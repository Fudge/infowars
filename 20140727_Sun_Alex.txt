[00:00.000 --> 00:23.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance,
[00:23.240 --> 00:32.720]  Alex Jones. Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. I'll be your host today,
[00:32.720 --> 00:37.560]  and we have a lot to talk about. You know, we just had congressman sessions or other
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.560]  senator sessions, peace sessions, say that Obama is begging to be impeached because of what's
[00:43.560 --> 00:47.680]  going on at the border. Well, he's been begging to be impeached over many different issues.
[00:47.680 --> 00:56.280]  We now have a faux congressman, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting member of the Congress
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.400]  from the District of Columbia, where they don't have congresspeople. She's saying that we don't
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.960]  have a right to know what's going on because in our form of government, that doesn't happen.
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.760]  Well, maybe that's the way it's going to be in our new form of government. So we've got the
[01:11.760 --> 01:17.080]  Obama administration signaling that they're going to take executive action on the border on
[01:17.080 --> 01:23.000]  immigration and actually came out and said, this is Dan Pfeiffer, who has been with the
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.480]  Obama White House since the very beginning. He said, the president acting on immigration form
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.760]  will certainly up the likelihood that the Republicans will contemplate impeachment at some
[01:32.760 --> 01:38.360]  point. Yeah, they're kind of laying that out there begging for that to happen yet. Is this,
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.360]  in this chess game, is this something that we should just wink an eye at and say, well,
[01:43.360 --> 01:46.800]  that's fine. We don't want to rock the boat before the elections, or do we stand on
[01:46.800 --> 01:53.560]  principle? Now, Sessions is saying he wants you to light up the phone lines at the Congress,
[01:53.560 --> 01:59.720]  at the Senate, at the congressional delegations for your congressman. He wants you to call them
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.440]  and melt it down. We want you to call in today and let us know what you think about that. What
[02:04.440 --> 02:08.680]  you think about is going on at the border. We're going to have some clips from our reporters
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.440]  down at the border. Joe Biggs is down there with cameraman. They're taking a look at the border.
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.440]  It's pretty amazing to see exactly what this fence looks like. Is that the way we stop this? Do
[02:20.440 --> 02:26.480]  we build a fence? Do we send the military? Do we increase border patrols there? Do we militarize
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.440]  the border patrol? What's the right way to tackle this? We want your opinions on this as well.
[02:32.440 --> 02:36.880]  I've got some ideas. We're going to talk about that as well. We're also going to talk about some
[02:36.880 --> 02:43.400]  major court victories for the Second Amendment, as well as an illustration of what happens
[02:43.400 --> 02:49.520]  in the same situation two years apart, two shootings, both in Pennsylvania, both in a
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.280]  psychiatric ward. A patient comes in and starts shooting people, but two very different results
[02:55.280 --> 03:01.400]  based on whether or not people have concealed carry or not. And it also raises a question as
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.320]  to what's going to happen to someone who defends himself and defends other people when it is
[03:07.320 --> 03:12.640]  prohibited to have concealed carry in that area. Now, we also have a court decision that's come
[03:12.640 --> 03:19.480]  down in Washington, DC, and that's a very important decision there. And it illustrates a lot there.
[03:19.480 --> 03:25.800]  The District of Columbia, just like Chicago, has done everything they can to prohibit the exercise
[03:25.800 --> 03:31.720]  of the Second Amendment. And we need to understand that if you're allowed to technically have guns,
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.640]  but you've got to keep them locked up at home all the time, that is what is an infringement by
[03:37.640 --> 03:42.160]  definition in the Second Amendment. If you are not allowed to use your guns, that is an
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.440]  infringement. And of course, it's not just an outright ban on taking them out of your home.
[03:46.440 --> 03:51.280]  There's a lot of different ways that the Second Amendment, that your fundamental right that
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.960]  transcends our governments, that transcends the Constitution, that our governments and our
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.840]  Constitution were created to protect those rights that we have from God, our right of
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.880]  self-defense, whether that is from criminals breaking into our home or from a criminal
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.480]  government. Those rights come from God and they were recognized in the Second Amendment,
[04:10.480 --> 04:17.160]  not created by the Second Amendment. And when the government infringes those, we need to do
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.960]  something about that. Now, we've got a judge that agreed with that today in a DC case. It's
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.360]  Palmer v. District of Columbia. Remember, it was back in 2008 that it was Heller v. DC where
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.720]  they essentially said that you could own guns. They had outright prohibited guns up to that point.
[04:32.720 --> 04:37.560]  And they finally said, no, you can own guns. But then they so restricted it that you didn't
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.960]  effectively have any rights at all. Well, this is a five-year battle that is just concluded with
[04:42.960 --> 04:48.880]  a federal judge saying, yes, you can carry guns in the District of Columbia. Now we'll see how
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.000]  else they infringe it. Stay with us. We'll be right back. We'll take your calls at 877-789-2539.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.600]  That's 877-789-2539. I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Supermale vitality was

[06:01.920 --> 06:09.120]  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security begins with hometown security.
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.680]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets,
[06:17.680 --> 06:24.560]  which may make scoring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap
[06:24.560 --> 06:31.840]  those revisions. Women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets,
[06:31.840 --> 06:42.240]  but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points. The big score,
[06:42.240 --> 06:56.320]  anyone, any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100 points. As always, how fast you move determines
[06:56.320 --> 07:07.840]  how long you live. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[07:07.840 --> 07:16.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host for today on this Sunday,
[07:16.480 --> 07:23.920]  July 27th, 2014. As I was just saying in the last segment, things are beginning to come to a head
[07:23.920 --> 07:28.480]  on a lot of different fronts. Of course, the crisis that is happening at the border,
[07:29.280 --> 07:34.640]  now they're sending signals that they're going to use executive orders. What a surprise.
[07:34.640 --> 07:40.160]  That's something we have seen over and over again from Obama. Clearly does not have any respect
[07:40.160 --> 07:46.160]  whatsoever for the Congress for a division of power for the rule of law. He rules by fiat.
[07:46.800 --> 07:52.480]  And we've got Congressman Stockman who is telling who went down to the border with WorldNet Daily,
[07:53.200 --> 07:59.360]  and they got the same receipt down there that we got when we went down with our crew. Basically,
[07:59.360 --> 08:05.200]  they went to a facility, wanted to take pictures of it. People came out and started questioning them,
[08:05.760 --> 08:10.480]  wouldn't let them in. And then when they drove around the Rio Grande Valley taking a look at
[08:10.480 --> 08:14.160]  what was happening late at night, because that's when the action really happens,
[08:14.160 --> 08:18.480]  they were being followed by the Border Patrol. So the Border Patrol focuses on reporters,
[08:18.480 --> 08:23.760]  they focus on congressmen, but they don't focus on are the people coming across the border.
[08:23.760 --> 08:30.160]  And as our reporter Joe Biggs is now down at the border with evidence of how these fences and the
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.080]  areas where they do have fences, how these fences are being cut open. I don't think that's happening
[08:36.080 --> 08:41.200]  with little children who are coming across the border. There's a whole different dynamic here
[08:41.200 --> 08:46.240]  than is being portrayed in the media, being portrayed by the White House. It is not simply
[08:46.240 --> 08:52.000]  a humanitarian crisis of a lot of little children who are marching across Central and South America
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.600]  to come to our borders. But now the Obama administration is signaling that they're going
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.920]  to use executive orders, that they're going to do it before the midterm elections in November.
[09:02.560 --> 09:06.320]  At the same time, we've got Pete Sessions, a senator from Alabama, saying,
[09:06.880 --> 09:13.600]  Obama is begging to be impeached, and rather that's the Stockman who's saying that. Sessions is
[09:13.600 --> 09:19.360]  saying, we need to do something about this, or they're going to give amnesty to three, four,
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.840]  five million people. And of course, he's quoting another congressman, Luis Gutierrez,
[09:23.840 --> 09:28.560]  who says exactly the same thing, that he wants to see that happen with executive order.
[09:29.680 --> 09:36.320]  Meanwhile, on the transparency issue, we've got Eleanor Hormes Norton saying that we don't really
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.360]  need to know what's going on, what's going to be coming down the pike. This is what she had to say,
[09:41.360 --> 09:46.880]  an amazing statement this last, I think it was just yesterday she said this, but she was saying
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.640]  that you don't need to know what's going on in your government. You don't have a right to know
[09:53.520 --> 09:59.840]  everything in a separation of powers government, my friend. That is the difference between a
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.120]  parliamentary government and a separation of powers government. Really? That's the difference
[10:05.120 --> 10:09.680]  between parliamentary government and a separation of powers government. I guess you could tell,
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.880]  I see people in the UK, if they feel like they've got that kind of transparency, I think they've
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.560]  got the same kind of surveillance problems, the same kind of closed government that we have.
[10:20.560 --> 10:25.520]  We see that happening in all the Western democracies now saying that you don't have a right to know
[10:25.520 --> 10:30.160]  what's going on. Now, this is not something that began with the Obama administration. Of course,
[10:30.160 --> 10:37.360]  this really started doubling down during the Bush administration and the aftermath of 9-11.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.800]  And when Obama ran, he said he was going to do something different. He didn't say that this
[10:42.800 --> 10:50.160]  was our form of government, just as she just said. He said this. When there's a bill that ends up on
[10:50.160 --> 10:56.080]  my desk as president, you the public will have five days to look online and find out what's in it
[10:56.080 --> 11:02.240]  before I sign it. That didn't happen, did it? So that you know what your government's doing.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.240]  When there are meetings between lobbyists and a government agency, we'll put as many of those
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.880]  meetings as possible online for every American to watch. When there's a tax bill being debated
[11:16.880 --> 11:22.000]  in Congress, you will know the names of the corporations that would benefit and how much
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.440]  money they would get. And we will put every corporate tax break and every pork mill project
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.960]  online for every American to see. You will know who asked for it. Hold it right there, okay?
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.680]  Now, we've got an article up on infowars.com today. The U.S. wants to criminalize movie
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.760]  and music streaming. Now, this is just another reincarnation of SOPA, PIPPA, ACTA, SISPA. We
[11:43.760 --> 11:50.320]  see this coming again and again and again. But when he says you're going to know all the legislation
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.160]  in advance, you're going to be able to see who's benefiting from this and who isn't.
[11:55.040 --> 12:00.480]  What about the Trans-Pacific Partnership that has been negotiated throughout his administration,
[12:00.480 --> 12:07.200]  started in his administration, the negotiations? That's being done in secret by corporate lobbyists.
[12:07.760 --> 12:16.000]  And they are going to incorporate the aspects of SOPA, PIPPA, SISPA, all these failed measures to try
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.880]  to enact surveillance and web control via copyright administration. See, that's the beard on it. And
[12:22.880 --> 12:28.560]  actually, there will be some usefulness to the movie and music businesses. They're driving this,
[12:28.560 --> 12:33.280]  but it's going to be used for a lot more than that. If you give them the power, you will not
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.000]  have your day in court. You will just have your website taken down or you'll be banned from the
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.240]  Internet merely by accusation. They're not going to give you due process. They're not actually
[12:42.240 --> 12:47.840]  going to give you a day in court. They're just going to be able to immediately shut down a website
[12:47.840 --> 12:55.520]  based on accusation. And this is what's being negotiated in secret by the TPP. Now, Obama has
[12:55.520 --> 13:01.680]  sent his trade representative down there with fast-track capability, and we are not allowed to
[13:01.680 --> 13:07.200]  know what's happening there. Not even senators and congressmen are allowed to know what's going
[13:07.200 --> 13:14.800]  on in these bills. It's kept totally secret from everyone. There is no transparency whatsoever.
[13:15.600 --> 13:19.280]  Now, as we look at this, and I want to get your take on this because we said that
[13:19.280 --> 13:25.520]  that senator Sessions wants people to call in and melt down the phone lines of the
[13:26.080 --> 13:31.120]  House and the Senate. We want you to let us know what you think about impeachment.
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.520]  Tell us what you think about what's going on at the border. What's really behind this?
[13:35.520 --> 13:40.960]  How do we control this? I want to go down. I want to show you what's happening at the border.
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.400]  And I want to get your take on this. Is it something that we can address simply by force?
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.320]  Or is there another way that we address this? What is driving this? What is
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.480]  pushing people from that area? What is pulling them in? What is attracting them?
[13:54.480 --> 14:02.800]  The number, if you want to call in, is 877-789-2539. That's 877-789-2539. Or that's
[14:03.680 --> 14:10.080]  Alex. 789-Alex. 877-789-Alex, if you want to remember that way, if you're driving in your car.
[14:10.880 --> 14:15.040]  Now, there was an article that was up on the Drug Report yesterday from Paul Joseph Watson.
[14:15.040 --> 14:21.200]  DARPA wants new technology to predict societal unrest. And as we look at what's happening
[14:22.400 --> 14:28.000]  at the border, as we look at what's happening with our economy, as we look at the implications of
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.320]  this massive immigration, this massive amnesty, and also what's going on with the drug war and
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.240]  the international drug gangs that are coming across, I have to ask if this is about predicting
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.760]  societal unrest that DARPA wants to do, or is it creating it? Certainly they want to know how
[14:45.760 --> 14:50.560]  you're going to react. And there's been a lot of research projects along that line. As Paul Joseph
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.400]  Watson points out, it's now DARPA. Those are the people who are always doing the really dark
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.680]  research. They're soliciting companies to provide new technology that would allow the
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.320]  Department of Defense to predict future societal unrest by keeping track of, quote,
[15:06.320 --> 15:12.240]  all human activities that can be measured. Now, they point out, and this is a solicitation on
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.800]  FedBizOps, they point out that this is going to be game changing technologies. It will provide
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.160]  information advantage to the U.S. and its allies in powerful ways they will gain insight into the
[15:24.160 --> 15:32.160]  world that will have mercantile and military implications. Now, when they say mercantile,
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.960]  they're talking about helping their favored corporations as well. And it's that kind of
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.320]  corporate espionage that this is being used for as well as the dragnet surveillance of its citizens
[15:42.320 --> 15:48.560]  that is causing so much protest, not only in America, but especially in Europe. That's why many
[15:48.560 --> 15:54.160]  European countries and governments are now moving away from American computer businesses and
[15:54.160 --> 15:57.680]  software companies. We're going to be right back with more on the border. We're going to take your
[15:57.680 --> 16:03.280]  calls. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[16:03.280 --> 16:09.440]  get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[16:09.440 --> 16:15.760]  world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered
[16:15.760 --> 16:21.840]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.160]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is
[16:26.160 --> 16:32.000]  powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.640]  personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure
[16:38.640 --> 16:44.160]  crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating. And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.640]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.320]  unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com. I can taste dirt in it.
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.120]  God knows what's in there. These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from
[17:05.120 --> 17:11.440]  the faucet. Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Pro Pure G2.0 filtration
[17:11.440 --> 17:15.840]  system. That one is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep. I know what good water tastes like. It's
[17:15.840 --> 17:21.440]  good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate,
[17:21.440 --> 17:25.440]  and many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of

[20:21.440 --> 20:31.520]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this
[20:31.520 --> 20:38.000]  Sunday, July 27th, 2014. Now we've been talking about what's going on at the border. Of course,
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.120]  there's so many crises to choose from in the Obama administration. So many different things
[20:43.120 --> 20:49.520]  that he could be impeached for. Certainly going after entire political movements using the IRS
[20:49.520 --> 20:54.400]  to go after them and then covering it up. See, that's the key thing. It was the cover up that
[20:54.400 --> 20:59.280]  took down Nixon. And that's the cover up that should take down Obama. But of course, then there's
[20:59.280 --> 21:05.360]  the executive orders to just give amnesty to millions of people. That's what they're talking
[21:05.360 --> 21:12.240]  about right now. So the question is, is this just gross incompetence or is this a planned
[21:12.240 --> 21:20.080]  take down of America? Now, in 2009, there was a New York Times op-ed piece where they basically said,
[21:20.080 --> 21:25.280]  is Obama a chess master? And they made the case that yes, they thought he was. Now just today,
[21:25.840 --> 21:33.120]  a real chess master, Gary Kasparov tweeted out, allow me to disagree. Now, I think he was talking
[21:33.120 --> 21:40.800]  about Obama's foreign policy in Ukraine and Russia. But the reality of it is, is that I think there is
[21:40.800 --> 21:45.520]  evidence to show that this is something at least if Obama is not orchestrating it. It's certainly
[21:45.520 --> 21:50.080]  the powers that put him in office. Think about what's happening here. Think about just with the
[21:50.080 --> 21:56.080]  border, the many different facets of this. It really is a master stroke of tyranny. They want to
[21:56.080 --> 22:03.120]  implode the country economically by exponential expansion of the entitlements. This is a Cloward
[22:03.120 --> 22:07.680]  and Piven strategy that we've talked about many times. The fact that you put all these entitlements
[22:07.680 --> 22:13.760]  out there, and of course, we've just had the largest increase in entitlements in my lifetime,
[22:13.760 --> 22:19.360]  and that was Obamacare. As they put Obamacare out there, and then they bring in millions of people
[22:19.360 --> 22:24.240]  as well as the other entitlement programs, that's an effort to overload the system. And of course,
[22:24.880 --> 22:30.240]  even if we just paid for the education of the children that are coming in, that would basically
[22:30.240 --> 22:36.240]  take most jurisdictions underwater. But it's not just imploding the country economically.
[22:36.240 --> 22:42.160]  He's also going to explode the country with violence because it's not children merely that
[22:42.160 --> 22:48.560]  are coming across. And many of the children who are coming across are gang members, 15, 16, 17 years
[22:48.560 --> 22:54.560]  old, still minors. But as we've seen and talked about here on the radio program here in the Alex
[22:54.560 --> 23:01.120]  Jones show many times, we've got babies, we've got MS-13 gang members who are minors involved in
[23:01.120 --> 23:06.640]  kidnapping, involved in murder and torture, mutilation, making videos of it, even after
[23:06.640 --> 23:12.000]  they get the ransom, still killing the victims and taking video of it and putting it out there.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  So that is not really the kind of image that they're putting out there in mainstream media,
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  saying this is just children that are making this long trek across. Certainly those gang members
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  can make the trek across, and we know that is happening. And so we've got a war on drugs that
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.600]  is escalating violence here in the United States that has essentially decimated those countries
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.440]  along with the economic policies, the rent-seeking policies of the IMF going all the way back to
[23:39.440 --> 23:45.280]  Robert McNamara for decades. They've been putting these countries into debt to the banks to pay for
[23:45.280 --> 23:49.840]  increased welfare states. They weren't building infrastructure in those countries. They were
[23:49.840 --> 23:53.680]  getting them to go into debt to pay for a welfare state. And as everybody said, you're
[23:53.680 --> 23:58.400]  getting into a rent-seeking status. In other words, you don't want anybody to own anything.
[23:58.400 --> 24:03.120]  You want everybody to rent everything from you. And that is what the big banks and the
[24:03.120 --> 24:07.920]  multinational corporations want to do. They want to stop all private ownership of everything.
[24:07.920 --> 24:12.400]  So we have communism on the bottom, but it's essentially an economic fascism on top.
[24:13.040 --> 24:16.880]  Think about what else he's doing. He's not just imploding the country economically,
[24:16.880 --> 24:20.880]  getting ready to explode it with violence as we bring in more of these international gang
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.600]  members who will then go into competition with the gangs that are already in our countries,
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.000]  already creating a lot of violence, prohibition style in our countries. He's also going to
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.880]  divide the country demographically. He wants to control a large new voting block of voters.
[24:36.880 --> 24:42.480]  He's going to do it with amnesty. And they want to make sure that nobody IDs anyone at the voting
[24:42.480 --> 24:48.080]  polls because, of course, that would be racist. Now, you can't cash a cheque. You can't get a drink
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.440]  in most bars. You can't drive a car. You can't do so many things without having an ID. We're
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.000]  constantly getting stopped as if we were in Nazi Germany, demanding IDs from us by the police,
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.240]  even when we're not trying to engage in something. But when we try to engage in something for which
[25:02.240 --> 25:08.320]  we should have some control and know if these people are legitimate voters, that's racist.
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.520]  That's racist to require ID from everybody. So they're trying to divide the country demographically.
[25:13.520 --> 25:19.040]  And he's trying to erase the rule of law with executive orders.
[25:19.600 --> 25:26.000]  Now, I want you to hear what Barack Obama said back in 2007 and 2008. Here's a few clips.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.320]  There's been a tendency on the part of this administration to try to hide behind executive
[25:32.320 --> 25:38.640]  privilege every time there's something a little shaky that's taking place. And I think, you know,
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.080]  the administration would be best served by coming clean on this.
[25:42.080 --> 25:47.520]  It's not actually true that the Patriot Act was the worst. Most of the problems that we have had
[25:47.520 --> 25:51.440]  in civil liberties were not done through the Patriot Act. They were done through executive order
[25:51.440 --> 25:58.560]  by George W. Bush. And I think one of the biggest problems of the last eight years has been the
[25:58.560 --> 26:09.520]  degree to which President Bush has taken almost the opposite tack, that secrecy and concentrations
[26:09.520 --> 26:13.840]  of power in the Oval Office. I taught the Constitution for 10 years. I believe in the
[26:13.840 --> 26:18.240]  Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We're not going to use
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.440]  signing statements as a way of doing it. He knows what the Constitution is. He certainly
[26:23.440 --> 26:28.240]  knows what it is. It isn't that he doesn't know. It isn't that he's incompetent. He's thumbing his
[26:28.240 --> 26:34.960]  nose at the Constitution. He, more than anyone else, has bragged about how he's going to use
[26:34.960 --> 26:38.720]  executive orders because he just doesn't want to wait for Congress. He could care less what
[26:38.720 --> 26:43.280]  Congress does and Congress sheepishly takes a back seat to him and doesn't do anything.
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.960]  And so the question is, should they impeach them? That's what we want to talk to you about. But I
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.800]  want to play you now this clip that just came out from Louise Gutierrez. This is the same guy who
[26:52.800 --> 26:58.720]  just a few days ago was recorded talking to LaRosa and said we're going to get amnesty so we can
[26:58.720 --> 27:04.240]  punish these Americans who don't want to allow illegal immigration. Here's what he had to say.
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.640]  I'm going over to the White House. I'll be meeting with Jay Johnson and the Chief Legal
[27:08.640 --> 27:13.840]  Counsel to the President of the United States. We're going to sit down and we're going to negotiate
[27:14.640 --> 27:21.360]  additional terms and avenues the President can use in prosecutorial discretion. And I think we
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.320]  can get three or four, maybe even five million people. Okay, so we're constantly hearing that we
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.920]  need to have immigration reform. But the Republican line is, of course, we need to secure the border
[27:31.920 --> 27:36.480]  before we have immigration reform. And then presumably we can just grant amnesty to everyone and
[27:36.480 --> 27:42.160]  put them right on the welfare rolls. Well, how is that border working out? Well, we sent our
[27:42.160 --> 27:47.200]  Info Wars crew team down there to take a look at it. We've got Joe Biggs down there. He's been flying
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.880]  over the border, taking aerial shots of it as well as going up and down the border. And there's
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.000]  some pretty amazing stuff. I want to play you a couple of short clips here. We've got three
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.440]  short clips I'd like to play of Joe down there looking at various aspects of really what does
[28:03.440 --> 28:09.680]  this border fence look like? Here's the first clip. We are now 100 yards up the fence from where we
[28:09.680 --> 28:15.440]  were just at a second ago where you saw the wide parts open. Now look, this is an area that has
[28:15.440 --> 28:23.280]  been cut down by the cartels. It was just repaired on 314-14 and it was cut open by the cartels on
[28:23.280 --> 28:28.640]  10-29-13. Now let me show you what happens. Write that down on the grid right there. What they do is
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.960]  there's a squuggly route right back here. A truck can get through. So we're going to be right back.
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.520]  I want to play these two clips and after that I want to go to your calls and get your comments on
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.560]  what we should do about that. He's showing basically a wire grid that they're cutting through with
[28:42.560 --> 28:46.400]  the settling torches and then they come back and record when they repaired it when it was cut.
[28:46.400 --> 28:56.400]  Stay with us. We'll be right back with your calls.

[30:03.760 --> 30:08.640]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[30:08.640 --> 30:13.040]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than
[30:13.040 --> 30:18.240]  even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[30:18.240 --> 30:23.520]  within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand
[30:23.520 --> 30:27.760]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that
[30:27.760 --> 30:32.000]  six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.360]  these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[30:37.360 --> 30:42.160]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic
[30:42.160 --> 30:48.000]  and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA. The new InfoWarsLife lung cleanse is here
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[30:59.200 --> 31:04.320]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water. I didn't taste dirt in it.
[31:04.320 --> 31:09.120]  God knows what's in this. These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from
[31:09.120 --> 31:15.280]  the faucet. Next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Cropure G2.0 filtration
[31:15.280 --> 31:19.680]  system. Now one is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep I know what good water tastes like. It's
[31:19.680 --> 31:25.680]  good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, fluorine, glyphosate and many
[31:25.680 --> 31:30.240]  others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues
[31:30.240 --> 31:34.720]  including tooth decay, lowered IQ and even cancer. It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake
[31:34.720 --> 31:41.200]  when you're in the top water. The Propure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances
[31:41.200 --> 31:46.320]  leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water. I think this is very tasty. It's good water.
[31:46.320 --> 31:52.800]  Refreshing. It's good. Go to infowarsstore.com today. Use promo code water and save 10% off your

[32:57.840 --> 33:15.520]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:15.520 --> 33:27.040]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[33:33.040 --> 33:36.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're getting ready to take your calls
[33:36.640 --> 33:40.880]  here. We were just playing some clips from the border. We have an Infowars crew that's down there
[33:40.880 --> 33:46.160]  right now. Joe Biggs has been filing reports walking up and down the border, flying over it,
[33:46.160 --> 33:51.200]  showing you exactly what the border looks like in Arizona, exactly how they're coming through.
[33:51.200 --> 33:57.440]  And of course, it ranges from being very easy to get through to areas where you've got drug cartels,
[33:57.440 --> 34:02.400]  essentially using a subtle in torches to cut through. So it's all over the place.
[34:02.400 --> 34:07.680]  I want to get your take on what we do to control the collapsing border situation,
[34:07.680 --> 34:13.520]  to control the economy that is going to be collapsing once we bring all these people in,
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.840]  give them amnesty, as Louise Guterres has said. Obama is going to use executive orders to grant
[34:19.840 --> 34:26.960]  amnesty to three, four or five million people according to him. Now we also have Steve Stockman
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.120]  who went to the border and said Obama is begging to be impeached. Now he went down with a
[34:31.840 --> 34:36.480]  world net daily crew to the Rio Grande Valley on Friday night and they did essentially the same
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.680]  thing. They've tried to talk to border control agents there who refused to talk to them and
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.920]  then started trailing them just like they did our crew when we went down there. Stockman said,
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.920]  Obama wants us to impeach him now before the midterm election because his senior advisors believe
[34:51.920 --> 34:57.120]  that's the only chance the Democratic Party has to avoid a major electoral defeat.
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.880]  Evidently, Obama believes impeachment could motivate the Democrat Party to come out and vote.
[35:02.880 --> 35:08.480]  Now we see the similar thing coming from someone who's been with the Obama administration since
[35:08.480 --> 35:14.240]  the very beginning, that is, uh, Den Pfeiffer. And he said the president acting on immigration
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.800]  reform will certainly up the likelihood that Republicans would contemplate impeachment at
[35:18.800 --> 35:25.280]  some point because he's talking about how they're going to float some reforms as they call it,
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.840]  some executive orders before the November midterm elections. As a matter of fact,
[35:29.840 --> 35:35.280]  in Time Magazine they bragged about it. They said Obama is eyeing major immigration moves.
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.480]  They said activists met privately with the president and his aides back in June 30th
[35:40.480 --> 35:46.320]  and Obama suggested even back then that he will act before the November midterm elections.
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.120]  And of course we have Senator Pete Sessions saying that we need to melt Congress's
[35:51.120 --> 35:58.320]  phone lines to stop Obama's planned executive action. And again, he's saying that he's concerned
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.640]  that he's going to grant amnesty to three to five million people just as Gutierrez has said.
[36:02.640 --> 36:08.480]  He says it would be wrong for any member of the House or Senate to support any border crisis bill
[36:08.480 --> 36:15.520]  that doesn't end DACA. That's the DREAM Act, essentially the amnesty for the younger children.
[36:15.520 --> 36:20.560]  That's what's drawing them in, I believe. And so the question is, should they stand on principle?
[36:20.560 --> 36:27.280]  They're going to lose if they try to impeach him before the elections. Or should they just
[36:27.280 --> 36:33.200]  give him a pass in kind of a cynical political move? Now before I take your calls, I want to go
[36:33.200 --> 36:38.080]  back and play the rest of this video that we had. It's fairly short. I got two more short videos
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.200]  of Joe Beggs down at the border. Now what we had just played, he was walking along showing
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.280]  some steel girders that were up vertically. I'll describe this because this is predominantly a
[36:47.280 --> 36:52.720]  radio show. People can watch this video feed on our website. But if you're listening on the radio,
[36:52.720 --> 36:58.160]  what they had were girders, steel girders going up, and then steel cross hatching between that
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.480]  that they said that he said they just cut through within a settling torch. And the board patrol
[37:02.480 --> 37:07.920]  goes along and writes on the girders when it was cut and when they repaired it. Now here's what else
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.200]  he had to say. What they do is there's a smuggling route right back here. A truck can get through.
[37:13.200 --> 37:20.240]  They drive up here and they bring a settling gas torches up here. They cut through this huge
[37:20.240 --> 37:24.000]  fence right here, make it big enough for the truck to get through. They cut through these
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.800]  I beams of the torch and then take that down. And then what they have is a complete open route
[37:28.800 --> 37:35.440]  into our country to smuggle drugs. This is not by accident. This is designed by the Obama
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.960]  administration and not only just them, our entire government as a whole has a hand in this,
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.320]  the fast and furious. All these things are happening. We make money getting their drugs.
[37:46.320 --> 37:50.880]  We sell them weapons. This is a huge issue that needs to be looked at. It's not just the illegals
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.600]  coming through. It's the drugs flooding our borders to help dumb our people down, essentially. I
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.800]  mean, this is a mind blowing thing that's happening out here. And we just need more people in America
[38:00.800 --> 38:08.240]  to care about this and watch what's going on and do something about it. We're told that they have
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.960]  the border under control, that they have a fence, that we don't need to worry about that. Of course,
[38:12.960 --> 38:18.320]  the GOP says we can have immigration reform as long as we've got the border controlled,
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.560]  but I want you to take a look at some of you guys got the next clip queued up yet. Okay,
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.480]  let's go with that. Let's go. This is a border fence as a multi-billion dollar facade. Here's
[38:28.480 --> 38:35.840]  Joe Biggs again. I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com in Cochise County, Arizona with Glenn Spencer.
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.800]  Now, we are right on the border. As you can see from what Glenn told me a second ago,
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.720]  they spend about $3 million every mile or so to build this fence, and yet they have left this
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.400]  completely wide open. Now, tell me why this happens. Well, we're known for monsoons between
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.720]  really July, August, September. We have heavy rain. Pause out there for a second. I want to
[38:56.720 --> 39:01.280]  describe this while for the people who are listening on the radio. So what you see there is a fence
[39:01.280 --> 39:07.520]  that costs $3 million per mile to build, a very heavy metal fence. And what they've done is just
[39:07.520 --> 39:14.400]  lifted it straight up, and all the remains on the bottom part is about three strands of barbed wire
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.280]  that are running across there, kind of like a cattle fence, let's say. Go ahead, continue.
[39:19.840 --> 39:26.240]  What they've done here, because this is a wash, this is a low spot, what they've done is they've
[39:26.240 --> 39:31.440]  cut the holes in the fence and put in these gates and raised them up so the water can come through.
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.000]  Now, these are up, I don't know, usually two or three months out of the year.
[39:36.000 --> 39:43.600]  As you can see, you could just walk right through. $3 million was spent on this section,
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.160]  and it is completely left wide open. I mean, right here they have a lock, and you can tell
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.680]  that someone goes through the trouble to bring a crane out here, not a crane but a forklift,
[39:51.680 --> 39:56.560]  lift these up and lock these completely in, and it's as easy as walking in.
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.200]  That's right. Yeah, they don't even have to pause it there. They don't even have to,
[40:01.200 --> 40:05.520]  they show the footprints on the other side. They don't even have to cut the barbed wire,
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.120]  because this is kind of spacing between it that you could just kind of duck through that thing
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.320]  and just walk right through. Let's go to Randy in Texas. Randy, what do you think about this?
[40:14.320 --> 40:17.280]  What do you think about impeachment? What do you think about the border situation?
[40:18.480 --> 40:25.040]  Yeah, I think that if Obama wants to be impeached, because if we start impeaching against him,
[40:25.840 --> 40:30.720]  then that's going to energize the Democratic base to come out and break the midterm elections.
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.480]  That's right. But what do we do? Do we just give him a pass on all these different
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.520]  things that he's done? I mean, there's got to be something there that we could get bipartisan
[40:41.520 --> 40:47.840]  support on where he has transgressed the rule of law, transgressed the Constitution. I mean,
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.560]  couldn't we impeach him on the civil liberties issue, for example, on the NDAA? There are a lot
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.400]  of people in the Democrat Party that understand how bad that is. And if you remember at the
[40:56.400 --> 41:01.120]  beginning of the program, when I was playing those quotes from Obama back in 2007, 2008,
[41:01.120 --> 41:06.640]  he said, he was talking about how bad the Patriot Act was. Well, it is bad. He's put it on steroids,
[41:06.640 --> 41:10.720]  and he pointed out that the worst stuff that was in there were executive orders. Well, he's done
[41:10.720 --> 41:17.760]  the same sort of things. He's done drone killings. He's killed an American citizen and that American
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.040]  citizen's son who wasn't even accused of anything with targeted drone assassinations. Isn't that
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.480]  something that we could impeach him for and get support from the left as well as from the right?
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.240]  Yes, we'd have to be careful a lot, we would impeach him, though, because automatically,
[41:32.240 --> 41:39.120]  the propaganda wing of the White House, MSNBC, would say that, oh, the only reason that they're
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.840]  wanting to impeach him is because they're a bunch of racist Tea Party people.
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.240]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we have to pick which things we do very carefully, because if we pick
[41:50.240 --> 41:57.280]  something that is a standard Republican issue, then they're just going to dismiss it as partisan
[41:57.280 --> 42:03.040]  politics. The problem is, is that what should be bipartisan issues, the things like the targeted
[42:03.040 --> 42:10.080]  drone assassinations, the things like the NSA, dragnet spying, those things are things that the
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.240]  Republicans want to do. They would love to do that. They don't care about civil liberties,
[42:14.240 --> 42:21.440]  so it's very hard to build a bipartisan coalition to stop criminal executive actions, isn't it?
[42:22.640 --> 42:28.480]  Yeah, I'm afraid that if we do try to go ahead and impeach him, it's just going to play into his hands.
[42:29.520 --> 42:37.280]  I think that the best thing to do is to go ahead and try to impeach him on any executive action
[42:37.280 --> 42:44.960]  he takes on immigration and just keep founding home the point that... Well, that's still going to be
[42:44.960 --> 42:48.720]  a partisan issue. That's going to be easy for them to spend. Hang on. Thank you, Randy. In Texas,
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.200]  we'll be right back. We're going to go to Joe in Arkansas. We'll be taking your calls on whether or
[42:53.200 --> 43:08.880]  not Obama should be impeached. And for what should he be impeached, we'll be right back.

[43:56.880 --> 44:03.040]  dead aunts. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[44:03.040 --> 44:09.360]  much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around
[44:09.360 --> 44:15.920]  the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered
[44:15.920 --> 44:21.920]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.240]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is
[44:26.240 --> 44:32.080]  powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I
[44:32.080 --> 44:38.720]  personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure

[45:15.040 --> 45:19.920]  water tastes like it's good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride,
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.960]  chlorine glyphosate and many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an
[45:24.960 --> 45:30.240]  assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer. It tastes like
[45:30.240 --> 45:35.680]  you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water. The pro pure G 2.0 filtration system

[47:31.200 --> 47:33.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:42.960 --> 47:49.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday july 27th 2014 i'm david night and we're taking
[47:49.280 --> 47:54.560]  your calls we're talking about impeachment and of course on friday we had an article on info
[47:54.560 --> 48:01.600]  wars dot com that one-third of americans would like to see obama impeached now it was 57 percent
[48:01.600 --> 48:08.000]  of republicans even 14 percent of democrats wanted to have impeached and of course 45 percent of
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.760]  people who wanted him impeached said that he sought to expand the presidency too much and of
[48:13.760 --> 48:17.600]  course that would be things like the executive order now there's talk that there's going to be
[48:17.600 --> 48:24.720]  an executive order before the election guitaris who was at la raza saying that we needed to grant
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.760]  amnesty to the illegals here so that we could punish the americans who want to throw them out
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.960]  he's saying that he thinks that obama could grant amnesty to anywhere between three four five million
[48:34.960 --> 48:42.080]  people to which senator pete sessions says we need to melt congress's phone lines to stop obama's
[48:42.080 --> 48:47.680]  planned executive amnesty and we also have steve stockman who is at the border with a film crew
[48:47.680 --> 48:53.440]  this weekend saying that obama is begging to be impeached so we want to ask you what should
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.320]  should he be impeached if so what should he be impeached for and of course we're focused right
[48:58.320 --> 49:04.160]  now too on the border situation because what's happening at the border is something where we've
[49:04.160 --> 49:10.720]  got the possibility of the economy being imploded by a rapid expansion of the welfare state we've
[49:10.720 --> 49:16.320]  got violence that can explode because they're bringing in or allowing in gang members many of
[49:16.320 --> 49:21.280]  them these children that were being told about minors but of course you know the dream act applies
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.440]  to anyone that is up to 31 years of age so that's pretty expansive in terms of children in terms of
[49:27.440 --> 49:32.560]  minors but of course it also has a potential to divide the country as louise guitaris would like
[49:32.560 --> 49:40.640]  to see to create these competing factions to create a new voting bloc just by by fiat by amnesty by
[49:40.640 --> 49:46.640]  executive order and of course these executive orders will erase the rule of law so i'm going to go to
[49:46.640 --> 49:52.240]  your comments and and i want to take your phone calls on this but before i do we need to take care
[49:52.240 --> 49:56.560]  of a little bit of business here you know one of the things that we have been able to do since i've
[49:56.560 --> 50:02.000]  been here i've seen the magazine come online top quality magazine that alex puts out there we've
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.440]  got a new studio where we're going into kind of be taking the nightly news into a broader audience
[50:07.440 --> 50:13.440]  when alex does stuff and when he reinvests the money that you send us when you buy our products
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.960]  when you support this organization when he does these things he does first quality stuff and he
[50:18.960 --> 50:25.680]  is reinvesting the money that we get from the products that we sell he also tries to put out
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.960]  the very best quality in terms of the products that he sells especially the health products because
[50:30.960 --> 50:36.720]  we understand how your health is being impacted by the additives that are put into the food
[50:36.720 --> 50:43.520]  into the food by the things gmo high fructose corn syrup the many additives that go in how do

[51:16.800 --> 51:28.080]  life.com 888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139 info wars life.com that's what keeps the organization
[51:28.080 --> 51:33.040]  going we don't get money from the government certainly and we don't have any corporate big
[51:33.040 --> 51:38.320]  daddies it's you supporting us you helping yourselves it's a win-win situation you've
[51:38.320 --> 51:42.400]  helped us to build this media organization i can tell you from the time that i've been here that
[51:42.400 --> 51:47.440]  alex is being a good steward with your money reinvesting it in things that are going to make
[51:47.440 --> 51:52.640]  a difference let's go to your calls right now let's take joe in arkansas joe what do you think
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.360]  about the border situation what do you think about impeachment yeah well impeachment is what i
[51:57.360 --> 52:03.920]  called about and i think that if the republicans help to have any chance of winning back the senate
[52:03.920 --> 52:08.800]  and the house this uh november election they better start making a real real real serious
[52:08.800 --> 52:13.440]  effort and impeachment right now because i think that's about the only thing that's going to give
[52:13.440 --> 52:19.760]  any good responsible patriotic american any motivation to vote for the republican and as
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.120]  for what they should impeach him for um i think some good congressman some good patriotic congressman
[52:25.120 --> 52:30.800]  ought to draw up a list of about half a dozen issues high crimes and misdemeanors which obama
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.920]  has committed you know along with good supporting factual evidence you know for each one and at
[52:35.920 --> 52:40.880]  least about half of them i think i think your idea of trying to impeach him for bipartisan issues is
[52:40.880 --> 52:47.280]  extremely good idea and then then this congressman should publish this list and ask people you know
[52:47.280 --> 52:52.000]  all over the country to call your congressman call your senators tell them that you want to obama
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.760]  impeach for these reasons you know try to list the support of the public you know melt down the
[52:55.760 --> 53:00.560]  phone lines of congress trying to get uh congressmen senators to support impeachment that's what i
[53:00.560 --> 53:04.080]  think they ought to do yes i agree absolutely i don't think that they're going to pay much
[53:04.080 --> 53:08.560]  attention to us if we call and melt down their phone lines and say we don't want executive orders
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.760]  i think that the gop needs to energize its base and of course they're out there saying oh we we
[53:13.760 --> 53:18.720]  don't want to do that because uh if we impeach obama it's going to energize the democrat base
[53:18.720 --> 53:25.280]  well as you pointed out very very smartly if they don't do this it's the gop base that's
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.720]  not going to be energized because we're going to look at this we're going to say these guys give him
[53:28.720 --> 53:33.920]  a pass no matter what he does no matter how many times he breaks the law i think that's very important
[53:33.920 --> 53:40.160]  thank you joe in arkansas let's go to marlene and michigan marlin i think it's marlin and michigan
[53:40.160 --> 53:46.160]  yeah sorry what's wrong oh yeah i just wanted to say um well as far as the impeachment thing goes
[53:46.160 --> 53:50.880]  i mean i definitely think that they should do it but the only issue with it is that if you're
[53:50.880 --> 53:57.280]  going to have a daryl isa and a and an elijah come and show then don't do it at all because i feel
[53:57.280 --> 54:02.800]  like you know the irs situation is is something they should have been buried with a long time ago
[54:02.800 --> 54:07.680]  yes but because of the way it's been handled i can honestly see an impeachment situation being
[54:07.680 --> 54:12.480]  something similar and it just be a fiasco that it doesn't basically go into the space everybody
[54:12.480 --> 54:16.800]  that want to happen and teach well marlin i think that's exactly why they need to do it is because
[54:16.800 --> 54:25.520]  we've seen them come up and just use this and kind of a limp-wristed way to essentially just score
[54:25.520 --> 54:30.480]  some political points and not really do anything about it we've seen what's happening with the irs
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.440]  and they and daryl isa keeps coming up and saying well you know we're really going to do something
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.200]  if you don't come forward with these records or we're going to we're very upset about how you've
[54:41.200 --> 54:45.360]  broken the law here or what you've done over here but they don't follow through and actually do
[54:45.360 --> 54:51.120]  anything and i think that is why it's imperative for the gop to show that it actually has a backbone
[54:51.120 --> 54:55.440]  that it'll actually stand up and do something otherwise why do we need to have a majority of
[54:55.440 --> 55:01.200]  gop there oh i i definitely agree with that i just want to add one more thing too is that
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.880]  i feel like with this whole amnesty thing i mean you know people would be talking about but they
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.720]  don't want to you know energize the democratic base they don't want to do this they won't do that
[55:08.720 --> 55:12.480]  but my thing is is there that the country is basically broken up into two sections i mean
[55:12.480 --> 55:16.400]  you're going to have people who want to vote democrat or republican but here's my only issue
[55:16.400 --> 55:20.720]  is that with him talking about the amnesty and they only talking about four or five million in my
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.360]  eyes i don't know about you guys but i'm seeing like more like 10 or 11 million people because they
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.360]  talk about the undocumented people but the people that's coming over and i'm adding up 11 12 million
[55:31.360 --> 55:36.320]  that is your vote right there it doesn't matter how much you you energize a democrat a democrat
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.160]  is going to vote democrat they're not going to vote republican you cannot do anything to change
[55:40.160 --> 55:44.240]  that opinion that's right come out they're going to vote that's right and when you look at when
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.960]  you look at how few people actually vote an election anyway now of course we're all assuming
[55:48.960 --> 55:53.600]  that these are legitimate elections that's another argument that we need to have it it's not just
[55:53.600 --> 55:59.920]  voter id i mean that's part of it but it's also maintaining custody of the votes make sure that
[55:59.920 --> 56:03.680]  they're going to be counted correctly that they're going to be reported correctly we've talked about
[56:03.680 --> 56:09.200]  this there's a whole chain of custody with the vote it starts with correct voter id but when
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.480]  you look at the number of people that presumably vote in these elections you're only looking at
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.640]  a few million people there's a very small percentage of the population that actually
[56:18.640 --> 56:24.720]  participates in the election so when you bring in a block of five ten million people maybe more we
[56:24.720 --> 56:30.320]  don't know what these numbers are that's going to radically alter everything and of course if we
[56:30.320 --> 56:35.280]  allow these people to come in and stay put them on the welfare role we don't do any voter id you
[56:35.280 --> 56:41.200]  don't have to have amnesty for them to be able to vote thank you let's go to uh margaret in
[56:41.200 --> 56:46.480]  north dakota you wanted to talk about immigration mainstream media is approach to that go ahead margaret
[56:49.440 --> 56:52.800]  well i think we're about out of time and i don't think she's still on the line
[56:53.760 --> 56:58.480]  we're going to rewrite back with your calls and of course the question is are we going to allow
[56:58.480 --> 57:04.640]  now the government to uh are we going to allow obama to just follow through with his executive
[57:04.640 --> 57:11.360]  orders have blanket amnesty or is the gop going to try to energize its base are we going to have
[57:11.360 --> 57:17.600]  an effective clash of ideas are we just going to set back and let obama do anything he wants
[57:17.600 --> 57:22.880]  i think even if you lose this fight it's a fight you need to have because you have to stand for
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.920]  principle you have to stand for the rule of law we're going to be taking your phone calls on this

[59:57.920 --> 01:00:07.520]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.640]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we're taking calls on
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:24.640]  what should be done about not only the border but about impeachment should we impeach obama
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.040]  he is declaring now that he's going to do some executive orders before the midterm elections
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.720]  they think that's going to help them as several callers have pointed out if we have a gop that
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:41.120]  doesn't have the backbone to do anything after scandal after scandal after scandal then maybe
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.520]  we're going to have the gop voters who aren't energized maybe they're not going to be energized
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:51.440]  if the gop sets back and does nothing no matter how outrageous no matter how unconstitutional no
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:58.160]  matter how tyrannical dictatorial his actions are and the question is when we look at the border
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.920]  what are we going to do about it we just had a report from joe begs who's now down at the
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:09.360]  arizona border and of course the border all across the southern border is wide open and has been for
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:14.560]  a very long time there's probably more fences up now than we've ever had before we have the federal
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.840]  government going down and building fences metal fences spending three million dollars per mile and
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.120]  then they go back and they put a gate in it and lift it up about five feet so people can just walk
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.000]  right through of course they put three strands of barbed wire across it that's not any obstacle for
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.880]  anyone that's what we have now and we have massive immigration that we've never had before even when
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:44.160]  we had fewer fences this is a manufactured crisis that's going on now this is not something that
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.560]  just happened by accident there's both a poll in terms of our policies that have been put in place
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:57.200]  by obama again by executive order our immigration policies our dream act all these different things
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.200]  have been put in saying that we're going to give an expanded entitlement state to anyone who comes
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.040]  in under the age of 31 they'll be able to get all kinds of benefits in terms of educational
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.320]  benefits that even our citizens don't enjoy we can't go to any state and get in state tuition
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.040]  and many of them of course are going to get free ride tuitions that's just part of it of course
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.360]  they're also going to be paid for in our taxes that we have for local school taxes this will
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.000]  implode the country so what do we do about it why is this happening now well it's because of our
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.040]  welfare policies but it's also there really is violence in those countries there really is economic
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.320]  hardship in those countries and that is being driven the violence and much of the economic hardship
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:47.360]  is being driven by american policies by imf policies by banker policies by our war on drugs
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.040]  and our prohibition policies that are down there now they do have out of control violence there
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.880]  because of the drug cartels and the gangs that is now moving north into our country and if you
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.080]  look at the number of people that have been killed in mexico it's an absolute slaughter far more
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.960]  have been killed in the war on drugs in mexico than in the afghanistan war do we want to bring
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:16.720]  that violence into america well obama is saying essentially yes so how do we respond to this do
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.800]  we militarize the border do we militarize the police do we make the same mistakes that we've
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:27.280]  made in light of 9 11 and the war on drugs i don't think so we need to step back and look
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.720]  at the policies that are causing the economic hardship there as well as here the policies
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.080]  that are causing violence there as well as here we need to stop those policies rather than double
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:45.760]  down and do another 9 11 do another patriot act that's what i'm concerned about seeing happen i
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.560]  don't want to see the border militarized i don't want to see us put into a giant fema cap fema
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.720]  camp that stretches around the entire perimeter of the southern border i don't want to see that
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:05.040]  happen i want to see the policies addressed i want to see drug wars drug prohibitions swat teams
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.160]  the militarization of the police i want to see that brought down i want to see some of the entitlement
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.600]  programs that we can no longer afford we have a 17 trillion dollar debt how are we going to pay for
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.720]  all of these new dependents well of course that's just one aspect of it just before the break we
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.600]  were getting ready to talk to margaret and north dakota i think margaret you were on hold but i
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:35.120]  couldn't hear us are you there now yes i am go ahead i did it um as far as the impeachment
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.520]  i first of all i don't think we'd have enough time right now anyway before the election um
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:49.760]  i think we we have to stop letting the powers that be well hang on because we're out of time not
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.000]  just before the election but before this break i'll hold you through the break we'll be right back
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  taking your calls on whether or not we should impeach obama and if so city of austin tap water

[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.520]  freedom for in its car to deceive and inflame or enlighten and inspire the motion picture
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:42.880]  as no equal welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday july 27th 2014
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:47.120]  we've been talking about whether or not obama should be impeached we've been talking about what
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:52.320]  should happen at the borders should we build more fences should we build different kinds of fences
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:57.680]  should we make them higher deeper should we spend billions and billions of dollars essentially
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:03.440]  creating a massive jail for ourselves or should we create a police state as we've made that mistake
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:09.040]  with the war on drugs should we destroy civil liberties even more than we have in the wake of
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.160]  9 11 should we militarize the police even more than we have in the wake of 9 11 should we send
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:20.720]  the military down there along these lines let's take a look at what just happened take a take a
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.240]  step back for a moment and take a look at what happened with the second amendment this weekend
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:30.800]  we just had a federal court case in dc this is palmer versus dc this is a court a case that's
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.800]  been winding through the courts for five years and finally the judge there has ruled in favor of
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:44.080]  the person who is suing to have his right to carry this is a an action the lead attorney is allen
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.480]  guru of the second amendment foundation congratulations to them thanks for fighting for that
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.760]  and this is what the court decision said from judge frederick skullan he said there is no longer
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:00.000]  any basis on which this court can conclude that the district of columbia's total ban on the public
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.640]  carrying of ready to use handguns outside of the home is constitutional under any level of scrutiny
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.600]  therefore the court finds that the district of columbia's complete ban on the carrying of handguns
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.920]  in the public is unconstitutional that was a 19 page ruling just came out and of course
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.200]  that follows on the heels of the supreme court slapping down the district of columbia back in
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:30.880]  2008 heller versus dc in that particular case that was a fellow who was a police officer or
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:36.240]  a security guard of some sort heller he was not allowed to have a weapon when he was off duty
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:43.360]  even they would not even allow a a police officer who worked for the city to have a weapon off duty
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.720]  so they were struck down that law was struck down by the supreme court saying no he can have a gun
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.640]  so they immediately said all right all right you can have a gun but you have to keep it locked
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:00.800]  up in your home you can't take it anywhere well that's infringement that's what is meant by the
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.640]  second amendment saying that the right to keep him bare arms shall not be infringed if you
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.360]  infringe it with all these different qualifications you don't allow people to actually carry the gun
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.080]  so they can actually have it with them if they need to defend themselves that's exactly what
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.880]  the second amendment was there to stop was government doing that yet we still see in this
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:26.000]  other article upon info wars dot com boston police say residents do not need to own shotguns and
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.200]  rifles this is the head of the boston police police commissioner william evans he says
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.200]  nobody in the city needs a shotgun nobody needs a rifle well i guess maybe that includes the police
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:46.000]  i don't know we know better than that we know that you do need to have weapons to defend yourself
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.280]  and of course they will try to infringe on that right any way that they can but i want to think
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.640]  about this want you to think about this case of two shootings essentially in the same area both of
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:02.480]  them up in pennsylvania both of them involving psychiatric patients going into a psychiatric
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:11.680]  ward or hospital and involved in shooting their two years apart now two years ago this was a gunman
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:21.120]  in western uh the western psychiatric institute and he went into this pennsylvania uh place and
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.600]  he fired several shots using two semi-automatic guns he killed one man who's 25 years old injured
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:34.080]  seven others before police eventually arrived and shot him and killed him now in the case that just
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:40.080]  happened in pennsylvania this is reported by abc news they say inside the furious close range
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.800]  gun battle at a pennsylvania hospital in this particular case you have another patient who
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.960]  comes in pulls out a gun out of his waistband and shoots a caseworker in the head without warning
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.960]  she's killed but then what happens is the doctor that he really wanted to kill that he had come to
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.520]  shoot there was a doctor silverman he according to this article dove to the floor pulled out a
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.120]  semi-automatic pistol out of his pocket and had a furious close range gun battle with this shooter
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:12.480]  who police said fired at least 10 rounds the doctor who was using a chair for protection aimed his
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.840]  gun at the shooter and fired until it was empty the doctor was grazed in the head wounded in the
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.040]  thumb while covering his face but he was able to get out of the office unaware that he had struck
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:29.280]  plots that is the shooter three times and then what happened was someone else bravely climbed
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.080]  through the window and wrestled him to the ground but he shot him three times he was still trying
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:41.040]  to reload but at that point i think he had been taken down a bit but that's the situation as it
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.000]  stands now of course there have been reports that there's going to be disciplinary action possibly
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.560]  taken against this doctor who defended himself and defended others by shooting this guy who came in
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:57.920]  and and shot the case worker in the head immediately the difference is as we've seen over and over
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.640]  again as the police chief in Detroit has pointed out over and over again when something like this
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:08.320]  happens you're on your own for a while the police can't be everywhere it takes them a while to get
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:15.360]  there and so you see in the first case seven people were shot in this case one person was shot
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.880]  besides the shooter that's the difference in having concealed carry that's a practical argument for
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:26.480]  of course there are many other arguments for what the second amendment is really about it's really
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.160]  about a deterrent on a tyrannical government but we have other deterrents and one of those is
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.320]  impeachment and we were just talking to Margaret and North Dakota you were weighing in Margaret
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.080]  as to whether or not you think that obama should be impeached or not and if so what do you think
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:46.800]  you should be impeached for go ahead well uh for right now i think we should hold off on that because
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:54.960]  we wouldn't be able to do it in time prior to the election anyway um and it looks like the
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.840]  republicans are going to take this on it and keep the house you also have a situation where
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:13.200]  in the primaries you have um more libertarian candidates coming in and all you need is maybe
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:27.280]  a handful more control of the um republicans along with um the citizens they know are more
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.280]  libertarian and we have to control the conversation i think that you know i don't know how long it
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.360]  takes to go through the impeachment thing it necessarily have to take longer than the election
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:44.240]  but i i agree with the earlier callers that if we don't energize the opposition base uh i don't
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.400]  know that the republicans are going to have that much of majority anyway and even if they do when
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  what difference does it make if they won't stand for principle thank you margaret let's go to uh
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:01.360]  chris in indiana chris go ahead hey david hey what's on your mind what do you think we should
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.240]  do about impeachment real yeah first on the impeachment thing i don't think it would do
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:12.000]  any good at all even if obama was impeached and kicked out office uh but you know vote because if
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  you're impeached doesn't matter i mean clinton was impeached and the senate was on his side so he
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.880]  just thrown out even if obama was thrown out by the senate he'd have jill biden as president
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.760]  i mean well what would that do if he won't you know what i think that it it actually did make
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.080]  a difference i think it it moved government back somewhat when nixon was impeached i think that
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.360]  that when clinton got away with it i think that kind of emboldened the lawlessness and you could
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.880]  argue i think maybe the best argument for not impeaching obama is is that if he gets away with
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:52.400]  it uh he's going to be even bolder but what do we do to stop him i mean he's gonna rule by executive
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.920]  order he's going to just grant amnesty to who knows how many millions of people he's going to put
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.520]  them on the welfare role he's going to put them on the voting rolls what do we do about that what
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.720]  do we do about the other scandals and the criminal breaking of the law with the other scandals
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.760]  no there's endless scandals and it's all all the scandals are just all round and out to get a
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:22.080]  big goal for the new world order but i wanted to get to the border also uh ron paul has said in
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.120]  many of the debates i was watching that stuff like i was obsessed with it when ron paul was
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.560]  in all these debates he he brought up in one of the debates because they were talking about the
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:39.440]  border uh he said repeatedly that we care more about the borders between afghanistan and pakistan
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:45.200]  than we do between the united states of mexico oh that's true thank you for calling and we're
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.440]  going to take more of your calls right after the break ron paul also said be careful when
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.000]  you build a fence because it can be used to keep you in as well as to keep other people out we'll
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:01.680]  be right back with more of your calls stay with us i began to get into iodine a few years ago

[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:39.920]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:44.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we're taking your calls on what's happening
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:50.560]  at the border are we going to have amnesty by fiat by executive order by obama should he be
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.440]  impeached is does he want to be impeached that's what steve stockman said when he went to the
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.160]  border he said obama is begging to be impeached and it certainly looks that way the obama
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:07.760]  administration has openly said that they plan to do executive orders on amnesty on blanket amnesty
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:14.080]  before the midterm november elections we've had congressman gutteris who was just speaking at
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.040]  la rosa said that we should have amnesty for the illegals who are here so that we could punish those
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.080]  who oppose illegal immigration he's saying that he thinks that we could get three to five million
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:30.720]  people given amnesty by executive order of course that number as callers have pointed out is probably
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:39.280]  much higher we don't have any real numbers to know who's going to be entitled to citizenship by fiat
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.160]  by the executive order because we haven't seen those uh we haven't seen that defined yet now of
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.680]  course we also have senator pete's sessions saying we need to melt congress's phone lines to stop
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.960]  obama's planned executive amnesty i guess the question is are we going to see the gop do anything
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.240]  or they're going to just grandstand like we've seen darrell issa do with the irs i mean that makes
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:08.240]  people very cynical about anything ever being done i mean if you can't send these people to
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.240]  jail if you can't impeach them when they do the same things that richard nixon was impeached for
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:21.120]  but far greater to a far greater extent to a far greater depth and with an attitude i you didn't
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.360]  even see the irs joining in and richard nixon's wanting to use the irs to go after his enemy's
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.560]  list the irs commissioner theoretically put that enemy's list in the safe and that was part of the
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.320]  exhibits and the impeachment of richard nixon today they go ahead and go after an entire
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.600]  political movement and then say they don't have their emails where they were talking about doing
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:49.840]  that they all just conveniently disappeared so we see this has gone far beyond whatever it was with
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.520]  richard nixon this is not a situation like it was with bill clinton where he was merely caught
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.400]  and i say merely it was enough to impeach bill clinton but he was caught with just one thing
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:06.880]  that came after him and that was lying under oath about an affair obama has many things that the
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.440]  obama administration has lied about many criminal activities cover-ups denying information to congress
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:19.360]  and this is just one of the things the border but it is a very large part of it but the other
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:26.640]  question is do we just allow the border to be opened we build a bigger fence a deeper fence
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.600]  a higher fence we've got joe bigs down at the border and he's been showing us pictures of what
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:37.440]  the fence actually looks like we've seen that a fence that they spend three million dollars per
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.680]  mile to build they also put in gates and they leave those gates wide open in case it rains you
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.840]  can see the footprints of the people walking underneath the gates that's what passes for
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.680]  border protection let's take a look at some more of joe bigs reports all right here we are about a
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.480]  mile up from where we just had a second ago now what you can see here is a main traffic route
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:05.120]  right through here for the smugglers what they do is they pull up a 15 pack van now this is probably
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.400]  what 12 feet high what they do is they bring it up stand on top they have an eye beam to step down
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.480]  on drop down to this beam and then come into the country and they're free they're home free look at
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.920]  this right over here there's a little barbed wire area that's easy to get through everybody's done
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:25.440]  it with some small little pliers you can just cut right through and you're home free our government
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:30.800]  is wasting money building this fence and all they're doing is giving them a spot to step and get over
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:36.080]  into the country it's a beard they're putting money the department of homeland security is saying
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:42.400]  yeah we have a fence we have a fence but yeah look at it i could climb over this this is ridiculous
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:49.200]  that where's the security at where is the secure border that they tell us is up but i have not seen
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.400]  yet continue watching our videos because we're going to keep giving you eye-opening mind-blowing
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:01.760]  reports down here at the border i'm jill bigs with info wars.com now as joe pointed out it is a beard
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.040]  it is just a facade that they put up in some areas so they can do photo ops with it but what is really
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.160]  behind this why has this changed so much recently well of course it's our policies pulling people in
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.720]  to give them entitlements but it is also the war on drugs that is really creating the danger i believe
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:24.960]  it's not just economic collapse that we have to look forward to it is a massive explosion of violence
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:32.000]  as these gangs come across the border engage in prohibition the prohibition racket just like we saw
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.720]  in alcohol prohibition you saw rival gangs shooting each other with tommy guns in the streets
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:44.000]  that ended after 13 years and we now have the new york times calling for a repeal of prohibition
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.200]  again now one of the things they don't mention in here is that the first time we had prohibition we
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:55.280]  had a government and a congress and a president who had enough respect for the constitution
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:01.200]  that they knew they had to pass a special constitutional amendment to give the government
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:08.000]  the power to prohibit a specific thing like alcohol they don't have the power to do that they don't
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.120]  have the constitutional power to do that but of course here we are about a hundred years later
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.800]  there is no respect for the rule of law or for the constitution either from those who are in
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.880]  congress or the presidency of either party and so we've had now for 40 50 years we've had a war
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.280]  on drugs actually i think it was nixon that started it in the 70s and then of course we had
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.320]  ronald reagan double down with it he actually went after the users which is something that
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:40.080]  they never did under alcohol prohibition and as rand paul pointed out when he talked to the NAACP
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:46.480]  this is targeted more so on minorities we have people who are nonviolent offenders people who
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.160]  have a certain amount of marijuana can go to jail for 55 years they can get more jail time
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.880]  mandatory minimums without parole more jail time than somebody who's committed murder
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.640]  that's the absurd situation that we have here but it's not just in our country it's also
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.240]  the root of the violence in these other countries it's the root of ms-13 and the zeta
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:16.320]  gangs those gangs that rca created along with the iran contra scandals that happened there as well
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.320]  as what we see going on in afghanistan with the heroin trafficking that's there poppy production
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.640]  in afghanistan went from 10 of the world supplied in 90 percent after the american military moved
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.040]  in there and started protecting those fields and helping those people we saw what's happened in
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:38.240]  central and south america we know that the cia and others were behind the increase in crack
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:46.400]  cocaine they used it as part of their ron contra scandal so what do we do about this do we depend
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:52.880]  on the federales in america defending us just like the federales in mexico have not defended
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.400]  those people down there we know that we're no safer now we have swat teams we have militarized police
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.640]  we have a loss of due process so many things have been destroyed in the war on drugs to no
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.640]  effect to no effect we still have as many people using these drugs we could argue that they're
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.960]  using them even more so if these are criminals in a black market that are giving these things to
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:23.600]  children and to other people this is not like they're selling you a car and misadvertising the car
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.920]  where you could go back and sue them that's why black markets are always so much more dangerous
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:34.480]  that's why black markets always create violence so i want to know what you think we can do to stop
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:40.960]  the root causes of this border collapse rather than responding to it in a way like we did to
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.960]  9 11 which is to destroy even more of our rights to militarize the police even more to create even

[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're gonna be going back to your
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.640]  phone calls we're gonna be coming up to madden canada mark in california captain bruce in
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:35.280]  florida and many others that are still online that have been holding but just before the break i
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.400]  want to let you know we were talking about prohibition talking about how the new york times is calling
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.920]  for the repeal of prohibition how rand paul is calling for the repeal of prohibition we've seen
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:53.600]  the rule of law we've seen nonsense like charging inanimate objects with crimes just so the government
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.640]  can seize that property without going through due process without convicting anyone without even
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:04.160]  charging a person with a crime they can go in and seize the property by those types of things we've
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:10.560]  seen it turn into a militarization of the police with swat teams we've seen people put away for
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:16.480]  decades in terms of mandatory minimums filling up the prisons to the extent that we have to allow
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.560]  violent criminals out on the streets because we can no longer hold them in prison but we give
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:28.320]  55 year prison terms to people because of a certain amount of possession of marijuana and the bulk of
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:33.920]  the war on drugs is about marijuana as they pointed out in this new york times editorial they said
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:41.040]  there were 658 000 arrests for marijuana possession 2012 according to the fbi but only 256 000 for
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:47.840]  cocaine okay so it's more than double the number of arrests for marijuana as it was for cocaine
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.200]  heroin and other derivatives and of course it is racist it's falling disproportionately on
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.640]  young black men and i'm not using that in the light terms that eric holder in the obama administration
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.800]  does complaining that everything in the world is racist no when you have a such a large percentage
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.120]  of people you can actually put numbers to this you can actually measure it there's actually
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.440]  metrics that show that it is racist we're going to be talking on the nightly news tomorrow night
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.240]  i'm going to be interviewing again jim gearock from law enforcement against prohibition he was a
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.680]  cook county prosecutor worked there for decades he says 80% of the shootings in chicago and of
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.400]  course gun violence is out of control in chicago one of the places where they have the most
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.000]  restrictive gun laws in the country is out of control there he said 80% of the shootings
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.240]  are due to the war on drugs what's going to happen when we have more people come across the border
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:46.320]  when we have gangs coming across the border like ms 13 like the zeta gangs and they start competing
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:52.560]  with the existing gangs that are here start a new drug war between them because we have this drug
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.280]  war that we started in central and south america as well as america we're going to be talking to
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.520]  tomorrow night on the nightly news if you're not a prison planet tv subscriber please consider

[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.280]  apparel there that we have the 1776 apparel the shirts the belt buckles many other things
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.720]  you know i'm drinking alex's coffee here that is two days old i came in i didn't have time to
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.560]  there wasn't any new coffee made it was there from friday and i thought no i don't think i
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.400]  should drink that but i thought well you know what the coffee is so good let me give it a try and
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.720]  actually i gave it a try and although it's cold it tastes great if i'm for iced coffee it is
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:10.640]  delicious so it tastes even great two days later so that's the wake up america line of coffee i would
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.240]  definitely recommend it they taste great even the pot cold two days later that's super stuff it's
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.280]  even better when it's freshly brewed but it's it's still really good better than most of the coffee
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.800]  that i've had that is freshly brewed and even two days later i want to go back to your calls and i
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.920]  want to ask and if you think that obama should be impeached over this how do we control the border
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:37.360]  how do we even more importantly how do we control a president who has declared that he's going to do
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:43.040]  whatever he wishes and as elner holmes norton pointed out you don't have a right to know what
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.960]  he's going to do because we've got this separation of powers government well you know elner holmes
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.680]  norton is a non-voting member of congress she shouldn't even be there because the district
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:57.440]  to columbia doesn't have a congressperson for a good reason and so she's just there to sound off
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:03.920]  but she's as we play the beginning of the program saying that you don't have any right to know under
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:09.520]  our division of powers i don't think there is any division of power it looks to me like congress has
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:16.160]  completely abdicated all of its power to either obama or to the bureaucracies that they let
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:23.760]  write the laws let's go to your calls let's go to matt and canada matt yes how are you doing good
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:29.200]  what's on your mind what do you think we should do i think the biggest thing is to correct the laws
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:34.320]  that are prohibiting uh the production of hemp and cannabis in the u.s i think that's the biggest
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.640]  way to increase the economy you're going to massively increase the performance they talk
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.800]  about the jobs that you're going to be creating you've got a whole industry that is completely
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.440]  dormant right now because of doors as soon as you open up cannabis and hemp production you open
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.040]  up plastics and textile let alone biodiesel that reduce uh that there can be a competitor for
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:58.160]  all the big oil companies out there oh yeah we have a crop that we are not using right now yeah you
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.120]  have if you look at just look at hemp and that's not anything that's going to get anybody high if
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.840]  you just look at hemp uh you know that back in world war two we had the hip for victory campaigns
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.880]  it's famous video that you may have seen online they can make clothing out of it they can make
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.200]  rope out of it they can make pharmaceuticals out of it hemp oil is very effective from what a lot
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.000]  of people have said it's helped them a great deal with cancer of course marijuana helps people who
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.160]  are on chemotherapy it's the only way that most people can still eat while they're on chemotherapy
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.160]  so it competes in a lot of different ways with a lot of industries out there and i would say mark
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.640]  and canada i would say that a lot of people advance the theory that maybe that was why it was
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:44.720]  criminalized the way that it was when it was was because it was competing with a lot of big business
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.280]  well that's exactly right by 1937 marijuana and tax act you're talking about uh a law that provided
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.960]  the cotton industry uh rave industry all the different manufacturing industries that came up
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:02.480]  it provided them uh a stepping stone for sure but right now uh we need to grow the economy the only
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:10.000]  way to do that is by growing hemp trees uh fast growing uh the but not to mention uh the plastics
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.120]  every product that you can think of that there's used plastics you can trade by plastics but by
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:20.400]  the grainable we're talking about no co2 emissions we're talking about carbon neutral uh this is a
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.680]  left button to right marriage right here yeah that's right and the good thing about it is that
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.800]  hemp and marijuana kind of grows like a weed doesn't it that's pretty easy to grow but you
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.960]  know it's also it's not just the economic benefits from it it's also the liberty benefits from it
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:43.520]  what if we actually went back to the rule of law because back in 1937 they did not have the legal
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:48.880]  authority to prohibit marijuana to prohibit hemp or anything like that because they needed to pass
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.560]  a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol but when they got to 1937 they just said we're just
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.960]  going to rule by fiat that's what we see happening right now thank you mark and canada that's what
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:04.240]  we see happening right now in so many different ways from the obama administration and i think
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:10.480]  that part of what we're seeing in the reluctance to go after obama is that in areas where they
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.680]  really could win in areas where they could come after him for things that appeal to a bipartisan
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.800]  audience where he has destroyed our civil liberties where they have done dragnet surveillance of people
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.920]  where they've done drone assassinations where they've done illegal undeclared wars so many of those
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:31.200]  areas the republicans could make common cause with democrats and could impeach him could bring back
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:38.000]  the presidency into line with a real separation of powers but they're reluctant on those issues
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.080]  because quite frankly they would like to break the law in those areas in the same way just as they
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.320]  have signed on to breaking the law with marijuana prohibition and drug prohibition the same way that
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:58.800]  the republican house has supported the ndaa every year even though obama did it and signed it
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:05.120]  we also see that it was passed by a republican majority in the house let's go to mark in california
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:15.680]  mark take them david let none of them escape was that david yes i said take them david let
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:23.120]  none of them escape take them okay expand that a little bit now uh well in other words you're
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:31.120]  doing a good job keep on doing it oh thank you okay yeah now uh definitely uh we should impeach
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:36.800]  obama no doubt about it i know these young books to say who did a fine job on our clinton they had
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.680]  the petitions that we went around getting people to sign the thing that the congress that hang on
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.520]  a second mark we're gonna come right back to you right after the break and we're also gonna go

[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:28.320]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david nighton in this last segment we're going to be
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:44.000]  going to mark in california jonah wisconsin and captain bruce in florida we've been talking
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.720]  about impeachment whether or not obama should be impeached whether or not he's actually begging
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:56.480]  for it saying that he's going to essentially give amnesty by fiat to five million people
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.080]  maybe more who knows we don't have an accurate number but essentially saying he's not going
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:06.800]  to wait for congress to do anything and of course if he can do that he can also by fiat
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:12.240]  and guns he's talked about doing that he's talked about doing many things by fiat and of course he
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:18.720]  has done a lot by fiat can we get him impeached on some bipartisan issues will the republicans
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.760]  do anything are they just trying to score some cheap political points now of course it's been
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.280]  said that obama wants this and i i think steve stockman is right congressman stockman from
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.520]  texas i think he does want impeachment i think he sees that as a way to energize his base the
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:41.520]  question is will those who oppose his rule by fiat will they be energized to vote for opposition
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.480]  or will they see the opposition as essentially weak and effective if they don't do anything
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:50.400]  i was talking just before the break with mark in california mark you were about to weigh in on
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.760]  what you thought we should do whether obama should be impeached and maybe for what what do you think
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.720]  yeah well first of all i'd like to say hi to captain bruce florida but i think uh i think it
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:07.040]  was joe that mentioned that the congressman ought to write up i'm not sure you know i'm a public
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.760]  winner but uh the congressman ought to write up you know six or seven different things you know to
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:19.360]  impeach him for it and uh then the the ants like uh this listener can go and and work on congress
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.440]  i think that's a good strategy another good one is uh i go to the city council meetings and
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.800]  centers a and i had a sign made up a three foot by two foot sign which is within the rules
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:37.360]  that i bring down there maybe two or three times it says that the john de camp alex jones the franklin
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:44.560]  cover-up we can bring up these issues you and alex talk about to our city council still yes and uh
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:50.000]  i've had three different t-shirts made up i go to san francisco border supervisors and it it says
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.680]  john de camp alex jones franklin cover-up and then on the back it's got a scripture and due time
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.040]  christ died for the ungodly so there's there's something we can do you know still we have the
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:07.360]  freedom because on the net and so on people do watch that but uh well you're right i think there
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:13.920]  are many things we could do i i think if we fail to do anything that sends the worst possible message
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:19.520]  i think it is whether or not we are going to win on something we need to stand up for the things
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:26.480]  that matter and when we fail to do that when we fail to take a stand that is the worst possible
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.360]  outcome i think that's worse than trying to do the right thing and losing you have to have a
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.920]  backbone you have to stand up for what's right and certainly mark i think it's a target rich
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:42.480]  environment in terms of what we could impeach him for they're just so many things let's go to uh
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:49.520]  john and wisconsin john yeah how you doing today good what's on your mind what do you think we
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.920]  ought to impeach uh obama and if so what do you think we ought to impeach him for i think what
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:51:01.200]  are you small you have to pick one thing i mean i guess that is a target rich environment isn't it
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:08.080]  well there's 43 reasons it's all wrapped up in obamacure that we can use um yeah i think this
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:15.920]  is this is you know with the final straw that breaks the Campbell's back pretty much because
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:23.040]  if you look back when kennedy was in office he wasn't going along with the program he was doing
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.840]  as a matter of fact he warned us about people doing this oh yeah that's why he was just fascinated
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.600]  yeah and what happened right after that everything escalated everything just going up and up and up
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:39.840]  which senior comes out every other time he almost his mouth is the new world order you know
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.160]  well i think one of the things the republicans need to do in order to shore up their bases they
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:49.680]  need to show that they are willing to do something i mean we see over and over again how they've
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:55.680]  abdicated their legislative responsibility to the bureaucracies we even see one of the leadership
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:02.800]  uh paul ryan going before the federal election commission asking them for permission to buy and
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:07.360]  sell uh buy his book and and give it away that's something that all these politicians have done
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.120]  they haven't asked for permission nor should they from the federal elections commission
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:15.280]  hillary clinton didn't ask for it so he went to them begged for permission
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.880]  he essentially turned what is a right that is political free speech he turned that into a privilege
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:27.200]  and the one of the chair of the federal elections commission who is a republican came out and said
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.600]  this is a very dangerous precedent we've set but he was one of the ones who voted for it they
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.640]  voted six to nothing to put this through and then he comes out and says we've set a very dangerous
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.040]  precedent yes they have they've changed a fundamental right of free political speech
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:46.560]  into a privilege that they can then micromanage and they did it in his case they said well you
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:50.880]  can do this but you can't do that you can't talk you can't have more than two sentences about it on
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:57.680]  your website that's the passivity that's the spinelessness of the gop leadership that we have
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:03.600]  right now and i don't expect them to take any action quite frankly but they have to do something
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:07.600]  we have to get somebody in there who's going to do something but it apparently isn't going to be
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:13.760]  this current crop of the gop anything else you want to add john well you know if we succeed in
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:20.320]  in impeaching the president then whoever's in charge then or week to the next president comes
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:26.480]  along we call everybody in this town yeah well somebody else pointed out if you get rid of obama
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:30.400]  you're just going to get obama you're just going to get obama you're going to get obama and he's
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.720]  just as bad but it sends the message that we could actually do something about it that we had the
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:42.720]  will to do something about it even if we didn't get the guy impeached the fact that somebody would
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:48.480]  stand up to him i think would be the beginning of a movement that person who or groups of group of
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:55.280]  people who would have the backbone to do that they could start coalescing a a coalition around them
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:59.680]  to actually do something i think that's what we need to see let's go to thank you john let's go to
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:05.680]  captain bruce in florida captain bruce go ahead david kudos i think alex has finally found his
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:13.200]  replacement oh no by the way uh the pro cure water filter works and i also use the x2 iodine
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:19.040]  i feel much better so that is not i'm not being paid to say that that that's the truth that's great
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:22.560]  we got that back in stock and we got a special on it as i mentioned earlier but thank you for
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:28.080]  letting us know go ahead what you want to say about uh i do think we should impeach obama
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:33.680]  and uh i think biden is probably obama's insurance policy that's the other reason has
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.640]  been taken out already that's right so we need to get rid of all of them we need to get rid of
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.600]  bernie sanders and just going down the line chuckie schumer hillary all of them god forbid we get
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:49.040]  hillary yeah oh yeah yeah that's very very concerning actually i heard a quote from her
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:56.160]  that was on an interview with uh on an npr and basically she was feeding this agenda out there
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:00.880]  that it's just simply children who are coming across and all the immigrants who come across are
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:04.720]  just falling to one of two categories they're either migrants who are coming here because they
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.280]  want to be reunited with their family and it's like oh wait a minute if their family is here
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.480]  then they're u.s citizens or they're coming across and joining illegal immigrants who are
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.640]  already here or she says the other alternative is they're fleeing violence well you know of
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:22.560]  course there are other alternatives to that as well it could be that they're coming here to
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:29.440]  make themselves a uh dependent on the american people it could also be that they're drug gangs
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.880]  who are coming across this is what we've shown in these early reports from joe begs down at the
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:41.280]  border they are cutting through the iron fences down there with a subtle in torches at a regular
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:46.320]  rate that's what is pushing these people in is the drug war i believe that's going on there
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.200]  unless we stop that we're not going to see it stop no matter how much force no matter how many
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.400]  fences we put down there what do you think well i've been teaching the children is important
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:01.360]  i'm not scared of the children come across we're going to be able to reform the union after the
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.760]  united states is balkanized i live in one of the most conservative areas of the country here next

[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:57.200]  trying to avoid the reality of what's going on and the most dangerous thing that could come out of
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.640]  all this out of the snowden leaks and everything else is for people to get the wrong message to
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:06.080]  say well they're watching me i better shut up i better not make any waves i better do exactly
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.600]  what they want that is the wrong message we have people like william benney that i've interviewed

[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:25.200]  globally he worked for them for decades and he says we have now a totalitarian state
