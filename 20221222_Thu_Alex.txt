[00:00.000 --> 00:28.840]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:28.840 --> 00:34.800]  It was just two and a half years ago when we had the most secure border in decades under
[00:34.800 --> 00:41.400]  President Trump doing four things, remaining Mexico, Title 42, in catch and release and
[00:41.400 --> 00:43.080]  build the border wall.
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.880]  That's what President Trump did and we had the lowest border crossings since last century.
[00:48.880 --> 00:53.120]  Now under Joe Biden, we have far more record setting numbers of people coming across the
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.360]  border than ever before is all because of Joe Biden's policies.
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.520]  I love how they keep saying, oh Biden's done a great job, the corporate media, the White
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.320]  House, the press secretary, he really has controlled the border, it's the same as it's
[01:04.320 --> 01:07.240]  ever been when it is basically gone.
[01:07.240 --> 01:13.440]  What Americans should know is that the president has done the work to deal with what we're
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.920]  seeing at the border since day one.
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.520]  People have been spotted emerging from manholes in the Segundo Varia area again, neighbors
[01:20.520 --> 01:22.200]  saying this is not new.
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.080]  They're coming in groups, I want to say maybe eight, ten.
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.680]  The location where the video was recorded Wednesday night is just half a mile away from
[01:29.680 --> 01:31.560]  the U.S.-Mexico border at the Rio Grande.
[01:31.560 --> 01:35.560]  What appears to be a drain outlet in the river is located in a straight line, southeast.
[01:35.560 --> 01:37.920]  You can even see a border patrol vehicle there.
[01:37.920 --> 01:41.560]  Yes, we've seen numerous videos of people coming through manholes, people running across
[01:41.560 --> 01:44.280]  the border highway up here by YouTube as well.
[01:44.280 --> 01:46.760]  They're not using the river anymore.
[01:46.760 --> 01:52.520]  You know, they're using the water, the water tunnels to come in.
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.880]  Stop, yes, snapping this picture of what appears to show a man standing over the manhole and
[01:57.880 --> 01:59.760]  another emerging from it.
[01:59.760 --> 02:05.240]  They're coming out of these manholes at that intersection over there, this one over here,
[02:05.240 --> 02:14.440]  the one by Circle K, and they come in the 30s, ten, three, from nine o'clock, midnight,
[02:14.440 --> 02:16.840]  any time of the day or night.
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.840]  Where do they go?
[02:17.840 --> 02:20.360]  And the answer is God only knows, but we have a pretty good idea.
[02:20.360 --> 02:21.360]  We know where a lot of them go.
[02:21.360 --> 02:22.760]  And we know what happens in Europe.
[02:22.760 --> 02:23.760]  We know what happens here.
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.240]  It's the guy that ran the whole implosion of Europe the last ten years for the UN and
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.200]  works for Soros, runs the whole Texas sector.
[02:31.200 --> 02:35.920]  The border patrol takes orders from NGOs the last two years since Biden stole the election.
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.120]  3,600 pesos was the last thing that I received.
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.120]  And does that go into your bank account?
[02:44.120 --> 02:50.400]  Oh, let me see.
[02:50.400 --> 03:02.880]  This mobile processing center is seeing an average of 1,500 migrants a day, about half
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.720]  of them from Venezuela.
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.160]  How does that change the equation for you?
[03:07.160 --> 03:13.160]  Well, unlike the Mexicans and Central Americans that we can process under the CDC authority
[03:13.160 --> 03:19.400]  of Title 42, we are having to process the people coming from Venezuela and Cuba and
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.960]  Nicaragua under our Title 8 authorities, meaning they're usually released and allowed to request
[03:24.960 --> 03:28.400]  asylum, a process that typically takes years to complete.
[03:28.400 --> 03:36.080]  El Paso is getting 14,500, they were saying, a day flooding in where there's just no controls.
[03:36.080 --> 03:40.480]  Officials have ramped up processing, but we were even able to see as of last night a lot
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.560]  of migrants just crossing and migrants I spoke to this morning saying they haven't had any
[03:44.560 --> 03:48.400]  interaction with U.S. immigration authorities, they just walked right in.
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.880]  Title 42 is about to go away.
[03:49.880 --> 03:56.000]  We know smugglers will try to spread misinformation to take advantage of these vulnerable migrants,
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.840]  but I want to be very clear here.
[03:57.840 --> 04:03.440]  The fact is that the removal of Title 42 does not mean the border is open.
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.280]  Anyone who suggests otherwise is simply doing the work of these smugglers who, again, are
[04:07.280 --> 04:08.840]  spreading misinformation.
[04:08.840 --> 04:10.760]  It's just total lawless crime.
[04:10.760 --> 04:16.040]  They use them as cutouts for the money laundering, for the drug dealing, for the sex slavery,
[04:16.040 --> 04:17.840]  just for everything else you can imagine.
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.720]  And then the Mexican drug cartels then put their money in U.S. banks controlled by Democrats
[04:22.720 --> 04:23.720]  as well.
[04:23.720 --> 04:26.840]  That's why Pelosi calls MS-13 God's children.
[04:26.840 --> 04:28.800]  The wages of sin is death.
[04:28.800 --> 04:29.800]  It's here.
[04:29.800 --> 04:33.840]  Whether it's California, Arizona, Texas, you name it, every day, tens of thousands
[04:33.840 --> 04:36.360]  in every sector just pour across.
[04:36.360 --> 04:38.600]  It's all to come by Biden.
[04:38.600 --> 04:43.080]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[04:43.080 --> 04:48.240]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[04:48.240 --> 04:50.160]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[04:50.160 --> 04:51.320]  They deserve to be heard.
[04:51.320 --> 04:52.320]  That's who we are.
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.760]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.760]  come.
[04:56.760 --> 05:01.760]  To be exploited, to be controlled, and to be put in the voting.
[05:01.760 --> 05:08.680]  Have you tried taking the real red pill, a one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed
[05:08.680 --> 05:11.360]  exclusively for Info War's life?
[05:11.360 --> 05:17.720]  The main ingredient in the real red pill plus is pregnanolone, a little-known neuro-steroid
[05:17.720 --> 05:23.200]  that assists in our body's natural hormone production, and low levels are associated
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.520]  with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[05:27.520 --> 05:34.720]  The real red pill plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium,
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.720]  and zinc.
[05:35.720 --> 05:41.920]  During naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the
[05:41.920 --> 05:47.840]  real red pill plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup
[05:47.840 --> 05:48.840]  of coffee.
[05:48.840 --> 05:55.360]  So visit infowarstore.com, go down the rabbit hole, and try taking the real red pill to
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.480]  see what it's really all about.
[05:57.480 --> 06:23.960]  That's infowarstore.com.
[06:23.960 --> 06:31.400]  100-plus billion is gone and up as we accelerate into World War III, disgusting standing ovations
[06:31.400 --> 06:37.720]  fawning by both political parties as they launder back, of course, most of the proceeds
[06:37.720 --> 06:42.120]  into their own pockets as we learn that the FBI criminally with the CIA spies the American
[06:42.120 --> 06:46.520]  people and manipulates and controls elections.
[06:46.520 --> 06:54.040]  The good news is, all of this evil, like a sore coming to the surface, is erupting and
[06:54.040 --> 06:56.320]  the population is waking up very, very quickly.
[06:56.320 --> 07:01.040]  The question is, can we organize non-criminal elements of society and private society and
[07:01.040 --> 07:05.120]  government and reverse this before the fall of our republic is complete?
[07:05.120 --> 07:07.600]  The borders are, again, completely wide open.
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.440]  All hell is breaking loose, not just here, but around the world.
[07:10.440 --> 07:15.480]  We're going to be laying it all out on this live Thursday edition, and we're going to,
[07:15.480 --> 07:17.520]  of course, be taking your phone calls.
[07:17.520 --> 07:23.200]  There is so much to get to, but here is Zelensky entering Congress before he gave his 20-minute
[07:23.200 --> 07:24.200]  speech last night.
[07:24.200 --> 07:32.720]  And there he is, yes, that was President Zelensky dressed in his traditional fatigues.
[07:32.720 --> 07:38.920]  What we see him wearing when we see him appearing on television frequently from Ukraine, there
[07:38.920 --> 07:39.920]  he is.
[07:39.920 --> 07:45.400]  You can see a number of members of Congress, again, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer,
[07:45.400 --> 07:49.640]  the Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, there seated on opposite sides of the aisle.
[07:49.640 --> 07:53.960]  And as we say, you can't stress enough, it's one of the rare moments when the two sides
[07:53.960 --> 07:56.040]  are in some agreement.
[07:56.040 --> 07:57.040]  So here he is.
[07:57.040 --> 08:06.280]  He's greeting Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
[08:06.280 --> 08:14.120]  And receiving what is clearly a warm welcome from both sides of the aisle in the House.
[08:14.120 --> 08:18.640]  And again, they're in the House chamber, these are House members, but also members of the
[08:18.640 --> 08:19.640]  Senate.
[08:19.640 --> 08:26.480]  And like trained seals, they gave him over a two-minute standing ovation at the first
[08:26.480 --> 08:30.600]  of it, and then continued to give standing ovations, like they were about to be thrown
[08:30.600 --> 08:37.120]  rotten fish out of a bucket that they were performing at SeaWorld.
[08:37.120 --> 08:40.440]  Over the top, creepy.
[08:40.440 --> 08:52.240]  There is a linty, says PBS anchor woman, wearing the traditional olive fatigues.
[08:52.240 --> 08:57.760]  So foreign leaders that have outlawed all political opposition, including liberals and
[08:57.760 --> 09:04.560]  supporting, taking total control of the media, torturing people to death, started the war
[09:04.560 --> 09:12.080]  with Russia, with massive NATO backing, firing missiles into Russia, and now, oh, he's wearing
[09:12.080 --> 09:25.560]  his traditional fatigues, like Fidel Castro, or Adolf Hitler, or Kim Jong-un.
[09:25.560 --> 09:33.960]  Yes, folks, when you have people strutting around in military uniforms, you got a problem.
[09:33.960 --> 09:43.200]  And by the way, just like Hitler, he is only wearing one symbol on his military uniform.
[09:43.200 --> 09:51.240]  In a dictator tradition, had dictators, their adjuncts, their minions, will have a whole
[09:51.240 --> 10:00.080]  bunch of fruit salad on their chest, but he only has one symbol, the symbol of Ukraine
[10:00.080 --> 10:08.000]  on his chest, strutting around being worshipped and addressing Congress.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.800]  And I guess, kissy kissing, Pelosi, when Pelosi turns around during a speech, like she's
[10:14.800 --> 10:25.600]  an eighth grader at the middle school football teams, homecoming rally.
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.520]  This is simply insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:30.520 --> 10:41.640]  And the clock ticks faster and faster, tick-tock, tick-tock, towards thermal, nuclear war.
[10:41.640 --> 10:47.120]  But the corrupt criminal political establishment loves to hide behind the latest thing that's
[10:47.120 --> 10:53.360]  Ukraine, the latest thing that can destroy human civilization and most life on the surface
[10:53.360 --> 10:55.960]  of the planet overnight.
[10:55.960 --> 11:01.640]  Even Henry Kissinger says we've never been in such danger of nuclear war, and no one
[11:01.640 --> 11:04.520]  is supposed to question what Ukraine is doing.
[11:04.520 --> 11:10.360]  Everyone is supposed to get behind the nine-year program of George Soros, who bragged on Faridzikaria's
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.640]  show four years ago that he got $5 billion of state-department money to overthrow the
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.000]  government there and start the ongoing civil war and the ethnic cleansing of the Russians
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.800]  in the East, leading to the manipulation of Putin's disastrous blunder to go into Ukraine
[11:28.800 --> 11:36.120]  into the jaws of a NATO, deep state trap.
[11:36.120 --> 11:46.160]  And that is exactly where we are right now, and Russia is only doubling down in the face
[11:46.160 --> 11:53.520]  of tens of millions of dollars of high-tech U.S. weapons every month being shipped in and
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.240]  billions of dollars of other high-tech weapons being shipped in by other nations.
[11:57.240 --> 12:05.560]  But the United States is giving more military aid than all other countries combined.
[12:05.560 --> 12:12.160]  I want to open the phones up again today specifically on this war that's not just a proxy war.
[12:12.160 --> 12:19.000]  The United States isn't just a proxy war with Russia now, U.S. troops are on the ground,
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.120]  U.S. troops are advising, U.S. troops are targeting weapons, U.S. troops are identifying
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.000]  where the missile attacks are going to go and artillery attacks, and U.S. soldiers are
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.040]  again dying in this conflict, and they're having a party over it.
[12:36.040 --> 12:37.040]  It's so exciting.
[12:37.040 --> 12:44.080]  It's so much fun in all the Hollywood trash, like Sean Penn travels to make homage and
[12:44.080 --> 12:52.640]  to make pilgrimage to Zelensky, who's an actor and who was installed and who has declared
[12:52.640 --> 13:02.400]  dictatorial powers in our addresses, our dictatorial Congress in a military outfit.
[13:02.400 --> 13:13.120]  So that is what Armageddon looks like.
[13:13.120 --> 13:20.600]  That's what the prelude or the eave of destruction looks like, and if you can't feel the danger,
[13:20.600 --> 13:25.120]  not just politically analyze it, then you're dead.
[13:25.120 --> 13:27.520]  Everybody I know says, man, I don't know why I'm having so much anxiety.
[13:27.520 --> 13:28.720]  I've never had this much anxiety.
[13:28.720 --> 13:30.280]  Well, we're losing all our rights.
[13:30.280 --> 13:33.800]  We know we have a government that's a rogue, but starting massive wars with the second
[13:33.800 --> 13:40.440]  most powerful nuclear state in the world, we know that many Americans have been converted
[13:40.440 --> 13:47.720]  into criminal operatives of the New World Order working hard to bring this country down
[13:47.720 --> 13:49.360]  and the world down.
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.360]  And I've got more clips of Bill Gates and others calling for depopulation.
[13:53.360 --> 13:55.560]  We're going to be getting to do that.
[13:55.560 --> 13:57.720]  We have the January 6th Committee.
[13:57.720 --> 13:59.800]  Guess what they did this morning?
[13:59.800 --> 14:06.120]  They released select parts they wanted to, like my deposition, but they didn't release
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.240]  the whole report or their research or data.
[14:09.240 --> 14:12.480]  In fact, it's sealed for 20 years.
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.640]  And they say they may seal it like the JFK files for 50 or 60 years.
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.400]  And that includes the 14,000 hours, that's how many cameras they had in the Capitol,
[14:22.400 --> 14:25.000]  the 14,000 hours of footage.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  But just the footage we have, we know there were provocateur groups stirring people up,
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.640]  helping lead people in.
[14:30.640 --> 14:32.640]  They undermanned the building that day.
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.200]  They refused Trump's security request for an additional guard.
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.000]  And now documents have come out showing that Pelosi was working my policies to make sure
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  that happened.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.280]  Her daughter and a film crew were there that day so they could hype up what happened.
[14:46.280 --> 14:51.280]  They wish it had been a lot worse, but myself and others were able to stop most of the crowd
[14:51.280 --> 14:53.160]  from getting in.
[14:53.160 --> 14:56.800]  I got there once, already 300, 400 had gotten in.
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.600]  I was able to stop thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands
[15:00.600 --> 15:05.280]  more from getting in.
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.480]  And for that, the corporate media has continually pushed for my indictment.
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.040]  When Shroyer has been arrested, other members of our crew have been arrested and are still
[15:16.040 --> 15:27.440]  facing trial for being on the Capitol grounds and trying to stop what happened that day.
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.760]  What we did is out in the open.
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.760]  But what Pelosi did and what the deep state did and what the globalists did is secret.
[15:35.760 --> 15:38.280]  So remember that.
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.560]  They have sealed their investigation.
[15:43.560 --> 15:46.400]  Why would you do that?
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.120]  Infowars.com is jam packed with critical news.
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.120]  You won't get anywhere else.
[15:50.120 --> 15:53.720]  Please share those links until folks tune in now, the most forbidden broadcasts in the
[15:53.720 --> 15:54.720]  world.
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.240]  Infowars.com, forward slash show, and on the local stations listening to you, we'll be
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.240]  right back.
[15:59.240 --> 16:03.000]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.600]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[16:07.600 --> 16:13.360]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[16:13.360 --> 16:19.200]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the
[16:19.200 --> 16:20.200]  globalists have done.
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.960]  And I've got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer

[17:54.640 --> 17:59.920]  massive savings.
[17:59.920 --> 18:05.720]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Infowars, attacking myself and
[18:05.720 --> 18:07.760]  the crew and our other hosts?
[18:07.760 --> 18:09.600]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[18:09.600 --> 18:11.320]  They know we're telling the truth.
[18:11.320 --> 18:12.880]  They know we've got their number.
[18:12.880 --> 18:19.120]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity, and God gave us through Mother Nature
[18:19.120 --> 18:24.440]  incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.440]  systems.

[18:40.200 --> 18:44.160]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.

[18:59.280 --> 19:04.760]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[19:04.760 --> 19:11.640]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[19:11.640 --> 19:17.200]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[19:26.280 --> 19:34.640]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[19:34.640 --> 19:40.280]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[19:40.280 --> 19:42.080]  care.
[19:42.080 --> 19:49.040]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health
[19:49.040 --> 19:57.360]  advice come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.400]  Wellness Company.
[20:00.400 --> 20:27.160]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:30.720 --> 20:36.120]  Through Friday, from 11 AM, 3 PM, I'm right here on the Infowars network, with a lot of
[20:36.120 --> 20:39.500]  the great shows, as well as Harrison Smith, Owen Stroyer, and more.
[20:39.500 --> 20:46.000]  Find them all at Band-I Video at Infowars.com, share the information, that's what globalist
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.060]  hope you won't do.
[20:48.060 --> 20:50.920]  You are the Resistance, you are the Power.
[20:50.920 --> 20:51.920]  Let me do this.
[20:51.920 --> 20:52.920]  I went off on Zalinski.
[20:52.920 --> 20:55.720]  But let me just tell you what's coming up, and I'm gonna get the number out.
[20:55.720 --> 20:57.040]  We're gonna take a ton of calls again today.
[20:57.040 --> 20:58.040]  Folks really liked that.
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.040]  I liked that.
[20:59.040 --> 21:00.040]  A lot of different angles.
[21:00.040 --> 21:04.280]  We're going to hit the Zelensky stack with more detail.
[21:04.280 --> 21:11.040]  We're going to hit the January 6 so-called conclusion as well because, again, they're
[21:11.040 --> 21:18.120]  saying we're going to minimum seal 99% of it for 20 years.
[21:18.120 --> 21:19.320]  Why would you do that?
[21:19.320 --> 21:25.240]  Well, including the 14,000 hours of surveillance footage because they did provocateur.
[21:25.240 --> 21:29.920]  It was a provocateur false flag, period.
[21:29.920 --> 21:33.680]  They'll also look at what the left is doing around the U.S. and in Europe.
[21:33.680 --> 21:40.680]  Church erases Jesus and Nativity and Christmas Carol, replaces them with queer people.
[21:40.680 --> 21:46.120]  We're also going to be looking at the FBI's latest response to the new Twitter files where
[21:46.120 --> 21:50.280]  they were paying millions of dollars to Twitter to censor and control and giving them actual
[21:50.280 --> 21:51.560]  security clearances.
[21:51.560 --> 21:57.760]  The FBI says it's all a conspiracy, none of it's true, even though it's all on record.
[21:57.760 --> 22:01.360]  It's like Biden's saying, I never said I'm getting rid of Title 42, I never said search
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.360]  the border.
[22:02.360 --> 22:04.240]  We're not getting rid of Title 42.
[22:04.240 --> 22:05.560]  It's the courts doing it, not me.
[22:05.560 --> 22:10.280]  No, you just filed the court cases in jurisdictions you control with an Obama judge.
[22:10.280 --> 22:18.240]  I mean, it's like saying, like Hitler saying, I don't know who the Nazi party is or a Christian
[22:18.240 --> 22:19.760]  saying they don't know who Jesus is.
[22:19.760 --> 22:26.240]  I mean, the level of the ridiculousness, it'd be like if Biden got up and said, traffic
[22:26.240 --> 22:30.120]  lights in the United States are not red, green, and yellow.
[22:30.120 --> 22:32.920]  He'd say, that's a ridiculous lie.
[22:32.920 --> 22:36.480]  Stop signs are not red in the United States.
[22:36.480 --> 22:38.640]  Yield signs are not yellow.
[22:38.640 --> 22:40.880]  The sun is not yellow.
[22:40.880 --> 22:42.960]  Grass is not green.
[22:42.960 --> 22:44.440]  Birds do not fly.
[22:44.440 --> 22:46.240]  Fish do not swim.
[22:46.240 --> 22:47.480]  Black is not black.
[22:47.480 --> 22:48.480]  White is not white.
[22:48.480 --> 22:53.800]  And if you read 1984, written by the number one propagandist for British intelligence
[22:53.800 --> 22:57.360]  explaining what they wanted to do and why he decided they were authoritarian and went
[22:57.360 --> 23:02.200]  against them, George Irwell, because he wrote nonfiction essays about it, suggests you read
[23:02.200 --> 23:03.200]  them.
[23:03.200 --> 23:05.120]  There's whole book compendiums of them.
[23:05.120 --> 23:06.680]  He wrote before he died.
[23:06.680 --> 23:11.680]  He explained that they want to train you to hear asinine BS and then punish you if you
[23:11.680 --> 23:12.680]  don't go along with it.
[23:12.680 --> 23:16.360]  It's like, we want a world government and you're going to own nothing and have nothing
[23:16.360 --> 23:19.280]  and we're going to forcibly inject you to sterilize you.
[23:19.280 --> 23:22.360]  You're like, well, here's the clips and here's the documents with the very people running
[23:22.360 --> 23:27.800]  this program admit the plan and they have headlines, Jones is insane, claims there's
[23:27.800 --> 23:35.400]  a world government and a plan to forcibly inject you and it goes on and on and on and
[23:35.400 --> 23:36.400]  on.
[23:36.400 --> 23:41.440]  So we've got those clips of the FBI and then more of what's in the files and this is exactly
[23:41.440 --> 23:49.480]  what we knew was going on from operations they ran overseas before that they found were
[23:49.480 --> 23:55.800]  so evil, this came out on OAN last year, they had a former high level CIA, operative go
[23:55.800 --> 24:03.880]  public, how he wrote the algorithm program to run total disinformation in Afghanistan
[24:03.880 --> 24:08.240]  and it was decided that it was just too criminal to do.
[24:08.240 --> 24:10.920]  It was just, it was so deceptive and so evil.
[24:10.920 --> 24:16.800]  So they're using that same program here and it's very complex but the first thing it
[24:16.800 --> 24:24.160]  is, it's just two men can have a baby, pedophilia is good, just absolute upside down world,
[24:24.160 --> 24:29.320]  we're going to ban your cows to save the earth, it's just flooding you with total attacks
[24:29.320 --> 24:35.680]  everywhere and then weaponizing the media to just lie about everything until people
[24:35.680 --> 24:41.160]  just give up and basically tune out instead of analyzing the lies and I see examples of
[24:41.160 --> 24:43.440]  this of own personal life every day.
[24:43.440 --> 24:50.160]  We filed a motion Monday to suspend the stay in my bankruptcy both corporate for free
[24:50.160 --> 24:55.960]  speech systems and for Alex Jones, you're surely, we filed it, the other side agreed
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.280]  so we can go ahead with our appeals but the bankruptcy is going on, headlines everywhere,
[25:00.280 --> 25:07.440]  judge strips Jones of bankruptcy, Jones's bankruptcy fails, just total 180 lie and friends
[25:07.440 --> 25:10.880]  and family call up and say man really sorry to hear that happen to you and I'm just sitting
[25:10.880 --> 25:17.360]  there going folks, the media didn't lie that bad five, ten years ago, they lied a lot but
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.440]  it was on key stories, now they lie almost about everything and if you don't know the
[25:22.440 --> 25:28.320]  back story then you can't analyze it and that's really why this show is so important because
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.760]  I'm so immersed in the news for 30 years, 28 years on air almost more now that I just
[25:33.760 --> 25:39.320]  had the background, the inside, I know the ongoing programs and I know the lies that
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.520]  they use to cover up those programs but I know the specifics, how they operate, how
[25:43.520 --> 25:50.000]  the spy networks operate and you know I've got contacts and people that have run these
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.080]  programs that give us information because they don't like what's happening and they
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.240]  resigned out of this and people always say oh you had that whistleblower on that exposed
[25:59.240 --> 26:04.440]  Wuhan, he had a top secret security clearance and ran these projects, why he's a deep state
[26:04.440 --> 26:10.520]  and Dr. Huff said yeah I am deep state and I'm an army veteran and I'm a patriot and
[26:10.520 --> 26:17.200]  I'm going public, what do you expect him to do, well we've got a lot of other whistleblowers
[26:17.200 --> 26:23.720]  and a lot of other people, I mean I've got one source who on record super highly decorated
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.760]  came up all the way through the military from the lowest levels to the highest levels and
[26:28.760 --> 26:34.200]  used to run major scyop campaigns and he doesn't give me the tales of those super secret
[26:34.200 --> 26:38.080]  scyop campaigns, I talked to people that know and they're like I ran major operations, he
[26:38.080 --> 26:41.560]  just sits there and says you're dead on here, you're dead on there, you're dead on here
[26:41.560 --> 26:45.800]  and he says we don't know how you know all this, you know something that only like top
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.880]  people know because that's all I do is study this and so what I'm telling the public is
[26:51.880 --> 26:57.280]  I don't need these sources, okay they can just verify my information because I'm already
[26:57.280 --> 27:02.440]  so immersed in it, I know the enemy battle plan and when you hear some of the callers,
[27:02.440 --> 27:06.480]  almost all the callers are amazing and teach me a lot, some callers a little bit goofy,
[27:06.480 --> 27:10.880]  nobody's perfect but you hear the callers and they know what's going on because you
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.120]  are immersed in this as well and what I'm saying is it's like becoming street wise,
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.160]  once you understand this there's no going back, once you've taken the red pill there's
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.320]  no going back so let me tell you what else is coming up, we've got the big giant budget
[27:24.320 --> 27:33.680]  in the fight between McConnell and with the Republican leader of the House as well, we're
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.960]  going to be breaking all of that down, we also have a lot of other news on this big
[27:40.960 --> 27:51.000]  super winter storm or what they're calling this winter vortex bomb which we're going
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.280]  to be going over quite a bit here today as well but I wanted before I get into all that
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.160]  and also clips of Trump, boy did he predict what would happen, they were able to throw
[28:02.160 --> 28:06.640]  him out of office, right before he left office we're going to play some of those clips coming
[28:06.640 --> 28:12.040]  up in the last segment of this hour and so much more but before I do that we're going
[28:12.040 --> 28:18.520]  to go to break and I'm going to come back and play a very important clip of a very respected
[28:18.520 --> 28:28.520]  scientist and medical doctor and pathologist, pathologist again decide how people live,
[28:28.520 --> 28:34.960]  how people die and they track what affects the body, coroners you name it, Dr. Ryan
[28:34.960 --> 28:42.280]  Cole and Dale Big Tree on what live blood does when the so called Pfizer and Moderna
[28:42.280 --> 28:47.360]  shots because they're both the same thing are put into the blood and it is unbelievable
[28:47.360 --> 28:52.280]  to watch the mad cow prions, it's what it is, form rapidly, we're going to show you
[28:52.280 --> 28:59.920]  that when we return on the other side, stay with us.
[28:59.920 --> 29:03.520]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.440]  effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years and now
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.080]  with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[29:13.080 --> 29:17.560]  factors it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[29:17.560 --> 29:19.120]  natural male potential.

[32:08.040 --> 32:12.200]  Because they know we're pro-human, they know we're telling the truth, they know we've
[32:12.200 --> 32:17.920]  got their number, they know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[32:17.920 --> 32:22.520]  And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[32:22.520 --> 32:25.760]  stamina, libido energy and immune systems.
[32:25.760 --> 32:31.800]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[32:31.800 --> 32:40.520]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[32:40.520 --> 32:44.480]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[32:44.480 --> 32:47.440]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[32:47.440 --> 32:55.720]  This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at InfoWareStore.com.

[33:00.480 --> 33:26.480]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.480 --> 33:56.160]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to give the phone number out here in just
[33:56.160 --> 34:00.960]  a few minutes, but first I wanted to hit the latest poison injection news and give everybody
[34:00.960 --> 34:04.680]  news alerts on that front so we can save more lives and bring the criminals that did
[34:04.680 --> 34:07.840]  this to justice before they do it again.
[34:07.840 --> 34:13.480]  I've taken a little five minute clip or four minute and a half minute clip, the Dale Big
[34:13.480 --> 34:22.720]  Tree put together with pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole, who is a renowned, very respected medical
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.400]  doctor scientist that studies what affects the body, that's what pathologists do, that's
[34:28.400 --> 34:34.160]  what coroners are, that's what the FBI has in their crime lab, that's who runs their
[34:34.160 --> 34:39.720]  crime lab and they've built their own big lab and Dale Big Tree had him there to take
[34:39.720 --> 34:47.080]  fresh blood and put the mRNA Pfizer-Moderna shot in, it's the exact same shot, just the
[34:47.080 --> 34:54.320]  Moderna's four times stronger, into the blood and it instantly begins to do horrible things,
[34:54.320 --> 35:00.640]  including creating giant protein blobs under a microscope.
[35:00.640 --> 35:06.520]  Now they knew full well what they were doing, they did this at the University of Texas and
[35:06.520 --> 35:21.120]  at the University of Baylor in Waco in 2012, 13, 14, 15 under Obama funding, directed directly
[35:21.120 --> 35:32.120]  by Salici, his name is on the top of the five year study in rats of mRNA coronavirus vaccine
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.040]  that creates spike protein and you can look at the different studies they did but the
[35:37.040 --> 35:43.960]  majority of rats were dead very, very soon, with blood clots all over their bodies.
[35:43.960 --> 35:47.200]  Now a rat obviously doesn't live as long as a human but they're very physiologically
[35:47.200 --> 35:51.720]  similar to us, that's why they do it with rats and pigs, again rats and pigs have the
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.600]  most similar effects as humans, just look it up, you don't believe me, that's why they
[35:55.600 --> 36:01.920]  use them and many of them died in just a few days but almost all of them that survived
[36:01.920 --> 36:10.040]  had their life expectancy cut in half because protein crystals began growing in their tissues
[36:10.040 --> 36:17.640]  particularly in the cardiovascular area because that's where they began to form first.
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.040]  So we know and there's all these other studies out but here it is under a microscope and
[36:22.040 --> 36:26.160]  a bunch of other scientists into the same thing in Spain, they started the shots there
[36:26.160 --> 36:32.200]  two years ago, a few months before us, remember, and top scientists at a major university showed
[36:32.200 --> 36:37.400]  the exact same stuff under a microscope with human blood.
[36:37.400 --> 36:43.200]  They duplicated it with cow blood, pig blood, mice blood, it's all the same and it depends
[36:43.200 --> 36:50.800]  on how your blood reacts but everybody grows a bunch of spike protein, everybody gets implanted
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.480]  and in some people it grows so fast and causes a response and a viral type infection and
[36:56.480 --> 37:02.280]  the heart goes out, the heart goes crazy but not before it beats itself to death especially
[37:02.280 --> 37:07.720]  in young people, it can take up a week of horrible pain to die, they describe microcarditis
[37:07.720 --> 37:15.520]  at that level as like a week long heart attack, that would go in and burn the heart muscles
[37:15.520 --> 37:22.640]  called ablation to try to stop it, now they are knowingly now injecting six month olds
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.120]  and older, we're the only country that's legalized in the world and now they're trying to get
[37:26.120 --> 37:34.640]  the approval for newborn babies, let's go ahead and go to this report with a little
[37:34.640 --> 37:58.840]  intro with Bill Gates and from the movie The Thing, here it is.
[37:58.840 --> 38:02.840]  Is there something to worry about with medicines, that is might some of them have side effects,
[38:02.840 --> 38:09.600]  do we need safety testing, I mean we're taking things that are genetically modified organisms
[38:09.600 --> 38:17.040]  and we're injecting them in little kids arms, we just shoot them right into the vein.
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.920]  You watch the 1980's thing movie and it's actually what the spike protein even looks
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.600]  like that and it goes in and takes over your cell and then makes it start reproducing more
[38:27.600 --> 38:34.080]  of the poison, but it also has interaction with the protein in your blood and creates
[38:34.080 --> 38:42.280]  protein crystals, what causes spongiform encephalopathy or the cause of mad count disease, it's an
[38:42.280 --> 39:05.760]  assimilation of our bodies, in our face, now here's the doctor talking about it, the pathologist.
[39:05.760 --> 39:35.480]  Okay, so we'll first take the normal one, this is the regular without anything on it
[39:35.480 --> 39:41.240]  and you can see little platelet clumps up in here throughout and then a couple of white
[39:41.240 --> 39:46.000]  cells in the background, well that looks pretty decent, like you're going to live forever
[39:46.000 --> 40:07.440]  now, alright let's see what the dermal looks like, so again we'll start kind of out at
[40:07.440 --> 40:30.820]  the end of the Roz IT, again look and see what it looks like, is this is what we have
[40:30.820 --> 40:32.740]  to take it back to the스프续�表示 it to us, okay that looks good, so see you
[40:32.740 --> 40:39.460]  crinkled. But yeah, I mean that whole edge is like bleached. So this is the J&J.
[40:41.460 --> 40:46.820]  That's totally different. It's like a nuclear bomb went off. Yeah, it's disordered, isn't it? And
[40:46.820 --> 40:53.460]  then there's a little more of that stacking, that Roulot here. And again, look at all this clumping
[40:53.460 --> 40:57.940]  here out on the edge of it. You're just, yeah, like you said, like a nuclear bomb went off,
[40:57.940 --> 41:04.180]  it just congealed it. And again, that's not spike. That's just the lipid nanoparticle. So these are
[41:04.180 --> 41:08.980]  becoming more spherical and you're losing that donut in the middle of your red cell. What's
[41:08.980 --> 41:14.180]  happening here is slightly from the outside of the cell in, causing those cells to balloon up
[41:14.180 --> 41:19.380]  slightly because now you got a subtle osmotic shift here. And all of these are supposed to be,
[41:20.500 --> 41:25.860]  again, isotonic. These are supposed to be balanced with the pH of the body. You shouldn't be seeing
[41:25.860 --> 41:34.980]  this kind of reaction. It shouldn't be damaging to the cells of the body right away like this.
[41:36.500 --> 41:41.140]  So here's that first visor. And these were the ones where we just put a drop on and the whole
[41:41.140 --> 41:53.940]  thing just cleared. This is where all that fluid went. And again, like that J&J just caused immediate
[41:53.940 --> 42:03.220]  dispersion and clumping. And those don't look very red to me either. Oh, look at this.
[42:03.220 --> 42:11.140]  Look at those little spikies. Those are called echinocytes. So it instantly changed the pH
[42:11.140 --> 42:17.700]  interior. These are little blobs of protein on the membrane of the red cell because the red cell
[42:17.700 --> 42:22.100]  has involuted and then those proteins on the surface, they don't have room to go. It's like
[42:22.100 --> 42:28.100]  flattening a ball of some sort. And it's kind of all baggy. But, you know, so all these little
[42:28.100 --> 42:32.020]  fingers that it's not spike protein. So that's another myth I want mine to spoil. I mean, it's
[42:32.020 --> 42:35.300]  crazy because it's done it to so many. We didn't see that on the other ones. We didn't see it on
[42:35.300 --> 42:41.780]  the other ones. So that's fascinating. You can watch this video in its entirety right now at
[42:41.780 --> 42:47.540]  band.bio. And they get into it more. It's not just creating the spike protein. It's collapsing
[42:47.540 --> 42:54.180]  yourselves, making their own protein globs. It dissolves yourselves into protein globs. It is a
[42:54.180 --> 43:01.060]  death shot. It is to murder you slowly and painfully. I want you to remember two words.

[47:53.460 --> 47:58.500]  Done three days of free for all. We're going to do the first round of first time callers

[48:09.300 --> 48:15.060]  I want to hear from you. The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[48:15.060 --> 48:24.740]  877-789-2539. 877-789. Alex, we'll get you on the air. We're doing a really good job
[48:24.740 --> 48:30.660]  taking phone calls. We took about 30 phone calls yesterday. I'd like to take 50 today
[48:32.180 --> 48:35.860]  because we just get so many neat people. But that means no matter how amazing you are,
[48:35.860 --> 48:40.820]  and it's hard to hang up on some of these calls. I got to give you two minutes and I got to give
[48:40.820 --> 48:47.220]  you a 30-second comment. Plus, I want to intersperse a lot of news. Let me finish up with that very
[48:47.220 --> 48:52.980]  conservative analysis by a very well-known pathologist that he's never seen anything instantly
[48:52.980 --> 48:58.820]  coagulate blood and make the cells clump in on each other into protein blobs. But that's what
[48:58.820 --> 49:05.300]  the studies actually show it does. If you are unlucky enough for them to put it into a capillary
[49:05.300 --> 49:11.060]  bed or, God forbid, a small vein or artery, you're going to be dying probably that day
[49:12.180 --> 49:17.700]  because it's going to go straight in and create a massive clot before the local cells absorb it.
[49:18.980 --> 49:23.860]  And that's what the studies show. It all depends on where it gets in. And we know it passes
[49:23.860 --> 49:29.940]  the blood-brain barrier because they put these patented lipids or these synthetic oil particles
[49:29.940 --> 49:36.820]  over the spike proteins to get them into the cells. So a little newsflash. If they get something
[49:36.820 --> 49:44.020]  into a cell, they can get it into your brain. And that's what's happening. And the studies show
[49:44.020 --> 49:49.620]  women get more strokes. It seems to get into women's brains worse and it tends to hit men's
[49:49.620 --> 49:53.860]  hearts worse. But it's also killing a lot of women via the heart and the lungs. And what did the rat
[49:53.860 --> 49:59.700]  in my studies show? Annihilation of the heart tissue, the arteries, the veins starting with the
[49:59.700 --> 50:08.500]  smaller capillaries. Annihilation of the heart tissue. Simply incredible. And then we have
[50:09.220 --> 50:16.340]  empty, suit, horrible, just disgusting people like Sean Penn, the warmonger,
[50:17.620 --> 50:22.100]  who called for nuclear war. I played the clip a month ago. He said, told CNN, well,
[50:22.100 --> 50:25.300]  we got to be ready to have nuclear war. Can't have nuclear war on the table. We need to go
[50:25.300 --> 50:30.020]  ahead and nuke Russia. I got an idea, buddy. If you're so into nuking yourself, how about you
[50:30.020 --> 50:34.660]  go jump off a cliff or go buy a wood chipper and climb into it, okay? I don't want to die
[50:34.660 --> 50:39.860]  on a nuclear war. You piece of dangerous garbage. You little satanic monster.
[50:41.940 --> 50:48.500]  And he's back at it again. Super relevant actor, Sean Penn thinks, it's a joke, not being vaccinated
[50:48.500 --> 50:53.860]  against COVID-19 is criminal and anti-vaxxers should stay home and not have jobs. Yes, there's video
[50:53.860 --> 51:01.140]  of it. No, Chomsky shamed himself saying the same thing. We're taking genetically modified
[51:01.140 --> 51:06.660]  organisms and we're injecting them into children's veins, not knowing what they'll do. Bill Gates,
[51:08.340 --> 51:13.780]  funeral home, sounding the alarm, massive increase in deaths. Yeah, look at the obituaries in small
[51:13.780 --> 51:18.900]  towns. You speak three or four names. Now it's three pages. This cartoon says it right. I'm glad
[51:18.900 --> 51:23.300]  you got your booster. Why are you having a heart attack? Yes, it's climate change. And by the way,
[51:24.340 --> 51:35.380]  they came out last week. Canada did and said people that don't take the shots are 76% more
[51:35.380 --> 51:39.860]  likely to have car wrecks with no evidence. They just made up some asinine sounding thing
[51:39.860 --> 51:45.060]  to scramble your brain. That's psychological warfare. And the Democrats came out yesterday and
[51:45.060 --> 51:52.020]  said black people are getting more COVID because of racism, because it stresses them out. I mean,
[51:52.020 --> 51:59.700]  give me a break, folks. No, black people on average need more bottom in D three because
[52:00.900 --> 52:05.380]  they need more sunlight to produce it. That's a scientific fact. Your skin produces it. And
[52:05.380 --> 52:09.460]  especially black folks living in these urban canyons in these big cities aren't getting any
[52:09.460 --> 52:13.540]  sunlight and no one's telling them to get vitamin D. So that's why they're twice as likely to die.
[52:14.260 --> 52:17.700]  And I guess it is kind of racism because the globalists make sure the media won't tell them.
[52:17.700 --> 52:20.020]  So I guess the headline is kind of true, isn't it? Isn't that sick?
[52:22.900 --> 52:28.260]  And it just continues on from there. We've got a lot of news on that front that I'll get to later.
[52:28.260 --> 52:40.740]  But I wanted to just remind people that this war is ongoing and this war is extremely real and
[52:40.740 --> 52:46.580]  extremely serious. And as angry as I got at Trump going along with the poison shot, the globalist
[52:46.580 --> 52:50.980]  hate him and tried to set him up on January 6th and stole the election from him because he was
[52:50.980 --> 52:57.700]  actually trying to be the president. So here's a clip of Trump in 2020 talking about what would
[52:57.700 --> 53:02.740]  happen if Biden was able to steal the election and has it not all come true here at us.
[53:02.740 --> 53:08.420]  They want to have open borders. People will pour in like they have been for years, just pour in.
[53:08.420 --> 53:13.460]  They could be criminals. They could be murderers. They can be rapists, drug addicts. They can be
[53:13.460 --> 53:19.140]  drug dealers. They want to pour in. They want to have open borders. And Joe Biden has said he
[53:19.140 --> 53:35.060]  wants to take the wall down. I don't even believe it. I don't even believe it.
[53:35.060 --> 53:47.620]  And for radio listeners, it then shows the montage of the border being completely
[53:48.580 --> 53:54.100]  totally open as a massive human smuggler.
[53:57.460 --> 54:02.100]  Now the Democrats have got more needy desperate people coming to a nation that's already falling
[54:02.100 --> 54:08.580]  apart and doesn't have jobs. They can feed off of and control sign up for welfare and have vote.
[54:12.420 --> 54:20.020]  It's the U.N. plan to take down the Western world. It's the replacement migration operation.
[54:23.540 --> 54:29.220]  All right, we are loading the phone lines up with a ton of callers. Robert, Agent Ike, Michael,
[54:29.220 --> 54:35.380]  George, Robbie, Dave, and many others. Your calls are coming up and we start the next hour,
[54:35.380 --> 54:42.180]  interspersed with a ton of news and key breaking information. But I want to just thank the listeners
[54:42.180 --> 54:47.460]  for really coming through in the last few days. InfoWars has gone back into the red. We are
[54:47.460 --> 54:52.580]  battling to stay on air. We have a plan to stay on air. Two years of appeals. We've just got to get
[54:52.580 --> 55:00.660]  through those. We've got to have the funds. And we're so close to being in the black that at
[55:00.660 --> 55:06.100]  current purchase rates, people supporting more, if people just keep purchasing like you are for
[55:06.100 --> 55:11.140]  another week, we'll be in the black. And then if you just continue on with just a little bit more
[55:11.140 --> 55:15.860]  purchasing, we'll stay on air. Plus, we've got products you need. So this is an absolute no
[55:15.860 --> 55:20.100]  brainer, something you need to decide. But I can't make you decide. You've got to decide
[55:20.100 --> 55:23.220]  to go to infowars.com and get products that are going to blow you away.
[55:24.420 --> 55:27.860]  Now, the easiest product to blow you away and get everybody it results
[55:28.500 --> 55:33.940]  is X2 and X3. That's all sold out. It takes two weeks to kick in almost everybody's
[55:35.140 --> 55:39.140]  iodine deficient. And most iodine nobody else really has the type of iodine we have. Nobody
[55:39.140 --> 55:44.260]  got atomic pure, real iodine, pharmaceutical grade. It'll be in a few months, hopefully.
[55:44.260 --> 55:47.220]  But we've got a bunch of other stuff that will empower your life and change your life as well.
[55:47.220 --> 55:54.660]  And again, it takes weeks for these products to kick in because they're real folks. They don't
[55:55.380 --> 55:58.180]  just hit you in 10 minutes. I mean, some of the products that have natural,
[55:58.180 --> 56:02.820]  healthy stimulants in them do. But even Shroom Max takes two or three days to kick in,
[56:02.820 --> 56:06.580]  and it's a natural system that doesn't use stimulants to empower the brain.
[56:06.580 --> 56:14.580]  That's the new product, infowars.com. But what takes a couple of weeks to kick in is
[56:14.580 --> 56:19.780]  Real Red Pill Plus. Now, Real Red Pill Plus does have natural stimulant from Yerma Mate and other
[56:19.780 --> 56:24.740]  things. That's great. So you'll feel that in 30 minutes. But what it really has is not just
[56:24.740 --> 56:29.300]  vitamins and minerals, but a bunch of key trace elements that are known in studies to be needed
[56:29.300 --> 56:33.140]  with the regular essentials to get it into your cells and have the full effect. And then it's
[56:33.140 --> 56:40.100]  got the preglinone in it that has naturally made the body and that is the precursor to all hormones.
[56:40.100 --> 56:49.860]  And this is what was prescribed for over 100 years until big pharma realized that they couldn't make
[56:49.860 --> 56:54.660]  money. So they stopped having it be prescription and it became over the counter more than 20 years
[56:54.660 --> 57:01.220]  ago, but nobody tells you to take it. Preglinone is powerful. And when you take it with all these
[57:01.220 --> 57:06.340]  other ingredients, it's insane. But it takes two weeks of taking it every day on averages
[57:06.340 --> 57:10.820]  and start seeing the results. What does preglinone do? It's associated with brain function, all your
[57:10.820 --> 57:17.220]  cells, libido, energy, stamina. If you don't have preglinone, look it up. It's associated with
[57:17.220 --> 57:24.020]  accelerated aging. The Real Red Pill has been sold out for over two years. It's back in stock 50%
[57:24.020 --> 57:29.460]  off at infowarstore.com. We're also selling out a vitamin mineral fusion. All the vitamins,
[57:29.460 --> 57:32.900]  all the minerals give me no asses. Everybody's be taking this old and young, but especially

[57:38.180 --> 57:43.860]  fact it's selling out at infowarstore.com. Find that and so much more at infowarstore.com like

[58:04.100 --> 58:09.540]  bestsellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well. We've gone right to
[58:09.540 --> 58:14.980]  the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of
[58:14.980 --> 58:22.340]  retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names. And not just under one name,
[58:22.340 --> 58:27.220]  they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have
[58:27.220 --> 58:33.620]  put out. The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about Payne
[58:33.620 --> 58:40.740]  MD. We're talking about HGH max boost. We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are
[58:40.740 --> 58:45.780]  incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare
[58:45.780 --> 58:51.220]  provider because they're so powerful. Get them at infowarstore.com. Look, it's not hype when you've
[58:51.220 --> 58:56.260]  delivered and Info Wars has been the tip of spear against tyranny. And when it comes to products
[58:56.260 --> 59:02.180]  we sell to funder operation, they're just like our news and information. They are powerful and they
[59:02.180 --> 59:07.300]  change the world. The real red pill plus one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been
[59:07.300 --> 59:14.260]  sold out because of supply chain breakdowns. It's finally back at stock or 50% off infowarstore.com.
[59:14.260 --> 59:17.620]  Now, the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it,
[59:17.620 --> 59:24.980]  but this sucker is amazing. Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[59:24.980 --> 59:30.660]  Every one of these will supercharge your day and everything you do. Just look into the preglonone

[59:43.860 --> 59:49.140]  red pill as you're going to get. Red pill plus 50% off infowarstore.com.
[59:49.140 --> 59:56.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:11.860]  All right, folks, I don't want to do it to you, but I got to do it. I'm not going to hear the whole
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:16.900]  20 something minute speech with all the disgusting standing ovations, but I'm going to roll a few
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:24.740]  minutes of President Zelensky and his little military outfit up there addressing the political
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:29.620]  horrors we call Congress people. Then we're going to go to break. Some stations join us and we'll
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:34.340]  go right to your phone calls for everybody that's patiently holding like Jordan and Jonathan and
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.540]  Michael and Dave and Rob and Jerome and Michael and Agent Ike and Robert and everybody else.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.620]  In the order your calls are received, we're coming right out of the break and going right to your
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.020]  calls because again, I love the wildcard nature of the great points and great angles and great
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:53.700]  topics that you bring up. It's wide open phones on any subject you want to raise, but it's this
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:01:00.340]  feeling of like just walking into a nightmare that we're already at war with Russia. It's public.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.740]  Our government's helping send missiles into Russia. It's escalating completely out of control.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.460]  Henry Kissinger says we're on the verge of nuclear war. I agree with him and we're still just giggling
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.220]  and laughing and clapping and marching into this. I mean, even if you think the war is a good thing,
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:19.380]  people shouldn't be acting like it's a fricking rave or something. Everybody's on ecstasy.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.180]  I mean, it just shows how empty this power structure is and how it wants to be seen
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:29.620]  as like movie stars or something. Zelensky is a movie star. Zelensky is a puppet. Here's a few
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:42.420]  minutes of him. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's too much for me. All this for our great people.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.820]  Thank you so much.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:02:01.860]  Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:12.180]  justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in all our cities, in each and every
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:19.940]  family, I hope my wars of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:30.660]  Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine,
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:38.500]  Madam Speaker. You bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:43.460]  Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:57.780]  Great privilege to be here. Dear members of the Congress, representatives of both parties
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:09.220]  who also visited Kyiv, esteemed congressmen and senators from both parties who will visit Ukraine,
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:27.700]  and who are in the future, dear representatives of the Aspera.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:47.780]  Present in this chamber and spread across the country, dear journalists, it's a great honor
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:04:00.260]  for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all odds and doom
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:12.740]  and gloom, scenarios Ukraine didn't fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:22.740]  Thank you.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:35.540]  And it gives me good reason to share with you our first, first joint victory.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.100]  We defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:49.460]  All right folks, he goes on, he goes on to demand more money and says this is not charity,
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:54.980]  basically give me more money. We'll be right back. Stay with us with your phone calls.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:04.260]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.300]  and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:12.340]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:16.660]  feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.820]  to boost our natural male potential. These products work great for women as well.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Payne MD. It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:31.460]  We got it discounted for 40% off m4store.com under the label m4s platinum.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:37.460]  We've also got ACH max boost. Read all about it. Be very safe with it. I take only a fraction of
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.380]  what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night. Don't do it during the day.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:47.700]  1776 testosterone boost. Totally incredible. Go read about them. Learn more about them at
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:55.620]  m4store.com in the m4s platinum section and you get 40% off on these already best selling
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:11.060]  products under the new name m4s platinum.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:42.580]  Well, we have all lived to see it. We are now inside the new world order takeover phase
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:46.660]  of the planet. They're coming after our farms, they're coming after our factories,
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.420]  they're coming after our children, they're coming after our guns, they're coming after our cows,
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:54.260]  they're coming after the combustion engine, they're coming after our privacy, they're coming
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:59.220]  after our free speech, they're coming after our due process, they're coming after it all
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:03.780]  like tyrants have done over and over again. What history shows, if we bow and roll over to it,
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:08.820]  it'll be far worse. If we stand up and say no to it and offer the American way
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:15.860]  and promote good decent Christian values, the public will realize that and will reject this
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:21.140]  tyranny. We will win. Do not let them demoralize you. Do not let them break you. Okay, I want to open
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:26.580]  the phones up and take a ton of calls now interspersed with a lot of news that we haven't gotten to yet,
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:31.620]  but the callers bring up the news. We've got Robert, we've got so many others we're gonna
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:37.300]  be getting to here in just a moment. I noticed that almost no one has called in, which is fine,
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:44.900]  it's open phones about Zelensky demanding hundreds of billions more, not just 45 billion,
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:50.500]  and saying it's not charity and the US greenlighting strikes inside Russia that have been going on
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:56.740]  for a month longer than that really. And how dangerous this is and how do we get out of this
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:01.620]  and how do we stop this because again, I've laid this out a lot, but I don't like Russia invading.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:06.100]  I said I thought it was a trap and I knew that US forces were over there and I knew there were
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.860]  a lot of high tech weapons over there and I knew the West was going to coordinate the Ukrainian
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:14.900]  weapons and the coordination that the West has is way beyond anything the Russians can even imagine
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:24.580]  with all these AI-grown controlled, robot-controlled systems, autonomous systems. So I understand
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:29.700]  that the globalist overthrew Ukraine nine years ago. I understand that they were probing into Russia.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:37.300]  I understand they manipulated Putin into going in and I blame George Soros and Bill Clinton
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.820]  and Victoria Newlin, all the rest of them, but regardless of what side of this you're on,
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:49.620]  this is bad for the planet and bad for our children's future and is incredibly costly
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:56.340]  while our nation goes bankrupt. And so I'll also ask the callers, callers that calling after this
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:02.980]  raft of folks, how do you think we stop this? What do we do and where do you think this is going?
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:07.620]  Because it just keeps escalating. There's only a few steps left until all out nuclear war.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:16.980]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539. The phones are loaded right now, but as you hear each caller hang up,
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.700]  that's your chance to call in. I'd like to get some calls on that subject as well.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.580]  You know, I don't mind talking about Elon Musk. He's very interesting.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.780]  But at the same time, he kind of sucks the oxygen out of the room when I go to infowars.com
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:33.380]  or anywhere else and half the stories are about him. And again, I talk about Elon Musk too,
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:39.060]  but to me, the war and the open borders and the dollar devaluation, for me, that's paramount.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.620]  But let's talk about Elon Musk. Robert and Florida, let's talk about Elon Musk. Go ahead.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:49.380]  Morning, Alex. How are you? All right, brother. I'm really worried about all of our futures.
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:56.260]  Exactly. Yes. A couple of points that I wanted to make. Elon Musk, I think, is evil destroying
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:06.980]  evil. I don't think he's any good for us. Yeah, I got what you said at the start there,
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:12.340]  then you're fine. A little bit of a problem. Sorry about that. Elon Musk, I think, is getting
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:18.740]  people to trust him for Starlink. Evil destroys evil. I don't think he's going to do any good
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.660]  for this country. And if he does, everyone knows nothing's going to happen. If the
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:29.620]  GOP doesn't go after everybody and do anything, we all know it's just another thing to get us
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:36.580]  sidetracked on what's really happening. Another thing I want to promote is your testosterone.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:41.780]  I actually am 47 years old. I've been feeling like crap. I actually went and got my testosterone
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:46.660]  levels checked. I'm not even on the charts. I recommend anybody over the age of 40, especially
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:52.660]  men. Go out and get your stuff checked. It makes you feel great. By Alex's supplement,
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:58.980]  the problem that I'm having on my account at your website, I can't change my address. I moved
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:03.060]  from Washington State to Florida. If I order products, I think they're going to get shipped
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.380]  to Washington State. I don't know who to talk to. I've called. I've sent emails. I can't get anybody
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.660]  to respond back. I'll tell you what you do. Give me your name and number right now, and I promise
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:18.980]  you that you will get a call in the next hour. Perfect. Get his name and number, folks. I'm
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.500]  going to give it to customer service right now, and it will get handled, sir. In fact,
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:27.780]  give him my phone number. Give him my cell phone number. Give that call or my cell phone number.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.220]  I'm going to make sure this happens, but also give me your number, sir. I'm going to make damn
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:38.740]  sure that happens. Continuing. Here, ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about testosterone.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:44.740]  The testosterone of somebody in the 1950s was about three times what it is now in the studies
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:50.500]  for an average 40-year-old. Now, why is that? Why is the sperm count down over 90% in some areas
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:56.980]  on average? 67%. Big studies on that. Look it up. Why is this happening? It's the chemicals in the
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:03.300]  food and the water, ladies and gentlemen, and the high-soil diet is able to go in and make your
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.460]  body think you're menopausal as a man, and men don't have menopausal the same way as a woman,
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:12.100]  but you can trick your body to lower your levels. And I got to tell you, the most important thing
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:20.180]  anybody can do is naturally boost testosterone. James Cameron just came out and said he thinks
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.900]  we should just basically have wore on testosterone and remove testosterone, and that's why they want
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.700]  to give little boys puberty blockers and the rest of it because they don't want us to become men.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:35.940]  And there are so many ways to naturally boost your testosterone level that are out there or to
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:41.940]  get your body to turn back on. And I would just encourage people before you go the medical route
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:48.340]  to do what I've done and to go the herbal and supplement round, and it is dramatic what goes
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:54.500]  on with exercise. Now, that said, everybody needs to drink lots of water. Everybody needs to be taken
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.660]  aspirin every day, especially, and I'm not your medical doctor, that's my opinion, if you're
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.980]  40 or more, but I've looked at all the studies. If you're not drinking enough water and there's
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:07.860]  all this spike protein out there, you would have taken the shots. Testosterone will produce more
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:13.620]  blood, will produce more platelets, and will make your blood thicker. Okay. And so you need to be
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.260]  taking aspirin, you need to be drinking a lot of water. And when I say that, I tell, I'm pointing
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:23.140]  it myself here because I remember to drink 15 glasses of water a day, just get used to it, enjoy it.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.540]  You want more and more water, the more water you drink. When you don't drink enough, your body
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.540]  protects you and makes you think you don't need it, and your thirst actually goes down.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:39.860]  Just start pounding water. And I would take a 200 milligram aspirin every night when you go to sleep,
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:45.140]  and it is just so important. I went and had my heart checked, and I'm overweight and super stressed.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:50.340]  I had my heart checked, had like 80-something blood tests done about three, four months ago,
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:54.900]  and they said, you've got the testosterone of a 30-year-old, you've got the heart of a 30-year-old,
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.700]  your blood pressure is perfect. What are you doing? And I'm like, I'll exercise a little bit,
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:05.300]  I take these supplements, and I try not to eat fast food. Everybody gets busy and you do it sometimes.
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:09.860]  So I'm certainly no pantheon of health and have all the answers, but I do look at all the news and
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:17.700]  the studies and talk to the experts, and yes. 1776 testosterone boost is an already number
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:22.660]  one best-selling brand made by a pharmaceutical company for over the counter. This is our name.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.260]  They said, you can private label it. We don't do this for most people, but the owner is a listener.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:34.340]  And so this sells for $100 all day in stores, has very expensive compounds in it, and it,
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.180]  so for the price you're getting it at $59, you cannot beat it.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:42.660]  Now, does it compete without the power? Does it compete with supermodel? You know,
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:46.100]  they're all different formulas, different compounds that are known to do the same thing,
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.500]  and different products are going to be better for different people.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:55.860]  Everybody's different, folks. Like, most people, you know, they give people Ritalin who are hyperactive
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.420]  and it burns them out and makes people, you know, less hyperactive.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.980]  So most people get depressed if they drink alcohol. It's depressing.
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.740]  I drink alcohol as the opposite effect. It has like an emfetamin effect, and they know medically
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:13.940]  that about five, six percent of people are like that. The point is, it's different strokes for
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:21.860]  different people, all right? And I'm telling you, testosterone boost is amazing. 1776
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:27.940]  testosterone boost is the InfoWars platinum line. I'm going to go back to your calls,
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.420]  but I'm going to make this point that I'm done plugging. HCHmax is incredibly strong,
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.860]  and it isn't advertised as a sleep aid, but what it does, rebooting your cells,
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:41.140]  makes most people super tired. So for the deepest, craziest sleep I've ever had,
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:46.820]  take HCHboostmax, be ready to sleep like 10 hours, and only take about a quarter of the first dose.
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:53.220]  Listen to me. This is the top rated HCHboost on the market in the United States for a reason,

[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:04.340]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:10.580]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:18.500]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:24.420]  have done. And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.

[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.420]  All right, we are back. I was a bad boy. Santa's gonna leave
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.780]  coal under the Christmas tree here in my stocking.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:28.740]  I guess Grompus is gonna come visit me. I didn't take one phone call last segment. Let's
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:35.620]  do better this segment. Agent Ike in New York. Thanks for calling. Hi, Alex. Sorry. I'm all right,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:39.860]  brother. Go ahead. Thanks for calling. Well, first I got a comment and then two questions.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:45.140]  My first comment is I thought it'd be a good idea to have the info warriors and yourself
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:51.380]  take our vitamins and minerals and pills before every episode starts right at the beginning.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.980]  I thought that'd be kind of a clever idea. You know, it is because here's what happens when I
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:59.380]  remember to take all the supplements and my aspirin. I'm so healthy and feel great. And then
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:03.140]  sometimes I'll take them for a couple months religiously and forget like two months goes by
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:07.220]  and it's like, why can't I remember? And it's like, oh, my wife took the lazy Susan
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:12.580]  off the kitchen table because it's cluttered. And so I just, I fight with her about that,
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:16.020]  about keeping it out on the table. She goes, can't you remember over here by the cupboard?
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.780]  Can I put it in the cupboard? And I just, I can't remember if it's not there. So I think I'm gonna
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:26.420]  put all my supplements on my bathroom counter. Well, we could do a live on air or be like a
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:32.260]  sacrament. You know, it's so important to do this. People really should. What else is on your mind,
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:38.580]  brother? First, I was wondering then your thoughts not looking for financial advice, but being that
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:45.700]  economy is the way it is, selling the 401k, is that a good idea to try to take advantage of
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:50.020]  the money that we have now to use to our advantage? You know, even the head of the Federal Reserve
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:53.940]  who's running all this and is a bad guy said he doesn't know what's going to happen with interest
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:22:00.420]  rates increases. And so things are so volatile and so crazy in the bond market and the stock market
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:06.020]  that I really cannot give you an honest answer. I think the most important thing is to be healthy,
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:09.220]  to have a relationship with God, to have good friends and family you take care of.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:15.860]  And I certainly can give my own personal health advice, not because I follow it very well,
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.340]  but because I study it constantly and know what the reality is. But when it comes to financials,
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:25.940]  man, I mean, I, you know, it's six one way happened. I mean, like, do you want to buy defense stocks?
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.060]  Do you want to buy stocks that are corrupt like Pfizer and stuff? I mean, clearly,
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.780]  if they maintain control, they're going to only get more powerful and more money.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:41.860]  But if they do tank, then you'll be screwed. Plus, would you want to invest there? Look at big tech,
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:47.540]  their stocks are basically all down except for Apple. And so we're in a very, very volatile time.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:53.460]  They've raised interest rates to lower inflation. It's not working. So we're getting inflation and
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:58.180]  higher interest rates and a slowing economy. That's supposedly impossible until the 70s.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.580]  They'd never had before. They call it stagnflation. So I got to be completely honest with you.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:07.860]  Things are deteriorating. And if I wasn't doing this as a talk show host, and if I had the money
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:14.260]  to long term just disappear, I would move to the most rural middle of the nowhere area that has
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:21.300]  a lot of farmers and a diversity of farming and ranching and a very highly dense Amish population
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:25.860]  nearby because no matter what happens, you can trade with them. And I would just absolutely
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:34.180]  live down a dirt road behind a hill in a shack. I mean, if I was not going to stay here on air,
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:40.100]  I would exit society immediately. I mean, because I have children and I care about them.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:45.860]  But instead, I'm staying on air in the hopes we can mitigate how bad this is as the best action.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:53.460]  But if I was not on air, I would be exiting society and going low profile as quickly as possible.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:24:00.580]  Right. And my last question is just wondering is any more information about the weaponization of
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:07.220]  the IRS? They've hired what is it? 70 something thousand new people to quote target average people,
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:12.260]  even though average people only pay about a third of the total taxes. And so they want total
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.220]  harassment to bankrupt the average person to make you give up and go on the social credit score
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:22.100]  universal basic income, which is just welfare for everybody. But it comes with societal strings
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:30.180]  attached. So you get I mean, they just gave a 25% budget increase the ATF. They just gave
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:36.420]  basically a doubling of funding the IRS. Every agency they can to squeeze the American people,
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:40.900]  they're basically given steroids right now. So yeah, I mean, I think you answered your own
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:45.860]  question. It's already weaponized. Everything we saw under lowest learner, I think it's about to get
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:51.460]  three or four times worse. Okay. Well, thank you, sir. Thanks for taking my call. Thank you. You
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.980]  know, I wish I could give you more specifics, but I just cannot lie to you and tell you that I know
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:25:02.340]  what to do about the stock market or your 401ks. I'll just say this. If I had stocks and bonds
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:08.820]  and a bunch of money, I would be completely diversified. I would have crypto, the Bitcoin,
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:14.340]  I would have gold and silver, I would have some of the best performing farming stocks,
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:20.340]  I would have high tech stocks, I would have nano tech stocks, I'd have big pharma stocks,
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:26.500]  I'd have defense stocks. But I just morally and I'm not on some high horse, I just feel so bad
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:32.020]  being connected to anything that's doing evil that even though most of what Pfizer does is good,
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.580]  but that one thing they do super evil, you can't be involved with it. But I'm not going to sit there
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:41.300]  and blame or judge people. If they're making money off the system and then fighting the system with
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:47.300]  the money, that's up to you to make that equation. But it's a very complex equation and it's up to
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:53.780]  each person to make it. But I am just not enough of a financial expert on the wide spectrum of money.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.860]  I do know how central banking works. I do know how fractional reserve banking works. I do know
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.020]  about derivatives. I do know about all the pump and dump scams. I do know how the ultra rich give
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:06.420]  themselves unlimited money that pass us on the debt and the and the devaluation. I know how
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:12.180]  the scam works. But to try to pretend that I can sit here and pick winners for people. I mean,
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:16.820]  here's an example. Joe Rogan told me six months before it hit the news that he'd done a contract
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.780]  with Spotify, but not to tell anybody. And I didn't didn't tell my wife didn't tell my neighbors.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.900]  And I mean, I knew that their stock would explode. And it basically went up 60 70%
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.700]  in the week after he did that. So if I would have done that, but I didn't do it,
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:37.940]  because I've made a decision not to get involved. And there's also another thing. They'll if I have
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:43.700]  a crooked toenail, they're gonna put me in prison. And so in my position, I learned a lot of insider
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:49.220]  knowledge. And so if I use that knowledge, it really becomes a form of insider trading. Now,
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:54.980]  Congress passed a law where they can insider trade so that I wouldn't be tempted. I mean, look,
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:27:01.860]  here's the deal. I don't like to go to topless bars because I'm attracted to women. And I'd
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:06.100]  probably leave with one, not mad at guys that go to them. I'm not judging you do what you want.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:11.220]  I stay out of topless bars because I don't want to cheat on my wife. You know, it's like putting
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:16.740]  a dog in a butcher shop with a bunch of meat hanging off the walls. But it's the same thing when it
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.780]  comes to stocks and all the rest of it, I just stay out of it. Not because I'm saying it's overtly
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.220]  evil. It's just that once I got involved in that, I would obsess on it. I'd be very successful at it.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:33.860]  I know every facet of it. Instead, I've just stayed away from it. I look at the 35,000 foot view.
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.540]  I don't really study the view at two inches away when it comes to those things. And I'm just being
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:44.100]  honest, folks. I'm completely honest. All right, I got to one call that segment. I'm out of control.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:50.500]  I'm back to the old Alex here. But it's going to stop. I'm going to have them fix a shock collar
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:54.980]  on me. I'm joking. But if I don't take five calls the next segment and five the next,
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:28:00.580]  I'm going to have big Scott Bronson, the producer coming here and punch me right in the nose. How
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:05.940]  about that? Well, we'll get to your calls. But it's hard to answer complex questions like that easily.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:13.140]  So David, Virginia. And then Michael, your calls are straight ahead. Please remember,
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:19.620]  there's a lot of news I'm not covering because we're taking your calls. I had one of the crew
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:23.700]  members asked, why aren't you covering all the Democrats that just got busted being pedos? And
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.780]  I said, well, I mean, I'd be on air all day every day if we covered who was being busted
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:33.780]  being pedos on a daily basis. I mean, my goodness. But yes, I do have those pedo articles. I have
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:40.820]  churches everywhere, desecrating Christ, the LGBT movement. And so I'll hit that next hour
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:48.980]  as promised. But right now we're taking your phone calls. We'll be right back on the other side.

[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:06.660]  years ago. Cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:13.620]  winter because of something called vapors. The associated these poisonous vapors with cold
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:18.980]  weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people. What was
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:26.740]  killing people was a lack of vitamin D three. You see the sun via your skin helps your body
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:32.660]  produce vitamin D three, but if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D three
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.820]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:41.540]  over. So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin

[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:05.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:16.100]  I'm going right back to your calls from the election show, but first a little excerpt of
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.860]  Zelensky and his little dictator military outfit last night being celebrated.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:24.900]  Saying it's not charity to give him money that they'll fight the war, but the US is fighting
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:30.580]  the war and is helping coordinate the attacks. And so now Americans are being targeted by Russia
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:37.140]  with nuclear weapons. So everything he says here is again a fraud that that Ukraine is fighting
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:42.820]  the war. No, the globalists are empowering Ukraine and they overthrew the government nine years ago
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:49.060]  and started the ongoing war against Russia that triggered this. That's the facts. Here's Zelensky.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:57.460]  I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. Ukraine never asked the American
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:06.580]  soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:15.620]  operate American tanks and planes. It pause back in five seconds. He's on record asking for
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:21.860]  NATO to come in. He's on record asking for troops. He's on record. Just everything he says is a lie.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:31.220]  Go back to this guy. Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:39.220]  of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:49.060]  and planes themselves. Yay, let's have one of the Russians in a Slavic Civil War. Yay.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.620]  Having a standing ovation for that.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.780]  You know they hate our military. Give them poison shots.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:05.060]  Pause again. Back it up. Our military is on record level food stamps right now.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:09.220]  But oh, we've got 150 million for Ukraine. Continue.
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:26.580]  Financial assistance is also critically important, and I would like to thank you.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:34.340]  Thank you very much. Thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:43.620]  and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It's an investment
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:49.620]  in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:58.420]  He's banned his political parties, all his opposition, all other parties, banned the oldest
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:06.900]  church in the country. It's just mind-blowing. Everybody wants me to talk about the Kerry Lake
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.700]  trial of election fraud going on, and yeah, they put on total evidence of it. I'll get to it next
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:15.700]  hour, but we already knew what happened day one. In all the Republican precincts, they gave them
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:21.940]  19-inch ballots so that they would then go through and not work, or if they did, they were realigned
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:27.860]  and voted in many cases for Democrats. Then they sent the Republican votes to their central
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:32.660]  tabulation centers to finish their magic. They stole the election, period. Of course they did.
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.420]  All right, let's go to your phone calls. David Virginia, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:44.100]  Hey, Alex. Welcome. The federal government has been involved in weather modification for 75 years,
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:51.300]  and they admit it in U.S. Senate documents. There's the U.S. Senate document, the Committee on
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:58.900]  Commerce, Science, and Transportation, United States Senate May 1978, which says in Chapter 5
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:05.620]  at the beginning, quote, the federal government has been involved for over 30 years in a number of
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:15.060]  aspects of weather modification, and they admit on page 402 of this document some of the damages
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:21.380]  that this weather modification is doing. For example, Franklin County, Pennsylvania suffered
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:27.940]  crop production losses of 50 million. East Coast rainfall was reduced by 30 percent,
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:35.060]  emphysema tripled, cancer increased, losses in agriculture and related industries were in the
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:40.340]  billions. Forest trees and orchards are dying, and there is damage to the atmosphere.
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:46.100]  And there's also a UN treaty about the weather weapons 1979, and all the evidence shows we are
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:51.220]  under weather war attack right now. Two years ago, they said once in a generation, now another
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:57.300]  once in a generation storm hitting as we speak. I'm right, and the reason I brought this up is
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:02.900]  I think you need to get Dane Wiginton on your program to explain how the current event is being
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:08.660]  engineered so that your listeners will understand that this is not an act of God, this is an act
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:15.380]  of criminal weather warfare. I totally agree. Let's get Dane Wiginton on tomorrow. So if we can get
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:21.060]  him on, we'll get him on sometime soon. Great points. Thank you so much. Let's talk to the next
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:29.700]  caller. Let's talk to Robbie in Florida. Robbie, thank you. Hey, Alex. Well, I originally intended
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:34.980]  to call in about the vaccine long story short. I have two family members that are mid-aged men,
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:42.740]  and athletic. They mysteriously grew blood clots after the vaccine. You know, they were told by
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:48.900]  their doctors they have blood clots, but what's that matter when you're on the verge of nuclear war?
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:54.340]  I remember you predicted the invasion of Ukraine before the war kicked off in
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:39:00.900]  February. Do you anticipate any type of major offensive by Russia or NATO in 2023?
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:06.340]  Oh, yeah. There's a good chance it'll go to theater area nuclear war, perhaps full nuclear war.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.900]  There's a good chance Putin's going to triple down and do it, launch an invasion out of Belarus
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:17.140]  from the north because Kiev is only 50 miles inside the country. And so, yes, Putin's not
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:21.460]  being given an exit strategy. He's not being given a deal. He's not being given any security
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:28.420]  guarantees for the almost 100% Russian population in the east. And so this is the unstoppable force
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:35.540]  comes into contact with the immovable object. Yeah, I saw Putin pulling out the big guns,
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:40.980]  pulling on nuclear weapons out of the ground, and I just think, you know, we're just sleepwalking
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:45.860]  our way right into this war. Well, you know why they put the missiles on mobile launchers? Because
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:50.260]  starting a month ago, the U.S. coordinated cruise missile attacks on their nuclear bases.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:54.660]  So the United States is directing attacks on their nuke bases.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:59.540]  Yeah, they're back to the wall and they have no option. And that tells Russia, hey, we're
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:05.620]  getting ready to nuke you. When the United States, through a proxy, coordinates and directs the attacks
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:10.900]  on the Russian nuke bases, 150 miles inside Russia. What message does that send?
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:19.140]  A lot to do. I mean, he said that anybody that interfered with, you know, the war between Ukraine
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:26.340]  that he would retaliate and pretty much discarded his word and now you see where it's brought it.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:29.380]  And so what message do you think Zelensky visiting since now?
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:36.100]  Just a matter of time. Sadly, and very caring. Yeah, this is like waving a red cape in front
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:40.180]  of a bowl. And I have no doubt that, quote, U.S. can destroy Russia, but we'll be destroyed in
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:44.420]  the process. What's the globalist want? I appreciate your call. God bless you. Great points.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:49.060]  All right, Michael and Mass, you're on the air. Hey, Alex, how are you doing? Hey, dude, I actually
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:51.940]  talked to you like a year ago. We talked about, I don't know if you remember, we talked about
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:57.060]  Prometheus, connection to the globalist. I don't know if you remember, but anyways, yes. I mean,
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:01.220]  I just want to ask you, why do you think the Democrats hate Russia so much? I think, I think
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:06.340]  they were going to do this in 2016, if Hillary got in, but obviously Trump like kind of derailed
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.740]  their plan. Well, that's it. They were going to use Russia as the pretend enemy instead of China
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:15.220]  that really is an enemy as the pretext for all the surveillance, all the control, and to bring in
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:18.900]  the new global currency. Hillary said that, quote, she would attack Russia if she was elected. I
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:24.100]  plugged the clip probably 300 times or more. And I think you answered your own question. Tell us
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:28.100]  what you think is happening. Well, yeah, if you look at it from like a strategic standpoint, right?
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:32.820]  I mean, say we were doing this with Taiwan to China, I mean, that would be smart foreign policy,
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:36.260]  I think, for the United States. But if you look at it from the Democrats perspective,
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.020]  that perspective, they have their, they're obviously basically stateness and they're
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:45.620]  going up against a Christian country. So they're using Ukraine to deplete Russia's military without
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:49.300]  even Michael, I don't want to cut you off. This is important. Stay there. We're going to break
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:55.780]  and come back to you. And I'm just say this now, I'm not a Russophile, but I'm also on a
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:59.620]  Russofobe. And I've studied history. It's very interesting. I know a lot about the Russians.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:07.380]  Imagine if the Russian government financed a coup nine years ago in Mexico and then
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:14.100]  decided to move troops up against our border and then started killing any Americans in Mexico.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:21.060]  I mean, the United States would would attack. You could bet your bottom dollar
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:26.900]  back when it was run by Americans. So the globalists are attacking America, they're attacking
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:31.780]  Russia, they're attacking America with crime and fentanyl and open borders and devalued currencies
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:36.580]  and pedophilia and, you know, all of it. Then they attack Russia, which is straight up stuff,
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:42.020]  straight up military. But I want to talk about what he raised. Why did the left hate Russia?
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:47.700]  They told us why. And we have the answer to that. So we'll go to break and come back to Michael to
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:52.180]  finish up at that point. And then Jordan and Florida and many others will be right back.

[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:43.300]  I'm dreaming of a wild Christmas just like the ones I used to know.
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.580]  Well, it looks like most of America's going to get a white Christmas with this megastorm.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:53.220]  Sure, everybody, a great Christmas should be safe out there. At least you haven't totally
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:58.660]  turned our power off of that in Europe. By the way, I have the big German economy minister saying,
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:03.940]  get used to not having power. We're going to have climate shutdowns, power shutdowns
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.660]  to save Germany. We're going to lock you in your houses. That clip's coming up next hour.
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:15.380]  And so much more an update on the election fraud. But I want to go back to Michael in Mass.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:21.460]  Democrats in their Russian narrative, but there's not just using Russia as a pretext for control
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:27.540]  and censorship and for money laundering. There's something else. Why does Hollywood and the Rob
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:32.980]  Reiner's and people hate Russia so much? I'll give you my research on it in a moment. The first
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:37.620]  give us your take, Michael. I mean, well, yeah, when we keep talking about they're trying to set up
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:42.420]  a multi-polar world order. I know you heard them. Oh, yeah. Wait, one more thing. Alex, I know you
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:46.580]  know this, but like something that needs to be restated is like pulling right before the war
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:52.740]  said, listen, if you guys guarantee me that Ukraine will not join NATO, I won't invade. And then the
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:57.540]  next day Kamala goes to, I think she was in Poland or Germany or something. And she was like, we want
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:02.740]  Ukraine to join NATO. So I mean, the Biden administration deliberately provoked this
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:06.500]  conflict. I mean, I'm sure everybody already knows that, but just to restate it. But anyway,
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:09.940]  yeah. So I mean, who would keep some of it? We're trying to set up a multi-polar world order.
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:14.100]  And then I see the Saudis meeting with the Chinese and you see the Democrats really
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.980]  accelerating the collapse of the country. So I mean, I think that's what's going on. They're
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:24.180]  trying to set up. That is absolutely what's going on. And then you've got the left that had Russia
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:31.780]  for 80 plus years breaking up families, banning the churches, turning into a leftist, you know,
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:37.060]  hate crime controlled system. And the fact that it's now becoming Christian and right wing,
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:43.860]  and it really is, and rediscovering its roots and loving its heritage, being proud of their culture,
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.660]  you hear white people are inherently evil by the media because they want to balkanize everybody.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:53.780]  Well, they don't want a country that's sovereign and that's predominantly white, but it's also
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:50:00.100]  very tolerant of everybody else. They want the division. They want the control. They want the
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:06.260]  LGBT pedophilia taught the children at birth. And that's why Hollywood hates Russia's guts.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:11.620]  Go ahead. You know what else? I think, I think if, if the Democrats didn't do all the FBI,
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:15.940]  like the, uh, deal, don't say all the Russian stuff, I think Trump, not that Trump was controlled
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.860]  by Russia. Obviously we know he wasn't, but I think he was actually trying to set it up so we
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:25.620]  could be allied with them and have a whole NATO Russia, US block against China. I think that was
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:29.860]  Trump's master plan. If he got in for the second term and if he didn't have the Democrats really
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.300]  real, real well, you know, that's what he was wanting to do. I appreciate your call. All right,
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:39.300]  let's go to Jordan in Florida. You're on the air. Hello? Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:44.260]  Hey, I like how are you? I'm all right, brother. I wanted to ask you about,
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:50.180]  I wanted to ask you about, I called yesterday about the FTX, uh, Sam Bankman Freud thing, man.
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:54.900]  Yeah. His girlfriend has now, uh, turned on him and saying it's all a big money laundering fraud.
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:51:00.180]  Of course it was the total scam. Yeah, man. It's really crazy. I mean,
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:06.020]  it is my, my big question is to you is do you think in your honest opinion that he is going to
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:11.140]  come out and really, I think like pretty much niche on everybody that's involved because
[01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:16.580]  we know his parents and the head of the federal trade commission, all of them were running this
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:21.060]  guy. He's a front guy. So I think they'll probably break his neck. I mean, he's even got Epstein's
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:24.980]  lawyer. Uh, just like Maxwell's lawyer, I think they're going to, they're going to murder him.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:31.700]  Really? You think so? I mean, I don't know, man. Do you think he knows like all of what's
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:35.460]  really going on? It seems like his parents are his handlers, but do you think he really knows
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:39.780]  the depth or do you think he's just like, Oh, absolutely. He was absolutely a hundred percent
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:45.860]  around a Ponzi scheme. Wow, man. It's unbelievable to think that this is what the country has come
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:50.900]  to man in 2022. I mean, it's really scary to think about, man. Yeah. I don't think they wanted to go
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:55.540]  down. A lot of people exposed it and it was the Democrat deep state's piggy bank. So it's a big
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.140]  defeat for them. And I think I think they'll break his neck. I think it'll be committing suicide
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:05.620]  real fast. Wow. I've seen Maxine Waters came out and said some stuff about him, man, which is kind
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:12.020]  of crazy. Forget who said that, but I had seen something about Maxine Waters saying like negative
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:17.620]  things about him. So Oh yeah, they're going to break his neck real good. But hey, like you, you know,
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:22.100]  you know, no big deal. Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. The instrument is real. Anything else,
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:27.060]  Jordan? No, sir, that's it. You have a good day. Alex, thank you for everything you do. No, thank
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:29.860]  you, brother. And if you want to thank me, I want to thank you for spreading the word about the
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:34.660]  broadcast and your support. That's what's powerful as you the listeners hear everything. You decide
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:38.900]  to share the articles of videos to tell folks go to the forbidden site info wars.com and then tell
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:42.660]  them if they get any good knowledge to share it to others, tell them to share it, tell them to
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:46.820]  share it. It's game over folks. That's all you got to do. All right. Let's go to Jerome in New
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:52.500]  York. Jerome, you're on the air. Merry Christmas and a happy new year to you, your family and all
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:58.900]  your crew there, Alex. You too, brother. Hey, I'm going to take a minute and run this by about
[01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:04.580]  Ukraine. When it first started, that activity started over there. I got interested real interested
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:10.900]  in it. And I want to see, well, what's going on? What's causing all this? And somehow or another,
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:17.300]  I found it through, believe it or not, a professor of economics. His name is Michael Hudson.
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:21.860]  Michael Hudson. I don't know if you've ever heard of his name before. I saw him on an interview
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:26.260]  with Mike Max Kaiser one time, but I didn't understand what the heck he was talking about.
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:33.540]  I've heard the name. What's he saying? Oh my God. It's beyond. It's mind boggling. You can't begin
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:38.980]  to believe it, Alex. It's too much. You got to put one of your bulldogs. Oh, okay, well give us
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:44.260]  an absence of what he's saying. Well, he's saying, well, what they want to do is they want to bust
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:51.460]  the country up. Russia, that is, bust it up into the smaller states. So the IMF and the World Bank
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:56.740]  can go in there and privatize everything and strip the wealth out of the country there.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:02.580]  Well, that's what the IMF World Bank want to do. Is he claiming Russia controls the IMF World Bank?
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:09.780]  No, no, no. No, no, no. He's saying that the World Bank and IMF wants to go into Russia.
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:15.940]  Oh, 100 percent. They want to do the same thing they're doing to us. Oh, 100. That's on record.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:22.180]  That's not even. We're living through the death of an empire right now, just like, you know,
[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:25.940]  I don't know if you're aware of that or not. But that's right. They almost want to bring America
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:30.660]  down in Russia. And so they're playing us off against each other. Guys, will you guys get the
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:40.580]  Chinese Fighting Fish intro clip from Russia With Love, where Blofeld, the head of Specter, explains
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:44.740]  he lets the two fish fight, one kills the other, the other is exhausted, then the other comes in
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:49.140]  and kills it. That's exactly how this is working. Really, really great points. Anything else?
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:56.660]  This professor, like I was saying, he's a professor of economics. Like I said, when I found this man,
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:00.900]  I've been studying him ever since I found him. First part of November, I hadn't put him down yet.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:06.500]  Sure. Sure. So tell me his name again. We'll get him on. Michael Hudson. He's an elderly person.
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:13.860]  He lives up here in Manhattan. And we'll look into it. I appreciate you. Yeah. Michael Hudson
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:17.300]  discusses economic war. Well, this is definitely what this is. They admit that's what it is.
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:21.780]  All right. We'll try to get him on. Thank you. Great points. We got Jonathan. We got Jordan.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:25.300]  We got Deborah. We got Matt. We got Michael. We're going to get to you all, Kim,

[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:02.020]  All right. Let's jam in Jonathan in North Carolina. You're on the air.
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:09.300]  Hey, Alex. I'm super stoked to be talking with you. It's not only my first time calling your show,
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.540]  but first time calling any radio show. So just forgive me a little bit. No,
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:17.860]  we are very blessed to have you taking your biggest step into a larger world. Go ahead.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:23.220]  Okay. All right. So I want to talk about spiritual war for Alex. We all know we're in a big spiritual
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:28.820]  battle right now. And I believe I have the missing link that we've all been looking for. And
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:34.180]  I want to lay the groundwork. We all know God is one supreme being. He's three persons, Father,
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:41.460]  Son, Holy Spirit. And if people don't know, the Holy Spirit is just basically the energy
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:51.940]  that is created between the love of the Father and the Son. The missing link, Alex, is blessed
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:57.940]  Virgin Mary, the mother of God. And how is this possible? It's because obviously she's the mother
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:03.220]  of God through Jesus, right? We all know that. But she's also the bride of God through the Holy
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:10.180]  Spirit. And I can tell you this is true because let me quote Luke 138. And Mary said,
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:15.060]  the hold I am the handmaid of the Lord, let it be done to me according to thy word and the angel
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:23.940]  departed. That Alex was literally the marriage right that she gave to God. Sure. And Christ said,
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:29.460]  you know, I'm the groom, you're the bride. It's a microcosm of us, us literally in a
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:31.380]  relationship with God being married to God.
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:46.420]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call. Stay with us.

[01:59:53.140 --> 02:00:10.260]  transmission you are the resistance. A key component of human life is enlightenment the
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:17.540]  awakening from the darkness of deception into the light of truth the so-called great awakening
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:24.580]  has really been going on forever and before MAGA and QAnon the consensus was that the banks
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:30.740]  were at the top of the criminal pyramid structure and while many of us assumed that a hidden hand
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:36.900]  was pulling their strings as well we realized that their main goal was a digital currency
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:42.180]  and a cashless society it was the subject of several documentaries the ultimate goal that
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:50.100]  these people have in mind is the goal to create a one-world government run by the banking industry
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:55.300]  run by the bankers right there'll be no more cash and this is giving me straight from Rockefeller
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:01:00.820]  himself this is what I want to accomplish and all money will be in your chips and if you're like me
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:07.460]  or you and you're protesting what they're doing they can just turn off each hip and you have nothing
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:12.500]  you can't buy foods you can't do anything it's total control of people and that chips connected
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:17.460]  to a database that has your purchasing records what you do everything everything is in there
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:23.380]  and he was also commonly discussed that they'll likely use big pharma to get us there yes there
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:28.500]  have been corrupt empires yes they manipulate yes there are secret societies yes there have
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:34.900]  been oligarchies throughout history and yes today in 2002 there is a tyrannical organization
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:43.540]  calling itself the new world order pushing for worldwide government a cashless society
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:50.420]  open borders total and complete tyranny and by creating open borders well there's no national
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:57.060]  sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources by centralizing and socializing
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:02.980]  health care the state becomes god basically when it comes to your health and then by releasing
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:09.540]  diseases and viruses and plagues upon us we then basically get shoved into their system but now it's
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:15.940]  as if everyone has just accepted it and found something else to fight about because the cashless
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:24.180]  society is being rolled out right now and very few people seem bothered by it in november of 2019
[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:31.700]  right before covid the institute of politics at harvard kennedy school had a live tabletop exercise
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:37.540]  called digital currency wars which looked at how the united states can continue to leverage
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:44.660]  economic power in a world of national digital currencies such as the chinese digital yuan
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:50.180]  which is already heavily competing in trade against the us dollar and seems to be at the
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:58.020]  forefront of centralized digital currencies and it has an expiry date if you don't spend it by then
[02:02:58.020 --> 02:03:03.940]  it becomes worthless so people can no longer save money the bank of international settlements
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:09.940]  has announced that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:15.860]  and will have technologies to enforce it the central bank of brazil is planning to launch
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:23.780]  their centralized digital currency in 2024 israel is about to launch theirs and the bank of england
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:31.300]  is now preparing a uk digital currency italy's new prime minister meloni is speaking out against
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:37.620]  the cashless society but she seems to stand alone on the world stage in the federal reserve's
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:44.340]  digital currency scheme it appears that hedera and quant will be used on the technology side
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:50.500]  they are already connected to everything the cashless society is here but everyone is talking
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:57.940]  about hunter biden's laptop the goal was never to put an old senile puppet into the presidency
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:04.900]  to run havoc the goal was to create a cashless society and so while bringing joe biden to justice
[02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:11.220]  may feel like a victory the tyrants are still getting exactly what they wanted and once it's
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:17.780]  all said and done then who will save you and if you're like me or you and you're protesting what
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:24.180]  they're doing they can just turn off each other and you have nothing you can't buy food you can't

[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:37.620]  i mentioned in the first hour fbi statement on twitter now they denied this it's in the emails
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:41.380]  that they're supposed to keep it secret the twitter executives it's just twitter that's
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:47.540]  been exposed as a musk it's all the big groups the executives think it's illegal what they're
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:53.540]  doing spying on people censoring people suppressing people and so the arrogant
[02:06:54.260 --> 02:07:00.660]  patorian guard of the new world order fbi leadership comes out and says the correspondence
[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:05.380]  between the fbi and twitter show nothing more than examples of our traditional long-standing
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:12.340]  and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements in regard set up by bush
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:17.700]  but it's way beyond that that involves numerous companies over multiple sectors industries
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:22.260]  as evidence is the correspondence the fbi provides critical information to the private
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:27.860]  sector kind of like new zealand saying we're spying on any vaxxers and ever to allow them
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:32.660]  to protect themselves and their customers the many women the fbi work every day to protect the
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:39.380]  american public what's that obfuscation it is unfortunate that conspiracy theorist a term
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:43.940]  created by the cif the skinny assassination and others are feeding the american public
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:49.220]  misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency the agency that took the
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:54.020]  fake steel dossier and put it out that trump was a russian agent the agency that covers up for all
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:58.740]  the real child trafficking and money laundering going on on the border the agency that suppressed
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:03.460]  the hunter biden laptop that was real but they told the media it was fake with no evidence yeah
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:11.060]  yeah we're not the ones putting out fake information here is fox news covering a short clip
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:17.140]  there's a learn now we are getting our first response from the fbi to the twitter file dumps
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:23.860]  the statement reads the correspondence between the fbi and twitter show nothing more than examples
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:30.740]  of our traditional long-standing and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements
[02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:36.020]  which involve numerous companies over multiple sectors and industries as evidenced in the
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:42.100]  correspondence the fbi provides critical information to the private sector in an effort to allow them
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:47.860]  to protect themselves and their customers the men and women of the fbi work every day to protect
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:54.340]  the american public it is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:09:02.100]  american public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:08.740]  that justin don't all right noted the white house starting to find a coherent message on there you
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:14.580]  go ladies and gentlemen it's just business as usual drag queen story time it's just business
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:20.740]  as usual the fentanyl just business as usual and once soros gets all the county attorneys
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:24.740]  and sanitary generals there'll be nobody they'll have the justice department they'll have all
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:32.500]  the states and then the real fun begins here it is new york city artists who identifies as
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:38.340]  non-binary queer charged with trying to have sex with a nine-year-old at a rape party that he
[02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:43.860]  established oh but it's okay he didn't like nazis he didn't like trump
[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:50.660]  surprise he's not running the us spent nuclear fuel stockpile
[02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:59.300]  and it just gets worse and worse and worse from there they have a kleptocratic out-of-control
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:02.980]  elite that protect themselves and that see the american people as the enemy
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:08.020]  by calling virginia thanks for calling you're on the air
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:17.460]  hello yes alex uh you know we're standing at the forefront of victory in one way or the other
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:23.060]  when more than one way than the other because they're breaking up their parts they're throwing
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:28.420]  everything at us another we have one side against the other there are those of us who were informed
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:33.620]  there those of us who are in the inside letting leaks out there those of us in different places
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:39.860]  who oppose uh the certain rule by these authorities these people want to have rulership and control
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:46.980]  over uh humanity so we have to we we eventually are breaking them up into smaller pieces they
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:55.060]  are fighting each other and that's good for our victory because we will attain victory by our
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:11:02.180]  attitude our awareness of of of how to govern and our and our perseverance george washington
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:07.780]  lost 90 of the battles the first six years but finally won their perseverance you're absolutely
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:12.660]  right i need to make that point more often because i cover the bad but not the the the good i can
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:16.660]  depress people including myself sometimes it's important to pull back and realize that they're
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:22.420]  revealing themselves we're making them show their hand we're met we're they're getting trounced uh

[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:40.260]  are making headway toward a final battle where they will be trumped at least we should retain
[02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:46.980]  victory for at least a few hundred years uh ourselves we will have a ruler a leader we'll
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:54.020]  have someone not necessarily that we bow to but like they want us to come to them to elect a leader
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:58.420]  and then that would be cause of them who are supposed to protect us that we give up our
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:05.300]  sovereignty to them but we're on the verge of taking that victory back where people themselves
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:16.820]  have rulership and and and again that is last for at least a your victory you're in in in the spear

[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:32.180]  four or five again and i'm gonna come back cover a bunch of breaking news and then back
[02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:38.980]  to your calls on this live thursday worldwide transmission let's go to debora in boston debora
[02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:46.740]  welcome go ahead hey alex um i actually got through like a month ago and i had the um i am
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:52.500]  spartacus idea um yeah i just wanted to talk to you about actually you know what i want to talk
[02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:59.220]  to everybody that's listening not you um if we just think about how much money could be raised
[02:20:59.220 --> 02:21:08.500]  like five dollars at a time um i saw a tweet by um chris rufo you know him right a couple months ago
[02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:15.380]  and um somebody was accusing him of getting big money from so-and-so and he actually said in a
[02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:24.900]  tweet that he only that he um had 2,500 people donating um small amounts and i just found that
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:28.820]  really surprising and kind of sad i wish there were more people that would kind of get together
[02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:34.260]  and just donate five dollars a month it's not a big deal um you know because of your show
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:39.220]  and the people you've introduced me to i give a lot of different people actually about you know
[02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:46.420]  whatever five ten fifteen dollars a month um attorney rents bail big tree rsk whatever so i
[02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:51.220]  just want to encourage everybody that's never bought anything doesn't need any vitamins whatever
[02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:57.060]  i mean if we if everybody listening gave five dollars right now and committed i mean what if
[02:21:57.060 --> 02:22:02.420]  you could just have like five million a month just like nothing well that's really the issue we need
[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:07.620]  to make it simpler to donate we kind of hide it at m4store.com if you go to m4store.com up there it
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:11.540]  says support and then you click that link and people can give five dollars two dollars whatever
[02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:18.580]  and look small town newspapers and things have gone all off the air everywhere have been shut down
[02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:24.660]  local radio stations when they need almost nothing you know to to to stay on air but just the insurance
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:29.060]  and the legal and the cost the electricity all of it for a small newspaper in a small town it's
[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:32.340]  like three four million dollars a year well they don't have the money they just shut down now you
[02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:36.260]  don't have local news and it's the same thing for local radio stations well it's the same thing
[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:40.180]  they were something like this we have millions of dollars of bandwidth cost a month we're very
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:45.620]  successful reaching people it's just we have a certain nut to crack so the good news is our
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:48.980]  accounting is about two hundred fifty thousand dollars a month we've been losing the last six
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:54.420]  months and so if i get a few sponsors and got great products and listeners just buy some more
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:59.940]  product and make some donations we'll be able to stay on air and do these appeals and overturn all
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:04.500]  this fraud and they're and so they're so pissed out there but it's not the globalist that can
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:10.100]  take us off air right now it is the listeners if they don't realize how serious it is and i get it
[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:14.580]  i've been on air for years saying help me help me please buy products we need funds to stay on
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:19.140]  it kind of gets old it gets old for me to say it but it's true this is like a football game that
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:23.700]  starts at the beginning and goes for four quarters where both teams are neck and neck the whole time
[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:28.740]  or it's like a Muhammad Ali george foreman fight where it goes into the twelfth round and they're
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:33.060]  just beating the hell out of each other we that but that's how it is everywhere in these fights
[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:38.340]  so it is toe to toe it is neck and neck and it's really in your hands and i appreciate your support
[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:48.500]  okay last you'd like to say that uh yep um i want to encourage everybody to get as healthy as
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:55.860]  possible um and i want to tell people that the health information that we've been given for
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:24:02.100]  the past i don't know how many decades you know counting calories and running like crazy is how
[02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:09.220]  you lose weight it's all from the government and it's all wrong so there are doctors that you can
[02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:16.100]  find on twitter you know mostly like low carb it's all a spectrum but there are doctors curing
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:26.660]  type 2 diabetes epilepsy ms just by changing diet so you know it's very empowering you know
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:33.380]  to to get your health under control and you know a lot of people obviously have um awakened with
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:40.820]  covid and realize how you know corrupt but then they continue taking their you know their pills
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:46.340]  their pharmaceuticals um i thought it would be a good idea maybe to have somebody like Dr.
[02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:53.300]  Mercola as a guest again just to talk about like the very very basics i just want people to know
[02:24:53.300 --> 02:25:02.500]  that it is so much easier than you think i'm well 53 and i eat meat and potatoes i just do not eat
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:09.380]  processed food i minimize sugar i do intermittent fasting which ed doud actually mentioned on your
[02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:14.660]  show one time oh there's no intermittent fasting is so good for you and again i'm not the perfect
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:19.540]  healthiest guy but i know it works i know it's out there and it's so healthy to just you know eat at
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:24.260]  10 a.m be done eating by 6 p.m and your life is so much better and of course i'm the worst
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:27.940]  facility in like midnight when i'm up working or whatever and you're absolutely right and look
[02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:33.300]  fouchy in the globalist wouldn't be trying to suppress vitamin d3 and all these things if it
[02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:37.460]  wasn't the answer that's why they're so scared thanks for the call kevin wisconsin thanks for

[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:28.500]  those slides and the shot killing the cells and damaging them instantly yes if everybody around
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:37.380]  the world took that video and the video of the clot and walked into every doctor's office every
[02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:44.660]  pharmacy every everything and demanded that they look at it and then called the head of the nurses
[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:53.060]  you know of the counties and and just demand and if everybody does it every day and and don't

[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:47.940]  how it kills it instantly i think that would really shock people because it's not something that oh

[02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:52.900]  pedophile i'd cast brian stelter first but if he couldn't do the job this guy i mean this is like

[02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:18.980]  raped quote quote create the new family and they had a netflix show host one of these drag queens
[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:22.740]  come out as a man and woman's outfit and say we're here to destroy the family
[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:31.220]  that's their goal that's their program that's their operation that's what they mean to do
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:37.780]  let me just say something to the listeners here we've been through covid we've been through the
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:41.700]  lockdowns we've been through everything info wars has been through supply chain breakdowns

[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:53.060]  and the rest of the info wars family overall are great people but we we've been through a
[02:39:53.060 --> 02:39:58.420]  process of upgrading our shipping we're about to upgrade our customer service we're upgrading
[02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:02.260]  everything here we want you to know that we're not amazon we're not walmart we don't have the

[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:18.740]  the real red pill has all these trace elements in minerals and vitamins but more importantly has
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:23.380]  preglonone and then a bunch of other incredible things that are the precursors to the hormones in
[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:27.540]  your body that they're attacking and they're suppressing with chemicals in the bombardment
[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:34.180]  so all these things do an incredible job but i gotta say x2 and x3 get the best results overall
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:38.820]  because most people are deficient in iodine and most forms of iodine are bound to other elements
[02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:45.380]  so you're not absorbing them we have atomic iodine and tri iodine one of its part of that is atomic
[02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:52.500]  real red pill is just as powerful as x2 and x3 with the preglonone and more it's 50% off

[02:48:29.780 --> 02:48:35.220]  it's a cult of men dressed up like women as a gang taking over and saying your children are ours
[02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:40.340]  well not only that they're taking away all the women's rates right because it's the you know

[02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:52.260]  fbi agent mr baker or something got hired in after many many years in the fbi and then he brought
[02:50:52.260 --> 02:50:58.660]  in multiple other agents and they created a private slack channel to bring in even more uh fbi
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:05.220]  agents and then uh i went on the website and looked uh the number of twitter employees increased
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:12.660]  from like 5 000 to 7500 between 2020 and 2021 no it's a revolving door with the intelligence
[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:18.900]  agencies loading up all the big tech a surveil blackmail trafficking criminal activity everything
[02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:24.660]  it's just a giant criminal organization yeah and all these people that came in from the feds
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:33.220]  they have multiple multiple years of uh of uh leadership experience and and uh real what they
[02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:37.460]  do is they're spying on the private chats of all the celebrities and government officials
[02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:43.700]  well and they're and they're leading all these uh tech clubs that just come right out of college
[02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:49.460]  brainwash and know nothing they just fall online behind these agents and basically it's a propaganda
[02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:53.620]  arm of the government that you know that's in all that it's all the emails everybody's a russian
[02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:58.420]  agent survey them take their right spy on them rob them harass them we're liberal it's okay
[02:51:58.420 --> 02:52:03.540]  and it's all a bunch of cold-blooded lawyers with fbi agent badges doing it no it's it's
[02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:08.180]  the gestapo it's the nazis it's you know while the adl sony oh look this person does
[02:52:08.180 --> 02:52:13.380]  it open borders they're a nazi literal nazi tactics are being used thank you for the call
[02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:20.260]  all right let's talk to herald and alabama herald go ahead hey thank you alex uh i'm a
[02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:26.100]  construction worker up here in north alabama and i worked on two of the fbi buildings we've got two
[02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:32.900]  in fbi buildings here one of them over a billion dollars but these people um one of the fbi buildings
[02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:40.020]  are like a five-star resort they've got baristas jim i mean i was appalled at how these uh things
[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:47.620]  were so lavish but what i was calling in about is that uh they did this new um new art uh in the
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:52.980]  lobby of the fbi building and it's up on the wall it's like a concrete thing you really can't tell
[02:52:52.980 --> 02:52:58.260]  what it is can you step back and i looked at it and i was appalled because it was a picture of a
[02:52:58.260 --> 02:53:06.020]  demonic demon's head on the fbi lobby's wall uh up here in huntsville alabama and i i got
[02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:12.740]  a type of fbi headquarters huntsville alabama mural huntsville alabama fbi headquarters mural let's
[02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:18.100]  see it on the wall in the lobby and when you you can't really tell what it is because it's one of
[02:53:18.100 --> 02:53:22.660]  these new age things but if you step back you can see it and i brought other people in i said look
[02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:27.380]  right here and they were just amazed you know why would they put that on the wall of the fbi
[02:53:27.380 --> 02:53:34.580]  building why would they defend and protect pedophiles they're totally captured is what i'm
[02:53:34.580 --> 02:53:39.380]  thinking oh they are brother they are bringing in because look if you get control of a country's
[02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:44.820]  executive police force federal police force it's game over and they've almost got it and
[02:53:44.820 --> 02:53:50.100]  it's soros has almost got all the cities under his control that's why this is happening yeah you
[02:53:50.100 --> 02:53:54.900]  know the thing about alex is these people are supposed to work for us you know i'm a construction
[02:53:54.900 --> 02:53:59.380]  worker you know we got port authorities we're eating in our car out there and they've got this
[02:53:59.380 --> 02:54:03.220]  lavish i mean who wouldn't want to work for the government the way that they're treating themselves
[02:54:03.220 --> 02:54:10.500]  i mean at public expense it's unbelievable like the the spawn is is like a five star spot well
[02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:14.420]  they're in there committing crimes against america so they've got to be rewarded and petted and
[02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:17.460]  told how great they are and they're you know people say oh there's still some good ones well

[03:00:25.220 --> 03:00:32.900]  hour on this 22nd of december 2022 edition it's on of news coming up over the course of the next
[03:00:32.900 --> 03:00:37.780]  hour we're going to tell you about the biggest outrage in the united kingdom probably of the year
[03:00:37.780 --> 03:00:45.060]  maybe of the decade maybe even of the century and if you guess that it's somebody who said some mean
[03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:50.660]  words in the form of the written word then you'd be right yes that's a bigger outrage than anything
[03:00:50.660 --> 03:00:56.180]  we've seen over the course of the last century it's jeremy clarkson's comments about mega markel
[03:00:56.980 --> 03:01:03.220]  we're going to get into that we're also going to get into mega markel herself being caught red
[03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:11.460]  handed in a brazen outright lie once again we're also going to get into the lyrics of a christmas
[03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:17.300]  carol our church in england which were changed to completely erase jesus and the nativity
[03:01:18.020 --> 03:01:23.060]  will tell you what they were replaced with under this new religion that we've been introduced to
[03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:29.380]  stanford university wants the word american added to a harmful language list of a lot of
[03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:35.540]  articles a lot of news stories this week about the control of language which of course is about the
[03:01:35.540 --> 03:01:43.540]  control of reality itself if you can get me that show clock up by the way producers that'd be a great
[03:01:43.540 --> 03:01:48.900]  help because i can't see it at the moment we're also going to tell you about the story out of the
[03:01:48.900 --> 03:01:53.140]  e you which again should have been one of the biggest stories of the year of the week at least
[03:01:53.140 --> 03:01:59.860]  and it was the announcement that the e you is imposing a carbon tax on individuals that outright
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:06.900]  came out and admitted it they said it would probably cause mass continent wide riots across the e you
[03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:13.780]  and the gas prices home heating prices would certainly rise over the course of the next few
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:20.340]  years they're going to delay it a little bit by two or three years while the current thing the
[03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:26.660]  war in ukraine calms down so they don't get that instant backlash but they openly admit it's not
[03:02:26.660 --> 03:02:33.300]  just a border carbon tax as it's being presented and reported on by the media it's a carbon tax on
[03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:39.060]  individuals themselves and we're going to get into that also going to get into an astounding
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:44.980]  revelation which again went completely unremarked on by the vast majority of the media and that was
[03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:50.180]  a deutcher bank research note which was actually written back in january 2021 but only came to
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:57.860]  light recently the absolutely alarming comments but as we'd expect the comments to be which were
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:03:03.460]  contained in this deutcher bank research report so we're going to get into that as well on the other
[03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:10.900]  side also going to talk about cbs news claiming climate change worsens air turbulence the eco
[03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:15.940]  activists themselves are out in force doing themselves no good whatsoever once again
[03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:23.380]  decapitating christmas trees in berlin we're also going to talk about the new generation of kiddles
[03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:29.380]  we've got new figures out showing that now half of young americans are living with their parents
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:36.100]  that's up 38 percent from numbers from the year 2000 it's increasing every single year it seems
[03:03:36.100 --> 03:03:45.060]  like and just by coincidence the us toy industry is basically surviving because one fourth of its
[03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:54.420]  entire annual profit is down to adults mainly adult men buying toys buying things like you know
[03:03:54.420 --> 03:04:01.860]  star wars action figures bonko pops lego sets and to be honest most of these men aren't even living
[03:04:01.860 --> 03:04:07.140]  with their parents they're just stuck in a permanent state of adolescence and it speaks
[03:04:07.140 --> 03:04:15.140]  perfectly to the crisis of masculinity that we've seen in recent years also going to talk about the
[03:04:15.140 --> 03:04:24.020]  wonderful benefits of diversity as they're being enjoyed in germany where the the rate rates the
[03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:30.500]  attack violent attack rates are increasing but the main problem is not the increasing terror
[03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:36.580]  attacks the increasing sexual assaults on women it's the fact that berlin police officers aren't
[03:04:36.580 --> 03:04:42.980]  using discrimination sensitive language and now they're actually telling them you can't even use
[03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:49.700]  the word refugee you have to explain that a refugee is from an area where there's war when
[03:04:49.700 --> 03:04:53.380]  they're striped that they're trying to escape those areas even though the vast majority aren't

[03:06:06.180 --> 03:06:12.260]  feel back it is the summit news hour and i want to set the scene for the biggest outrage as i've
[03:06:12.260 --> 03:06:17.780]  mentioned before in the united kingdom perhaps of the millennium perhaps of the entirety of human
[03:06:17.780 --> 03:06:25.540]  history at least UK history and that is the sun columnist Jeremy Clarkson making a joke about
[03:06:25.540 --> 03:06:30.980]  Meghan Markle i'm going to come back after this video and talk about some of the latest updates
[03:06:30.980 --> 03:06:38.100]  on this story of the century but first let's go to this video it's called stupid beyond belief let's
[03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:46.580]  roll it let's check in on the latest phony contrived clant world outrage tv presenter Jeremy Clarkson
[03:06:46.580 --> 03:06:51.620]  wrote an article in the sun newspaper in reference to Meghan Markle which said quote again though
[03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:56.340]  is a different story i hate her not like i hate nicolas sturgeon or rose west i hate her on a
[03:06:56.340 --> 03:07:00.420]  cellular level at night i'm unable to sleep as i lie there grinding my teeth and dreaming of the
[03:07:00.420 --> 03:07:04.340]  day when she's made to parade naked through the streets of every town in britain while the crowds
[03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:10.660]  chant shame and throw lumps of excrement at her oh no anyway the flinging poo joke is in reference
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:17.620]  to sursy's walk of shame in game of thrones it's a joke based on a scene in a fictional tv show
[03:07:17.620 --> 03:07:22.580]  the rest of it is just Clarkson's usual acerbic hyperbole is he actually going to make Meghan
[03:07:22.580 --> 03:07:28.820]  Markle parade naked through the street so it can throw crap at her no because it's a joke remember
[03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:34.740]  those but because we live in a supremely idiotic time this is the outrage of the century ipsos
[03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:42.500]  confirmed today that this was the most complained about article ever 17 500 complaints as of 9 am
[03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:48.340]  today every has been celebrity and professionally outraged grifter is jumping on board to decry
[03:07:48.340 --> 03:07:54.020]  Clarkson's vile misogyny claiming based on no evidence aside from their own hurt feelings that
[03:07:54.020 --> 03:07:59.060]  it's going to lead to actual violence against women interesting isn't it the media can spread
[03:07:59.060 --> 03:08:04.740]  vicious damaging propaganda about lockdowns and vaccine mandates for years lies which grease the
[03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:10.260]  skids for the imposition of the biggest and most draconian outrage in living memory deceptions
[03:08:10.260 --> 03:08:16.260]  which led directly to real world harm and virtually no one complains Clarkson writes a snarky insult
[03:08:16.260 --> 03:08:21.860]  in a tiny section of a newspaper and everybody loses their minds who cares it's just some words
[03:08:21.860 --> 03:08:26.980]  he's got untold number of excess deaths a week people dying all over the shop from untreated
[03:08:26.980 --> 03:08:33.460]  illnesses because of lockdown all of it exacerbated by odious lies published in national newspapers
[03:08:33.460 --> 03:08:39.700]  they're more upset over a famous tv presenter insulting another famous woman who gives a s***
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:46.100]  now 65 mps have demanded the sun take action against Clarkson what no you have anything better
[03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:51.460]  to do who voted for you to waste time patrolling jokes in newspaper columns they want Clarkson
[03:08:51.460 --> 03:08:57.220]  to be banned from all television forever this idiot reported him to the police for a hate crime
[03:08:57.220 --> 03:09:01.140]  then the police told him to go away pointing out Clarkson's mean joke had nothing whatsoever to
[03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:05.460]  do with Meghan Markle's ethnicity this is why people can't get seen when they're burgled because
[03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:10.260]  people like you attempt to tie them up dealing with herty words yeah record crime in england and
[03:09:10.260 --> 03:09:15.380]  wales record number of crimes going unsolved and this clown's wasting their time because his fee
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:19.620]  fees were hurt on behalf of someone else and in case you were thinking this whole farce couldn't
[03:09:19.620 --> 03:09:25.380]  get even more painfully absurd Clarkson's own 28 year old daughter went public to say she stands
[03:09:25.380 --> 03:09:30.420]  against everything her father wrote woman moment oh the joys of social media and narcissistic
[03:09:30.420 --> 03:09:36.100]  dopamine culture children denouncing their own parents like the kiddie starzy more stupid still
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:41.620]  was Clarkson apologizing because as we know this only emboldens the mob's demented witch hunt
[03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:46.580]  no Jeremy Clarkson not on any level in any circumstances is it okay to write this stuff
[03:09:46.580 --> 03:09:52.340]  about any woman but Meghan Markle is a woman you can't say anything bad about a woman what
[03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:58.260]  how's that equality is Meghan Markle inherently unlikable yes that's an objective fact and it's
[03:09:58.260 --> 03:10:04.740]  got nothing to do with a race or biological gender has it it's an opinion shared by a clear majority
[03:10:04.740 --> 03:10:10.660]  of the british people she's unlikable i mean some women are great fantastic total angels some women
[03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:15.780]  are completely insufferable and the same goes for men you know why because they're all humans
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:20.820]  because some humans are great some humans lie somewhere in the middle and some humans are
[03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:26.260]  detestable the fact i even have to say this rocks my own brain the fact that this is the biggest
[03:10:26.260 --> 03:10:32.420]  outrage of the year after everything that's happened every real outrage underscores the utter
[03:10:32.420 --> 03:10:40.180]  derangement of the permanently offended mob now this is all happening of course
[03:10:40.180 --> 03:10:48.900]  amiss a debate over toxic masculinity over vile dangerous misogyny in the united kingdom specifically
[03:10:48.900 --> 03:10:55.780]  since the de-platforming the banning of andrig tey now of course that was back some number
[03:10:55.780 --> 03:11:03.860]  since we've had laws passed in the united kingdom dealing with misogyny dealing with tax on women
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:12.260]  on women in the street and actual police resources being devoted to police going undercover and going
[03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:16.500]  after people who are supposedly harassing women on street against that but again some of the
[03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:22.660]  fallout of the clock and controversy the biggest controversy that the united kingdom has seen
[03:11:22.660 --> 03:11:30.500]  in years empty demands Jeremy Clarkson faced permanent ITV ban after Meghan Markle naked
[03:11:30.500 --> 03:11:35.380]  proud now of course they're claiming this is about slavery this is about the rate it's nothing
[03:11:35.380 --> 03:11:41.780]  whatsoever to do with her race he's referencing a scene out of Game of Thrones where one of the
[03:11:41.780 --> 03:11:47.700]  characters gets pulled long at them as they march through the streets has nothing to do with the
[03:11:47.700 --> 03:11:54.740]  history of slavery has nothing to do with the skin color it's a fictional reference it's a joke but
[03:11:54.740 --> 03:12:03.300]  now not only that they want him banned from TV they want him arrested and jail in fact Reverend
[03:12:03.300 --> 03:12:10.580]  Jesse Chacka Al Sharpton so the latest to wade into this controversy got
[03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:19.060]  to do with the US it's from trending news Reverend Al Sharpton slams Jeremy Clarkson's
[03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:25.540]  racist Meghan Markle calling it police plea again he didn't even mention her race it's got nothing
[03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:30.580]  to do with race US civil rights pioneer Reverend Al Sharpton the strict size of Jeremy Clarkson's
[03:12:30.580 --> 03:12:35.460]  racist rant against Meghan such as Sussex with her newspaper the next judge has asked the
[03:12:35.460 --> 03:12:42.100]  Metropolitan East to investigate yes forget the record numbers of crimes that can't get
[03:12:42.100 --> 03:12:46.500]  sold because the police don't have the resources to respond to third parties police don't have
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:52.500]  the resources to solve more than 0.5 percent car thefts major department stores in London have
[03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:59.860]  stopped bothering calling the police when they get robbed because they don't turn up but all these
[03:12:59.860 --> 03:13:06.900]  top public figures are pulling on the metropolitan police of London as violent crime skyrockets
[03:13:06.900 --> 03:13:17.380]  stabbing skyrockets every single day they're calling on Clarkson to be jailed for his speech crimes
[03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:20.740]  again Reverend Al Sharpton strict size Jeremy Clarkson's racist rant
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:26.180]  there's national action network I join many others in condemning the appalling comments
[03:13:26.180 --> 03:13:31.780]  published by mr Jeremy Clarkson in the sun this week against the duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle
[03:13:31.780 --> 03:13:37.700]  why he's wading into this contrast he knows condemn these racist and inhuman actions in the
[03:13:37.700 --> 03:13:41.940]  strongest terms they represent the blurs of angels of our society and should not find any shelter in
[03:13:41.940 --> 03:13:47.780]  the media joining calling on all people good faith and in the US and abroad to unite this condemnation
[03:13:47.780 --> 03:13:54.580]  and demand accountability nothing whatsoever to do with race of course when a left winger at the
[03:13:54.580 --> 03:14:02.260]  night comes down and makes a joke in the context of a violent insult against someone on the right
[03:14:02.260 --> 03:14:09.860]  all that comedy why can only the left why are only the left allowed to be offensive then it's
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:15.380]  comedy when the right's offensive well then it's vile dangerous misogyny and it's going to lead to
[03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:21.860]  women getting attacked on the streets it's all complete bollocks telegraph reports what the
[03:14:21.860 --> 03:14:28.340]  Jeremy Clarkson for all tells us about left of bias hypocrisy and free speech and they make this
[03:14:28.340 --> 03:14:38.020]  point at the article where joe brand was a fat feminist comedian in the United Kingdom in 2019
[03:14:38.020 --> 03:14:44.020]  i'm referring to Nigel Farad being physically violently attacked with a milkshake salted
[03:14:44.020 --> 03:14:48.820]  that's what it is you go around throwing milkshake people guess what you committed assault
[03:14:48.820 --> 03:14:56.900]  he said about him my brother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid that was fine
[03:14:56.900 --> 03:15:01.940]  because it was a joke apparently what Clarkson wrote wasn't a joke even though he literally
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:09.460]  made a reference to a TV series and he's obviously not going to go flinging to public figures it was
[03:15:09.460 --> 03:15:18.820]  a joke they also point to Miriam Morguels Miriam Morguels who in 2020 said i wanted Boris Johnson
[03:15:18.820 --> 03:15:25.780]  to die when she got called out for those comments she downgraded her desire to be a castration so
[03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:32.580]  again it's okay when we do it they're calling for Clarkson to be kicked off TV they want him put in
[03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:40.900]  prison for making a joke about Meghan Markle this is this is the vile misogyny moral panic that
[03:15:40.900 --> 03:15:45.780]  we're experiencing the grouping gang scandal which the government all covered up targeting women and
[03:15:45.780 --> 03:15:50.900]  young girls that's nothing nobody's outraged about that submit not news we'll be back
[03:15:50.900 --> 03:16:02.580]  so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight
[03:16:02.580 --> 03:16:07.460]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard

[03:20:30.020 --> 03:20:35.540]  justified the lockdown which justified the demonization of quote anti-vaxxers people who
[03:20:35.540 --> 03:20:41.540]  wanted to make their own medical choices which justified what we now have which is excess death

[03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:11.140]  nowhere of course the local authorities in many cases were responsible for covering up the grooming
[03:21:11.140 --> 03:21:18.260]  gangs targeting young women predominantly young white children no outrage over that vile dangerous
[03:21:18.260 --> 03:21:25.380]  misogyny but jeremy clarkson makes a rude joke about meghan markle in a tiny little
[03:21:25.380 --> 03:21:31.620]  column inch of a newspaper article and everybody loses their minds reverend al sharpton has waded
[03:21:31.620 --> 03:21:38.020]  in for god knows what reason and also people on twitter were actually reporting him to the police
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:44.180]  yeah they should be arrested for wasting police time given the problems we've got with spiraling
[03:21:44.180 --> 03:21:48.740]  violent crime throughout the united kingdom again record high crime levels in england and
[03:21:48.740 --> 03:21:56.260]  wales over the course of the past year but these morons on twitter was so offended so offended on
[03:21:56.260 --> 03:22:02.260]  behalf of someone else meghan markle the serial lying grifter that they literally report him to
[03:22:02.260 --> 03:22:07.940]  the police and so they credit you know perhaps they'd done doing the macarena at the gay pride
[03:22:07.940 --> 03:22:14.900]  parade for the day the police took the time to tell them this isn't a hate crime even with our
[03:22:14.900 --> 03:22:20.100]  stringent hate crime laws which of course are very different to what you've got in the united
[03:22:20.100 --> 03:22:23.860]  states with your first amendment where you can basically say anything so long as it's not an
[03:22:23.860 --> 03:22:30.420]  imminent incitement to violence they even they said and bear in mind these are the police forces
[03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:36.340]  who will go out and arrest people for posting limericks about transgenders on facebook making
[03:22:36.340 --> 03:22:41.300]  fun of them they'll literally go out and handcuff people they'll arrest pregnant women in their own
[03:22:41.300 --> 03:22:47.940]  kitchens for making jokes about transgender people on mumsnet and all these websites they'll do that
[03:22:47.940 --> 03:22:54.740]  but even they came out and said no whatever jeremy clarkson wrote was not a hate crime that didn't
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:23:01.140]  stop the morons from reporting him then to the metropolitan police over london this article
[03:23:01.140 --> 03:23:07.780]  continues out of trends net again headline reverend alshops and slams jeremy clarkson's racist
[03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:13.940]  megan markle column so they cite the fact that this has been reported to the police his comments
[03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:19.460]  come as peter herbert a former judge and black society of lawyers chair has written to the
[03:23:19.460 --> 03:23:25.300]  mayor urging action against mr clarkson over his column arguing it incites racial hatred again
[03:23:25.300 --> 03:23:30.340]  doesn't mention her race it's nothing to do with her race it's to do with the fact that he doesn't
[03:23:30.340 --> 03:23:35.300]  like her he basically says you know remember that scene out of game of thrones wouldn't it be funny
[03:23:35.300 --> 03:23:42.660]  if you got poof longer in public it's a joke get over it and then the police came back and basically
[03:23:42.660 --> 03:23:50.340]  said no there's no hate crime here so this is the true outrage when it comes to dangerous violent
[03:23:50.340 --> 03:23:57.300]  misogyny against women in the united kingdom forget the grooming gangs forget the actual sexual assaults
[03:23:57.300 --> 03:24:03.300]  and abuse of women no outrage over that what's really outrageous is cat calling in the street
[03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:09.060]  daily mail reports man who cat called woman in the street is one of the first in uk to get 100
[03:24:09.060 --> 03:24:15.780]  pound fine for sexual harassment after he was caught in undercover police operation this is what
[03:24:15.780 --> 03:24:20.100]  they've got resources for you get burgled they're not even going to respond they're not even going
[03:24:20.100 --> 03:24:26.900]  to investigate it they said that themselves the chief of police in the uk in 2015 said tough look
[03:24:26.900 --> 03:24:32.740]  we're not going to respond to burglaries anymore but they've got scrapped teams of undercover cops
[03:24:33.460 --> 03:24:41.620]  they put roll the streets listening for sexism wolf whistles cat calling the man who cat called
[03:24:41.620 --> 03:24:47.860]  a woman on a london street in london where all the real crimes happening has become one of the
[03:24:47.860 --> 03:24:53.380]  first in the uk to be slapped with a hundred pound fine for sexual harassment after he was caught in
[03:24:53.380 --> 03:24:58.980]  an undercover police operation the offender who was not named he'll he'll probably be publicly
[03:24:58.980 --> 03:25:04.340]  shamed later on twitter by the mob was issued a fixed penalty notice for harassing a woman in
[03:25:04.340 --> 03:25:13.300]  illford town centre last friday and again you know i get it there are creeps who chase women down
[03:25:13.300 --> 03:25:18.980]  the streets who harass them who try to talk to them when they're not interested i get it that it's
[03:25:18.980 --> 03:25:25.940]  annoying it's wrong they have all these campaigns in this country saying don't sexually harass women
[03:25:25.940 --> 03:25:31.460]  on the street don't rape women you really think criminals and rapists and weirdos and perverts
[03:25:32.020 --> 03:25:36.340]  are going to see a little advertisement on the tube saying don't harass women and then go oh all
[03:25:36.340 --> 03:25:45.140]  right then i won't oh they're criminals arm women with tasers that'll stop them won't it no women
[03:25:45.140 --> 03:25:49.860]  aren't allowed to own tasers in the united kingdom they're not even allowed to carry pepper spray
[03:25:50.420 --> 03:25:56.260]  legally in the united kingdom women if we're so concerned about women getting harassed
[03:25:56.260 --> 03:26:02.740]  sexually assaulted and yes it is a problem i've had girlfriends who you know every single one
[03:26:02.740 --> 03:26:07.700]  of them have said you know they've been chased down the street cat called you know what's your phone
[03:26:07.700 --> 03:26:11.700]  number what's your snapchat go away i don't want to talk to you they just continue doing it is a
[03:26:11.700 --> 03:26:16.820]  problem so why not let them carry pepper spray no that's banned you can't have pepper spray
[03:26:17.540 --> 03:26:24.420]  they can't they're not allowed to defend themselves but apparently we can hire teams of undercover cops
[03:26:24.420 --> 03:26:30.660]  to go around major cities trying to catch people who can't call them that's the solution when we
[03:26:30.660 --> 03:26:36.020]  have a police resource crisis to the point where they can't even respond to burglaries in what world
[03:26:36.020 --> 03:26:42.260]  does that make any frigging sense the fee was handed to the offender using the council's public
[03:26:42.260 --> 03:26:49.540]  space protection order as working with met police as part of a special covert operation they make it
[03:26:49.540 --> 03:26:55.620]  sound as if they're casing terrorists you've got actual terrorists and murders roaming around the
[03:26:55.620 --> 03:27:02.340]  streets of london by the way striking out on a regular basis but this is the special covert
[03:27:02.340 --> 03:27:09.700]  operation of the metropolitan police going after wolf whistlers this culprit this deadly misogynist
[03:27:09.700 --> 03:27:15.620]  was ordered to pay 100 pound fine within 28 days if he doesn't pay the fine he faces a potential
[03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:22.740]  prison sentence red bridge council leader jazz ath wall that old british name said we're
[03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:28.660]  supporting covert police operations in the borough to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice
[03:27:28.660 --> 03:27:34.100]  he says this is this fine is a strong start and will serve as a statement of intent we will not
[03:27:34.100 --> 03:27:40.100]  tolerate harassment of women and girls unless they're being harassed by large groups of pakistani
[03:27:40.100 --> 03:27:44.980]  and bangladesh men and then not only will they turn a blind eye to it they'll cover it up and make
[03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:51.860]  sure the perpetrators walk free but these wolf whistlers these cat callers well they are now
[03:27:51.860 --> 03:27:59.300]  well they are now shaking in fear because all the police resources are being devoted to catch them
[03:28:01.140 --> 03:28:07.700]  meanwhile as they're patrolling wolf whistlers and cat callers in the church of england their
[03:28:07.700 --> 03:28:13.380]  patrolling language church erases jesus and nativity and christmas carol replaces them with

[03:33:13.060 --> 03:33:17.940]  i was talking about it before the break this church in england under the church of england
[03:33:17.940 --> 03:33:25.300]  they held a christmas carol event on monday and they replaced jesus they scrubbed references
[03:33:25.300 --> 03:33:31.220]  to standing up against satan they scrubbed references to the nativity and they replaced
[03:33:31.220 --> 03:33:36.340]  them with the verbiage of the new religion the religion of the alphabet people
[03:33:38.340 --> 03:33:44.020]  so this was a trainee priest rachel brinn search again lord at how the church had changed the
[03:33:44.020 --> 03:33:50.580]  lyrics to the classic carol god rest ye merry gentleman she said flipping love my church
[03:33:51.300 --> 03:33:58.020]  the new lyrics included the following two verses god rest you also women who by men have been
[03:33:58.020 --> 03:34:05.140]  erased okay women are raised by men through history ignored and scorn defiled and replaced
[03:34:05.140 --> 03:34:11.380]  remember that your stories too are held within god's grace this says god rest you queer and
[03:34:11.380 --> 03:34:17.300]  questioning whatever that means at this point your anxious hearts be still believe that you are
[03:34:17.300 --> 03:34:21.380]  deeply known a part of god's goodwill for all delivers wanted peace the global dream fulfilled
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:26.740]  the global history fulfilled the verses replace the actual lyrics of the carol which talk about
[03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:32.900]  the nativity and how christ came to save us all from satan's power now it is very much evident
[03:34:32.900 --> 03:34:41.220]  isn't it that satan's power is being exercised over this very church sam margrave member of
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:45.700]  the general synod of the church of england responded by saying when they say we aren't
[03:34:45.700 --> 03:34:51.140]  ordaining political activists show them this absolutely disgusted an act of worship to our
[03:34:51.140 --> 03:34:56.420]  lord and savior is being used to push political ideology well again that's the point isn't it
[03:34:56.420 --> 03:35:01.780]  well kism isn't just a political ideology it's their new religion so they are going to hollow
[03:35:01.780 --> 03:35:07.940]  out your religion and as somebody else responded commented it's very important for the new religion
[03:35:07.940 --> 03:35:13.780]  to try to wear the skin of the old not only does it need to replace the old religion it needs to
[03:35:13.780 --> 03:35:22.900]  defile the old religion brin such whose twitter profile bear in mind this is the trainee priest
[03:35:22.900 --> 03:35:27.700]  this is how far the church has been completely taken over this is why many people have stopped
[03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:32.820]  going to church this is why the church is dying and the only people going now are basically these
[03:35:33.540 --> 03:35:38.020]  woke ordained religious leaders who are taking it out hollowing it out and wearing it as their
[03:35:38.020 --> 03:35:44.900]  new skin the twitter part profile included her pronouns and lgbt flags interesting that isn't
[03:35:44.900 --> 03:35:51.060]  it she responded to the backlash by claiming the lyrics were appropriate because representatives
[03:35:51.060 --> 03:35:57.460]  of refugee charities were in attendance so because you know denizens of the ordained
[03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:03.380]  humane charities the refugee charities and that is the new form of worship isn't it
[03:36:03.380 --> 03:36:11.860]  re worshiping illegal boat migrants because they're very special people because they were there
[03:36:11.860 --> 03:36:18.020]  then somehow it was necessary to amend and erase jesus christ out of the carol and replace it with
[03:36:18.020 --> 03:36:24.580]  queer people she said my faith informs my politics i think that's the other way around
[03:36:24.580 --> 03:36:29.140]  actually and i will never be sad or mad or apologize for attending a church which challenges me to
[03:36:29.140 --> 03:36:34.660]  think about them more and the policies being legislated for in our name typical intersectional
[03:36:34.660 --> 03:36:40.900]  gobbledygook nonsense and of course it turns out that this church is part of the inclusive church
[03:36:40.900 --> 03:36:46.660]  movement which obviously doesn't include the biblical teachings of christianity they're not
[03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:51.380]  quite up to date so they've been kicked out which pushes regime narratives and progressive
[03:36:51.380 --> 03:36:57.220]  stances which are about as far removed from christian teachings as you can get back in july
[03:36:57.220 --> 03:37:02.980]  the church of england refused to define what a woman was they still oppose same-sex marriage
[03:37:02.980 --> 03:37:08.580]  but expect that to change very shortly more response to this in the form of this bright bar
[03:37:08.580 --> 03:37:15.540]  headline stop rewriting christmas carols to be woke cardinal tells church of england catholic
[03:37:15.540 --> 03:37:19.060]  bishop has said that christmas carols should not be rewritten to suit fleeting political and
[03:37:19.060 --> 03:37:24.980]  social mores after it emerged that woke individuals have reworked one song to promote lgbt ideology
[03:37:26.180 --> 03:37:31.060]  carnal vincent nickles who serves as the roman catholic archbishop of west minster
[03:37:31.060 --> 03:37:37.540]  has waded into a debate on the rewording of the christmas carol he said i think what christmas
[03:37:37.540 --> 03:37:43.060]  does it tells us the importance of ritual and ritual helps us to set outside our own little
[03:37:43.060 --> 03:37:46.740]  bubble connect with something that we have received inherited and that we hope to pass on
[03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:52.660]  said i think those values of continuation musical rapport to the ability to sing together looking
[03:37:52.660 --> 03:37:57.220]  at rituals that have been fashioned over the centuries basically said again they're trying
[03:37:57.220 --> 03:38:02.420]  to eliminate the ritual entirely they're trying to subvert it they're trying to hollow out the
[03:38:02.420 --> 03:38:10.100]  religion and make it a worship of their progressive demented liberal ideology and of course anything
[03:38:10.100 --> 03:38:17.620]  that challenges that goes very quickly by the wayside video stanford university wants the word
[03:38:17.620 --> 03:38:24.580]  american added to a harmful language list stanford university is proposing adding the term american
[03:38:24.580 --> 03:38:29.540]  to a blacklist which are the harmful words reasoning that it's too us-centric and not
[03:38:29.540 --> 03:38:35.620]  inclusive enough of other countries university's targeting labels by this orwellian elimination
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:39.940]  of harmful language initiative that seeks to police language by memory hauling words and phrases
[03:38:39.940 --> 03:38:44.900]  it deems to be not woke enough so you're not allowed to use the term american now again this
[03:38:44.900 --> 03:38:51.540]  isn't about sensitivities this isn't about protecting people's fee fees it's about seizing
[03:38:51.540 --> 03:38:57.860]  control of language this is about the raw lust for power if you control the language if you control
[03:38:57.860 --> 03:39:04.980]  the definition of words you control reality and you eliminate any real reality that you don't like
[03:39:04.980 --> 03:39:10.660]  that's why they do it they're malevolent bastards they know exactly what they're doing
[03:39:11.780 --> 03:39:17.300]  biden admin funds ai to police online language why are they so obsessed with policing language
[03:39:17.300 --> 03:39:23.940]  because language dictates reality it allows you to enunciate truths if they take that away from you
[03:39:23.940 --> 03:39:28.900]  they're basically metaphorically cutting out your tongue that's why they do it they're malevolent
[03:39:28.900 --> 03:39:34.100]  bastards government spending records have revealed the biden administration is dishing out more than
[03:39:34.100 --> 03:39:38.660]  half a million dollars in grants to fund the development of artificial intelligence that
[03:39:38.660 --> 03:39:45.300]  will censor language on social media in order to eliminate microaggressions now of course it's not
[03:39:45.300 --> 03:39:52.500]  been going too well so far because what tends to happen with the ai is that it's at its current
[03:39:52.500 --> 03:39:59.780]  embryonic stage very prone to the people who program it so when they put an ai online and
[03:39:59.780 --> 03:40:07.540]  invite people to go in and have conversations with this ai online it tends to get uh bombarded by
[03:40:07.540 --> 03:40:15.380]  let's say some very edgy edgy people and the ai turns out to be racist that's what's happened
[03:40:15.380 --> 03:40:19.300]  all along so they've had a lot of problems with that because it's been bombarded with people who
[03:40:19.300 --> 03:40:25.140]  are going on there and trolling and making the ai become racist well apparently that's going to be
[03:40:25.140 --> 03:40:30.660]  solved by this new funding package the washington free beacon reports that the funding was part
[03:40:30.660 --> 03:40:37.220]  of biden's 1.9 trillion american rescue plan and rescuing america by controlling language and
[03:40:37.220 --> 03:40:41.780]  censoring it and was granted to researchers at the university of washington in march to develop
[03:40:41.780 --> 03:40:47.620]  technologies that could be used to protect online users from discriminatory language again complete
[03:40:47.620 --> 03:40:53.540]  bollocks just another front for censorship judicial watch president tom fit and compared the move to
[03:40:53.540 --> 03:40:58.580]  chinese communist party's efforts to censor speech unapproved by the state of course that is the
[03:40:58.580 --> 03:41:04.180]  origin of political correctness at its origin at its embryonic stage it had nothing to do with
[03:41:04.180 --> 03:41:09.940]  protecting gay people protecting minorities politically incorrect speech was politically
[03:41:09.940 --> 03:41:15.620]  inconvenient speech when it was about the regime in communist china communist russia that was the
[03:41:15.620 --> 03:41:22.100]  origin of political correctness it was to censor criticism of the state had nothing to do with
[03:41:22.100 --> 03:41:28.100]  protecting the rights sensibilities and feelings of minority groups but that's how it's being adopted
[03:41:28.100 --> 03:41:33.060]  in the west the report notes the researchers are developing machine learning models that
[03:41:33.060 --> 03:41:37.460]  can analyze social media posts and correct any language that could cause offence to marginalize
[03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:43.620]  groups and of course when they control big tech that works in a similar fashion to how their
[03:41:44.500 --> 03:41:51.140]  fact check algorithms work so any aparachic of the regime of course now we've seen the revelations
[03:41:51.140 --> 03:41:57.060]  twitter working directly with the u.s government facebook the same pre-eal on musk of course
[03:41:57.940 --> 03:42:03.540]  you have those state aparachics once once they define what has been fact checked what's debunked
[03:42:03.540 --> 03:42:10.020]  what's a conspiracy theory they feed that into the ai that goes into the algorithm and then those
[03:42:10.020 --> 03:42:16.100]  stories get censored in the algorithm they get relegated so very few people or none whatsoever
[03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:22.740]  see those stories that's what happened with the hunter biden story they malevolently and deliberately
[03:42:22.740 --> 03:42:28.420]  manipulated the outcome of an election by censoring that story before the election and they did it in
[03:42:28.420 --> 03:42:34.660]  a similar way to how they're going to deploy this machine learning ai to censor your social media
[03:42:34.660 --> 03:42:39.780]  posts before you're even allowed to make them so they won't even have it need to have a human
[03:42:39.780 --> 03:42:45.780]  analyzing them afterwards if you use naughty words in a certain order the ai will detect it
[03:42:45.780 --> 03:42:52.500]  the post will be blocked before it's even allowed to go online that is the next phase summit dot news

[03:47:04.420 --> 03:47:19.300]  it's a final segment and i want to get to these two final videos because again this should have
[03:47:19.300 --> 03:47:25.460]  been one of the biggest stories of the month if not the year the announcement that the EU is launching
[03:47:25.460 --> 03:47:31.220]  the carbon tax which will be targeted against individual citizens this is unprecedented the
[03:47:31.220 --> 03:47:38.820]  first of its kind in the world and it was barely even reported this was reported as an EU border
[03:47:38.820 --> 03:47:46.020]  tax against foreign countries importing goods into the european union that they would be hit by
[03:47:46.020 --> 03:47:50.900]  carbon taxes of course that's going to be passed on to the consumer but within this agreement which
[03:47:50.900 --> 03:47:56.020]  is going to be voted on by the unelected EU the basically just going to rubber stamp it in january
[03:47:56.020 --> 03:48:03.140]  or february it has a direct carbon tax on citizens and they admit this is going to cause yellow vest
[03:48:03.140 --> 03:48:09.700]  style riots across the continent this video is called this is scary we're going to play the first
[03:48:09.700 --> 03:48:19.700]  three minutes 40 of it let's roll it here it is sometimes a new story comes along and you just
[03:48:19.700 --> 03:48:25.700]  think how is this not the top headline all over the western world this is easily one of the biggest
[03:48:25.700 --> 03:48:31.300]  developments of the year if not the past 30 years and it just slipped out with virtually no one
[03:48:31.300 --> 03:48:37.700]  grasping its true implications last night the unelected totalitarian EU just announced the
[03:48:37.700 --> 03:48:44.980]  world's first direct carbon tax on individuals how is everyone not freaking out over this EU
[03:48:44.980 --> 03:48:50.260]  approved co2 tax on heating and transport the new carbon price will apply to petrol diesel and
[03:48:50.260 --> 03:48:56.260]  heating fuels such as natural gas beginning in 2027 they're going to start adding on carbon tax
[03:48:56.260 --> 03:49:01.780]  whenever you pay your heating bill or fill up at the pump the new scheme will entail higher prices
[03:49:01.780 --> 03:49:06.660]  at the pump up to 10.5 cents for a liter of petrol and 12 cents for diesel according to a study by
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:11.300]  the Potsdam Institute for climate research heating fuels like gas heating oil and coal will see their
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:17.220]  prices increase as well AFP confirms the agreement also aims to make households pay for emissions
[03:49:17.220 --> 03:49:22.340]  linked to fuel and gas heating from 2027 of course they'll start off small to get everyone used to
[03:49:22.340 --> 03:49:27.940]  it oh just a tiny bit extra to save the planet then it's the slippery slope to an enviro feudal
[03:49:27.940 --> 03:49:32.500]  hellscape they're also imposing more of this on industries and energy companies which will then
[03:49:32.500 --> 03:49:38.340]  just pass their costs on to the consumer dutch media outlet nos confirms citizens and companies
[03:49:38.340 --> 03:49:42.660]  will have to pay for the co2 from the exhaust and the chimney this goes through energy companies
[03:49:42.660 --> 03:49:47.140]  and pumping stations they have to pay for emission rights and then charge the costs to the cost
[03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:51.700]  to the customer who comes to fill up or turn on the gas heater michael bloss a green lawmaker who
[03:49:51.700 --> 03:49:59.060]  took part in the final negotiations said this citizens in the EU must expect higher co2 prices
[03:50:00.420 --> 03:50:05.700]  they admit the talks were dragged out quote because of the political sensitivity of introducing
[03:50:05.700 --> 03:50:11.220]  what many will perceive as a new tax but it was approved even against the advice of the chairman
[03:50:11.220 --> 03:50:16.580]  of the EU's own environmental committee pascal can finne can finne said the proposal was quote
[03:50:16.580 --> 03:50:22.820]  politically suicidal and risked triggering a european wide protest movement similar to the
[03:50:22.820 --> 03:50:31.300]  yellow vests in france the yellow vest uprising began in rural areas as a revolt against fuel
[03:50:31.300 --> 03:50:36.580]  tax hikes and ended up paralyzing the entire country the technocrats themselves admit that
[03:50:36.580 --> 03:50:43.220]  this new carbon tax is so onerous and odious they fear the reaction to it will be continent level
[03:50:43.220 --> 03:50:48.180]  riots and civil unrest what happened in the netherlands is just a taste of what's to come
[03:50:48.180 --> 03:50:53.460]  authorities fired live rounds at dutch protesters including a 16 year old boy the clashes ensued
[03:50:53.460 --> 03:50:58.820]  after nationwide former protests against drastic green agenda nitrogen cuts which would see their
[03:50:58.820 --> 03:51:04.340]  livelihoods devastated in order to comply with globalist technocratic rules on climate change
[03:51:04.340 --> 03:51:10.020]  cuts farmers would be paid by the government not to produce food while 30 percent of farms would
[03:51:10.020 --> 03:51:15.220]  be forced to close down for good this war on farmers is also playing out in germany and other
[03:51:15.220 --> 03:51:21.540]  european countries to make this new carbon tax quote politically acceptable the EU has promised
[03:51:21.540 --> 03:51:26.820]  a social climate fund to help with the cost something that will obviously be later withdrawn
[03:51:26.820 --> 03:51:31.300]  once everyone is acclimatized to their new serfdom and even the same technocrats behind
[03:51:31.300 --> 03:51:36.900]  this new carbon tax admit that this social climate fund won't be enough to soften the burden on
[03:51:36.900 --> 03:51:43.060]  households and americans sorry to alarm you but your next climate reparations paid to the third
[03:51:43.060 --> 03:51:49.300]  world the last damage fund though i mean is there going to have to be us taxpayer money that helps
[03:51:49.300 --> 03:51:53.060]  the united states and presumably the united states is going to have to be one of the nations that
[03:51:53.060 --> 03:52:00.900]  contributes great if there were some now that is what has been announced this week as a result of
[03:52:00.900 --> 03:52:04.900]  this vote that took place so this it wasn't even a vote they just announced it they're going to have
[03:52:04.900 --> 03:52:11.060]  a rubber stamp vote in january then we had another revelation a couple of days later which brings us
[03:52:11.060 --> 03:52:17.780]  to our next video this was admitted way back in january 2021 it was published by Deutsche Bank in
[03:52:17.780 --> 03:52:25.380]  a research report and wait until you find out what they said would be necessary to achieve this net
[03:52:25.380 --> 03:52:33.460]  zero agenda by 2050 under the guise of global warming hysteria this is called hidden in plain
[03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:40.260]  sight let's roll it sometimes the true agenda behind net zero slips out because these technocrats
[03:52:40.260 --> 03:52:44.820]  can't help themselves getting all giddy about what they're really doing the latest example was
[03:52:44.820 --> 03:52:50.340]  discovered in a document first released last year by Deutsche Bank research the document reveals
[03:52:50.340 --> 03:52:57.220]  what the EU must do to achieve climate neutrality net zero by 2050 guess what this says they're
[03:52:57.220 --> 03:53:02.980]  going to have to impose an eco tyranny dictatorship but it's for the planet so totalitarianism can be
[03:53:02.980 --> 03:53:09.700]  a good thing right the document talks about the need to change the consumption habits of the ordinary
[03:53:09.700 --> 03:53:15.700]  citizens even on minutiae such as how often you use electronic devices and that quote climate policy
[03:53:15.700 --> 03:53:21.380]  comes in the form of higher taxes and fees on energy which may heating and mobility more expensive
[03:53:21.380 --> 03:53:27.220]  how you travel how you heat your home how much meat and even exotic fruit you eat will all be
[03:53:27.220 --> 03:53:32.260]  under scrutiny quote if we really want to achieve climate neutrality we need to change our behavior
[03:53:32.260 --> 03:53:36.660]  in all these areas of life that means that carbon prices will have to rise considerably
[03:53:36.660 --> 03:53:42.820]  in order to nudge people to change their behavior and here's the kicker i know that eco dictatorship
[03:53:42.820 --> 03:53:47.620]  is a nasty word but we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may
[03:53:47.620 --> 03:53:54.020]  be willing to accept some kind of eco dictatorship in the form of regulatory law in order to move
[03:53:54.020 --> 03:54:00.100]  towards climate neutrality eco dictatorship right there in black and white that's them admitting
[03:54:00.100 --> 03:54:05.220]  it eco dictatorship i don't really have to tell you what the word dictatorship means do i remember
[03:54:05.220 --> 03:54:09.780]  what stanley johnson said about net zero and it's that means actually some of us are told
[03:54:09.780 --> 03:54:14.820]  well you can't go on a plane that's fine that's part of the part of the national plan again hidden
[03:54:14.820 --> 03:54:21.140]  in plain sight it's all a massive con they just want absolute technocratic control over your every
[03:54:21.140 --> 03:54:26.660]  activity shockingly since people start adoring attention to this research paper it's mysteriously
[03:54:26.660 --> 03:54:31.060]  crashed and no one can see it anymore just a coincidence i'm sure i'm sure the guy who wrote
[03:54:31.060 --> 03:54:35.700]  this paper eric hayman has been sufficiently reprimanded eric don't tell him what we're
[03:54:35.700 --> 03:54:40.260]  actually planning to do people might start waking up quicker they might begin to realize the agenda
[03:54:40.260 --> 03:54:49.140]  and start doing something to resist it eric we can't have that now these eco activists who of
[03:54:49.140 --> 03:54:52.980]  course as i've explained many times before i'm talking about just stop oil i'm talking about
[03:54:52.980 --> 03:54:58.580]  extinction rebellion they're the foot soldiers of the globalist technocrats they're all pushing
[03:54:58.580 --> 03:55:03.860]  in the same direction it's just the eco deranged mentalist activists want to go there a bit quicker
[03:55:04.420 --> 03:55:08.660]  they claim they're part of the rebellion they're actually a fundamental integral part of the
[03:55:08.660 --> 03:55:14.100]  establishment they're out annoying people once again because again doesn't matter what public
[03:55:14.100 --> 03:55:20.420]  approval they have they don't need the public support they're shock troops for the establishment
[03:55:20.420 --> 03:55:25.460]  they're out there to try and convince people that this is a climate emergency they're out there
[03:55:25.460 --> 03:55:31.380]  to gin up the hysteria and the moral panic they're out there to be a visual reminder just like the
[03:55:31.380 --> 03:55:36.980]  masks were the visual reminder for the pandemic for people to stay in their lanes and not question
[03:55:36.980 --> 03:55:43.540]  anything that's the role that the eco climate protesters serve is to be that visual reminder
[03:55:43.540 --> 03:55:48.180]  that we're supposedly in a climate emergency when we know that that of course is all bollocks
[03:55:48.180 --> 03:55:52.660]  the earth's climate has always changed it will continue to change whatever humans do
[03:55:53.460 --> 03:55:59.380]  eco activists decapitate landmark christian tree this is in germany where climate protesters
[03:55:59.380 --> 03:56:04.340]  locked off top of a christmas tree at berlin's brandenburg gate on wednesday group responsible
[03:56:04.340 --> 03:56:08.660]  has led a months-long campaign of tragic traffic disruption and vandalism but again they don't
[03:56:08.660 --> 03:56:13.220]  care about it because they don't need public support the u.s has spawned an entire generation
[03:56:13.220 --> 03:56:18.740]  of kid ults that simply simply refuse to grow up 50 percent now of young adults between the
[03:56:18.740 --> 03:56:24.340]  ages of 18 and 29 are living with one or both parents that ties into this story of course
[03:56:24.340 --> 03:56:28.500]  part of the reason for that is crippling student debt the fact that homes are unaffordable but it's
[03:56:28.500 --> 03:56:34.900]  not the only reason there's a general crisis of masculinity where people are remaining impermanent
[03:56:34.900 --> 03:56:40.180]  adolescence into their 30s and 40s because they don't have any good masculine male role models
[03:56:40.180 --> 03:56:46.100]  anymore adults are buying toys for themselves and it's the biggest source of growth for the industry
[03:56:46.100 --> 03:56:55.460]  report cmbc one fourth of the adult toy industry is now being supported nine billion dollars a year
[03:56:55.460 --> 03:57:02.100]  by kid ults these are adults buying action figurines for themselves and again you know if you want
[03:57:02.100 --> 03:57:06.900]  to buy an action figurine and one of your favorite shows or something as a one-off that's one thing
[03:57:06.900 --> 03:57:14.100]  but when you have wall-to-wall frigging funko pops when you have adult lego sets adult coloring
[03:57:14.100 --> 03:57:22.580]  books and your entire identity is predicated around marvel and dc comics and superheroes in the cinema
[03:57:23.380 --> 03:57:28.260]  that's a bit of a problem isn't it and we're seeing this kid ults trend grow and grow and grow
[03:57:28.260 --> 03:57:34.420]  as masculinity becomes more and more derided more and more vilified more and more monstered by the
[03:57:34.420 --> 03:57:41.140]  establishment by the institutions by the culture and it's a crisis that will continue to be exacerbated
[03:57:41.140 --> 03:57:45.380]  that's going to wrap it up war room is next summit dot news don't go away we'll be back
