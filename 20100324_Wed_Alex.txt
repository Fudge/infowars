[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:23.000]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.000 --> 00:33.480]  welcome ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us we attempt to defend the
[00:33.480 --> 00:41.000]  Republic against the eugenics-driven world government openly taking over the
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.800]  entire planet right now okay I've had even more time to read the final version
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.400]  of the bill that Obama signed but it's not the final version that's now law but
[00:52.400 --> 00:56.640]  now that people are distracted and think that the deal is done one bill is done
[00:56.640 --> 01:01.400]  they're having a reconciliation bill in the Senate for all the pork barrel and
[01:01.400 --> 01:06.120]  goodies and national ID card information they want to add into it
[01:06.120 --> 01:12.920]  there is a national ID card provision in the current bill but now they can
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.560]  basically add amnesty to it just anything else they want and the public is
[01:18.560 --> 01:22.360]  not focused in on what's happening in the Senate so this is a separate bill now
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.720]  they're he's saying he'll just sign that but he's already got this and it's bad
[01:26.720 --> 01:30.840]  enough so we're going to be walking through all of that today also look at
[01:30.840 --> 01:36.000]  the economy and what this health care bill is going to do to it 72% of
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.840]  Democrats 84% of Republicans and 80% of independents think the economy could
[01:40.840 --> 01:47.480]  collapse that's national news out of the associated press and I want to go over
[01:47.480 --> 01:53.920]  the states going into bankruptcy or others on the verge of bankruptcy the
[01:53.920 --> 01:57.560]  Federal Reserve is also announced a big power grab and the bill has moved to the
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.880]  Senate to give them even more control the private banks over our country they've
[02:01.880 --> 02:06.800]  got other legislation moving through where they can just arrest US citizens
[02:06.800 --> 02:11.280]  and torture you for no reason it actually says the military will grab you
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.320]  and torture you quote interrogate you enhance interrogation they've got the
[02:17.320 --> 02:20.800]  Cybersecurity Act raising to the Senate to literally shut down the web the
[02:20.800 --> 02:24.880]  president wants that's even Reuters that's not Alex Jones saying that I mean
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.160]  that it really does that if you it's happening they're taking over on every
[02:30.160 --> 02:33.400]  front they played possum for a few months on the health care bill to get
[02:33.400 --> 02:38.560]  everybody to kind of dissipate their fury so we thought that we were winning
[02:38.560 --> 02:46.040]  same thing with the global carbon tax legislation that's passed the houses in
[02:46.040 --> 02:49.760]  the Senate now they're gonna try to race that through blanket total amnesty all
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.280]  illegal aliens legalized and US citizens like to have a worker ID card to work
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.400]  and the illegals are just legalized and given it if they wanted if not they're
[02:58.400 --> 03:03.720]  selectively left alone I did a lot of research last night a lot of research
[03:03.720 --> 03:09.760]  this morning a lot of research before I went live and I just I'm overwhelmed I
[03:09.760 --> 03:16.880]  mean it's I cannot articulate I cannot explain to you just how dire our
[03:16.880 --> 03:22.120]  straights are this radio broadcast is not hyperbole it's not exaggeration it's
[03:22.120 --> 03:29.040]  not fear mongering I cannot even put it in words I've studied history I've
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.280]  studied the Constitution I've studied who the elite are and what their plan is
[03:33.280 --> 03:38.840]  and I cannot articulate to you just how wicked and ruthless and sadistic the
[03:38.840 --> 03:44.160]  controllers are I mean if it was just a bunch of idiots in government they would
[03:44.160 --> 03:48.720]  screw everything up and drive us into bankruptcy but these are not idiots they
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.200]  know exactly what they're doing and they have scientifically studied how to dumb
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.640]  people down they know how human beings tick how we operate and they've got this
[03:57.640 --> 04:03.800]  giant scientific military industrial banking pharmacological mind control
[04:03.800 --> 04:11.040]  complex that is just waging war on humanity and the general public obsessed
[04:11.040 --> 04:19.200]  with bobbles and trinkets and Hannah Montana and all of this has no idea I
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.120]  mean if you focus on this 24-7 it's hard to even fully grasp it and understand
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.480]  it the depth of the wickedness the depth of the evil the depth of the
[04:30.480 --> 04:37.920]  corruption and envy and control and I mean I am fully focused on this and can
[04:37.920 --> 04:46.400]  barely grasp it and I just can't imagine the general public it has no idea what
[04:46.400 --> 04:54.960]  we're already it's already happening to us what we're in store for I'm gonna just
[04:54.960 --> 05:02.480]  hit some of the headlines hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[05:02.480 --> 05:06.040]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[05:06.040 --> 05:09.800]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[05:09.800 --> 05:13.520]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[05:13.520 --> 05:16.760]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[05:16.760 --> 05:20.880]  again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[05:20.880 --> 05:26.280]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[08:40.560 --> 08:44.480]  intensify see what happened is the social engineers have studied other
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.320]  societies our criminal government has funded over a hundred nations overthrow
[08:49.320 --> 08:56.120]  by the CIA with dictators or plutocracies they put into place they know
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.080]  that you're going to resist this because they're just getting started
[09:00.080 --> 09:04.120]  squeezing you and driving you into revolt and now they've set up the
[09:04.120 --> 09:09.400]  Homeland Security surveillance grid they've militarized the police police all
[09:09.400 --> 09:14.120]  over the country are announcing cable repair people taxi drivers truck drivers
[09:14.120 --> 09:18.920]  children all being recruited to spy on everything you're doing open reports in
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.640]  thousands of schools we know of where the children as part of their assignment
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.560]  write reports on their parents openly they are busing children nationwide to
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.560]  have abortions without their parents knowing that's in the news today they
[09:32.560 --> 09:39.280]  are poisoning the water supply they it's ladies and gentlemen 99% of the time
[09:39.280 --> 09:44.120]  governments go bad and mass murdering killers get into control the worst
[09:44.120 --> 09:49.360]  people always get into control of a country because they have the will
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.440]  they're willing to work with other criminals and they have a desire and
[09:53.440 --> 10:00.480]  an appetite for destruction and it's like if you went into the doctor and they
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.600]  said you have the worst inoperable cancer there is you have a giant brain
[10:05.600 --> 10:09.680]  tumor in your brainstem there is nothing we can do you'll be dead in a month
[10:09.680 --> 10:13.800]  there is nothing they can do about that type of tumor and that's basically what
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.120]  America has we have to completely take the federal government over via the
[10:18.120 --> 10:23.320]  states and if that won't work I am never been for this but I will tell you now
[10:23.320 --> 10:29.800]  we don't have a country we don't have a government we have a lawless illegitimate
[10:29.800 --> 10:37.120]  100% criminal group absolutely by any measurement and I guess all we can do
[10:37.120 --> 10:48.880]  is go for full secession it's just they have premeditatedly prepared for war
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.040]  with the people they know full well the only response we've got and they want
[10:54.040 --> 10:57.560]  to drive it into violence now people are waking up and getting concerned but they
[10:57.560 --> 11:05.480]  don't care if the polls now show over 80% a month ago it was 70 plus over 80% know
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.600]  the health care bills illegal most the Democrats don't even want it most
[11:10.600 --> 11:18.440]  Americans believe the country is going to collapse it is collapsing this is
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.080]  happening so fast it's one thing to know all this was being set up and coming
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.560]  but it's another thing to be here and to know the next step in all of this where
[11:26.560 --> 11:33.320]  we're going it's just we have to repent as a country ladies and gentlemen we
[11:33.320 --> 11:38.320]  have to get our priorities straight there should be no more ball games you
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.240]  mean none of you should be going to ball games even your children's ball games
[11:42.240 --> 11:47.560]  this is so serious everything has to be dropped everything has to stop people
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.720]  need to have national strikes people need to be flooding the churches
[11:51.720 --> 12:00.520]  repenting but the churches are devil run in most cases it it's like living in
[12:00.520 --> 12:06.160]  1938 Germany and I'm sitting here on the radio and Hitler is openly announcing
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.000]  he's getting ready to shut down the radio they're announcing they can
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.920]  completely shut down the web that they may do it they're openly announcing that
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.960]  they're gonna arrest us citizens with no charges and torture you they have
[12:17.960 --> 12:22.880]  legislation to do it they're already doing it they are brainwashing the
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.400]  police against the public they're brainwashing the military the police and
[12:26.400 --> 12:29.840]  military are waking up in many cases they're robbing nations all over the
[12:29.840 --> 12:36.680]  world there's exact same programs been launched everywhere I've got mainline
[12:36.680 --> 12:42.880]  reports of TSA workers putting women in in England and the US and saying look
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.880]  at their look at their bleeping breast oh I love them and recording it and
[12:48.880 --> 12:56.840]  printing it off and then they don't even get in trouble and just and the
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.400]  government is hiring all of these stupid criminals to work for them just
[13:00.400 --> 13:12.680]  morons on power trips the Houston police are announcing they're gonna run
[13:12.680 --> 13:16.200]  warrantless checkpoints everywhere
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.320]  all right I've got to settle down it it's just it's really even hitting me
[13:23.320 --> 13:30.880]  harder than it's ever hit just how much trouble this society is in I mean you
[13:30.880 --> 13:33.600]  know what happened in China you know what happened in Russia you know what
[13:33.600 --> 13:36.160]  happened in Germany you know what's happened in hundreds of different
[13:36.160 --> 13:41.920]  nations the last 80 years and and it's happening here and they've done it
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.280]  scientifically they have figured out every step of what they're doing it's
[13:46.280 --> 13:51.160]  all compartmentalized if I could just let the police and military know what I
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.480]  know if you just knew what I knew if you knew that I'm a hundred percent right
[13:55.480 --> 14:00.440]  that I've dotted every eye crossed every T I know what I'm talking about but
[14:00.440 --> 14:07.360]  just look around you this is tyranny this is evil and it's been going on for a
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.760]  long time before Obama he's just a frontman he's birdcage liner they put
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.840]  him in the New World Order puts out its unpopular illegal agenda and then in
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.400]  four years they pull out that piece of birdcage newspaper covered with garbage
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.680]  and they stick a new one in and everybody blames the birdcage liner instead
[14:26.680 --> 14:29.680]  of the bird the New World Order bird that's sitting up there on its perch
[14:29.680 --> 14:35.600]  gobbling up humanity's abstinence eating out our substance and then
[14:35.600 --> 14:42.040]  crapping all over us I'm focusing on the bird not on the birdcage liner George
[14:42.040 --> 14:51.520]  Bush Sarah Palin John McCain Barack Obama it's so elementary and I mean I
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.640]  have stacks of news with the country and the world is going bankrupt by design
[14:55.640 --> 14:59.600]  and we have the IMF World Bank documents we know who the criminals are we know
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.360]  who the social engineers are we know who's doing this look at this 70% of
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.000]  Democrats 84% of Republicans 80% of independents think the economy could
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.520]  collapse here's another one Bloomberg sales of US homes drop in February the
[15:13.520 --> 15:19.040]  lowest on record because the so-called bailout wasn't designed for the houses
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.640]  it was designed to get the banks flush with cash to consolidate the economy
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.640]  during the implosion here's another one states sue over overhaul that will bus
[15:26.640 --> 15:34.080]  state budgets it's designed to that's another Bloomberg massive job cuts
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.800]  projected for New York City 19,000 will be laid off 3,100 less cops 1,000 less
[15:39.800 --> 15:46.480]  firefighters see they're gonna cut all of the services but then raise all the
[15:46.480 --> 15:53.880]  taxes New York's past what 81 new taxes New York State the city's passing a
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.600]  bunch of taxes everything goes to the bankers you understand this is like
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.120]  living in Mexico folks or third-world country it's been done to everybody else
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.800]  they're doing it here you understand four-day school weeks might be coming in
[16:08.800 --> 16:15.560]  Illinois state is bankrupt this is out of CBS news they've already got a lot of
[16:15.560 --> 16:18.360]  government employees in California working four days a week and working the
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.240]  fifth day for free it's called slavery and it's gonna happen to everybody
[16:22.240 --> 16:28.160]  Greece to default at some point UBS Donovan says Bloomberg mainstream news
[16:28.160 --> 16:31.560]  says we're getting ready to default or lose our triple-a rating Portugal's
[16:31.560 --> 16:39.480]  debt rating lowered by Fitch on finances Bloomberg Portugal's going under and I've
[16:39.480 --> 16:45.120]  I've read the bill and I I'd heard analyst on seeing it in Fox actually
[16:45.120 --> 16:50.040]  admit this over the weekend but it turns out this that the health bill will not
[16:50.040 --> 16:55.240]  cover people it still allows insurance companies to kick pre-existing folks off
[16:55.240 --> 16:58.080]  you're not gonna get anything for free all you're gonna get some big fat tax
[16:58.080 --> 17:05.000]  increase here it is AP gap in health care laws protection for children hours
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.040]  after president Barack Obama signed historic health care in the legislation
[17:08.040 --> 17:11.920]  a potential problem emerged oh it's potential administration officials are
[17:11.920 --> 17:15.840]  now scrambling to fix a gap oh yeah in highly touted benefits for children
[17:15.840 --> 17:20.120]  Obama made better coverage for children a centerpiece of his health care remake
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.760]  but it turns out the letter of the law provided less than complete guarantee
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.400]  that kids with health problems would not be shut out of coverage under the new
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.240]  law insurance companies still would be able to refuse new coverage of children
[17:32.240 --> 17:35.800]  because of a pre-existing medical condition folks the way I read it it's
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.280]  the whole thing's a blank check of power to the insurance companies and the
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.000]  government insurance companies wrote this so it makes you buy the care and
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.640]  then they don't give it to you and we've got the actual subsection of the bill I
[17:47.640 --> 17:54.640]  talked to my aunt last night she said she's a sharp knife in the drawer she's
[17:54.640 --> 17:58.040]  a smart cookie she said why have you talked about the national ID card
[17:58.040 --> 18:03.440]  provision more and she says it's in there and so we did pull it up this
[18:03.440 --> 18:06.720]  morning it did pass in the law now again you already have a national ID card
[18:06.720 --> 18:10.080]  through your driver's license but this is an expansion of the ID card a
[18:10.080 --> 18:17.160]  separate medical car ID where you have to have this tied to your taxes and where

[18:48.040 --> 18:52.360]  that matters is your freedom your autonomy your liberty your right to

[19:13.760 --> 19:18.320]  you're saying why is this guy so upset there's something wrong with you there's
[19:18.320 --> 19:24.560]  nothing wrong with me okay in fact there is something wrong with me I should be
[19:24.560 --> 19:31.680]  more upset but by degrees they've trained us to be slaves and now we're going

[24:52.440 --> 24:59.720]  intellectually just calm down because at an instinctive level my body has got
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.720]  me in war mode just like if I had ancestors 10,000 years ago that saw
[25:05.720 --> 25:09.840]  enemy scouts come up over the hill of the village and then I run up to the hill
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.680]  top and see an army coming to take my family into bondage you better believe
[25:14.680 --> 25:23.120]  I'd get chills and I'd get my axe or my club and I'd rally the men to fight or to
[25:23.120 --> 25:31.200]  at least try to flee but this is a high-tech system it's all packaged and
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.880]  slicked up by the media and Harvard lawyers sit up there and their three
[25:35.880 --> 25:44.400]  four thousand dollar suits and read off teleprompters spew their lies I remember
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.520]  reading in the late 90s Rand Corporation and Pentagon documents how they plan to
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.080]  turn American to a total police state so I started warning people and I explained
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.440]  this would take time and they need to stage terror attacks to get it done
[25:55.440 --> 26:01.320]  because the white papers put out by Brzezinski and Cheney and others that
[26:01.320 --> 26:06.240]  we've sourced here thousands of times thousands of times PNAC September 22,000
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.440]  and others that they'd need to stage terror attacks to get you to accept the
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.680]  police state never knowing it was for you and then once they push you into
[26:15.680 --> 26:19.160]  resisting in any way you're gonna be called a terrorist and drug off to a
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.560]  torture camp and now they've got the legislation introduced to do that on
[26:25.560 --> 26:30.400]  paper saying citizens will be handed over to the Pentagon for interrogation
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.840]  for any reason for intelligence or any reason deemed by the president I mean
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.200]  this is this is illegal evil these people are crooks they are and they've
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.440]  committed thousands and thousands of crimes and they're going for broke they're
[26:45.440 --> 26:48.520]  not gonna stop they're committed it's like a bank robber who's already robbed
[26:48.520 --> 26:53.640]  20 banks why not rob a hundred more it's like some serial killer that's
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.720]  already killed four or five people why not kill 20 more it's like Hitler once
[26:58.720 --> 27:03.080]  he'd already invaded Poland and Czechoslovakia why not go into France do
[27:03.080 --> 27:07.960]  you got it they're committed they've released they've dropped the bomb and
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.840]  they're gonna drop a lot more and all the police out there you better research
[27:13.840 --> 27:17.800]  history right now you better even if you don't believe in God you better go
[27:17.800 --> 27:23.200]  close you know the bedroom door and get on your knees and ask God to open up
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.440]  your eyes and take those blinders off your stinking eyeballs to open up the
[27:28.440 --> 27:32.880]  windows into your soul to get some sunshine in there because let me tell
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.000]  you something for anybody who's got a nickel worth of discernment anybody
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.920]  that's got a nickel worth of common sense you know we're staring down the
[27:40.920 --> 27:53.680]  barrel of pure evil oh makes oh oh no these aren't fake glenbeck tears right
[27:53.680 --> 28:04.520]  now I got tears coming out my eyes right now because my soul is in anguish

[28:12.240 --> 28:15.840]  built around us knowing it's for all these innocent people and knowing this
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.600]  system loves to hurt children if they'll kill a million Iraqis to sell some
[28:20.600 --> 28:25.600]  weapons and to get some oil do you think if they don't care about a million
[28:25.600 --> 28:32.320]  plus Iraqis you think they care one cent about your butt or my sorry but
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.160]  they're in power because they're ruthless and we need to grow up and get
[28:37.160 --> 28:43.560]  serious nothing can stop us if the men of this country and the women of this
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.280]  country will stop caring about entertainment and movies and stupid
[28:48.280 --> 28:52.840]  ball games and we'll really get serious and do more than just go to tea parties

[35:21.600 --> 35:25.840]  de facto internment camp they're gonna have automatic rifles at these checkpoints
[35:25.840 --> 35:31.480]  randomly taking your blood I mean you cannot come up with something this evil
[35:31.480 --> 35:39.800]  on your own only government always surpasses you imagine in German newsreels
[35:39.800 --> 35:43.240]  that they were taking blood at checkpoints papers please blood please
[35:43.240 --> 35:48.240]  then you've got TSA workers and British TSA workers it's all the same system
[35:48.240 --> 35:52.920]  announcing that they're gonna expand nationwide worldwide with checkpoints
[35:52.920 --> 35:56.640]  mobile vans that's now in congressional testimony that it's gonna be the
[35:56.640 --> 36:02.600]  national police force a bunch of minimum wage workers are close to it with
[36:02.600 --> 36:08.680]  weapons who openly record your naked body break child porn laws and then
[36:08.680 --> 36:13.040]  laugh at you while they do it and that's back in the news and then separately
[36:13.040 --> 36:21.600]  over a million US school children to be given Rotorix retro virus vaccine
[36:21.600 --> 36:31.400]  contaminated with pig cancer virus that humans can contract that's CNN here's
[36:31.400 --> 36:37.320]  another one out of China fact I had it here in the stack will you guys print
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.920]  me the China all the deaths from vaccine there I just and I had another
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.880]  article about people dying in China from the H1N1 shot which they've now
[36:46.880 --> 36:57.000]  recalled I just I've got all the UN documents all the US government documents
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.640]  all the British government documents I made a film about it called in game
[36:59.640 --> 37:04.120]  three years ago as a full bibliography online it was the in-game comm all of
[37:04.120 --> 37:07.760]  it proven just like a book has a bibliography at the end this film has a
[37:07.760 --> 37:12.560]  bibliography how they openly say they're poisoning your water and have
[37:12.560 --> 37:18.520]  genetically engineered the GMO crops to sterilize you and they're killing us it
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.360]  doesn't get worse than this but now they're going to start turning the heat
[37:22.360 --> 37:30.800]  up power companies nationwide announcing the remote controlling your power
[37:30.800 --> 37:34.160]  they're going to decide what temp your house can be laptops issued by the
[37:34.160 --> 37:37.200]  federal government through public schools watching the parents and kids at
[37:37.200 --> 37:40.640]  home and the government brags and says it's good I mean this day it's worse
[37:40.640 --> 37:53.040]  than 1984 and what's coming next is the big question okay I'm gonna go to calls
[37:53.040 --> 38:01.120]  and then I'm going to next hour start getting into all of this I'm gonna
[38:01.120 --> 38:03.840]  recap what's in the health bill get into some areas we haven't gotten into the
[38:03.840 --> 38:10.400]  national ID card how the IRS is gonna run your life it's all coming up and
[38:10.400 --> 38:15.600]  the states are saying they're going to pass laws against it we've got to keep
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.480]  the pressure on them
[38:23.280 --> 38:29.720]  Jim in Illinois you're on the air hey Alex how you doing the answer to 1984 1776
[38:29.720 --> 38:34.720]  correct yes okay if I may quote for a second there is another way whereby
[38:34.720 --> 38:38.200]  governments are dissolved that is when the legislative or the executive either
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.320]  than that contrary to their trust first the legislative acts against the trust
[38:42.320 --> 38:45.440]  proposed in them when they endeavor to invade the property of the subject and
[38:45.440 --> 38:48.520]  make themselves or any part of the community masters or arbitrary
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.360]  dispositions of the lives liberties or fortunes of the people the reason why
[38:52.360 --> 38:56.680]  men are in there into society is the preservation of their property and then
[38:56.680 --> 38:59.600]  why they choose and authorize a legislative is that there may be laws
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.120]  made and rules set as guards and fences to the properties of all the members of
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.040]  society to limit the power and moderate the dominion of every party member of
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.760]  the site for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.320]  that the legislators should have a power to destroy that which everyone
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.440]  decides to secure by entering into society and for which the people submitted
[39:18.440 --> 39:22.720]  themselves to legislators in our own making whenever the legislators endeavor
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.080]  to take away and destroy the property of the people or reduce in the slavery
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.520]  under arbitrary power they put themselves into a state of war with the
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.440]  people for their palms all for many further obedience and left to the common
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.440]  refuge with God had provided for all men against force and violence when so
[39:37.440 --> 39:40.880]  ever therefore the legislative shelter and stress this fundamental rule of
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.680]  society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavor to grasp
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.800]  themselves or put in the hands of any other an absolute power over the lives
[39:49.800 --> 39:54.960]  liberties and estates of the people by this breach of trust they forfeit the
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.440]  power the people had put in their hands for quite contrary ends and it involves
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.720]  the people who have a right to resume their original liberty and by
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.200]  establishment of a new legislative such as a shall think fit provide for their
[40:07.200 --> 40:12.400]  own safety and security which is the end for which they are in society what I've
[40:12.400 --> 40:16.160]  said here concerning the legislative in general holds true also concerns the
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.520]  supreme executive let me stop you is that it is that George Washington or
[40:20.520 --> 40:24.200]  Thomas Jefferson well this is John Locke but that's what all these guys are
[40:24.200 --> 40:29.160]  reading at the time it's a yes foundation John Locke's essay and you can see a
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.600]  lot of John you can see a lot of John Locke's words in the Declaration of
[40:33.600 --> 40:39.320]  Independence go ahead yes we'll see okay let me get back this up who having
[40:39.320 --> 40:42.880]  double trust put in him both to have a part in the legislative and the supreme
[40:42.880 --> 40:47.440]  execution law acts against both when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.440]  will as a law of the society he acts also contrary to the trust when he either
[40:52.440 --> 40:57.040]  employs the force treasure and offices of the size society to corrupt the
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.920]  representatives and gain them to his purpose or openly pre-engaged the
[41:00.920 --> 41:05.240]  electors and prescribed to their choice such whom he has by solicitation
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.280]  stress promises or otherwise wanted his designs and employs him to bring in such
[41:10.280 --> 41:15.040]  who have promised beforehand what to vote and what to enact thus to regulate
[41:15.040 --> 41:19.360]  the candidates and electors and new model the ways of election what is to
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.600]  but to cut up the government by the roots and poison the very fountain of
[41:22.600 --> 41:26.520]  public security for the people having reserved themselves the choice of their
[41:26.520 --> 41:30.800]  representatives as a fence to their properties to do it for no other end but
[41:30.800 --> 41:35.840]  that they might always be freely chosen and so chosen freely act and advise as
[41:35.840 --> 41:41.000]  the necessity of the Commonwealth and the public good should upon examination
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.720]  and mature debate be judged to require this those who give their votes before
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.160]  they hear the debate and have way the reason on all sides are not capable of
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.960]  doing well Jim here here's the problem what you're reading is extremely
[41:52.960 --> 41:59.120]  powerful but your phone audio was very low and muffled but perhaps I have read
[41:59.120 --> 42:04.560]  that essay before I know I recognized it and it's all very eloquent and and and
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.840]  really is you know one of the major founts from which our Declaration of
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.360]  Independence streams so why don't you email that to show tips and info wars
[42:13.360 --> 42:18.600]  dot com we should probably post that I'll give us the name of the essay John
[42:18.600 --> 42:23.040]  Locke's essay concerning the true original extent and end of civil government it's
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.800]  like everybody must read this you're American you must read this because
[42:27.800 --> 42:32.800]  then you'll understand the declaration I send it send it to show tips John Locke's
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.000]  essay and we will perhaps I should read that on air Jim and I appreciate your
[42:39.000 --> 42:47.040]  call it's very simple we have a republic where if 99% of the population in a
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.920]  fake democracy said we're gonna kill the 1% and take their property you can't do
[42:51.920 --> 42:59.760]  it because in a democracy a pure democracy if 51% say kill the other 49
[42:59.760 --> 43:07.320]  or rob the other 49 or put the other 49 into slavery or tax them into submission
[43:07.320 --> 43:12.520]  it is your right and duty to throw that off that's just common law organic law
[43:12.520 --> 43:20.160]  God's law common sense and what's happened is special interests come in they buy
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.080]  off the politicians or they run their own politicians they get into government
[43:24.080 --> 43:29.480]  and they have the government then pass laws giving them more power and control
[43:29.480 --> 43:33.640]  and as the public begins to wake up to this they use the taxpayer money to set
[43:33.640 --> 43:41.440]  up a police state control grid this is a well thought out tyranny it's all been
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.680]  designed and crafted and lovingly expanded and the system has funded
[43:46.680 --> 43:51.040]  their own private interests their own police state control grid with our tax
[43:51.040 --> 43:56.160]  money so that so they become wealthy as they enslave us and so in a republic if
[43:56.160 --> 44:01.520]  51% say enslave the other 49 you can't do it because there's absolute rights of
[44:01.520 --> 44:06.960]  property and liberty and freedom and the minute you remove that you know they
[44:06.960 --> 44:12.080]  sell the mass oh we're a democracy it's what the people want no you've got the
[44:12.080 --> 44:16.240]  dumbed-down mass that's promised other people's money and treasure and land and
[44:16.240 --> 44:26.400]  they can be very cheaply bought off to man the military enforcement system to
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.600]  rob the other 49 but that's not even what we have here on the surface it's a
[44:31.600 --> 44:41.840]  democracy mob rule to sheep and I guess five wolves voting on what's for dinner
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.040]  the original Benjamin Franklin quote is two wolves and one sheep voting on what's
[44:46.040 --> 44:50.720]  for dinner you know the two wolves are going to vote and out vote the sheep and
[44:50.720 --> 44:56.400]  it's going to be dinner but in our case you got 300 million Americans and you've
[44:56.400 --> 45:01.680]  got a lot of stupid sheep who go and vote for the wolves to devour them because
[45:01.680 --> 45:04.520]  the wolves have basically convinced them that this is the best thing for them to
[45:04.520 --> 45:10.120]  do and this is the fundamental nature of corrupt government if it doesn't
[45:10.120 --> 45:12.320]  follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution of the people don't
[45:12.320 --> 45:19.600]  jealously guard their freedoms then you will always over time have corrupt
[45:19.600 --> 45:23.400]  people get into power they will kick out good people they will recruit more
[45:23.400 --> 45:29.040]  corrupt criminals into the system who enjoy petty power or who enjoy robbing
[45:29.040 --> 45:36.640]  the population becoming wealthy and powerful and you will get a tyranny
[45:36.640 --> 45:42.920]  and that's what's happening that's why this happens 99% of the time it happens
[45:42.920 --> 45:48.000]  to every civilization given enough time evil gets in gets control takes over
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.520]  and then robs everything to a point where the society collapses and generally
[45:54.520 --> 45:57.560]  it goes into another form of tyranny sometimes worse sometimes not as
[45:57.560 --> 46:03.560]  egregious but rarely but sometimes it happens you get more freedom out of the
[46:03.560 --> 46:07.480]  collapse now the system has written countless white papers about how they
[46:07.480 --> 46:10.600]  know this is going to collapse that their government takeover is going to
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.240]  collapse things and then out of that collapse they've set up a COG continuity
[46:15.240 --> 46:21.040]  government system to design the collapse and bring you into an even greater
[46:21.040 --> 46:27.480]  level of tyranny through the collapse that's what we talk about when we
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.800]  discuss a scientific dictatorship I mean this has all been thought out all
[46:32.800 --> 46:44.720]  pre-designed Eric in California you're on the air Alex good day to you brother
[46:44.720 --> 46:52.160]  welcome I think this is a great segue here my mom is a German immigrant I'm
[46:52.160 --> 46:55.640]  half German and since I was eight years old I studied the rise of Hitler and how
[46:55.640 --> 47:01.880]  it could have happened to to my my bloodline my people and I'm watching it
[47:01.880 --> 47:09.760]  unfold as we speak when I really started to see what the real fight is I
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.680]  started talking to the military and police every chance I got and I stroke
[47:14.680 --> 47:19.720]  fate I've been able to talk to two people involved in north com in the
[47:19.720 --> 47:27.520]  military and I confronted one who's ahead of me in line at a store and I
[47:27.520 --> 47:32.400]  got outside out front of the store with him and I asked him if I could speak to
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.400]  him he was in full dress officer's uniform on lunch break or whatever and I
[47:36.400 --> 47:42.040]  just flat out asked him I said sir do you stand with we the people and that's
[47:42.040 --> 47:46.080]  how I started the conversation I talked to him about north com north com
[47:46.080 --> 47:51.400]  requiring or requesting 400,000 troops and blah blah blah and he just assured
[47:51.400 --> 47:56.560]  me that federal troops would never be used on the people another incident I
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.000]  had they are being used that they've got beta tests going everywhere
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.720]  absolutely and another incident I was installing some some work at a home and
[48:07.720 --> 48:14.120]  it was when I discovered you know the adjuvant of the vaccine and I was just
[48:14.120 --> 48:21.040]  so distraught I knew this housewife of the military officer had two young
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.520]  children bright beautiful young girls and I just talked to her about the
[48:25.520 --> 48:32.120]  adjuvants in the vaccines and then I kind of segued into north com and she's
[48:32.120 --> 48:35.560]  like oh my husband works with north com I said yeah well did you know that they
[48:35.560 --> 48:40.840]  requested 400,000 troops to operate internally in the United States oh it
[48:40.840 --> 48:46.160]  will never get that bad it will never get that bad and I kind of made a
[48:46.160 --> 48:50.800]  mistake of trying to assure her that I wasn't some right wing crew that I
[48:50.800 --> 48:55.440]  didn't have any weapons and blah blah blah because of the my act report I
[48:55.440 --> 48:59.720]  don't know what she was privy to but she ended up calling my boss later and
[48:59.720 --> 49:04.440]  telling him how upsetting my conversation was with her and that she was
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.680]  contemplating calling the sheriff on which segues into why I really want to
[49:09.680 --> 49:17.160]  talk to you down here in San Diego we have we had a sheriff colander who was
[49:17.160 --> 49:23.520]  about to retire before he retired he basically quit or retired early and
[49:23.520 --> 49:27.640]  appointed Bill Gore now you might recognize that name apparently he was a
[49:27.640 --> 49:33.360]  fed worked with the FBI at Ruby Ridge now we're having an election coming up
[49:33.360 --> 49:42.520]  and now this gore is an incumbent and running for sheriff and I just want to
[49:42.520 --> 49:47.160]  know because I was getting a haircut yesterday and I sat down waited for my
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.920]  line now my turn in line and I actually sat next to the mother of one of the
[49:52.920 --> 49:56.960]  guys that's running against him and had a very good conversation about 10th
[49:56.960 --> 50:03.720]  amendment and the importance of sheriff and blah blah blah but what advice do
[50:03.720 --> 50:11.040]  you have what what kind of ammunition can I use to make sure that this this
[50:11.040 --> 50:16.600]  gore fellow is not well look you know he's not good any fed that they're
[50:16.600 --> 50:22.640]  running this is part of an admitted CIA Pentagon operation to secure every city
[50:22.640 --> 50:29.960]  under their control to secure narcotics routes you name it and so just do what
[50:29.960 --> 50:33.440]  you're doing but but that shows the mindset oh we're not in a police state
[50:33.440 --> 50:37.200]  but I'm gonna call your boss and I'm thinking about calling the cops on you
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.840]  because you were warning her about a takeover I mean this woman has no idea
[50:42.840 --> 50:46.440]  and she probably took her kids in and wonders why they got low IQs or can't
[50:46.440 --> 50:52.160]  talk at age five and you know you tried to warn her but she should won't wake up
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.080]  till her kids die of cancer at age 15 so you tried as best you could move on to
[50:56.080 --> 51:04.560]  other people you worry you see the signs and worry about the future you worry
[51:04.560 --> 51:07.680]  about economic turmoil and food shortages how to be prepared while
[51:07.680 --> 51:11.720]  preserving your sanity your answer may be at hand author Linda Runyon lived off
[51:11.720 --> 51:15.760]  the land isolated from civilization she knows that as long as the sun shines
[51:15.760 --> 51:19.880]  there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth perhaps the only
[51:19.880 --> 51:24.000]  sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants the cost of learning is
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  minimal wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere it's every
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.840]  bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets well respected in her

[52:05.320 --> 52:10.080]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[52:10.080 --> 52:14.200]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home

[56:23.920 --> 56:28.080]  myself a number of Americans especially in the South they're tired of it we're
[56:28.080 --> 56:33.100]  tired of I wonder why though for for over 14 years I've had people on message
[56:33.100 --> 56:37.160]  boards and emails and call the show and they say Alex you need to call for
[56:37.160 --> 56:41.880]  violence and then I never see them go out and commit the violence I mean you
[56:41.880 --> 56:45.520]  what you want me to who am I supposed to attack I mean tell me right now who am
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.240]  I supposed to go out and target today well let's start with the IRS we had a
[56:49.240 --> 56:53.520]  Boston Tea Party before the Revolutionary War we dumped tea we were tired of
[56:53.520 --> 56:57.280]  being taxed on tea well or are we tired of being taxed by federal income tax
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.280]  and illegal tax let's start with the IRS let's have our Boston Tea Party how
[57:02.280 --> 57:06.240]  many people have been dumb enough to file their taxes this year stop filing your
[57:06.240 --> 57:12.320]  taxes start that way well that's hold on hold on that's peaceful so I mean I
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.600]  thought you were look sir we are waking people up peacefully right now and this
[57:18.600 --> 57:22.200]  is a big wake-up call for folks and we're and we're trying through the
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.240]  states peacefully and it looks like we're gonna have success if we get
[57:25.240 --> 57:30.120]  involved and support them I've seen a lot of people who call for violence or
[57:30.120 --> 57:33.200]  just go get a shed out in the countryside and wait for the first
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.680]  government person to come on their property so they can kill them and then
[57:37.680 --> 57:40.600]  you got some stupid census worker comes knocking on the door and somebody
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.600]  shoots them they don't deserve to be killed they don't deserve a death penalty
[57:44.600 --> 57:48.520]  even if what they're doing is unconstitutional I mean you don't get
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.160]  up on the radio and and I mean I've seen this so many times and I'm not saying
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.360]  you're saying this Steve but that's where it sounded like it was going yeah
[57:57.360 --> 58:00.280]  and saying I'm not going to pay these illegal income taxes the private
[58:00.280 --> 58:05.200]  fellow reserve because it's paying for aborting babies I say more power to you
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.600]  then that's your personal stand okay but but but you were saying you know it's
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.520]  time for violence you know at the beginning I'm gonna come back to you
[58:14.520 --> 58:18.720]  after the break and let you clarify what you're saying we're going to try the
[58:18.720 --> 58:25.880]  route of the state legislatures nullifying this and saying no and then
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.880]  through our state supporting them but a lot of people just cop out and say I'm
[58:29.880 --> 58:34.680]  ready for war and then just sit there waiting for something no I'm gonna try

[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.480]  against the New World Order to go out and warn the people with our committees
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:41.440]  of correspondence as our founders did with the Sons of Liberty in the 15 plus
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:48.480]  years leading up to 1775 1776 with the gun confiscation that was not offensive
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.280]  that was defensive and on record the British fired first if you really
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.800]  study the history and if there's ever another Wayco that's probably when the
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.720]  war is going to start and a lot of you guys that talk big Steve here's the deal
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.640]  you call in and you say I want to know you know it's not a time to be depressed

[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.200]  I want to know if you're gonna be with the people as if I'm not with the people
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.000]  for 14 plus years putting my life on the line doing what I'm doing through all
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.480]  this persecution and demonization nationally okay and the Southern
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.540]  Private Law Center trying to pin dead cops on me to get law enforcement to go
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:32.440]  after me in a Psyop and then you shift gears and say well we should not pay
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:38.760]  our taxes that that that's another thing that is non-compliance and very
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:48.920]  constitutional but I don't deserve and I don't appreciate you just coming on the
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.920]  air in an accusatory turn tone like I am doing something bad you know I mean the
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.040]  world's full of these people that tell me what I need to do the things I need to
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.120]  do and what films I need to make and organizations I need to set up and found
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.280]  when we at this radio show and my films in my websites have done more than
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.880]  anyone else but Ron Paul if you got a single somebody out to really expose
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.760]  the enemy of this country you got over 80 percent of people it was 70 a few
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.720]  weeks ago against the health care takeover we're proving the these tyrants
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.680]  or tyrants we're making them act like dictators we're exposing the banking
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.080]  dictatorship they barely got this thing passed now they're trying their
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.960]  greenhouse gas tax we've got the states lining up to pass laws and say we're not
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.880]  gonna comply we need to go that route if the states would have done that in eight
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.160]  in in 1860 we wouldn't have had the civil war they'd have done it peacefully
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:50.640]  and with embargoes and with strikes and with other things and but no they let
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.840]  British intelligence manipulate them into a war that was meant to break up the
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.600]  whole country now it's come out that the feds are running fake white
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.160]  supremacists fake patriot sites fake al-qaeda sites trying to get attacks on
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:08.840]  u.s. forces in every case we look at the feds are bombing themselves and they
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.840]  know they've set up this grid that they're pushing you into real attacks
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.240]  and that's what they want now are you gonna give them what they want see it's
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.040]  real simple if I find out the new world order is for something I'm against it
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.080]  they're for open borders I'm against it they're for violent response I'm against
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.880]  it that's the only reason I've survived this long is because I have been savvy
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.800]  I've understood what's going on they tried to set me up more than a hundred
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.520]  times calling for violence okay in person they've tried this I am surveilled
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.160]  by the Pentagon I am surveilled by the FBI they have tried every dirty trick on
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.000]  the book on me and thanks to our listeners support and God Almighty
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.480]  support we are still here standing look at this which a tall eagle
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:58.920]  Democrats offices across the U.S. attacked now what exactly are you calling
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:07.240]  for Steve he just dropped off I mean call back in Steve I mean you need to
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.680]  figure out who the real enemy is here
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.400]  are you gonna stand with the people Alex it's time to you know we've tried
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:24.920]  doing this peacefully that might have been a setup right there but it's his
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:32.320]  tone and the way he sounded I just think he's ignorant you know I've seen a few
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:42.840]  things in my life and I'm the last person that wants violence I have told
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.440]  people to arm themselves and prepare to protect your families we're putting that
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:55.040]  call out right now for people to girt themselves or defense of the Republic but
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.160]  then there's a larger question of if you're gonna offensively go after
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:05.760]  somebody when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.680]  road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond

[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.400]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.560]  pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the

[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.520]  that you will target government buildings you need to say enough is enough
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.360]  we need to attack the government and they'll promise people livers who need
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.320]  livers they'll promise million dollars and it's always federal informants that
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.680]  found the groups and lead the groups and they go on the message boards in the
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:45.200]  chat rooms and say it's time for us to get violent you know who's with me
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.120]  you're not a real man if you don't commit to violence right now you know
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:56.280]  here in public on this radio show probably of cop probably a fed if not a
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.680]  useful idiot you know the system wants to have a war with the American people
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.520]  they've geared up for it they've put in the Pentagon grid they want it to be
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.440]  offensive they want the American people to attack the police and military so
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.600]  that we run a scyop for them so the police and military see the American
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:21.280]  people as the enemy they don't care a police and military die they love it we
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.720]  need to take our states back and criminally charge the private central
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.600]  banks with crime we need to abolish the fellow reserve kick them out of our
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:39.800]  country whoever fires first loses now if the feds are burning a church down I
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.600]  mean you know that's an offensive attack and propaganda wise it's gonna backfire
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.280]  on them give it that point people physically resist them that's why they
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.320]  don't like to have big public wake-os anymore that was a test remember John
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.840]  Joe Gray up in East Texas with his family he's been there now for what 11
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.880]  years with all these warrants out for his arrest and he's there saying come on
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.320]  in I'm ready to fight to the death and they don't go in because they know it's
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.080]  near Waco and they know the message it'll send
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:20.600]  what is he on like 40 acres or something on the Trinity River the feds
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.240]  want you to offensively go out I mean these guys that say it's time to have
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.520]  physical war with the government what do you do pick some cop coming out of a
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.240]  7-eleven with a cup of coffee what are you gonna go up and plug a hole in them
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.840]  and then they got a wife and kids you can't judge that guy's heart you don't
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.920]  know what he's done you can't be judge jury and executioner we are about due
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:46.840]  process of law here we're about justice and that's why when the cops put some
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.120]  teenager in handcuffs and shoot them in the back those cops deserve to go to
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:57.240]  prison but you just can't go grab a bunch of cops and hog time and then take
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:11.640]  them into some ditch and blow their heads off they beta tested in Seattle
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.880]  though they shut off the food and water for five days cut the police
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.160]  communication lines on record the sheriff went on ABC news and talked about
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.280]  it FEMA cut off their communication lines severed their communication tower
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.880]  as the storm blew in they were planning the whole thing
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.920]  feds blew the levies back in the 20s evidences they blew them again as a
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.240]  beta test and the first thing they did was not let people get out of the city
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.240]  on the high and dry highways they made them go to the Superdome where they got
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.440]  raped and robbed and they sat there with the military with the food and water
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.920]  for days under orders not to give it to them and then the police and big flat
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.920]  back trucks under Homeland Security FEMA and FBI command went in to the
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:01.320]  wealthiest areas put them in handcuffs and took their firearms remember that
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:08.640]  they were testing and I'm not saying it's a good thing but it's what's gonna
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.520]  happen as gun confiscation continues as they pass more laws there's a small
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.440]  percentage of people that just don't care anymore mainly veterans and they're
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.400]  going to have shootouts with police then they're going to get smart and stop
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.680]  waiting for the cops to come to them
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.880]  and the police and military need to know you think you had trouble with the
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.760]  Hodges as you like to call them the Afghans can shoot straight on average
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.960]  the Iraqis for some reason can't some of the worst marksmen out there they fire
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:51.520]  very emotionally they have a lot of courage if they're not cold about it
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:02.640]  I mean do you police have any idea of 150 million gun owners if 1% decides to
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:08.920]  fight you 1,500,000 and that's why they've got all these people online
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.920]  trying to draw out folks that are ready to fight Hal Turner and others I told
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.120]  you was a Fed for a decade now it's admitted who do you attack every day
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:25.800]  yours truly is a Fed and he was there to draw out people so they can arrest your
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:33.960]  butt you got the wrong show Steve and if you're not a Fed or a Southern
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:42.240]  Poverty Law Center operative or an ADL operative you better watch your butt
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.320]  because they'll haul you up there in front of television all in shackles how
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:53.520]  you were planning to attack some organization or group
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.040]  you know instead of talking about violence how about we take our state
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:10.280]  houses back peacefully how about we nullify these federal laws how about we
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.240]  take the city council back of Houston and say no to illegal checkpoints how
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.800]  about we call these different cable companies and people that are spying on
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.880]  you when you're in your house and make a big deal out of the fact and start
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.600]  boycotting them and turning the cable off because they do it how about we stop
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.080]  contributing to the system how about we repent to God and start spending all
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.360]  our free time educating our wives and children and our husbands about the New
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.320]  World Order and start small with attainable goals to start local
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:47.100]  organizations local cop watch organizations there's so much you can do
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.960]  by just getting active and mobilize that gets you up on your feet and off your
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.600]  butt and then a whole world of opportunity targets of opportunity a
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:03.840]  whole world of seek and destroy in the info war begins I mean you go to your
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.320]  state house with a video camera you're gonna catch bribery going on I've done
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.440]  it you're gonna catch all sorts of corruption you start you just pick a
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.920]  corrupt congressman in your town you start a blog about him you start
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.880]  tracking everything they do within six months you'll be in the local newspaper
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.560]  the information you you aggregate that you collect will then be used by local
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.520]  lazy reporters you just engage them everybody doing a little something
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.480]  everyone has this false image in their mind that you've got to fix it all
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.640]  yourself overnight I mean I've done an hour and 15 minutes here today and I
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:43.400]  haven't even plugged my films there is no better solution to unlock minds so
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.400]  people shadow the left right paradigm so that so the system doesn't alternate
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.320]  between Republican and Democrat oh the Democrats are babble put Republicans in
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:57.000]  all the Republicans are babble put Democrats in to identify the world
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.120]  government to identify the scientific dictatorship to identify the real
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.700]  enemies of humanity you've got to identify the enemy first you've got to
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.720]  reach out to police and military and say look at all this evidence of
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.520]  corruption and evil look at how our federal governments run by offshore
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:15.800]  banks choose a side and if you actually educate these men and women most of them
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.680]  are just brainwashed just like the public and they will wake up and become
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:29.440]  great patriots you don't want to fall into this us against them mentality
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.120]  Democrat offices across US attack now they get to play the part of little
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.920]  victims authorities not public servants but authorities in Wichita and some
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.880]  other cities across the country are investigating vandalism against
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.240]  Democratic offices apparently in response to health care reform now how
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.560]  many times of the Democrats and others been caught spray-panning swastikas on
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:01.080]  their own buildings panning the inward on their dorm doors most the time it's
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.200]  staged why see see me if it's so good to do violence why do they stage it
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.760]  against themselves
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.400]  why haven't they come to the guns at once why do they try it incrementally
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.680]  because if they come out for the guns and people die in fire fights with the
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.960]  police it will clearly be the police fault because they're engaged in pure
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.960]  tyranny and they will lose the moral high ground and then it will spread no
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.040]  they want to have this on their own terms attacks against government
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.120]  facilities to get the government all feeling sorry for itself and all the
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.480]  useful idiots that work for it so they'll go out and knock heads of the
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:48.280]  general public they want to do this their way we're gonna do it our way okay and
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.240]  I've already got the southern property law center within two hours of
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.600]  papuloski killing those cops saying it was my fault when it turned out that
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:59.600]  white supremacist hated my guts on every website he was on now why is that
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.600]  because I'm calling for violence no because I'm calling for non-violence I
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:12.760]  know how to beat these people I've studied history I know how to beat these
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.120]  people
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.920]  and on Monday a former Alabama militia leader took credit for instigating the
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.600]  actions Mike Vanderbough of Alabama former head of the Alabama Constitution
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.960]  militia put out a call on Friday for modern sons of liberty to break the
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.760]  windows of Democratic Party offices nationwide an opposition to health care
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.560]  reform if he doesn't get arrested you know he's a fed since then vandals
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.640]  obstruct several offices including the Sedgwick County Democratic Party
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.200]  headquarters in Wichita there was glass everywhere said Lindsey Staubel executive
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:56.560]  director of the county Democratic Party a brick took out the window floor to
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:04.120]  ceiling window and put a gouge in my desk and it's happened to a bunch of
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:09.800]  other facilities and places how about you just all of you pro-lifers you're
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.600]  the majority polls show it's upwards of 70% why don't you all just get behind

[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.280]  getting reports from all over the US here's a headline homeowners facing

[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.360]  economically conquered okay I want to hurry through calls because I need to
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.240]  start getting into all this news there's so much the bills even worse than we
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.240]  thought of that was possible but right now let's go to Ron in Texas Ron go
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:51.360]  ahead pretty good sir go ahead I look a little smile on your face you told us
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.880]  yesterday to let you know when you started calling Obama by his by Obama
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.960]  instead of Barry Sataro I apologize that's right Barry Sataro aka
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.680]  Barack H. Obama yeah that's what he put a little smile on your face for you
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:11.120]  day I'm not surprised at this health bill you helped out the past and the
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.080]  reason why is you have a commercial estate that you know a hundred nations
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.240]  have fallen under tyranny within this last century five hundred of them in
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:25.080]  this country alone did the same thing but they were able to come back from it
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.240]  the healthcare system that's provided to us by the Native Americans through
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.640]  treaties which supersede constitutional law any executive order or anything like
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:39.000]  that are now in danger plus it's also one of the worst healthcare systems
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.680]  worse than what they give us better and I'm a better let me let me comment on
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.360]  that Ron I have found four provisions in the bill where it states were doing
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.800]  this to follow international agreement this is a UN mandate
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:59.080]  mm-hmm exactly and they in the UN considers us third world people in this
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:05.160]  country that is a fact but there's a way around it what's stopping the state of
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.360]  Texas because Texas has the financial resources to do it to set up their own
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.840]  clinics to set up their own insurance plans for the residents of the state
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:20.680]  nothing except nobody wants to do it well you've got all the money and the
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.400]  big lobbyists from the rest of it Ron but I appreciate your call this is on
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.000]  constitutional it will be overturned at the state and federal level if we
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.440]  continue to push the Democrats think we'll just roll over again let's talk
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.680]  to David in Montana greetings to all from higher top of the purple mountain
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.920]  majesty then how you doing any other if that guy wants to kill some you should
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:47.600]  kill his TV and on a computer because they're doing this to us all through the
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:53.760]  computer if we all kill five computers I think we could break free but the best
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.640]  thing to do is have a massive home sit-in because like what you said the
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.440]  police in the military you don't pay you don't sign or pay check and with this
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:10.400]  medical bill it's going to put 50% of a population working for the government so
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.360]  all our tax pay and people you know the ones that pull the wagon if we just stay
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.320]  home for like a week two weeks we all like make like pick a month half of the
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:26.040]  month we prepare and the other half of the month we just sit home and don't
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.920]  work no more and because if you got 50% of the population working for the
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.520]  government that means they're all bought off man with their credit cards their
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.200]  loans their investments in the corporations that keep working and now
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.720]  it's just like the mafia how they get people in debt and control their lives
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:49.080]  this is a mafia David I appreciate your call good points Jay in California you're

[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:25.240]  made aware of let me just start with this first and remember this is in the
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:29.840]  context of government issued laptops to school children watching them at home
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:35.160]  face scanning cameras license plate reading cameras going in mobile 18
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.480]  wheeler trucks with naked body scanners and brain scanners being announced by
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.200]  homeland security that's in the news to just be rolling around at random check
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:50.760]  points houston police to begin training officers to staff checkpoints info
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:57.240]  wars dot com this is from sarge an anonymous police officer now I went and
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:04.000]  look this up and actually found mentions in funding request for this I don't just
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.800]  take something from police even when they give it to me on record which this
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:12.880]  guy didn't I go and look it up this is accurate this is true from my deep
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.680]  research remember we got the myac homeland security reports last february
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.280]  people didn't think they were real for a week then the new york times and others
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.240]  reported yes it's true but it's great the north com is for the american people
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.240]  I saw governor ridge almost six years ago on c-span say tsa will be the
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:39.560]  national police force and you'll have to have a national ID card to work and that
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:44.720]  the tsa will form the national checkpoint police now you see it's openly
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.640]  being announced in congress after beta testing everything I cover is on the
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:56.360]  record you understand that so what you're about to hear is the truth houston
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:59.960]  police to begin training officers to staff checkpoints the houston police
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.560]  department is poised to do what no other civilian police department in the
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:08.520]  united states has yet to do publicly I want to correct the police officer for
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:13.160]  at least five years new york does have random checkpoints where they search
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.920]  people and they're being sued in federal and state court over it but this one is
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.480]  different because it's a cordon where they shut down parts of the city and
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.960]  search everyone but technically the officer is incorrect the houston police
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.880]  department is poised to do what no other civilian police department in the
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.320]  united states has yet to do publicly I would add chicago's done this and
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.120]  boston they go door-to-door asking for your guns are asking to inspect them and
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.080]  we've played the newscast where it shows them busting in houses without warrants
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.440]  first it's not going to talk then they just come in but sorry again I'm just
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.160]  giving you some background that's why I can't just cover the news here is on
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.600]  each issue I want to give you a full spectrum breakdown the houston police
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.200]  department is poised to do what no other civilian police department in the
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.360]  united states has yet to do publicly on the desk of the chief of police is the
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.520]  authorization to begin training officers to staff checkpoints a key
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.680]  infrastructure points throughout the city which is part of in for guard as part
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.000]  of infrastructure protection as part of north com I would add although the talk
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.800]  about creating such a group has been discussed among supervisors of the
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:20.080]  special response group for years only in the last few months have these talks
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.440]  become reality because they're getting ready for the total collapse of the
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.520]  dollar I would add this idea received support from the former police chief
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:33.240]  herald hurt and he called for cameras and everyone's homes don't believe me
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.400]  just google houston police chief wants cameras and homes you'll get mainstream
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:41.800]  news but wasn't signed before he retired December 30th 2009 due to being under
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.120]  review by departmental lawyers yeah the houston police department what two years
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.680]  ago it said had framed over 4,000 people with fake DNA in their crime lab
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.840]  remember dr. frederick wirehurst we've interviewed we ought to get widehurst
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.360]  back oh I probably had had him on about five years former head of the FBI crime
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.120]  lab he said it was systematic frame ups of everybody just if they say frame them
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.960]  they frame them it's all admitted above board just totally criminal and now of
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.520]  course it came out the New York Times they plant fake DNA DNA is not a hundred
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:19.120]  percent it's a total fraud but sorry I'm see it's all in it's all integrated due
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.680]  to being under review by departmental lawyers now under the just name police
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:29.080]  chief Charles McCleland it stands ready to sign and implement almost
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.400]  immediately the special response group which was created in 92 to deal with
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:37.200]  protesters at the republican national convention is the main crowd control
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.200]  unit the houston police department they receive 40 hours of training annually in
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.640]  riot control and mass arrest scenarios the group has a subgroup called the hard
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.720]  team which received an additional 32 hours or more of intense training per
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.280]  year this training includes pain compliance techniques that's called
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:01.480]  torture in America YouTube banned that section of fall the Republic excuse me
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:08.040]  of 9-1-1 martial law 9-1 rise the police state that's banned on YouTube shows
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.320]  police their own footage breaking pro-life protesters arms who just sit on
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.640]  the sidewalk federal courts of rule they can taser you to answer questions okay
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.040]  you think this goes on in Abu Ghraib and camp x-ray think again since the early
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:29.120]  90s they've had pain compliance again let me continue the training includes
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.760]  pain compliance techniques dispersal of chemical agents rubber bullets crowd
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.720]  control grenades as well as many other less lethal munitions remember towns in
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.360]  Louisiana announced federal training to get citizen militia that works for them
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:51.240]  with 50 cows to take on protesters now the hard team is poised to get another
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:56.800]  subgroup called the checkpoint team the checkpoint team will be armed with assault
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.400]  rifle car beams with shoot to kill orders that is in major newspapers now in
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.960]  Baltimore and New Orleans again when you have the knowledge I went and looked it
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.320]  up and found out there there is departmental memos on this and funding
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.880]  request from the fed so I know the cops on the truth but separately I know every
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:17.840]  line of this not bragging I'm saying how do I know these things it's the
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:22.520]  knowledge you're an expert on the cowboys defensive lineup I'm an expert on
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.440]  America you could be smarter than I am you could be more informed than I am you
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.160]  better start caring about this and not the saints of the cowboys now listen to
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.480]  this carefully remember the infigard plans that came out mainstream news three
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.160]  years ago shoot to kill orders for hundreds of thousands of hired
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:49.240]  executives they're building an army against the people quietly this
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.880]  checkpoint team will be armed with assault rifle car beams with shoot to kill
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.480]  orders and tasked with manning sensitive areas such as airports chemical
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.040]  refineries in any other critical infrastructure locations again that's
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:06.960]  all under federal control by the very nature of the training it is but only a
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.960]  small step for them to be tasked to man checkpoints throughout the city turning
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.720]  it into a de facto internment camp why do you think they're putting cable
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.600]  blockers up on all the highways and stack up concrete dividers at the
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.960]  corners of key intersections that was part of it infrastructure protection
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.320]  they're ready to shut it all down Houston being one of the largest cities of the
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.280]  nation is both population and square mileage will be hard to lock down without
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.040]  adequate manpower this is why the checkpoint team will have an additional
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.320]  staffing of 300 if more needed those highly trained will be able to act as
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:48.360]  checkpoint leaders as cadre commanders or train the trainer situation according
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.760]  to the primary source federal money is being sought to offset the cost of
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:56.920]  creating the running of the checkpoint but the federal funding has not yet been
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:00.400]  approved it seems the team will be created with a way out the federal
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.280]  dollars it's an unfunded infrared mandate this will be the first billion
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:10.520]  police agency in the nation incorrect to begin this type of training sir how did
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.120]  we know about the flu in January we got internal memos new york and california
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:22.160]  and nirvana and we had the emergency manager on from a town bordering chicago
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:25.520]  and indiana where they were telling them millions are going to die this is
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.880]  going to happen they use that as a smoke screen and the people would have bought
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.120]  into the flu hype they may have pulled the trigger then but they knew they did
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.520]  their internal gauging and their surveillance algorithms to know the
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.640]  public wasn't going to buy it i'm not contradicting the officer he's done a
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.920]  good job boiling this down he just he's busy working all day and got a lot of
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.600]  people under him and so you know he hasn't been tracking all this no sir
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.120]  they always tell you it's only your department that's a standard scyop so the
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:03.400]  department feels special and they tell every town they have an urban warfare
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.520]  drill in this is the first time this has ever happened oh you're so special i
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.880]  mean it's just they do it psychologically
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.720]  all right continuing this will be the first time civilian police agency in
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:26.120]  the nation to begin this type of training so it should be seen as a beta
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.640]  test for expansion other police agencies nationwide as is very common in the
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:37.720]  law enforcement field the article is important but we should perhaps add
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.560]  links at the bottom to this article in our articles about homeland security and
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:46.560]  the national emergency centers act because if you want to know how the
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.640]  camps are going to be run now they're going to roll this out the public it's
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.840]  all in the legislation there's another key article the centers to be detained
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:59.480]  as enemy belligerence prisonplanet.com new bill allows us citizens to be
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.600]  kidnapped and detained without trial and definitely based on suspected activity
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.680]  now remember they took the no fly list or the suspicion list that's even wider
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:12.000]  that has over 10 million names on it the no fly over a million 200,000 till they
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  made it secret two years ago it's been growing though they said 25,000 a month
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.840]  on average where now you're in these databases and they pull you over at the
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.560]  checkpoint and you'll go through many checkpoints before they finally pull you
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:31.440]  out of your car and put you in a truck and then they'll have your psychological
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.840]  profile from your television watching habits or credit card purchasing habits
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.080]  or internet serving habits they'll know who can be broken who will do what they'll
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:44.000]  drag you in and they will show you someone else tortured they'll have
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.840]  special CIA and private corporate teams that do this they've built the
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.520]  cadres up to over a hundred thousand torture experts and they will then have
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.560]  your neighbor they'll stop your neighbor and threaten to torture them knowing
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.840]  their psychological profile knowing that they're 99 plus percent sure they will
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:08.280]  roll over and say that you are a terrorist this is the essence of terror
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:13.000]  the essence of a terror state it's been done everywhere else we know how they do
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.360]  it we know Homeland Security seven years ago right as the department got
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.880]  funded hired Prima Ka former head of the KGB and hired Marcus Wolf former of
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:29.040]  East German Stasi that was mainstream news they went to the very best experts
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:36.040]  in the world on this okay that's what these black sites are you notice they
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.080]  always train these guys to be terrorists at the torture camps and send them out
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.080]  to lead cadres so they could they create the terrorist and they create the
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:54.680]  response to it oh god help us all right I mean this is this is the blackest most
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:00.280]  evil most scientifically crafted wickedness we've ever seen okay there
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:12.480]  is no doubt this is the most diabolical mechanized focused thought out kill
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:19.880]  grid ever seen in history it's global standardized worldwide the globalists
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.320]  are mopping up the final few holdout countries there is resistance to them
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:31.960]  in many nations like Iceland people basically were on strike for a year that
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.600]  brought the globalists to their knees there but they're one of the most highly
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  educated people in the world in Iceland you cannot say that about us we have been
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.360]  brain damaged by chemical weapon attacks in the food and water and air you
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.280]  understand you're under chemical weapon attacks so am I that's why your
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:53.000]  neighbors are dying of cancer it's why young kids are dying all around you
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.360]  so I almost everybody's getting diabetes they're murdering you and they're just
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:02.680]  testing will you notice can they cover up the numbers and every one of you cops
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:07.800]  out there and and homeland security you look you know this is all true okay why
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:13.720]  don't you join the republic why don't you look I'm begging you on my knees to
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:18.240]  let God into your heart and to break your conditioning and compartmentalization
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.320]  and for heaven's sakes please just research this this doesn't have to happen
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:26.120]  it doesn't have to happen but you're going to have to get right down to bedrock
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:33.760]  and admit to yourself the full magnitude of this and I know that we have
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:38.680]  psychological defense mechanisms I have it where you want to tell yourself it
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.000]  isn't that bad you want to tell yourself oh Alex is exaggerated you you want to
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.480]  tell yourself yeah this isn't real or okay yeah there's some problems but no
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:56.440]  the terror staged the financial collapse stage it's all on record and they
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.640]  psychologically profile Dudley do right types you notice they never bring them
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.240]  up the chain of command they're kind of the foot soldiers and the mid-level they
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:12.800]  kind of hires sociopathic control freaks for psychopaths and above that they
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:23.400]  hire charming psychopaths and let me just talk to the psychopaths out there this
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:30.600]  system isn't going to be good for you either in fact after they fully purge
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:36.240]  the country and if they killed 80 million in China if they get their plan
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.240]  fully in 10 years after the plan is fully in place say five years from now
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.520]  so that's 15 years you'll probably have about 150 million people in the country
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.040]  they're going to repopulate the US with Latin Americans and I'm not joking around
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.880]  here okay they're going to kill most of you listening and the first group they're
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.240]  going to kill once this grid's fully in place they're going to at least strip you
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.080]  your badge they're going to at least throw some charges on you and then they're
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.360]  going to kill you and I know you're laughing it's funny because you've
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:08.680]  lived in America and it can't happen here haha you don't know history I want
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:12.640]  all of you servants of this to know they're not going to want to pay you
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.280]  your retirement they're not going to want you to know where all the bodies are
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:22.040]  buried the first group they're going to go after is going to be you once they've
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:29.160]  mopped up and taken over of their successful and all the good cops if they
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.120]  can't kick you out by the time this goes through they're just going to blow your
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:37.400]  head off and all the thugs and crooks on your department they're going to go
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.200]  along with it because they're going to be scared this happens everywhere
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:48.800]  every time guaranteed hey you never thought you'd see open borders never
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.640]  thought you'd see our country abolishing the Bill of Rights never thought you'd
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.320]  see socialist healthcare you never thought you'd see the green police you're
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.200]  going to see it all you understand this you never thought you'd see taxes on

[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:24.640]  it and we tell you this is all just the preparation our criminal government in
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.640]  over a hundred countries in the last century has put dictators in and given
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.400]  and sent in US government torture trainers to teach them how to torture
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:40.040]  people okay our government's been pure able for a long long long time at the
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:46.280]  highest levels and it took them a long time to convert the police and the
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.840]  bureaucrats into agents of evil but they are now look they knew it was gonna

[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:33.800]  anyone who thinks that violence is the uh you know the cure to this right now
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.120]  has got to seriously rethink it because it's uh you know it will be the one
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.560]  thing that throws us all off off the ship and into the
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.360]  water where the sharks are and you know it just i know
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:49.480]  people are enraged about this it's really disgusting and vile stuff
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:52.840]  happening to us right now but you know i mean
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:57.880]  you can't you can't just give them an excuse to use more violence on listen
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:01.880]  i've had colonel craig robertson and i've read all the mainstream news
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:05.000]  articles on air it isn't a rumor what all the
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.080]  patriots have talked about they plan on having the american people
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.040]  backed into a corner chew up the military and police
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.600]  and they're going to bring in multinational forces i've been to the
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.720]  urban warfare drills where they train with dutch
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:25.160]  israeli australian british scott troops you name it to go into san francisco
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.680]  and oakland now here's the deal if things do go violent
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.560]  all these big mouth talkers need to understand
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:37.560]  that uh then the sky's the limit i mean i mean once this stuff starts but
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:43.320]  remember remember it's not the cops that
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:49.320]  well i'm not going to say it just just you look look they're training everybody
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:52.680]  in all these simulated attacks in these drills they're having
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.880]  and in the staged events that people are going to go after the cops
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:59.080]  they put that out so the public sees the cops as the target
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.800]  the cops
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.240]  anything else paul yeah i mean it's an info war and everybody's know the facts
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:10.520]  and we need to get together and know the facts and know what's going on and not
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.400]  say you know let's shoot somebody or let's kill somebody who doesn't really
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.600]  deserve to die because they're being controlled well i just hope the jack
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.280]  asses in the government know that we're trying to stop this from happening
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:23.400]  but i hope many of the people listening right now who can't wait for a fight
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.800]  with the american people i hope you know that once this once this starts
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:31.800]  and it's getting closer every day that that that they're not going to be able
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:37.000]  to control it and run a pr campaign and demonize the violence i mean
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.160]  when joe stack did that it's clearly a staged event people were cheering him
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:45.960]  on they can't wait the public cannot wait to start
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.040]  having open season on government people and i'm trying everything i can to
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.240]  stop this i want stability i want freedom
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:59.960]  i want rule of law and uh that's just i mean this is so real
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.480]  and and and i think some people tune in here and it's like entertainment
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:06.040]  or they don't realize what they're saying or they don't realize where this is
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.960]  really going i i think a lot of cops listening
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.720]  right now don't understand this is real folks i hope the police and military
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:16.440]  realize you've been set up for this over a decade
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:20.760]  ago the globalists have set all this up and i hope they realize that this is
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.960]  not this is going to make vietnam look like a joke okay this is going to make
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.440]  afghanistan look tame and
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.520]  and once we go into this martial law they're going to be able to pass whatever
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:37.160]  legislation they want do whatever they want we do not want this to happen we
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:39.400]  want to try to have the states repeal this
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:42.920]  we can take our country back peacefully the momentum is against them 80 percent
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.640]  of people in polls it was 70 percent are awake
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.440]  and if that 80 percent will just get up off their rear ends
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.680]  and start doing something peaceful we can turn this around paul
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:01.480]  absolutely absolutely and and i'll i'll i'll have to say i mean that guy steve
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.720]  you know he calls up and says you know uh let's let's go for violence alexary
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.040]  with me oh i'm i'm calling on you to let's let's advocate non-violence this
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:12.760]  if everybody gets the message of non-violence and knowing the facts and
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.360]  that this can be solved without violence i mean i think it'll be it'll be much
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.520]  easier for everybody well here's the deal we're going to try to solve it
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:26.280]  without violence and if the enemy gets offensive spontaneously folks are going
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.800]  to defend themselves and that's why the enemy has been trying to provoke
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.680]  something okay the enemy
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:43.080]  the enemy is going to lose when they fire first we'll be right back

[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.400]  and that's the mexican and u.s government trying to knock out
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:41.960]  their drug dealing competition you're not going to bring this tyranny down by
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:47.880]  killing cops okay if they would just decriminalized drugs that
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.200]  would do it but the drug cartels and others in
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:55.480]  mexico kill legalization activist i mean how obvious it is
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:59.240]  that we need to decriminalize drugs and now you got the mexican mafia killing
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:01.640]  cops all over the u.s and the cops are starting to just
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:04.360]  leave them alone
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:11.880]  it's pathetic it's and notice the media keeps it real quiet
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:16.680]  and the politicians are just puppets anybody kills a politician will turn
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:19.480]  them into a victim
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.440]  we've got to get our courts under the people's control we've got to start
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:30.200]  indicting the bankers the high-level cfr members the people that have written
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.800]  public reports calling for treason

[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:46.680]  paul and connecticut welcome
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:54.440]  okay bishop in texas go ahead yes alex uh just wanted to let you know that i
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.360]  stand with you and your anger and frustration with what's going on in
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:02.600]  america uh i'm actually a pastor here in uh the
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:06.920]  metroplex um farm and law enforcement and uh
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:13.560]  just wanted to uh let you know that um i called uh broyce west
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:17.640]  office on yesterday he's a state senator here in texas
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:25.000]  and spoke with uh his uh legislative director and basically wanted to
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.320]  determine you know what they were doing uh with the passage of this
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:34.760]  outrageous bill and of course uh the general responded as if i was being
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.560]  just completely paranoid so i'm i'm even angered that some of the state
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.240]  legislators really don't understand the true implications
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:48.760]  of this bill yeah i mean i know he's a state senator i don't really know his
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.360]  voting record but uh that just sounds like par for the
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.360]  course we're going to go over some of the provisions of the bill the national
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:01.000]  ID card provision when we come back from break uh and then talk about what's
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.360]  happening in the senate with the bill which is another bill
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.280]  that they're basically trying to put even more tyranny in so obama signed one
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:11.000]  bill now they're calling in a reconciliation but they're adding a
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.200]  bunch of pork barrel and other things to the senate versions we're going to go
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:18.360]  over that anything else uh bishop yeah i just want to let you know that i uh
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:23.400]  pastor a church here in the metroplex and uh have woken my congregants and uh
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.600]  have shared this information with other churches as well
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:31.400]  in the metroplex so basically we are on a campaign to try to wake up as many
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.120]  people as possible uh finally i actually a few
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:39.960]  months ago i uh emailed and left a voicemail message on
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:45.960]  here tips line concerning an uh former fbi employee
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:52.760]  that was indicted several years back and i've discovered i do have some
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:57.400]  connection to that individual and found out that part of the reason why that
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:03.240]  employee was uh uh basically indicted and fired from the fbi was because
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.400]  they were basically nosing around into the 911 investigation
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:10.680]  and you know there's some other information if you wouldn't mind
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:15.320]  that i would like to share with you all off air concerning that incident

[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:25.480]  live from austin texas alex jones thank you for joining us we are now two
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.600]  hours and eight minutes into this worldwide broadcast we have another hour
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:33.720]  52 minutes left in transmission we are simulcasting live
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:43.320]  at prisonplanet.tv on the 24th day of march 2010
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:49.240]  here is an actual subsection of the health care bill that is now law
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:52.040]  now obama
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.880]  has sent the bill back to the senate he signed the bill
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.040]  but they have a reconciliation bill they're going to try to tag on
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.880]  which is a whole nother bill and has even more draconian
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:09.480]  legislation in it but let me tell you what is in the bill
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:12.760]  i've got a lot of calls and people saying is there a national id card in the
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:15.960]  bill we already have federally standardized driver's license the
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:19.000]  real id act that is a national id card
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.840]  this id card is different that they're now going to be issuing to people
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.400]  because as it's phased in the next few years
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:32.840]  because the irs has real-time access to your bank account to wire out funds
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:37.480]  we're going to give you that subsection here's a document cam shot
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:41.960]  and the irs will find you or fee you if you use your medical care for
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:45.800]  procedures that they think you don't need mainline medical test
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:51.160]  not just alternative medicine tens of thousands of new irs employees
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:54.920]  ten billion dollars every year they were saying every two years to fund this
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.720]  now it's every year
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:03.560]  and so this is now the nanny state irs involved in everything you do in your
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:06.840]  life a huge expansion the likes of which we've never
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:10.520]  seen of this criminal agency that violates law and
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:17.800]  due process every day now this is from section b on page 65
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:24.120]  of the bill
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:32.600]  section b section i page 65 of the bill that's now law eligibility for health

[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:51.400]  ensuring that such operating rules are effective not later
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:56.600]  than january 1st 2013 and may allow for the use of machine readable
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.640]  identification card may that means it's all at their
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.200]  discretion of course they've said that's what hillary wanted in 93 94 it's in
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:10.520]  there okay this is from hr 3590
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:15.480]  now let's go over some good synopses
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:20.680]  of what's really in the health bill and i've looked these up myself
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:24.520]  page 16 states that if you have insurance at the time of the bill
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.960]  becoming law and change you will be required to take a similar plan
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.280]  if not if it's not available you will be required to take the government option
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:37.960]  page 22 mandates audits of all employers
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.760]  that self-insure audits everybody gets an audit now page 29

[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.560]  comparative care they will decide what you get
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.560]  for cost cutting page 30 a government committee will decide what treatments and
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.000]  benefits you get and unlike an insurer there will be no appeals
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.200]  process page 42 the health choices commissioner will
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:04.120]  decide health benefits for you you will have no choice none page 50
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.600]  all non-us citizens illegal or not will be provided free health care services

[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:34.760]  and they could take your wages i mean this is this is all in there

[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:50.840]  exchange which is what they want it lowers the amount of care you get
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:53.960]  page 84 all private health care plans must participate
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.040]  in the health care exchange i.e. total government control of private plans

[02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:19.880]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:25.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention.
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:28.360]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:32.760]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:17.320]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:24.760]  George straight was singing seashores of all Mexico
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:30.600]  it sounded so good I got an idea I'm going on I mentioned this yesterday I
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:35.320]  want to get back into it briefly then we're going to your phone calls
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:38.600]  and a bunch of other news
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:46.840]  Grayson can oversee senate race this is from the Associated Press
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:50.760]  Secretary of State Terry Grayson can oversee the U.S. Senate race in Kentucky
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:54.120]  without any apparent conflict of interest a government ethics panel
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:59.080]  ruled today you heard me right Grayson who is
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:03.720]  Kentucky's chief elections official is running as a republican for the senate
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:08.520]  seat being vacated by retiring Jim Bunning
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:11.720]  one of his GOP rivals bowling green physician
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.240]  ran Paul questioned whether Grayson should
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:20.120]  recuse himself from oversight of the race and they went to the board I talked
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:23.320]  to Paul's office yesterday they went and filed this
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:29.400]  and the board said 50% democrats 50% Republicans they said no
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:32.280]  it's fine for the head of the election process
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:37.640]  to oversee his own election and you've got all these employees
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:40.680]  that are guaranteed to be getting jobs in the senator's office if the
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:44.920]  republican wins ran Paul's 10 points or more ahead of him
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:48.040]  Dick Cheney's come out against Rand Paul the republican machine's going up
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:52.600]  against him and magically this is never before
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:56.280]  happened so now you can be an election official
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:58.680]  and I guess that's the only way you can get elected now in America you're the
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:03.000]  election official you run it that's kind of like senator
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.200]  Hagel when he first got in over a decade ago
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:13.560]  84% of the ballots cast in Nebraska were cast on machines that he owns the
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:16.680]  company for so you own the election machines you
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:20.360]  become a senator you are 10 points behind in the polls
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:25.960]  but magically he can end up winning because he's the election official
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.080]  there's nothing on the face that requires abstention said John Steffen
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:34.040]  head of the executive branch ethics commission the unanimous opinion of
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:37.000]  the commission held that it is highly unlikely the secretary of state
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:40.440]  Kentucky could influence the results of the statewide election without having
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:43.320]  the universal cooperation of election officials across the state
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.400]  not with computers what we see in florida
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:52.120]  2000
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:56.040]  this is just incredible and then Kurt Nemo
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:59.560]  wrote a key article everybody's got to get and get out to everybody they know
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:03.640]  because if Rand Paul wins it'll send a shockwave across the nation for true
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:07.320]  conservatives to win our Kentucky Republicans rigging
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:11.560]  Senate race against Rand Paul very important
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:17.080]  article on that front
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.240]  okay
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:31.640]  i've got a bunch of other news on naked body scanners on police checkpoints
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:35.400]  on the federal government to decide what you can eat what you can do
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:39.560]  not just the federal lunch program the feds deciding what kids can eat
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:42.520]  that's already happening
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:47.960]  i've got cop program has cab drivers helping local police
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:50.760]  i've tried to cover a lot of news today and i haven't even scratched the surface
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:56.920]  but i'm attempting to we're gonna go to your calls here in a moment
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:01.960]  i first want to tell folks that this can be used all this open corruption and
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:06.680]  tyranny can be used as a big wake-up call and people are upset right now
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:10.680]  i talked to my aunt who lives in east texas yesterday
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:15.400]  and she said that the meter reader
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.000]  was talking about me to her
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:25.720]  just out of the blue and now he's awake and then she was in a town nearby at
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.480]  walmart only place in the country to shop
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:34.840]  and two women randomly came up to her in separate events
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:37.560]  talking basically about the new world order and the takeover that was
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.360]  happening and she she didn't ask him are you an alex jones
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:43.560]  listeners they probably weren't the point is it was just
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:48.600]  yesterday just spontaneously people running around upset
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:56.200]  i mean that's a gauge of how awake people are starting to get so
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:01.960]  it took time for folks to build momentum against the new world order
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:05.240]  20 years ago but they planted the seeds that grew into what we see today
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:08.040]  the mighty oak
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:13.160]  never before have people's minds been more fertile
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:16.680]  to be unlocked and to find out the truth of the planet and who's really
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:19.800]  running things and just how dire the situation is

[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:26.120]  history this is the same exact plan that at all hitler implemented in
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:28.600]  nazi germany yeah his first takeover was government
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:33.400]  run health care euthanasia health rationing total control and and this is

[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:46.280]  as you beg for water and food i mean people don't know
[02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:49.480]  that the police have been torturing for decades under paying compliance they
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.280]  don't know they're already euthanizing and killing people
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.160]  the media never covers the cases where they can talk and are begging
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:57.800]  you know they covered terry shybo because they could act like she was in a
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:02.040]  coma and try to sell the idea that's why that case got so big in the media
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:06.680]  um in fact pull up leslie smith wall street journal articles
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:09.720]  about and he also wrote a best-selling book about i mean this list

[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:21.800]  bill writing a book about old people above 60 have a duty to die

[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:36.920]  that's if they want to get rid of limited health care get rid of the
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:39.960]  cancer you know because it's costing the government a lot of people that are
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:43.480]  you know what you're on medicare it's in there that the government decides
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:48.760]  what treatment you get and who dies i mean you're not going to get anything
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:52.200]  free from the government folks that's what we need to understand this is how
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:55.080]  many times have they been caught lying how much evil have they been caught
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:58.200]  putting cancer virus and over 200 million injections
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:02.040]  of the polio vaccine i mean that's mainstream news
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:07.320]  why do you think cancers is common as the as the common cold now
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:12.200]  i mean they've gotten away with poison in the water why not stan i appreciate

[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:22.920]  yeah hey alex go ahead yeah a couple things i just wanted to cover real
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:26.520]  quick uh first of all uh i just moved here not too long
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:30.120]  going florida from out in houston texas and uh
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:34.360]  i had to deal with my sister who was living with my mom she was being very
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:38.840]  abusive so in the process my sister called the sheriff found me five times
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:42.040]  uh just to try and make herself look good well anyway
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.280]  i got her out of here but what i want to mention was one of the times that these
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:50.440]  sheriffs came out they actually told me that this was my
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:54.280]  mother's fault for latin or move in and i'm telling you alex to look on this
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:57.320]  guy's face he would have fit in real well with
[02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:01.320]  that group that was at the g20 in pittsburgh yeah that's the problem a
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:04.840]  lot of cops now when they come to your house for something they end up
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:08.920]  arresting you for something else they're looking for trouble
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:13.320]  right and uh yesterday i was at the store shopping i was talking to a guy
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:17.640]  working there about uh what you had gone over about this healthcare bill and
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:20.680]  listening to what you had gone over yesterday like you did today and reading
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:23.560]  the article it's on there with the 20 points
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:27.480]  and uh anyway this woman overheard me talking to him and she goes well
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:31.320]  shouldn't you just wait and see how it's gonna all turn out before you start
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:36.120]  commenting on it and uh she goes have you read all 2800 pages
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:39.320]  i said no man but i've seen enough that i know that this is something that's
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:42.840]  going to totally bankrupt our system well well i mean hold on hold on for
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:46.440]  people watching on tv or on the radio we went over it with the with the
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:49.000]  sections of the bill we have them in a little set i mean
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.520]  when i tell you there's a national id card and the irs is going to be in your
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:55.960]  bank account and be able to take your money i mean i read from the bill
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:59.720]  itself this it's not like i'm just here saying this
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.320]  i mean i just read the ap where it doesn't cover people with pre-existing
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:07.400]  conditions oopsie wasn't in the bill
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:11.640]  well i had uh a way to come over my mom's house yesterday it does her hair
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:15.560]  and i showed her parts of the obama deception last night was who was here
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:18.760]  and she's pretty on board with that but her husband's an obama
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:23.400]  supporter and he's a local fireman and so i told her i'm gonna
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.080]  send her a link so she can you know have him watch it but i also
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:31.080]  online but i also told her to go to the website and purchase a copy for him
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:34.760]  but his response when she was just sharing the little bit she saw was oh
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:38.920]  so you've drank the kool-aid huh i'm thinking no she's not the one that
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:43.240]  drank the kool-aid dude you know it's unfortunate that these
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.240]  people are reacting this way but you know that's why we've got our work cut out
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.320]  for us well good job for taking care of your mama
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:54.520]  yeah that's one thing about being an immoral society where they encourage
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:57.960]  people to just warehouse their parents not knowing that's going to happen to
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:01.720]  them is that there is so much abuse of older
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:05.800]  people by their filthy children we are a demonic country
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:09.320]  i mean and the demonic are taking over there's still a lot of good people in
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:11.880]  this nation but if you don't take care of your
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:16.120]  parents you're the scum of the earth
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:26.840]  look what happened in germany and russia those people are a lot more
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:30.600]  moral and hard-working than americans are today
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:33.480]  and look what they did
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:37.720]  look what people go along with
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:44.280]  it isn't just the health care takeover it's everything it's it's they're evil
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:47.160]  they're bad
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:51.480]  and you're only alive once and we're only in this place in history one time
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.000]  all of you out there need to have a gut check you need to get up off your hind
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:58.280]  ends research the claims we've made here find out it's true for yourself
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:01.640]  and then make a decision you can't just passively go along with it but say
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:06.680]  you're against it you got to take action against it
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:11.640]  rick and georgia you're on the air hey alex love the show
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:15.000]  look i want to talk about this health care bill uh this is
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.920]  the worst legislation ever because it's just gonna open the floodgates for the
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:22.600]  next big bombshell that they're gonna throw on the american people
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:26.040]  which is and they don't care how many people don't like it which is full
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:29.480]  amnesty that's coming next that's gonna be the
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:32.280]  big one no they've said that they're gonna try to pass
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:37.320]  amnesty total open border and in it is a national worker id
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:40.680]  they just give it to all the illegals but then
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:43.640]  they're also exempt that's in the health care bill that we have to have a medical
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:47.160]  id card from the government the irs but the illegals are exempt i read the
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:50.600]  subsection it's the same thing here if illegals want it they can have it
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:55.560]  it'll be selectively enforced but citizens have to have the worker id card
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:59.080]  that's right and soon as they announce that this amnesty is gonna go through
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:03.400]  we're gonna get flooded with illegals how they think they're gonna keep them
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:05.880]  out you think there's a lot here now
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:10.280]  there's gonna be a whole lot more which further those things
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.240]  they want the government is about to go bankrupt
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:18.200]  that is the goal that's exactly right and here in georgia they announced late
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:23.480]  last year that we already have a real id card they said that there was so much
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:27.480]  security in these new drivers license that everyone would get
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:31.240]  by january 31st so that's done coming gone
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:34.280]  everyone in georgia will be getting these new cars they said there's so much
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:37.400]  security in them that the state didn't even know
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:40.360]  yeah let's be clear because they're under the real id act
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:44.200]  it federalizes your id's so you'll have to have that to travel
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:47.400]  it's a hemispheric id it's it's under un north american union
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:51.240]  parameters publicly and then you're gonna have your medical id cards attached
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:54.520]  to your bank account and your amnesty card but the
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:51:01.480]  illegals they're all exempt i read from the bill

[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:39.640]  because that top you know one out of ten thousand people
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:44.520]  they have most the wealth well i thought there was a larger percentage there
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:48.520]  but uh another idea i had yeah i thought it was a larger percentage
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:51.560]  that maybe maybe it's one percent or two percent whatever they call it that i
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:55.080]  thought maybe is well what obama says we're taxing the top two percent
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:56:01.080]  that's people over 125 000 a year or couples 250 they're in the top two
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:05.720]  i mean not most americans don't even make 50 000 dollars
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:08.840]  if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you're in the top five percent
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:12.520]  folks didn't even realize that i see i'm in i'm in
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:15.640]  connecticut and you're almost poor i'm new literally poor if you're under
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.000]  fifty thousand dollars i'm not getting the cost of hay in manhattan if you're
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.240]  making a hundred grand a year you're poor in san francisco you need a hundred
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:26.840]  grand a year now that's that's that that's very well you know middle class
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:30.440]  in texas because of the cost of living because wherever you got big
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:34.120]  government there's a high cost of living
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.440]  another quick idea i had uh as a brainstormer if they try to collapse the
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.080]  dollar why not tell all the states they unite under a new
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.720]  united front and don't let any federal tax and what they do with the excess tax
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:50.600]  that they don't they they don't use for their own
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.360]  deficits or situation that they buy gold and silver and re
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.680]  refloat a currency that has a silver certificate of some sort
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:01.960]  that way then they get all that they screw up the bankers who think that they
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:05.160]  have they have well look i'll go on further i'll go on further
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:08.200]  george in connecticut we need to identify the private
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:11.480]  banking families as the criminals as the mafia that's all they are
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:14.600]  is a mafia that controls the banks and the issuance of currency and credit
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:18.200]  no wonder we're in so much trouble identify them as the enemy and they've
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:21.000]  committed all sorts of crimes not saying where the trillions are
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:24.920]  and arrest a couple thousand of these people we've got all the evidence
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:28.920]  and arrest the people that stage 9 11 and we could turn this around the
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:31.720]  problem is there's so many crooks right beneath them
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:35.000]  that if you do that they'll normally arrest the crooks above them the
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.960]  communists and fascists always do this and just take over the system
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:43.640]  i mean i figure you could charge over a hundred thousand people at the highest
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:47.160]  levels of government corporate america and globalist
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.320]  hundred thousand of them send them to prison i mean we just just arrest their
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:53.240]  stinking butts we've got the evidence give them a
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:58.440]  trial but see they control the courts but if we identify them as the enemy
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:02.200]  they could end up like chelchescu's romanian and that's my whole point the
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:05.800]  government wants us to have a fight with the police and the military no we wake
[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:10.040]  them up then we arrest the top
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:17.000]  one percent of a thousand you understand right but you do it through
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.320]  due process you don't have a french revolution with guillotines
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:26.200]  i appreciate your call and then half a million people got killed
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:29.720]  and then if somebody wanted your wife and you were poor they killed you
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:32.280]  because a group of criminals came in and did that we want to
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:35.720]  we want to have an orderly restoration of the republic
[02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:41.640]  and the arrest of the criminal revolutionaries that have taken over our government

[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:34.680]  look at her naked body it's all part of the active humiliation

[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:55.960]  uh there was a time there every time i would come into the uh
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:02:01.800]  v a hospital be treated i would have four or five police officers
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:09.000]  uh called to the rescue because i was a danger patient and i'm in a wheelchair
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:16.280]  well i mean we've seen the horrors people dying of maggot infestations
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:19.480]  this is the one area where government did run health care and look how bad it
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:23.320]  was well it it it's just the way they they run
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:28.840]  things here you know i have uh i haven't had any drugs in 73 in my system
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:34.440]  and i had a nurse up there that was always uh giving me a hard time you know
[03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:39.880]  and uh she would make me take these uh urine tests to see if there was any
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:44.920]  illegal drugs in my system you know i haven't had a beer in 25 years you
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:48.360]  know what i mean and one day i was there and i had to
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:51.080]  take a test because she was holding a prescription in
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:55.080]  her hand and then a urine bottle on the other hand if i peed in the bottle i
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.400]  got my prescriptions if i didn't the four or five police officers would give me a
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:05.240]  bad time you know and uh one incident that happened
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:11.240]  uh i went and i took a urine test i got my uh went to get my prescription and
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:15.960]  she told me i had to take another urine test i told her i just did take a test
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:18.920]  she says well i don't believe you you're gonna take another test
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:21.720]  so i'm not gonna argue with her because i really need my
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:26.840]  pain medicine you know and uh i waited for the report to come back because over
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:30.520]  the past five ten years all the reports come back negative
[03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:37.080]  well that day i took two urine tests okay i was in the hospital 18 hours to get
[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:41.400]  a bottle of pain pills 18 hours can you believe that
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:45.640]  and i waited for the test to come back one test come back negative any other
[03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:50.520]  tests come back hot now how could that possibly be
[03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:53.800]  well it's all about bureaucracy it's all about contracts with private
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:57.880]  companies remember last year in fact i covered that article yesterday obama
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:00.920]  wanted veterans to have to buy their own insurance
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:04.120]  they hate you you can't pay them taxes anymore

[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:41.000]  well they're putting most veterans now on ptsd list and you can't buy guns even
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.280]  though there's no law saying because some government quack

[03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:10.360]  and he went on to say they want to deploy this
[03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:16.200]  nationwide into the cities and last week i played video from homeland security
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:20.120]  where they show mobile 18 wheeler trailers to be at concerts football games
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:24.600]  everywhere and at checkpoints to randomly
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:28.360]  put you through interrogation under a brain scanner and a naked body scanner
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:32.040]  and ask you if you're a terrorist this is actually
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:36.360]  going on and now the houston police are training to set up checkpoints
[03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:40.360]  with orders to kill any resistors we have that article
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:44.840]  up on info wars dot com and a month ago we put a story together
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:48.920]  out of bbc television clip that the drugs report linked to
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:54.840]  up at prismplanet.com where a popular tv movie star in england
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:11:58.840]  went through the naked body scanner the women recorded his genitals and had him
[03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:02.360]  sign it and that's now been confirmed well now
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:06.040]  out of england the sitting the guy two weeks ago that got arrested in boston
[03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:11.560]  logan uh he was a tsa naked body scanner
[03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:15.800]  reportedly had sex with a 14-year-old girl the sitting the guy a month before
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:18.360]  that that told a girl in the tsa i'm gonna bust you
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:21.320]  if you don't become my sex slave it's not the guy that got arrested he went
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:25.400]  crazy and said i'm god at lax it's not the guy that made the woman
[03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:28.440]  drink her own breast milk it's not the lady that made the woman
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:33.560]  take the the rings out of her breast uh with pliers
[03:12:33.560 --> 03:12:39.000]  it's not the people harassing folks that have metal prosthesis
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:45.960]  no airport worker perv over a woman's naked body image
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:51.400]  said quote i love gigantic bleepers and it turns out she's an airport worker
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:54.760]  who had to go through the naked body scanner
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:12:58.680]  and uh incident proves once again that detailed images of genitals
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:02.280]  are visible and these are the people who will be
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:07.880]  leering over your naked children and joining us from england where this
[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:10.680]  happened the webmaster of prismplanet.com and
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:16.840]  prismplanet.tv paul joseph watson journalist to break
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:21.080]  this down paul joseph watson airport worker pervs
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:26.600]  over woman in body scanner i love those gigantic
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.680]  bleepers paul watson break down what's happening here
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:34.600]  hello alex good to be back good to have you
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:41.240]  you know what's happening is um these scanners were hastily justified and
[03:13:41.240 --> 03:13:45.640]  introduced with primarily three guarantees from the government
[03:13:45.640 --> 03:13:49.240]  and this was the same in the u.s as it was in the uk
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:52.840]  and these guarantees these promises were all designed to
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:57.080]  pacify dissent and uh prevent people from
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:00.920]  getting hit up about what these body scanners could do
[03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:05.720]  the number one was they said the body scanners don't show
[03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:09.800]  detailed images of genitalia and we were shown
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:15.720]  through the media um these images of amorphous matchstick meant as if those
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:21.000]  were the images produced by the scanners now even before the scanners were
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:25.320]  introduced the uh creators the makers of
[03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:29.800]  the scanners in germany and australia said outright
[03:14:29.800 --> 03:14:35.400]  the scanners don't work properly if you blur out sensitive images of the body
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:39.720]  and uh german security advisor hand set left out
[03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:43.640]  who was a representative for one of the companies who made the scanners said
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:48.520]  that they do show this is a quote show intimate piercing catheters and the
[03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:53.160]  form of breasts and penises you had images on the tsa's
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:58.600]  website examples of images produced by the scanners
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:01.880]  and they clearly show that genitals are visible
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:06.120]  now you have this incident today not to mention the one last month
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:09.400]  which he throw denied the indian film star
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:13.720]  never recanted and now at the same airport again
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:18.920]  you've got this airport security official taking
[03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:22.840]  images of his colleague 29 year old woman
[03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:27.240]  going through the scanner perving over it leering over it
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:31.640]  and saying you know as he said i love these gigantic bleepers
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:37.560]  so it proves that the claim they don't show details of genitalia
[03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:42.600]  is yet another example of mass public deception which was foisted upon us to
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:47.320]  get these scanners hastily introduced number two they said the scanners could
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:51.800]  not store and send images again a complete lie
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:56.040]  the electronic privacy information center has got the document
[03:15:56.040 --> 03:15:59.960]  from the gamatics of the scanners that show
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:05.240]  that you can create an administrative level which allows you to send and store
[03:16:05.240 --> 03:16:09.160]  the images and they're now presenting that information in court
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:13.480]  so again another proven lie by the government number three
[03:16:13.480 --> 03:16:18.040]  they said that the scanners would be operated and this was guaranteed by the
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:23.400]  uk transport secretary lauded on it they would be operated by well-trained and
[03:16:23.400 --> 03:16:26.600]  professional security staff who wouldn't abuse them
[03:16:26.600 --> 03:16:30.360]  and they're saying there's no problem with this paul the ap reports
[03:16:30.360 --> 03:16:34.040]  as well as afp warning for man accused over airport
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:39.080]  breast x-ray no big deal but if people want to read the full details
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:43.960]  it's at prisonplanet.com but i mean think about this laptops watching kids
[03:16:43.960 --> 03:16:48.040]  that the government federal government pays schools to give them when they're
[03:16:48.040 --> 03:16:50.840]  at home watching the parents in their bedrooms
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:54.920]  over the laptops face scanning cameras everywhere
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:16:58.760]  mobile tsa trucks going out now to be a new domestic
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:03.480]  law enforcement federal police uh they're recording these images how do they
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:06.840]  record them to save them for the news media now it's admitted in internal
[03:17:06.840 --> 03:17:11.080]  documents that the genitals is what they look at to make sure it's focused
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:14.200]  just like when you have a camera focusing on somebody's face you make sure the
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:18.200]  cracks at the edges of their eyes their crow's feet are visible
[03:17:18.200 --> 03:17:22.200]  that that's part of it and that they do record the images
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:25.800]  and they do save them and it's really a biometric scan
[03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:29.880]  of the body now going in courthouses and the chicago tribune
[03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:32.680]  in fact dig that article out i had it here in my stack
[03:17:32.680 --> 03:17:38.200]  here it is the chicago tribune reports tsa says eventually
[03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:42.760]  headline body scans eventually mandatory tsa official says
[03:17:42.760 --> 03:17:45.720]  england's already announced they're now mandatory
[03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:49.960]  they will record your wife and children and and and by the way now let's talk
[03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:55.400]  about your girlfriend slash fiancee who's too shy to come on the show
[03:17:55.400 --> 03:17:58.600]  again first take your shoes off open your laptop up
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:02.280]  let us touch you now and i've seen it on the news we have clips of it
[03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:06.760]  they grab the brass they squeeze them they grab your testicles on television
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:09.560]  they squeeze them on the news they show this
[03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:13.800]  women grab men men grab women and of course perverts are flocking
[03:18:13.800 --> 03:18:16.760]  and getting busted constantly raping children on the side
[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:20.520]  because this is where you get to squeeze women's breasts perverts
[03:18:20.520 --> 03:18:24.760]  you know want to force it men want the women to want them
[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:30.040]  but these are perverts and literally what happened to your girlfriend
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:33.480]  well i mean that's the case airport security
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:38.120]  attracts pervert like you know excrement attracts flies
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:42.200]  half the time my girlfriend goes through airport security
[03:18:42.200 --> 03:18:47.320]  she is treated in a manner that would constitute sexual harassment in any
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:51.080]  other context what they've done to make people
[03:18:51.080 --> 03:18:55.560]  accept the body scanners is to make the other option
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:59.880]  you know the pat down in britain you don't even get an alternative option if
[03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:04.680]  they ask you to go through the scanner but in other countries with the pat down
[03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:09.080]  they've merely made the pat down about a thousand times more intrusive than it
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:12.680]  was before and i've seen this on the news they grab each breast
[03:19:12.680 --> 03:19:16.920]  and squeeze and they go rub underneath them and then they stick their hand
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:20.600]  right up between and just let me make sure those are testicles
[03:19:20.600 --> 03:19:25.480]  or make sure that's a woman there hmm yeah i like this job i mean this is so
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:29.160]  sick paul i mean again it's an act of psychological warfare
[03:19:29.160 --> 03:19:32.280]  an act of submission to make sure we fully capitulate
[03:19:32.280 --> 03:19:36.520]  and now they want to take blood at dmv's to get driver's license it's now
[03:19:36.520 --> 03:19:40.280]  federal law under executive order that has not been implemented
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:43.880]  stay there let's talk about it more what it's like for your girlfriend

[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:13.240]  you know my wife's always wanting to fly places and i just said look
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:17.320]  we're gonna have to when i do take a vacation run an rv or something
[03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:21.320]  we can't ever go to the Caribbean with the kids we can't ever fly
[03:24:21.320 --> 03:24:25.640]  i physically cannot watch my son and my two daughters
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:31.000]  with big fat perverts naked body scanning them and groping their genitals
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:35.000]  i mean i just can't do it and it's like oh that's abnormal that's terrorist
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:39.000]  it's all psychological training they admit it is they brag about it
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:43.560]  what is it like for your girlfriend when she flies around places
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:48.520]  uh for business paul and i mean is it making her not want to fly and
[03:24:48.520 --> 03:24:51.560]  does it anger you to know that your woman
[03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:55.480]  has these perverts having their way with her
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:25:01.240]  well it's it's not just sexual groping going back to the pat down
[03:25:01.240 --> 03:25:05.720]  it's literally torture light when she went through
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:09.640]  the security at the uric airport a few weeks ago
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:14.440]  she said it physically hurt her when they were doing the squeezing and groping
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:19.240]  so it's gone even beyond sexual perversion it's like pain compliance
[03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:23.480]  it's like something the corrupt cops that do with tasers
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:29.480]  but another instance we went through paris charles de gaulle airport last
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:34.040]  year after getting back from china which in comparison with u k and
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:38.440]  u.s airport is like the border they treat you nice
[03:25:38.440 --> 03:25:44.040]  you get straight through we got to paris charles de gaulle
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:49.000]  um we had to spend a thousand pounds to buy our tickets again because we were
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:53.560]  a security threat because we wanted to get through into the
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:57.960]  area before you get on the plane about five hours before the plane actually
[03:25:57.960 --> 03:26:01.160]  took off so we were a security threat we gave them a
[03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:05.160]  thousand pounds to get new tickets and suddenly we weren't a security threat
[03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:09.640]  but we get we get through to security she goes through
[03:26:09.640 --> 03:26:15.480]  before me so i get to the other side and i expect her to be right next to me
[03:26:15.480 --> 03:26:20.520]  but they've stopped her bearing in mind she's gone through the metal detector
[03:26:20.520 --> 03:26:25.160]  she's gone through the pat down her bag has gone through the scanner
[03:26:25.160 --> 03:26:29.800]  and these air friends employees are rifling through her bag
[03:26:29.800 --> 03:26:34.520]  while making sexually lewd comments about oh you're attractive i like to go out
[03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:38.440]  with you and that's just another instance so
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:42.680]  every time she goes through an airport she gets sexually harassed
[03:26:42.680 --> 03:26:46.760]  now what seems to happen is that you know even if you believe
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:49.960]  arab terrorists are running around everywhere that aren't federal
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:54.440]  informants their main targets for airport
[03:26:54.440 --> 03:26:58.360]  security are attractive women and old men in wheelchairs
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:02.200]  they particularly get off on harassing and humiliating
[03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:06.440]  old men in wheelchairs and by the way i even have a cbs news report that we
[03:27:06.440 --> 03:27:08.760]  posted up at prisonplanet.com earlier in the week
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:13.320]  where they admit that and some and and and the reports
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:17.240]  with the cops kid the handicap kid who couldn't walk they made him get up and
[03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:19.960]  walk and he was falling down they were screaming at him
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:23.160]  again they're they're telling him to drive us into submission
[03:27:23.160 --> 03:27:26.760]  it's the same all over the west they admit it is a psychological
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:31.880]  warfare operation yeah um the clip the clip in the article today
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:36.520]  shows the old man in the wheelchair he gets his pants pulled down to his
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:40.440]  ankles um during the pat down and he said why are you
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:46.200]  doing this and the woman goes i have power i have power i have power
[03:27:46.200 --> 03:27:49.880]  well be in a chest like some kind of demented silver back
[03:27:49.880 --> 03:27:55.240]  eight and as you mentioned before others other tsa agents are being caught on
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:59.320]  coke bingers screaming i am god i am god there was the
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:02.280]  the case with the guy caught molesting the teenage girl
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:05.880]  these things happen every single week there was the case where they took the
[03:28:05.880 --> 03:28:09.880]  guy and got his email password and started reading his emails
[03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:13.400]  they're all thugs and they're all attracted to this control freak
[03:28:13.400 --> 03:28:18.040]  sexual perversion and airport security allows them to express that
[03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:22.760]  whereas in the uk people who take photographs of their own fully clothed
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:27.640]  children in shopping malls are approached and harassed by police
[03:28:27.640 --> 03:28:32.520]  and charged with being accused of being suspected pedophile
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:36.360]  so you know ugly naked kid is in a
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:39.800]  is okay if you're in a position of authority but if you want to take a
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:43.160]  photograph of your own child on a on a ride then
[03:28:43.160 --> 03:28:47.880]  you're a pedophile or if you take a photo of your daughter in a swimsuit
[03:28:47.880 --> 03:28:51.800]  when she's five they arrested the member of the military because his wife
[03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:55.480]  mailed it to him i mean it's it's just again it is a criminal
[03:28:55.480 --> 03:28:58.200]  government they're recruiting more and more scum
[03:28:58.200 --> 03:29:02.120]  and they now go we have a criminal government move against the population
[03:29:02.120 --> 03:29:04.600]  and now we have the videos and the news releases

[03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:16.760]  when you come in by name without asking you the british government admits they're
[03:29:16.760 --> 03:29:20.120]  doing that too uh... they're searching everyone
[03:29:20.120 --> 03:29:22.840]  uh... they're putting them on list for no reason
[03:29:22.840 --> 03:29:26.680]  uh... they're just totally controlling everything and now it's going to go

[03:36:33.560 --> 03:36:38.040]  incredible watson you want to stay on which is a rarity watson always wants
[03:36:38.040 --> 03:36:39.720]  to get off of something else he's working on
[03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:43.720]  he's a real workhorse here uh but you want to talk about your ideas for
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:47.560]  solutions well yeah the fact is we're really getting
[03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:53.640]  some momentum on this because historically it's been proven
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:57.400]  that strip searches are illegal even for criminals
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:01.560]  and yet we're being told our children are going to be subjected to and we got
[03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:05.240]  uh idaho trying to pass a law against it in their state we've got
[03:37:05.240 --> 03:37:08.040]  congressman speaking out we've got airline executive saying it's killing
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:10.120]  air travel which is exactly what the government wants
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:14.280]  implode the economy this is very unpopular this is bold though why
[03:37:14.280 --> 03:37:17.400]  shouldn't the criminals in government try it to see if they can get away with
[03:37:17.400 --> 03:37:21.080]  it if they don't try they'll never succeed we've got to try and have victory
[03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:25.720]  against them but here's the big news that came out today
[03:37:25.720 --> 03:37:32.760]  new york city 33 million dollar settlement in a class action lawsuit
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:37.240]  that found the strip search has conducted in new york city jail
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:41.240]  over an eight-year period from 99 to 2007
[03:37:41.240 --> 03:37:45.560]  this is strip search has done on criminals
[03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:49.720]  petty criminals and on the left but criminals those strip searches today have
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:55.000]  been found to be completely illegal and new york city must pay 33 million
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:59.240]  dollars to the victims in a class action lawsuit settlement
[03:37:59.240 --> 03:38:03.560]  so that's the way to go if people start filing lawsuits over this because it's
[03:38:03.560 --> 03:38:08.680]  provably criminal i did a brief research and then the feds will just blow up
[03:38:08.680 --> 03:38:11.480]  another airplane as they were caught trying to do on christmas day for
[03:38:11.480 --> 03:38:14.040]  those that don't know the fbi admits they were ordered
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:18.600]  to help him get on the plane everything uh this is all on record now but it's
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:22.040]  it's been buried in a few major newspapers but the undersecretary of
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:26.280]  state admits all this it's all fake folks the radical
[03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:29.960]  muslims are funded by the cia in every major case
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:35.080]  unless it's a provocateur action new york post defense says new york synagogue
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:39.320]  bomb plot was fed's idea they promised a guy dying of liver failure
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:45.000]  a liver if he would just talk about how he was planning it's totally staged
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:49.400]  and the uh state department ordered the underwear bomber to be on the plane
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:54.040]  on top to bottom that was staged if you look at who owns the uh
[03:38:54.040 --> 03:38:58.440]  naked body body scanner companies there are some very interesting connections
[03:38:58.440 --> 03:39:02.680]  there in regard to how it was a well-dressed indian man that helped him
[03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:06.360]  on the plane the major body scanner manufacturer is
[03:39:06.360 --> 03:39:10.760]  owned by indian billionaires just to go into this i'm sure
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:14.760]  but there's the there's that lawsuit class action settlement today
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:19.880]  there's also as you mentioned people need to lobby their local government to pass
[03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:23.640]  legislation like idaho already has that make
[03:39:23.640 --> 03:39:28.040]  homeland security prove there's no health threats from the body scanner
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:31.960]  which made your global radiation bodies bodies that
[03:39:31.960 --> 03:39:35.720]  you know openly stated that pregnant women shouldn't go through them
[03:39:35.720 --> 03:39:39.640]  that the risks are there and they have to prove otherwise before they can go in
[03:39:39.640 --> 03:39:44.920]  the state that idaho wants them you're going to continue to cover this
[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:48.600]  and you've got the key article about them grabbing women's breast
[03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:52.120]  and and then videotaping it body scanning it and laughing about it
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:55.720]  and how the government saying this is okay this is good this is our guys deserve
[03:39:55.720 --> 03:39:59.640]  to have some fun with your women and your children and we don't care but
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:03.240]  violates child porn laws in england in the us we're the government we're god
[03:40:03.240 --> 03:40:06.120]  the feds trying to set the president there is no rights
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:10.120]  for their federal police force to then be on the streets and do this to everyone
[03:40:10.120 --> 03:40:13.480]  this was announced in congress yesterday we told you for months this was coming
[03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:16.920]  we also have the homeland security video it's all at prisonplanet.com
[03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:21.000]  thank you so much watson thanks all right okay
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:25.080]  look in the first second third hour i did nothing but take calls and cover
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:29.320]  the entire healthcare bill i mean it's
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:32.920]  i almost don't want to cover anything but this because the media keeps lying
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:36.600]  about what's really in it it's worse than what the republicans say
[03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:41.960]  the irs taxes your healthcare the irs taxes your savings account the irs
[03:40:41.960 --> 03:40:45.240]  controls your bank account they they're going to give you a medical
[03:40:45.240 --> 03:40:47.800]  id and they're allowed to take money out whenever they want
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:53.480]  i mean this is so insane but separately they sign an executive order saying you
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:56.920]  can't have abortion funds they're already doing abortion funds with federal
[03:40:56.920 --> 03:41:01.160]  grants to hospitals and clinics they and as ron paul said on fox two days ago
[03:41:01.160 --> 03:41:06.360]  and they even have a federal term for it the federal money goes in
[03:41:06.360 --> 03:41:09.320]  and then they have money that they were going to spend on something else other
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:14.440]  than abortion at the hospital or clinic they then move that money over to the
[03:41:14.440 --> 03:41:17.080]  abortion and pay for the other stuff with the federal money
[03:41:17.080 --> 03:41:21.320]  it's nothing but a shell game and it's all on record
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:24.360]  and all the bishops and others have come out and exposed this but i want to get
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:27.080]  into something that's been happening since rovey way but it's now getting
[03:41:27.080 --> 03:41:31.000]  attention it's so illegal you've got to have a permission
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.640]  slip to go to the zoo when you're in the school
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:37.640]  or to go to the planetarium but not to have the school
[03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:41.400]  tell your child to have an abortion they secretly
[03:41:41.400 --> 03:41:45.320]  say don't tell your parents will take you over to the clinic give you an abortion
[03:41:45.320 --> 03:41:49.000]  with the clinics they have in the schools this is out of ko mo
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:52.280]  seattle washington tv it's also in the seattle times
[03:41:52.280 --> 03:41:56.120]  mother furious after in school clinic sets up teen abortion
[03:41:56.120 --> 03:42:00.040]  the mother of ballard high school student is fuming after the health center on
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:02.840]  campus health facilitator daughter's abortion during school hours
[03:42:02.840 --> 03:42:06.680]  the mother whom ko mo news has chosen to find only is jill
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:10.440]  so the clinic kept the information confidential when she signed a consent
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:14.280]  form jill figured it meant 15 year old could go to the ballard teen health
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:17.240]  center located inside the high school for an airache
[03:42:17.240 --> 03:42:21.480]  a sports physician or even birth control but not for help
[03:42:21.480 --> 03:42:24.920]  terminating a pregnancy she took a pregnancy test at school
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:28.520]  at the teen health center nowhere in the paperwork does it mention abortion or
[03:42:28.520 --> 03:42:31.640]  facilitating abortion well you don't tell the scum parents
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:37.560]  they're just to provide like eggs like a hint to the state
[03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:41.640]  jill says her daughter a pro-life advocate was given a pass
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:44.920]  put in a taxi and sent off to have an abortion during school hours all without
[03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:47.640]  her family knowing we had no idea this was being
[03:42:47.640 --> 03:42:50.760]  facilitated on campus she said they just told her that if she could
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:53.880]  shield it from her family that it would be free of charge and no financial
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:57.400]  responsibility so they work to keep it secret from your family
[03:42:57.400 --> 03:43:01.880]  and this is standard procedure with these murdering scum
[03:43:06.040 --> 03:43:10.520]  this is incredible folks this is what this is really all about
[03:43:10.520 --> 03:43:13.880]  and are people going to refuse to pay income taxes now
[03:43:13.880 --> 03:43:18.440]  we built the country without them when you're paying for abortion
[03:43:18.440 --> 03:43:21.320]  are you going to put up with this i heard pro-lifers on local radio this
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:25.480]  morning not arguing with the host that travis county pays for abortions in
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:29.560]  schools with taxpayer money and doesn't tell the parents that's on record
[03:43:29.560 --> 03:43:34.040]  that passed last year but you pro-lifers
[03:43:34.040 --> 03:43:37.400]  are living in la la land you have no idea what's going on
[03:43:37.400 --> 03:43:40.920]  most of you and i want to bring up a real pro-lifer has been arrested
[03:43:40.920 --> 03:43:45.720]  on city property in dallas on a sidewalk with many others he's gone to court
[03:43:45.720 --> 03:43:49.640]  over it and i wanted to get daryl run this a pastor
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:55.640]  i wanted to get his take on his view of christians in this country
[03:43:55.640 --> 03:43:59.080]  the government is criminal and has declared war on the people it's totally
[03:43:59.080 --> 03:44:04.040]  lawless the way this bill was passed was lawless
[03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:07.400]  daryl run this good to have you on with us hey great to be here alex thanks for
[03:44:07.400 --> 03:44:11.080]  having me so give us your take on the story i just
[03:44:11.080 --> 03:44:13.320]  covered and the bill well i tell you you're
[03:44:13.320 --> 03:44:16.440]  absolutely right in fact there's a new movie coming out called blood money
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:19.000]  and it's all about what you're just talking about government funded
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:22.600]  abortions and how it may be illegal to give your
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:26.920]  kid an aspirin at a public school but they can go and get them an abortion
[03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:30.760]  without your permission isn't that amazing
[03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:34.040]  continue well the bottom line is alex and i heard you
[03:44:34.040 --> 03:44:37.720]  talk about earlier today how we all just need to get on our knees and repent
[03:44:37.720 --> 03:44:41.240]  that's that that truly is the case in fact i was just reading this morning in
[03:44:41.240 --> 03:44:44.280]  second testimony is where the bible clearly says
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:49.480]  what no one deceived you by any means for that day won't come until the great
[03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:53.560]  falling away comes and you're talking in reference to the antichrist and the one
[03:44:53.560 --> 03:44:57.720]  world government and so on and you know that's why we see so much apathy is
[03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:02.520]  so much pathetic behavior among those who call themselves christians it's part
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:04.680]  of the great falling away it's part of that
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:08.280]  great cup of delusion that god is poured out upon the people
[03:45:08.280 --> 03:45:13.560]  who won't and the system is scientifically pushing for more and more
[03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:16.840]  and more squeezing women's breast videotaping your
[03:45:16.840 --> 03:45:21.080]  children's naked bodies with the scanners knocking on your door asking to see
[03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:24.120]  your guns training your kids to tattle on you
[03:45:24.120 --> 03:45:26.600]  everything i mean i've read those passages in the bible maybe you can pull up
[03:45:26.600 --> 03:45:29.640]  the verse where it says your children will be set against you by the
[03:45:29.640 --> 03:45:34.040]  government you know you in every culture the government
[03:45:34.040 --> 03:45:37.560]  always seeks to kill kids they're going to turn everything on its head that's
[03:45:37.560 --> 03:45:40.920]  exactly what we see we we see a government that's not of
[03:45:40.920 --> 03:45:45.080]  buying for the people it's not you know a country that's the home of the
[03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:48.520]  the free and and you know land of the free home of the brave it's more of
[03:45:48.520 --> 03:45:52.520]  land of the slave and people are living in an invisible
[03:45:52.520 --> 03:45:56.760]  prison we have had the wool pulled over our eyes incrementally they continually
[03:45:56.760 --> 03:46:00.760]  increase in fact as our forefathers stated in the declaration of
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:04.440]  independence until such time as the long train of
[03:46:04.440 --> 03:46:08.840]  abuse has become intolerable people will tolerate it they will
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:13.240]  continue to put up with it and i believe and that's why i'm almost happy
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:16.600]  that they were so arrogant in passing the health care bill because
[03:46:16.600 --> 03:46:20.680]  i think it was the great wake-up call it certainly was for me let me just share
[03:46:20.680 --> 03:46:25.160]  something kind of private with you but and make it public for everybody but
[03:46:25.160 --> 03:46:29.720]  man i you i've had you and many other celebrities and tv people say they're
[03:46:29.720 --> 03:46:32.440]  all you need to start a radio show you gotta start a radio show you gotta
[03:46:32.440 --> 03:46:36.280]  start radio show and honestly alec i continue to put it off
[03:46:36.280 --> 03:46:40.920]  because man i've worked 20 20 years 120 hours a week
[03:46:40.920 --> 03:46:44.840]  building a big company so i could sell it and then you've started a national
[03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:50.040]  christian television shows and have a huge bio and i know and i know what
[03:46:50.040 --> 03:46:53.880]  that commitment is because i have had that experience i know you're talking
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:46:56.920]  i know the kind of time you're putting in i know the kind of sacrifice you're
[03:46:56.920 --> 03:47:00.600]  making i know the kind of tax that you're constantly
[03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:04.680]  subjected to from all kinds of areas you get it from both sides you get it
[03:47:04.680 --> 03:47:07.320]  from christians you get it from non christians you get it from
[03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:11.320]  you know all kinds of people and so to be honest with you i thought i could sit
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:15.640]  on the sideline satisfied in my own success protecting my own family in
[03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:19.560]  my own things and kind of get unplugged from the system but
[03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:24.360]  take the national id act in this and the health care bill the simple fact of
[03:47:24.360 --> 03:47:27.400]  the matter is you now are mandated to have health
[03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:30.840]  care but you can't get health care until you take the app national id act so
[03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:34.040]  that means if you don't want a national id card with an r5d
[03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:37.640]  chip to track you wherever you go then you're going to get behind it who's
[03:47:37.640 --> 03:47:40.680]  going to come knocking on your door with their guns and masks and so the reason
[03:47:40.680 --> 03:47:44.200]  i wanted to have you on today is because i've told you daryl to start a radio
[03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:47.480]  show and you said no i want to support you and you've donated and really helped
[03:47:47.480 --> 03:47:50.680]  us no we need more voices more people
[03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:54.840]  more prominent well-spoken successful salesman
[03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:57.800]  like yourself and others to go out and sell freedom
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:01.320]  and the truth we need more people attacking the new world order
[03:48:01.320 --> 03:48:05.960]  from every angle and let me just show people this so they understand
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:10.680]  us citizens may need national id card for work that's now in the amnesty bill
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:16.920]  but in this bill it says illegal aliens are exempt in the health care bill
[03:48:16.920 --> 03:48:24.520]  page 65 section bi it says you must have a digital national id card
[03:48:24.520 --> 03:48:27.800]  to get your health care even if you have your own insurance
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:31.480]  it says they can implement this however they want but the illegal aliens are
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:35.560]  exempt from it of course that's in that standard i mean
[03:48:35.560 --> 03:48:39.240]  you know what should we expect especially as christians and one reason i
[03:48:39.240 --> 03:48:42.680]  i am a christian is because i i know the bible is true it's accurate i've
[03:48:42.680 --> 03:48:45.880]  studied it i've scrutinized it i've told you now have a one world government
[03:48:45.880 --> 03:48:49.720]  forming that wants to track everything we eat everything we do and taxes and
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:53.000]  make us show a mark to buy and sell that's it and we're one
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:57.320]  one step away now with this national id act we are one step away from having to
[03:48:57.320 --> 03:49:00.840]  take a mark because you know what the ultimate incremental next increase will
[03:49:00.840 --> 03:49:04.680]  be you'll say hey you could lose the card it cost you to replace it you got to go
[03:49:04.680 --> 03:49:07.160]  wait in line why don't you just take this end point
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:09.560]  why don't you know we'll put all your health records on it
[03:49:09.560 --> 03:49:12.760]  it you know you won't have to worry about losing your credit or your you know
[03:49:12.760 --> 03:49:16.280]  no identity theft i mean all these things that we see
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:19.880]  that you've been talking about you know our actress they're true and they're
[03:49:19.880 --> 03:49:22.360]  happening by design they're happening for a reason
[03:49:22.360 --> 03:49:25.880]  and they were foretold thousands of years ago by the prophet god and
[03:49:25.880 --> 03:49:30.760]  the bottom line is second chronicles 714 sums it up best you alluded to it
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:34.520]  earlier day if my people who are called by my name will
[03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:37.560]  humble themselves and pray and here's the key caveat
[03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:41.320]  and turn from their wicked way that means no more football games
[03:49:41.320 --> 03:49:45.640]  that means no more idolatry american idol who i can't wait to see who's on tv
[03:49:45.640 --> 03:49:49.160]  tonight no it's about getting up wise enough waking up and
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:51.400]  speaking up and never shutting up or giving up
[03:49:51.400 --> 03:49:55.880]  well darryl i agree with you it's time it's time to fully commit and realize
[03:49:55.880 --> 03:49:59.480]  this is life and death against this evil and the fake churches will say oh no
[03:49:59.480 --> 03:50:03.720]  we're about to all be raptured stand down that doesn't matter duty is ours
[03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:06.840]  consequence belongs to god and others all those verses in the bible for
[03:50:06.840 --> 03:50:10.760]  christians out there where god says if you don't stand up against the evil
[03:50:10.760 --> 03:50:14.120]  then the blood of the innocent will be on your hands you are all
[03:50:14.120 --> 03:50:17.000]  accomplices and i'm talking to christians out there
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:20.600]  well that's what that scripture says it says it's my people my people who are
[03:50:20.600 --> 03:50:23.640]  called by my name he's not given that review can that
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:26.840]  instruction to the lost people hey people that are in the world act like
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:30.120]  people in the world i expect politicians to act the way they're acting
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:34.120]  what i don't expect is for people who say they love god who loved them so much
[03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:37.640]  he died for them to not be willing to also lay down their word
[03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:41.000]  one thing you asked me this yesterday what's the number one thing in surveys
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:44.760]  people respond to when they hear the word christian it's hypocrite like this
[03:50:44.760 --> 03:50:49.000]  and that's because people aren't really christians folks if you aren't fighting
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:52.680]  tyranny and don't have a burning desire to stand against corruption for the
[03:50:52.680 --> 03:50:57.400]  innocence then you are not a christian you're alive
[03:50:57.400 --> 03:51:01.000]  one time on this planet hurtling through space and you're going to hell if you
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:04.280]  don't fight this evil did you know there is a growing number of researchers who
[03:51:04.280 --> 03:51:08.120]  agree that 90 percent of all disease begins in the colon did you know that
[03:51:08.120 --> 03:51:11.960]  80 percent of all americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic
[03:51:11.960 --> 03:51:14.840]  infection if allowed our bodies are capable of healing

[03:52:10.200 --> 03:52:14.200]  as we're finishing off this agenda we'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[03:52:14.200 --> 03:52:17.400]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:21.800]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[03:52:21.800 --> 03:52:26.680]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[03:52:26.680 --> 03:52:29.880]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[03:52:29.880 --> 03:52:34.280]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[03:52:34.280 --> 03:52:37.560]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[03:52:37.560 --> 03:52:41.320]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[03:52:41.320 --> 03:52:45.160]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[03:52:45.160 --> 03:52:48.680]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[03:54:11.480 --> 03:54:15.160]  got to control the people let's go ahead and play that clip
[03:54:15.160 --> 03:54:19.800]  we're not ready to be doing it but let me remind you this has been going on for
[03:54:19.800 --> 03:54:23.160]  years we are bringing it to a halt the harsh
[03:54:23.160 --> 03:54:26.680]  fact of the matter is when you're going to pass legislation
[03:54:26.680 --> 03:54:31.240]  that will cover 300 american people in different ways
[03:54:31.240 --> 03:54:37.640]  it takes a long time to to do the necessary administrative steps
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:40.760]  that have to be taken to put the legislation together
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:46.760]  to control the people to control the people they don't just give you
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:50.760]  health care they lower the quality for eugenics
[03:54:50.760 --> 03:54:54.200]  this is what they've done in europe there are death panels they do have the case
[03:54:54.200 --> 03:54:57.800]  for killing granny on the cover of newsweek this is what they're really
[03:54:57.800 --> 03:55:01.320]  pushing darrell rundus well i can say alex is
[03:55:01.320 --> 03:55:05.400]  i would i would ask everybody listening believer or non-believer to question
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:09.480]  my motive on why i would get off the sideline and into the battle
[03:55:09.480 --> 03:55:12.840]  when i had everything the world had to offer i could go anywhere do anything
[03:55:12.840 --> 03:55:16.120]  have everything could retire work really hard to put myself in that position
[03:55:16.120 --> 03:55:19.240]  i'm not both and i'm not bragging god bless me but the point of the matter
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:22.440]  is simply that with this new health care billet so
[03:55:22.440 --> 03:55:26.120]  increasingly obvious you cannot escape the tyranny
[03:55:26.120 --> 03:55:30.440]  i believe it was patrick henry uh... it might have been anyone else that that
[03:55:30.440 --> 03:55:33.720]  that when people turn from god to tyrant
[03:55:33.720 --> 03:55:37.560]  tighten their chains and that's exactly what we see happening and now it's in
[03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:39.560]  your face it's just right there they did their
[03:55:39.560 --> 03:55:43.960]  you know here's an example let's say let's say there's well-spoken doctors
[03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:47.400]  listening or lawyers they need to go buy time on local
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:55:52.120]  stations do a sunday or saturday show start a website start a newsletter
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:56.360]  start calling into talk radio go to city council talk about you just
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:55:59.880]  everybody has to have their voice be heard even if you don't have the means
[03:55:59.880 --> 03:56:03.000]  is me or you or other people to make it up and go do that there's so many
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:05.960]  different things you can't do look here's a simple one you hate junk mail you
[03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:08.920]  hate getting junk mail when they send you those business for buy mail
[03:56:08.920 --> 03:56:11.880]  just stick some literature in there about the new world order about the obama
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:14.440]  deception about info wars and send it back to them
[03:56:14.440 --> 03:56:18.440]  well people are now putting in the fed or info wars dot com on their money i'm
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:20.920]  seeing it everywhere well that's what i mean okay
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:23.960]  if somebody's gonna send me junk mail to my house then you know what i'm gonna
[03:56:23.960 --> 03:56:27.720]  send them back some gospel information about about the bible about jesus i'm
[03:56:27.720 --> 03:56:31.000]  made it free you know but look how fast i'll take you off the junk mail let's
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  do but look there's a thousand different things you could be doing
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:38.840]  whatever you're giving is whatever you're calling it get up get out get busy
[03:56:38.840 --> 03:56:42.920]  doing something because now is the time to take a stand well the number one thing
[03:56:42.920 --> 03:56:46.680]  is go to your state houses and say nullify this federal act
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:50.840]  don't just have your attorney general sue pass legislation saying not in our
[03:56:50.840 --> 03:56:54.360]  state that's constitutional it's time for the states
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:56:58.200]  to stand up to the federal government that is totally
[03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:01.480]  reprobate and criminal i mean look at these articles should government
[03:57:01.480 --> 03:57:05.160]  regulate what we eat the feds want to ban trans fats
