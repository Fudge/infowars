[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:18.000 --> 00:30.000]  last night i watched as much as i could stomach of the dnc and it made me feel
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  embarrassed for this country i'll be completely honest with you it made me
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  really feel sick to my stomach that bizarre reanimated zombie clinton
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  stumbling around and everything he said was a lie and about how hillary goes
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  into a country and fixes everything when everywhere she goes she destroys
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  whether it's sirbia or bosnia herzegovina or libya or syria or egypt i mean i
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  could go on and on and on the destabilization programs that that dynamic
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  crime have carried out and him talking about the love of my life it was truly
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  sick and then watching c-span so i could kind of get behind the scenes shots of the
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  people there i've got to say you get invited to a party and you get there
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  and it's got a weird feeling and the people are all kind of creepy and weird
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  looking and i'm just going off how they look but i mean you know creepy acting
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  sneaky looking evil looking watching the body language the democratic party
[01:40.000 --> 01:49.000]  operatives they just look like a group of criminals they look like a bunch of
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  middle patients mixed in with criminals and pedophiles and slime bags with
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.000]  republicans you've kind of got swollen guys and pinstripe suits cigars but and
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  they've got their own seediness that's kind of the republican establishment
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  that's being swept out right now i've been to a lot of r&c's this one with
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  trump had a grassroots feeling of electricity and gone were the
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  establishment republicans almost entirely it was extremely powerful and i've
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  talked to some of our crews can be joining us later today and they picked up
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  on the very same thing and just watching the sliminess of the black lives matter
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  pimps there to distract african-americans from how their unemployment's doubled
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  how they've been totally forgotten because the democrats know they got them
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  how they're invoking total race trying to turn the black population into like
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  the black clan it was absolutely painful painful painful and the
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  reviewing clips this morning that we're gonna be going over it was just
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  incredible and then the stories on info wars calm the stories on prison
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  planet dot com stories on drugs report dot com are unbelievable our crew got
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  the footage from three different angles other media got it as well in fact one
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  place from other media because it's better quality and it's black lives
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  matter saying get to the back white people you're not allowed to be in the
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  back of our demonstration literally inverting what happened to rose the
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  parks saying get to the back of the bus lady i mean the irony whites ordered
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  the back of crowded black dnc march and it colleges all over the country they
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  are the colleges are segregating and the same things happening for muslims for
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  for for black americans this is the divide and conquer strategy you see when
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  it was a vast majority of whites until the abolitionist and republicans and
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  christians broke the back of institutional racism to a great extent
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  it was still there but broken they would play this broken strategy the democrats
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  would but as soon as the republicans defeated that in the late fifties and
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  early sixties they switched to oh we're the party of the minorities now and as
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  soon as minorities hit a majority which they are most areas boom now the
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  flipping back to race and man i tell you you see ignorant races white people it's
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  embarrassing it is just as disgusting to see a bunch of racist black people i mean
[04:25.000 --> 04:34.000]  it is it is really creepy and weird and bizarre and what's even worse is you
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  got mainstream media telling you it's good and it's up there on the stage
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  being pushed is something wonderful now this is the kickoff of the 28 hour

[04:56.000 --> 05:04.000]  how we come back a new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic reports
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  fox news getting inked may lead to long-term skin problems and an increased
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  risk of cancer according to a new report by the european chemicals agency
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  researchers found red ink was the most dangerous but they warned blue green
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  and black is also risky the most severe concerns are allergies caused by
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductive
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  toxic effects the report stated it's also being reported that governments in
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  the EU do not regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food and many shops
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  operate without government regulations in the United States the food and drug
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  administration regulates chemicals and products including tattoo ink
[05:45.000 --> 05:50.000]  cosmetics and color additives but due to other public health priorities the

[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  obviously going to be airing we've got some highlights obviously of the RNC and
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  DNC will have our reporters live on the ground throughout the next 28 hours we
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  have a lot of special surprise guests joining us in the next hour or so we
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  will put a schedule up though at info wars dot com forward slash giant and I
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  want to be clear for folks info wars dot com forward slash giant has the feed of
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  the 28 hour broadcast we will also have a refeed loop of the official four hours
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  of the main show for folks that want to be able to go in and see any of those
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  newsmaking interviews that break and one reason I do that is there's actually
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  TV stations and other systems out there that actually get the show off of that
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  HD archive every day not just the TV satellites the radio satellites and
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  other systems a lot of TV stations a lot of cable systems a lot of radio
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  stations strangely enough I started doing TV to try to get on TV stations but
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  what happens is radio stations a lot of our affiliates end up picking up the
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  nightly news every night and a lot of them are going to be picking up large
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  sections and of course you're welcome to it's free to air of the 28 hour
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  broadcast much of it commercial free so you just play your commercials wherever
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  you want or we play a video or something just stations have at it enjoy
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  yourselves again we're all about freedom here we just want to get the message out
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  so whether you want to play excerpts of the show or whether you want to carry
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  the whole 28 hours or whatever you want to do right now it's about fighting the
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  globalists and exposing the coronation of Hillary who officially got the
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  nomination last night despite the fact that she probably only got from the
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  numbers we've crunched 35% of the vote Sanders annihilated her and in 10 states
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  won by more than 20 points and it just didn't matter it just didn't matter
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  because she got the super delegates unbelievable we've got all sorts of
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  stories about Trump supporters being shot being stabbed being attacked
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  especially black and Hispanic Trump supporters there is cult-like bullying
[10:55.000 --> 11:05.000]  going on by just mobs of basically thugs from MS-13 to black power groups
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  it's just crazy it's absolutely crazy to see the president and the mainstream
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  media trying to foment division in this country we're gonna be breaking it all
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  down Trump just finished coming up a few minutes ago a lengthy speech from
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  Florida we're gonna be airing some excerpts of that today obviously we
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  also have with huge breaking news Roger Stone joining us coming up here in about
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  15-20 minutes David Nott will be popping in via Skype from the DNC Matt Bracken
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  on the massive increase in Islamic attacks there's like three or four a day
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  now it was once a month then once a week then once a day it's like four or five
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  a day and that's what we know of I mean I've just got stacks here it's incredible
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  and British children found in cages of Islamics I mean it's just it is it is
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  hell on earth and then William Benny former technical director of the National
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  Security Agency one of the biggest whistleblowers in history will be joining us
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  and then we've got everybody from Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkins to
[12:11.000 --> 12:18.000]  Dinesh to Suza to just so many others joining us it's it's going to be a huge
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  huge 28-hour global transmission so obviously this is about activism you
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  may know all about the New World Order and more than I do but the point is that
[12:28.000 --> 12:34.000]  the understanding of global government and stealth government was known by
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  Patriots 50 years ago and they fought it and got made fun of and ridiculed and
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.000]  demonized and audited and arrested and murdered in many cases but it doesn't
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  matter today in national polls 90 to 92% in every scientific poll believe
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  elements of the government killed JFK 90 plus percent of Americans and Gallup
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  polls want the Federal Reserve audited and or abolished and they know it's
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  private 15 years ago I was ridiculed in the New York Times saying that it was not
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  private you could not even get people to admit that there was a carbon tax plan
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  eight nine years ago Al Gore would go before Congress and say it was a
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  conspiracy theory when he owned the main carbon company set to make trillions
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  they're not playing games and the good news is we're not either they're just
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  lying to us and stonewalling isn't working so they've now gone into complete
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  and total panic mode and have now doubled down in lying to the most
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  weaponized lying I've ever seen total inversion of reality and again who
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  cooked up the scam when he was a senator with Kinley of Enron look it up
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  yourself Enron environmentalism the carbon credit scam pumps millions of
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  tons more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere set to make trillions every
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  decade and you can actually go see ATR.org Democratic platform calls for
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  carbon tax globally Donald Trump wants to stop that so does Vladimir Putin we're
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  talking about that with Roger Stone coming up but before we go any further
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  I just want you to know that Bill Clinton is now dodging subpoenas oh yes
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  there are subpoenas out for Bill Clinton and so I'm just gonna stop right there
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  Roger Stone's coming up in about again 16 17 minutes let me just calmly now
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  let me just calmly give you the headlines that we will cover in detail
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  today let me just go through these for everybody charges is missed against
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  Baltimore police officers in Freddie Gray case will there be riots now that
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  we learned that three of the police officers were black and that the judge
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  dismissing the charges is black no one's defending excesses of police it
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  happens it's wrong there are people on power trips that become police it's
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  wrong it's a globalist diversion from the big issues to get us fighting with
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  each other period Freddie Gray case charges against three remaining
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  officers dropped shooting deaths of police up 78% this year troubling to
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  Memorial Fund funny though that when they had black lives matter victims
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  families up there people who died in questionable shootings they didn't have
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  all the widows of dead cops up there and everybody come together and hug and say
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  let's work on bringing communities together they didn't mention the 2000
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  plus people shot in the first seven months of this year in Chicago almost all of
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  them black black on black 500 plus dead black because the cops are pulling out
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  they're not going to those areas and quite frankly I don't blame them I was
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  out there to black lives matter deal there were communist people open carrying
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  out there which is fine we had ours open carry and it was a really creepy feeling
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  to know I was a target when I went in there and charged in there and said
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  it's wrong and randomly kill cops I got to really get what it feels like to
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  people surrounding me not knowing when a bullet's gonna hit me you imagine me in
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  a cop just you know writing tickets or going to a house disturbance or
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  whatever or you get called to the scene of stuff at a robbery liquor store
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  there's 20 people calling for you to die right there I wouldn't take that job in
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  a million years a million years and the point is we have the numbers
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  there's more cops getting killed than there are people in questionable
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  shootings and the issue here is the globalist want the police to be our
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  oppressors we need to try to be friends with them take our communities back
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  and come together and not be idiots but I'm sorry I said I just got red lines
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  it's it's hard to do I'm gonna do this later let me just get into it because
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  it's all paints of picture these articles that go together okay 990 people
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  shot by police in 2015 total 258 were African-Americans and it turns out more
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  than a third were shot by other black officers and we start doing the numbers
[16:52.000 --> 16:59.000]  man you're maybe maybe maybe 50 60 70 questionable shootings good put those
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  cops in prison but is it the biggest issue in the galaxy no no no again a
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  total diversion from our government trying to start World War three with
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  the Russians and putting jihadist in control of Syria who killed over 250

[24:00.000 --> 24:18.000]  I'm going to say something right now
[24:18.000 --> 24:26.000]  that I guarantee you is extremely important and quite frankly very very
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.000]  profound and I want this to be a message to the globalist to the social
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.000]  engineers to the technocrats who have not learned from history and who think
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  they're invincible if they want to have the illusion of an elected government
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  they're going to actually have to at least let people vote in the primaries
[24:49.000 --> 24:57.000]  and pick the candidate of their choice then you can try to steal the general
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  election and maybe get away with it but you can't fix it early on in front of
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  everyone and have it be common knowledge that it's been stolen and that a party
[25:08.000 --> 25:19.000]  system like the Communist Chinese Central Committee and Politburo is selecting
[25:19.000 --> 25:35.000]  the nominee and that's indicative and is a bellwether of the old rusty quasi
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  royal political class of the Democrats and the Republicans trying to hold on by
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  their fingernails with that weird creepy
[25:45.000 --> 25:52.000]  Bill Clinton walking around on stage spewing lies if I was going to cast
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  someone for a horror movie where there's a funeral home and they're really all
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  devil worshipers killing people or something I mean I would I would cast
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  Bill Clinton I mean Bill Clinton is who I would cast as a pedophile it's who I'd
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  cast as a rapist it's who I'd cast as a pervert as a murderer as a monster as a
[26:12.000 --> 26:22.000]  psychopath as a serial killer I mean that's who he is all of it's true that
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  is a literal demon and they cut to Hillary smiling breaking the glass ceiling
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  and I look at the crowd supporting her these are creepy weird dumb losers who
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  all organized together so they can just run the government and rob everybody the
[26:40.000 --> 26:50.000]  average Democrat knows they're a piece of criminal filth and they hate those of
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  us that are smart and they hate those of us that are successful they've got a
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  bunch of young women meaning well buying into this whole thing I think they're
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  going to get ahead because the system has set it up to put women in positions
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  of power all these images of women crying they put up and Hillary only up
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  there with girls as they end the human condition as they break up the family
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  put women in the positions of power in the final phase I have the
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  technocracy and the robots replacing the general population this is all they
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  admitted plan and you're watching women married to the state and that it's the
[27:29.000 --> 27:36.000]  man that's going to bring home the bacon by by giving them the job this is the
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  greatest slavery I've ever seen but here's what's profound and important I
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  guarantee you unequivocally I can just study history I can see it that rotting
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  Hillary and rotting Bill and rotting Obama and and a hateful Michelle Obama
[27:51.000 --> 28:02.000]  and and Michael Moore and all these people are just indicative of the death
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  of the establishment and it's not just happening here it's it's happening all
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  the world populism is rising and there's nothing they can do to put the genie
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  back in the bottle there's nothing you can do you're not going to be able to
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  control humanity you're not going to play us off against each other time is
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  running out for you in a big big way if you were smart and actually put good
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  candidates forward at least new candidates younger candidates smarter
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  candidates candidates that had at least a little bit of populism and weren't
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  out to get everybody you would you would remain in control and power and could
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  grow your technocracy and probably beat humanity in the end if you went a
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.000]  little bit slower but you're so arrogant you're so disconnected you're so
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  drugged up you can look at Hillary and Bill and I mean the footage of her in
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  public doing weird tics and quirks and looking like she's about to fall down
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.000]  and completely insane this is the madness of King George this is the madness of
[29:06.000 --> 29:16.000]  the Pharaoh I forget the poet that said or the historian that said that when God
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  wants to destroy us he makes us mad those that God would destroy he first makes
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  mad and I'm just telling you steal the election from Trump he's probably ten
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  points ahead as best I can tell pull whatever scams you want you people are
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.000]  evil you stink spiritually God sees you and you'll always be maggots there it
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  is the phrase whom the gods would destroy they would first make mad taken

[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  Hinckley juniors brother met with the bushes in Colorado two days before the
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  shooting best buddies with the bushes and all hooked up with the central
[35:46.000 --> 35:56.000]  intelligence agency but Reagan survived so that's just some of the news on that
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  front meanwhile what's happening inside the convention Democratic platform calls

[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  security says Trump has destroyed US foreign policy and they blame him for
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  ISIS did you know that because he called the very strategy a year before the
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  Russians deployed it that took ISIS out to a great extent of course that's because
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  he was being advised by General Flynn and others who had been secretly working
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  with the Russians oh countermanding in a soft coup against Obama the plan to fund
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  Al Qaeda and ISIS and now General Flynn says Hillary should be arrested it's not
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  just Alex Jones saying that now more voices are oh Hillary says the Russians
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  are so bad they hacked her stealing the election and they also hacked the UN
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  hiding the decline in temperatures and pushing carbon tax and Putin said we've
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  exposed it because it's a plan to dehumanize populations and lower the
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  population in bankrupt nation states so I say I salute the Russians we have a
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  foreign globalist group running our country with Roger Stone and so thank
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  God we've got people in the Pentagon people like Trump and people like

[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  billions in the first decade if they turn the carbon off this is the plan
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  21st century they kill you by turning the energy off called siege they should do

[38:27.000 --> 38:35.000]  correct good before we go any further during the 28 hour broadcast obviously we
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  are just doing one more thing to help fundraise to be able to continue at the

[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  people with black circles around their eyes around here we have a lot of folks
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  who work in 18 hours a day for about two weeks like Rob do I've just had to tell

[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  telling you Mitch trying to get good people organizing him is is it hard
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  enough then having the money to pay him a decent living wage so we are the tip
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  of the spear we are information warfare kamikaze he's everybody knows it you see
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  how we are dominating the narrative because it's the truth the truth always

[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  growth I mean right now we are on the level playing filled with the enemy
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  thousands of articles admitting from Newsweek to the New York Times Alex Jones
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  is the spirit of the movement against the new world order I mean it's not a
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  secret I said is this off record and I was like no not really off record but I
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  mean that's not just me saying that or the enemy saying that Donald Trump knows
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  that so we're going to Roger Stone who's now joining us the hardest working guy
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  out there that works like 20 hours a day it's insane and he's got so much to
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  cover so I want to give him the floor on AGs going after investigations of
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  Clintons this you're hearing this here first how they try to plan to steal it
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  how Trump's going to fight back so many angles I want to just give him the floor
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  now Roger Stone former head of Trump's campaign obviously one of the prime
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  movers out there exposing what's happening Roger thank you for joining us
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  you've got the floor take over Alex great to be back with you you know
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  honesty with Donald Trump pulling ahead in the polls is I think I told you he
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  would we went out we had a few too many of these last night so I'm a little
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  late right more late rising than I normally am I'm very excited because the
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.000]  the two things are happening here Alex Trump is gaining and Hillary is
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.000]  imploding bombshell after bombshell when presumably Russian hackers or Putin
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  himself arranges for the truth to get to the American people the Clintons
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.000]  attack the source rather than the content it of course makes the contents
[44:03.000 --> 44:10.000]  no less true and they expose the theft of democracy and the humping of Bernie
[44:10.000 --> 44:18.000]  Sanders they they expose that Deborah Wasserman Schultz is a mole she's a mole
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.000]  who stole the nomination for Hillary so and then on the heels of that Alex the
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  IRS is open to national investigation the interline piece today in the daily
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.000]  caller I can now reveal that the Ohio Attorney General has opened a formal
[44:37.000 --> 44:44.000]  investigation this is a I think maybe on the info wars website remember that
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.000]  any place the Clinton Foundation did fundraising which is to say all 50 states
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  they're regulated by the state attorney generals the problem with that is their
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.000]  state filings like their federal filings are permeated with fraud partial
[45:00.000 --> 45:08.000]  information some cases no information some cases lies and we also know now
[45:08.000 --> 45:15.000]  the IRS is looking specifically on epic skimming meaning for example the
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.000]  the nation of Norway says that they gave the Clinton Foundation X but they
[45:20.000 --> 45:27.000]  only deposited why there's a number of these discrepancies involving government
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  payments to the Clintons which I think we recognize our bribes but they're
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.000]  required to have disclosure in those countries so this is somebody is just
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.000]  getting off the top who could that be but Bill and Hillary what did you make
[45:45.000 --> 45:52.000]  of the display last night I mean it looked like archetypal death Clinton and
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.000]  and all the tottering around and the politicos just look like a group of
[45:58.000 --> 46:05.000]  criminals pardon me for getting distracted by the rakeish tilt of my hat I am it
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  was the it was the raping of democracy the Clintons are having the worst
[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  roads the worst run of luck I have seen if Bill thinks so highly of Hillary why
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  did he cheat with her cheat on her with thousands and thousands of women now as
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.000]  a libertine I'm not really concerned with Bill Clinton's consensual sexual
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  affairs my problem is not Maryland fidelity or adultery or girlfriends or
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  mistresses or consensual sex but as I've written in the Clintons war on women
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  which you can get at info wars dot com at the store the issue here is sexual
[46:41.000 --> 46:47.000]  assault and rape it's bullying and violence against women and Bill has
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  perpetrated it as you know Hillary has covered it up by bullying it builds
[46:51.000 --> 47:00.000]  victims Roger obviously Trump is surging ahead the fact that so many burning
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  people almost all of them we talked to now said they're going for Trump this
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  has really got to be scaring Hillary what do you expect her to strike back
[47:08.000 --> 47:18.000]  with increasing attempts at censorship you know I believe that the FEC and in
[47:18.000 --> 47:26.000]  the FCC are harassing certain conservative news outlets over bogus
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.000]  complaints filed by David Brock that because you are pro-trump this constitutes
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  some kind of corporate illegal contribution pretty much vacated by
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  citizens united these are bogus complaints meant to harass news outlets into
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  not covering you know certain people they're going to continue to put play
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  these kinds of games at censorship did you notice how there was not a single
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  American flag in the hall on the first night of their convention not one where
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  was that where's the stars and stripes these people hate America they
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  apologize for America Donald Trump wants to reassert American power that's not
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  just rhetoric let's talk about that but then you know who are these modern
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  Democrats because they seem like middle patients I mean they already run the
[48:19.000 --> 48:26.000]  country why do they want to wreck it well because they're driven by what the
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  tune that's been paid for by their funders Hillary is a neocon she's right
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.000]  over there with George W. Bush the reason that the Russians are are probably
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  leaking this damning information is because they don't want a nuclear war
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  either Hillary's been on a war that benefits her donors and the multinational
[48:50.000 --> 48:57.000]  corporations and the defense contractors that that have already funded her
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.000]  assault on the White House and Putin understands that which I think sees in
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  Trump a tough guy that he could make a peace deal with and both sides could
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  live together is that not what we want I think that's what we want
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  now instead the globalists want to be underhanded and bring in global crisis
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  you can't do that with nuclear weapons now don't they understand they can't pull
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  a Napoleon or a Hitler today because it'll end the world yeah but I this is
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.000]  the this is the power game that I think that that they are playing and the
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  establishment including the international community is hysterical about the rise
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  of Trump the rise of national and by the way you're not just saying that the
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  Washington Post admitted sort of Bloomberg that the last week top globalists
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  including the Chinese have all been meeting and quote how to quote double down
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  and defeat the rise of populism they admit world governments in trouble so
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  so Trump and this whole movement has forced a global debate look at Briggs
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  it this is incredible let's talk about that and let's talk about the real polling
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  numbers that you guys are getting that you're researching and really how far
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  ahead Trump is and what you see in the last few months of this race how will
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  the Empire strike back I'm worried about false flags I'm worried about an
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  assassination attempt on Hillary blamed on a patriot
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  well when I was in Cleveland I had an opportunity to meet with Nigel
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  Farage I understand that you met with him also and then we saw him briefly there
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  and I guess it was a bar and he was very focused on the enormous success they
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  had with blue collar labor voters on brexit there's a lot there to be learned
[50:38.000 --> 50:44.000]  see I think that the hard-working working-class Democrat people that pay
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  their taxes they don't go to demonstrate we're gonna skip this break go ahead
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  that they're not rioting they love their country they love their flag their
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  children are in the service their grandchildren in the service these
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.000]  these people are fed up and I think they exit the party which is left today is a
[51:02.000 --> 51:10.000]  party of limousine liberals crazy whack job progress of progressives the the
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.000]  professional Democratic gay establishment which is not gay established
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  in America I'm happy to say because I think Donald Trump is going to do
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  extremely well among gay and lesbian voters because he's the only candidate
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  who stands between them and Islamic terrorist inhalation like black people
[51:31.000 --> 51:36.000]  like Hispanic like whites we are all subject to this first they kill the gays
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  then they kill the Christians separate from statistically even being killed by
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  a jihadi why wouldn't the Democrats stand against that why are they for Islam
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  and radical forms of it that is the opposite of being liberal it's the opposite
[51:49.000 --> 51:56.000]  of Thomas Jefferson well because the the the muscular Democratic foreign policy
[51:56.000 --> 52:02.000]  of guys like John Kennedy and Harry Truman who we may have our criticisms of
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.000]  but they they were strongly anti-communist now in the case of Truman he broke
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  the back of but he probably broke the back of the communists in Greece when
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  they try to take over Kennedy I think botched the Bay of Pigs probably should
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  never have approved the lane brain plan of the Bay of Pigs but remember Alex
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  he got elected president by running as a anti-communist hall to Nixon's right
[52:27.000 --> 52:32.000]  so that stream of patriotic Democrat that loved America and he cut taxes by
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.000]  50% they don't they don't exist anymore the Democratic Party is a
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  conglomeration of Wackdell extremists they're the extreme we're the main
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  yeah they keep calling us extreme because we want private property and lower taxes
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  and they spend all day trying to make us look weird when they are the freak show
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.000]  with black lives matter on the stage nothing about all the dead police I mean
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  they could have had black lives matter family members and then the the the
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  widows of dead cops and everybody hug that would have been better for the
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  Democrats but they don't but see they hate the country so much they've got to
[53:07.000 --> 53:12.000]  create the division yeah and no American flags they why would you not have
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  American flags it's just like the symbol of America's gone we're the third world
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  party now hey and they and they feature a long speech by the one woman we call
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  Pocahontas the woman who falsely claimed to be a Native American so she began
[53:28.000 --> 53:34.000]  certain preferences at Harvard so Alex you know that was the most boring speech
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  I've ever heard I almost rather watch hate drives I was about to say no energy
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.000]  the Democrats look completely dead so so so read us the tea leaves in the last
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  six seven minutes give us other key things that are happening Roger because
[53:45.000 --> 53:51.000]  this is key well what's amazing is the way Trump is breaking out of the old
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  model you see I think previously we thought of this and based on the
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  strategy being pursued by Hillary which is the Obama strategy which is not the
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  Bill Clinton strategy yet everyone on the left you can to vote for you
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  registers many experts as you can some places try to vote illegals that story
[54:12.000 --> 54:20.000]  will break conversely that would make our strategy maximize every vote on the
[54:20.000 --> 54:25.000]  right and the center right and the bet by the Clinton says that their stack is
[54:25.000 --> 54:33.000]  higher than ours this is a strategy that worked for for Barack Obama here's the
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  folly in their argument Trump can make incursions into small but key parts of
[54:39.000 --> 54:45.000]  their constituency the people the Clintons policies are leaving behind that
[54:45.000 --> 54:53.000]  she has people voting for her whose interests she is betraying every day
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  you know I was just putting a daily caller article up on screen for TV
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  viewers and it shows the RNC with American flags everywhere and then it
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  shows the DNC no American flags looks like some high-tech communist Star Trek
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  meeting you understand these are globalists they are ending national
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  sovereignty they are destroying the nation state and bringing in unelected
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.000]  tyranny I mean the choice could not be clear I mean I'm all for bringing
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  immigrants in they're great people we need them but make sure they're not
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  felons and and have them say we want to be Americans we want private property
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  and self-defense and wealth okay if you don't want that we're not letting you
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  in you have to pledge allegiance you have to say you're in the club and I just
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  can't believe they're trying to bring people in who don't want to be part of
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  the club or they're trying to indoctrinate them to be in this sick
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  anti-freedom club it is crazy I apologize we had some internet issues there
[55:44.000 --> 55:50.000]  little electrical down so I understand I can hear you but what other key points we need to know Roger
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  well the polls show that Trump therefore is making these inroads in places like
[55:54.000 --> 56:00.000]  western Pennsylvania parts of Ohio and there's a New York upstate New York
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  York could actually be in play he's doing extraordinary well in New Jersey
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  Michigan showing growing strength isn't it going to win New York well I think New York
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  is the bluestate in the country I mean registration the Republican Party of
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  New York City is down to about 19% but there's got to be some pride there
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  what about Florida is in dominate Florida it's not a fine question the bushes and
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  the talkies the liberal Republicans let the party go to shit they have no
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  fundraising base they can't find candidates they don't run anybody for the city
[56:35.000 --> 56:41.000]  offices they leave candidates on the state ticket empty that is pathetic so
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  Trump is bigger than the Republican Party and he's got a lot of sizzling his home
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  state my guess is in the end he'll fight for it but all I'm saying is it is so
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  democratic it's upheld but he's doing really good to Florida what about
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  Pennsylvania Florida Florida he's actually ahead Pennsylvania you see I think
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  is that I've always considered the fool's goal of a presidential politics
[57:04.000 --> 57:11.000]  Bush did well they're early faded Romney did well they're not Romney McCain did
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.000]  well they're early faded Romney did well they're early faded a lot of money was
[57:17.000 --> 57:23.000]  spent on that state to lose these are turd blossoms decisions mostly and they
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  always fell short what's interesting though is if you go back and look at
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  why they were briefly ahead why Trump's ahead today they're not the same kind
[57:33.000 --> 57:40.000]  of voters in other words they're Democrats Union middle-class working people
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.000]  well overwhelmingly white in that it were really a road in the Pittsburgh area in
[57:46.000 --> 57:52.000]  Pittsburgh suburbs Trump is running as it like a typical Republican in the weaker
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  eastern part of the whole dynamic of Pennsylvania is problematic because you
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  will lose the city of Philadelphia by trying to say I'm probably can't with it
[58:02.000 --> 58:07.000]  what about California well let's finish it you'll win by 350,000 votes
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  lose in the city you'll make up a little bit in suburbs if you pick up the rest
[58:11.000 --> 58:16.000]  in the West Trumson play in the Keystone state so I think it's great news
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  Roger we got you on late I know you put another interview coming up if you can't

[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  Roger Stowe we got four and a half minutes left finishing up with the
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  different states how you see things going I mean I know you told me a few weeks
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  ago you think you'd be five six points ahead by the end of the convention
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Hillary I think he's having a lackluster convention even mainstream media admits
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  that the scandal the emails and I think she's mortally wounded my gut tells me
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  if they don't try to steal the election they failed well Alex first of all I
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  want to say I got this hat in preparation for going to Philadelphia
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  I mail order to shake a very t-shirt I stopped bathing like Friday before
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  and I was going to be out there with the demonstrators and then it occurred to me
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  that there's no reason to go as I think it was Wellington said never interfere
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  with your enemy when they're in the process of destroying themselves exactly
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  so I but I did we both said that the last day in Cleveland on Friday as we were
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  saying bye and then it was like 2 a.m. we're like oh yeah this is too good
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  we don't want to go there it looked like you know we're starting stuff up now
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  they would have falsely accused of us of inciting violence like when we were
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  set up by that fat turk whose name I can't recall in the other day in Cleveland
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  so anyway that little fat turk got his butt handed to him in any event you know
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.500]  Trump is really on his game here and you always have to look at both ends of the
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:13.500]  race by that I mean Hillary's imploding between the IRS investigation which is
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:20.000]  enormous and I predict that before long you'll have a half a dozen attorney
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  generals in hot pursuit you'll have Bill dodging subpoenas while he tries to
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  campaign for Hillary it is you know I think have enormous enormous problems
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.500]  oh yeah other states finishing up real quick California other states how do you
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:40.000]  see this going well California is probably out of reach for the Republicans in
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  all honesty however Trump has a celebrity quality like Schwarzenegger that
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  kind of transcends the old rules there is no state in the country who is more
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  celebrity conscious I mean Alex I'd like to do a tour of California with you and
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  you ripped up the roof off their old California is always ahead of the curve
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  on pop culture so I think Trump is a larger-than-life figure therefore he
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.500]  reaches beyond conservative Republicans Latinos he has to make some inroads but
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.000]  I'll tell you this I know a lot of Hispanic Americans you know what they
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  want jobs I was about to say California is falling apart well you know Jerry
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.500]  Brown is left holding a bag of shit I mean a hundred years of liberal policies
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.500]  has borrowed and taxed them into the Stone Age the state and he's had to make
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:39.000]  great economies and the state is a basket case and it's much better than
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  many other states it's just overwhelming though Alex it's become
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  more democratic demographically it's not the state that Ronald Reagan won twice
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  far fewer white voters about far fewer Republicans there are right for targets
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  in my opinion okay what are the key targets where the key battlegrounds that
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  give the victory to Trump because he's ahead in all the polls Florida is king
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Ohio will be king Michigan will be king Colorado will be king Iowa will be king
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  this is why I have been saying that it is essential that one million new voters
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  be identified through a sophisticated in a Linux program and these people are
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.500]  highly motivated their Trump voters go out and register I would say do an
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:39.500]  analysis of how many votes Mitt Romney lost let's say Pennsylvania by double that
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.500]  number let's call it the second discussion Roger we're out of time
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.500]  stonezone.com we look forward to speaking to you again soon get some rest my
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500]  friend I've been working really hard and sorry about your dog passing my friend
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.500]  any thanks all right we'll be back with a ton of news your phone calls Leanne
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:05:01.000]  McAdoo and reporters on the ground from Philadelphia straight ahead a new study
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.500]  suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic reports Fox News getting inked may lead
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:11.000]  to long-term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer according to a
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.500]  new report by the European Chemicals Agency researchers found red ink was
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:20.500]  the most dangerous but they warned blue green and black ink is also risky the
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.500]  most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the ink and
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.000]  possible carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects the report
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.500]  stated it's also being reported that governments in the EU do not regulate
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:38.500]  tattoo ink as they do drugs and food at many shops operate without government
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.000]  regulations in the United States the Food and Drug Administration regulates
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  chemicals and products including tattoo ink cosmetics and color additives but
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  due to other public health priorities the FDA has not traditionally regulated
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.500]  tattoo inks and pigments you can find more reports on info wars.com

[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.500]  first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.500]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:14.500]  can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.500]  the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the

[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  the word that the show is on and many stations are deciding I've been told
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  as this happened last few years to carry more of the broadcast later in the
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  evening we're also fund raising today and we are doing sales and I keep saying
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  biggest ever big server because we're getting to be the discount store not
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  just high quality but high quality discounted because I mean I'd rather sell
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  you know 100 cheeseburgers at a lower price end up being able to get more money
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  to fund ourselves and sell 50 cheeseburgers at a higher price but like
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  make less money it's that metric we have a big enough audience to do that so
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  we're so competitive normally 2995 for the nutraceuticals that are in
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  brain force which is emblematic of the sleeping giant awakening an incredible

[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  because that makes like 40 point something but 1776 is how much it is

[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  capital to not just stay at the level we are we've got to get probably six seven
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  eight more people and have the money to have our crew go out and cover things
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  and we're dominating coverage we're changing the global narrative we're
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  having the biggest effect quite frankly anybody out there thanks to all of our
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  folks that are helping us like Rogerport.com and others but you are the key
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  the listeners that spread the links that send out the podcast and send out the
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  video links you are the key to all of us I want to thank you and salute you it is
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  so humbling when I go out to Cleveland in other areas to shake your hand and it
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  felt so good to be there at those rallies where you have a third of the people
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  being black Americans and probably 20 30% being this I mean I'm telling you there
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  were less white people when you counted the quote minorities we're all just human
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  beings and we want lower taxes we want a second amendment we know the globalist
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  are eugenicists heating hospitals around the world with dead babies and selling
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  their body parts now Leanne McAdoo's just popping in because she's gonna be hosting
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  a lot today I'm gonna go to David Knight then to your phone calls at the bottom
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  of the hour on everything that's happening the epic state of the world
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  what's happening with Black Lives Matter these Black Lives Matter groups
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  getting up and saying no no whites at the front of the line whites to the back
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  these videos are on info wars.com black and Hispanic Americans being shot and
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  attacked if they tell people they support Trump the weaponization of the media
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  800 259 9231 800 2599 231 and we're now over an hour an hour and 14 minutes
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  in the 28 hour broadcast I cannot tell you how critical it is to spread that link
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Leanne McAdoo drug in here as you're back to doing research you were making some
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  great points and actually pounding your hand on the on the door angrily I've
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  rarely seen this angry it's good to see this energy we always have great energy
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  but while watching the DNC last night you know David Knight's inside of it
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  we're about to go to him and that collectivist rat now.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  I mean why are you so fired up?
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  Well you know I just coming off what you just said how incredible it was to be
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  out there in Cleveland at the RNC and to see people from all all backgrounds
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  there just supporting us supporting Liberty and then you go and look at
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  what's happening at the DNC where they are actually fighting trying to bang
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  us through the gate there let us in you rigged the system you know and all the
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  media was out there at the RNC just looking for whatever kind of little
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  protest they could to like jack it up and say even the Democrats own minions
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  are coming after because even they know that's the power structure.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Yeah I mean and it's just like now that you actually have these people out trying to
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  break this fence we have video of them climbing it.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Yeah no climbing it setting flags on fire like tons of flags pushing police
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  violently pushing the police back to jump on their cop cars you don't see that
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  the media was like all either they were afraid they were inside afraid of the
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  monster that they had been coddling and creating for the last couple years or
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  they just want to at the DNC Frankenstein is on the loose right well and the DNC is
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  really pushing this narrative that America's already great why was Trump
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  being so dystopic America's already great totally ignoring the fact that it's
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  like a war zone right outside and with even cooked numbers 1.8 growth folks
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  we've been in a depression for a long time it's just not equally distributed
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  we're gonna come back to you Leanne and make more the points you're talking about
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Madeleine Albright this this this what you call a parade of criminals yes it was the party of crooks they
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  they stood true to who they are I mean it was like a whole criminal lineup last night.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  David Knight I know you're chomping at the bit my friend you've been inside that nest for
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  this is Sunday this is like day three for you what are your observations.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  David Knight and Philadelphia the Democrat National Convention Alex last
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  yesterday we were there as they were doing the roll call vote because we wanted to see the
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  reaction of the Bernie supporters as opposed to being called out and one of the places
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  that they were focused on of course is California they knew there was a lot of opposition
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  there the DNC had strategized beforehand they would have a lot of Hillary supporters
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  right next to the loud and boisterous Bernie supporters which they did so you
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  saw essentially two high school teams cheering very loudly against each other as that was going through
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  and then you had the massive walkout of the really hardcore Bernie supporters as
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  that was going through and we tried to get down to those guys who missed most of them
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  we did talk to some of the people who were not as upset about it thought they could find
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  some common ground with Hillary and if you say that report that I put out with a couple
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  of delegates from New York it was absolutely in my mind totally delusional they
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  understand as I point out to them you know Bernie has been authentic on these issues
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  for decades just as Trump has been authentic on trade and other issues yet Hillary has
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  been on the other side of these issues that they say are vital to them banks as
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  well as the trade agreements and they said well we think that we're going to be able
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  to convince her and I said no she has tens of millions hundreds of millions of reasons
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  not to listen to you and I said well we have millions of reasons as well so what
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  they think they're going to do Alex is they think they're going to go out and have
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  demonstrations and protests and that's going to bend Hillary Clinton to their will
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  because that stopped her stealing the nomination she's going to go for broke bringing us into
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  the world government that's right that's right and you know I think it's interesting Alex
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  to see how the media is taking the mask off you know we had this morning Joe Biden
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  went on morning Joe with Joe Scarborough former GOP congressman they gave Joe Biden
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  a 30 minute a 30 second standing ovation can you imagine that on a television show
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  30 seconds and the journalists are giving them a standing ovation even state run
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  media in China acts like they're not state run and doesn't do that crap
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  exactly but I see that Alex as a positive sign you know we reported about this and
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  the bleachers on the first night as they were handing out all the different
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  posters for each individual speaker to press seating area and the press was
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  eagerly gobbling this up and waving their signs and sharing as the individual
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  speakers came up and you look at it and it's like okay fine the mask is off we
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  if we lose this pretense of being completely neutral and objective I think
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  that's in the long run a positive thing they can't maintain that I agree I agree
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  this is a victory populism is rising even if they steal this they're in deep
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  trouble so folks shouldn't get disheartened but listen stone doesn't want to go
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  too far and make people feel overconfident but the truth is internal polling
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  across the board and this isn't from stone this is from other folks is
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  showing big leads he's seven eight nine ten points it's getting wider
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  Florida is landsliding for him that some think California is even in play
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  because if 30 40% of the Bernie people you know go for Trump it's game over and
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  so we need to target the Bernie people like never before and say listen you've
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  been totally screwed don't be morons here they're calling you ridiculous
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  they're saying okay you're being ridiculous now thinking you're going to
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  turn this thing and they're confiscating their signs and beating them up and they
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  might not even be getting access now from what I was looking at Twitter that
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  they they took their credentials away so maybe they're not even going to get back
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  in there after the little protests done then we're going to break but I want to
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  ask you this when we come back in your gut what do you think they're going to do
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  I mean if Hillary stole I want to ask you this too Leanne if Hillary stole the
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  nomination in broad daylight naked I mean this is like robbing you know a bank
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  in slow motion from everybody at the at the World's Fair okay I mean she's in
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  front of God and everybody doing this what's the keeper from everything else
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  so when we come back we're going to talk about that we're also going to talk about
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  other shoes to drop what other emails the the the the Russians or whoever the
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  fairy godmother is that releasing these are going to do that Leanne McAdoo
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  David Knight in studio with me your phone calls are coming up at 800-25-99231

[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  believe I'm just here calmly talking about her openly stealing the nomination
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  they try it with Donald Trump and it failed that really tells you something
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  about where the real insurrection is is in the Republican Party as I've been
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  saying for years the Democrat Republicans have been caught on tape with the
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  Clinton's meeting Obama meeting with the Republicans saying we got to combine
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  forces with the National Chamber of Commerce that helps ship our jobs
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  overseas and the Republican establishment and the Democrats to block a populist
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  insurrection in the Republican Party the Tea Party and I see footage that we were
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  just airing during the break a lot of our breaks are just actually information
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  not just ads of our crew in Philadelphia and I'm talking a large percentage of
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  people are Hispanic and black and Asian and they're just having a great time
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  with all these evil white people talking about free market and freedom and
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  absolutely articulating real issues they've done everything they can to say
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  the Tea Party's races so that minorities don't feel like they have a place at the
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  table it's a total hoax and I see the hoax under Trump collapsing because the
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  truth is he's always been inclusive the guy 30 years ago got criticized by
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  conservatives he was inclusive of gays and was an advocate for people that
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  equal rights the truth is Trump's a great guy and that's why they hate his guts
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Leigh Ann McIntyre then back today at night
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  well yeah I actually got in a fight with one of my friends just trying to
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  explain how Trump was one of the first people that opened up his golf course
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  decades ago and said what the heck of course black people and minorities can
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  join my private club what what do you mean you know so that but nobody wants
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  to talk about that yeah the first golf courses he built he did that and it was
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  just unheard of I can't believe anything goes on no it still goes on there are
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  still clubs that do not allow minorities to join I mean it's that's a fact
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  gambling's illegal at Bushwood so well I just want to you know I don't know how
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  long we want to go get into this but we have more time in the next time I don't
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  want to finish up go ahead everyone just needs to take a look at what's going on
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  at the DNC and just acknowledge that like attracts like so here you have the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  DNC people were peacefully protesting there wasn't a lot of chaos mayhem like
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  you said there was a people just actually having conversations but then you go to
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  the DNC and you have people outside complete mayhem and on the inside they
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  have a complete criminal lineup trying to convince them we had communists come
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  after us and try to block us but we did it was and the only violence we did have
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  was the young teas the young jihadis coming after us as well well I mean
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  talk about the media kind of showing its true colors I mean they're set up in the
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  YouTube studios on the YouTube set sure answer my questions will come back into
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  the other issues don't get David's take on this going back to David what do they
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  do a false flag assassination attempt steal the election I mean what what are
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  they gonna pull it's clear that Hillary is collapsing with the narrative that
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  she's a criminal with the foundation and the emails and the new emails and even
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Democrats are saying oh my god she's super corrupt I mean I see her really
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  collapsing right at her launch point Alex to do our word is not racism but
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  Russian trying to lay that on Donald Trump about these leaks and of course the
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  obvious thing is to distract from the content and say well who did this you
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  know as we've seen that done all the time before with the NSA whistleblowers
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  with Ed Snowden they don't want to talk about was actually revealed about their
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  criminal actions instead they want to talk about who revealed it and make a
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  criminal out of them but Alex there's something that is far more dangerous and
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  subtle about that I think there is a subliminal message of propaganda pushing
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  back against Donald Trump because of course his message has been America first
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  either income having a Skype problem there I'm guessing you're gonna say the
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  truth is he's really a Russian agent the truth is he doesn't want to go you know
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  against foreign adversaries though the truth is the globalists are using us to
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  take over countries when it hurts our interest and other interest globalism is
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  bad go ahead well what what they have seen here is that that first night and
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  of course they started using the Russian narrative before that but you know they
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  continue to use her so what's the subliminal they're not well the subliminal is
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  that they don't want people to see Donald Trump as being America first as
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  pro-American as patriotic because the the Democrats that's their issue right
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  that's their weakness people understand that they're they don't want to put the
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  American flags on their stage and that's what we saw the other day so what they do
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  is they fight against Trump by saying oh look he's on Russia's side he's
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  they're helping him well she helped Russia right he released our most secret
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  documents to Russia in order to help herself because she had private secrets
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  that's right that's right thank god the Russians are releasing the carbon tax fraud
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  thank god they're exposing the fact that this woman's a criminal and stole our
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  election but that's shameful the Russians have to do our media's job I mean we don't
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  need the emails to know they stole it she stole it from a god in the world right
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  if they are doing that is he she's the one the loudest issue it's pretty much
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  as a Russians well whatever it is Alex you know Julian Assange is with Wiggy
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  Leakes said in his opinion Trump was unpredictable but he said Hillary
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Clinton is totally predictable and problematic he says she is against free
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  speech she wants to shut down everything in terms of free speech and she is a
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  war hawk she's a war hawk of course if you remember if you remember back at some of the
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  other leaks that Wiggy put out Manning Leakes showing the way the war was being
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  conducted other issues in terms of the invasion of Libya and Hillary Clinton's
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  State Department policy there he said he's been exposing this kind of stuff and
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  Wiggy Leakes has been exposing it for quite some time that's right they know she's
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  really right back with the finish of the night in Leigh Ann and your calls

[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Patrick in an undisclosed location five star review says brain force is a game

[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  bit of green tea too that just helps supercharge the neurons that's only an
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  activator you don't want to just activate neurons you want to give the brain
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  building blocks is the way it's all described by Dr. Group all I know is you
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  know even the nutraceutical Nazis even the supplement Nazi sites love it and
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  they go wow there's similar formulas for like 80 bucks and the industry says
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  Alex everybody else marks it up seven times you mark your stuff up 50 to 100
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  percent and I'm like I just I mean the average is five to seven times our
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  average is about a hundred percent and we use much better quality well
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  absolutely I mean you know that that's why this is such high quality and people
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  go yeah there's folks selling the basically the same thing we're selling
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  close to it for seventy five dollars and it's not even as good as our formula
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  right and it's like it's crazy I mean I wouldn't be having to fundraisers though
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  I guess if I did like put some huge price tag everybody thinks it's like God like
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  this must not be good at 1776 right well yeah and it's like we're making like
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  three dollars on it but you know the point is I want to sell 50,000 bottles

[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  thank my mother for praying for me my grandmother who's 91 years old I want
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  to thank everybody for putting up with me sometimes it's a train wreck
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  including my crew and I put up with them but we're all one human family
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  that has red blood fighting the technocrats that think we're animals
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  David I want to give you a few minutes to finish up and tell us what all she
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  thinks coming up and then I want to go back with some final comments from Leanne
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  and then go to some phone calls but I've got to say I'm not putting a pretty face
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  on this and I agree with you and then I want to get your take on this Leanne
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  the question what will they pull to try to derail this everybody should be
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  thinking right now get in the mind of your enemy I think it was Lord Wellington
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  that he was quoting earlier stone don't ever interrupt your enemy while
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  they're destroying themselves it was Sun Sue said you have to get in the mind
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  of your enemy you have to think like your enemy you have to be your enemy
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  and that's what I do Napoleon Bonaparte also said never interrupt your enemy
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  when he's making a mistake I think they both kind of said it back at each other
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  but it really goes back to Sun Sue if you read that little book he said
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  that the enemy's already screwing up in things kind of let him go for a while
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  you know and see how long that plays out sometimes they might collapse
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  without you even having to attack them right so those are just some of the rules
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  to that but David the worm has turned again they can't put Humpty Dumpty back up there
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  they said to steal this out of their arrogance they had to you know go in
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  there and do this and it's this it's this it's this tottering group
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  that looks like they're reanimated corpses you're in there personally
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  you have the useful idiot followers with you know the looks of dumb children
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  in their eyes I feel sorry for them but I see the party apparatchik
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  and I see them talking to each other it just radiates disingenuousness
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  just backstabbing dishonor it gives me the creeps
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  well Alex as we're talking to these different delegates that were for Bernie
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  and they want to see the TPP stop and understand what's going on with that
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  and as I point out to one guy said you know what you and I disagree on a lot of issues
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  but we're not going to be able to even have a voice in this in the future
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  if we turn over our governance our sovereignty to foreign multinational corporations
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  and a committee that's going to rule this and it's going to be able to rewrite the rules
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  you know Senator Sessions is the only one who read the TPP
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  he's been the advisor to Donald Trump since last August
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  he pointed out that the TPP and the rest of these trade like the TTIP
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  for the one with Europe these are living documents
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  they have provisions that allow these small committees to alter them
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  to include China to include other nations at will
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  they can alter the terms of this to manage our economy
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  but also to manage many other aspects of our government here
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  and again we're just calmly talking about Europe and the US being signed on to secret global treaties
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  and then we're the extremists for talking about it go ahead
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  well they understand that and yet they think that they can have some influence on Hillary Clinton
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  who has been with us all of her life and Wall Street is a static
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  about not only Hillary Clinton but her VP pick, Kane
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  and so I think what they're going to see Alex, what she will throw them as a bone
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  is she's going to talk a lot about gun control for the left
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  she's going to talk about some of these social issues
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  because those are some things that she can throw them as a bone
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  but the key fundamental issues that they're going to lose control of the country
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  if they don't understand this is going to be the trade issues
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  you know as they were going down this roll call yesterday
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  and as part of the state pride you know back in North Carolina
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  we've got these license tags that say first in flight
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  because we had the Wright brothers did their flight there at Kitty Hawk
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  so there's this Guinness book aspect of the states
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  that are giving people a flavor of their states
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  but most of what they focused on with the Democrats
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  was the first person of this color or this sex or whatever
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  to do this or that, to get elected to this position
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  they're absolutely totally out of touch with another real first
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  and that was the first time in our living memory
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  for hundreds of years since Islam was taken out of Europe for the first time
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  after they invaded it
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  for the first time we had a priest executed by Muslims in a church
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  that was a first and we've gone now two days without them talking about this issue
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  so I think it's going to be a real hard thing for them Alex
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  if they try to do some kind of a false flag
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  to try to get a control of this
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  because they are already not seen as the people who are part of the solution
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  they're seen as the people who are bringing in the terrorists
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  and massive numbers and bragging about it
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  we had John Kerry the last day of Ramadan
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  talking about how he brought in six times more people from Syria
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  and Hillary once accelerated by five times
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  and just to add here David
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  the point you make, listeners have to hear this, it's so central
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  this is so key
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  they're getting rid of achievement of having liberties
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  having freedoms, having private property
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  having free association, having free will
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  and now it's a collective, the first person of this or this person of that
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  or this statistic on that
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  because they're taking innovation, they're taking prosperity
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  they're taking real rights away
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  and giving us all these things the globalists don't care about
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  this is total and complete engineering
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  and then you look at the fruits of what the Democrats have delivered to their constituents
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  they're all on average, worse off
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  because the globalists want them dependent
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  this is a plan, it's not just that they're mismanaging
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  so I'm really concerned about false flags, assassination attempts, you name it
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  David Knight, 60 seconds and we're going to go back to Makadu
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  and you can continue with your great reporting
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Well Alex, I think that we look at what's happening again
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  we need to understand that what they're trying to do with this push with Russia
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  is not only to avoid the dark secrets that have been exposed
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  about their collusion and rigging of the electoral process
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  or collusion with the media
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  but they also want to subtly push this idea that Trump isn't for America first
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  we know that that's the central issue
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  and I believe that he's authentic on it
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  the guy that I talked to was absolutely surprised
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  and I told him that Donald Trump had been opposing NAFTA for 30-some-odd
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  and the Iraq War
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  and the Iraq War, David Knight reporting
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  from the DNC there in Philadelphia, thank you so much sir
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  Thank you
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  Makadu, I want to get your final comments
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  and let you go get ready because I know you're doing a lot of research and helping the show
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  I just appreciate your amazing work you did there at the RNC
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  but just to add to what he's getting at here
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  I even got blindsided by this Islamic title wave
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  I mean I don't support what radical Islam does
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  I don't support what dominant Islam does, Orthodox Islam
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  I mean it's in a major radicalization phase that's taking over right now
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  I thought the elites would use the attacks to take our freedoms
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  no, they are really planning to bring in millions and millions more
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  and make us submit to them
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  because that's just another form of authoritarianism
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  and then like it's some form of hospitality
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  we send all our kids to Islamic training
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  Germany's making it law now
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  and put martial law on the streets
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  Germany's now announced that troops to stop Germans protesting
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  I mean this is unprecedented
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  since the fall of Hitler there's been a German law
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  that you can't have troops on the street policing the people
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  duh, they're doing it and saying it's for the Germans
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  this is sick, high treason, why would the elite of the west
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  want to butcher this open, laissez-faire, libertine society
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  that is true liberalism
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  I mean as a true liberal I find it horrifying
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  I mean it's someone that spoils my daughters
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  it has spoiled the limit of my life
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  as someone that is all about true freedom
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  to be called a fascist, a racist
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  and then to watch our enemies
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  cavort and align with the worst scum of the planet
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  right, well I mean that's what we're seeing there
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  that they're the party of gaslighting
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  okay, they have everyone completely convinced
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  that they're the good guys
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  while they have a whole entire criminal lineup
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  rolling out telling you why you need to vote for Hillary
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  the most criminal candidate that's ever run
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  it's like when you catch your boyfriend cheating
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  and then he turns it around and blames you
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  for violating his privacy because you went into his phone
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  like how dare you, oh you know it's like
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  no, no, you cheated on me, right
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  so they totally twist this game around
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  get everyone's minds all twisted
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  and they're the party of opposites
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  I mean I just couldn't-
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  of mind control
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  total mind control, total opposites
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  and you know you say well how could they do this
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  how could they destroy liberty
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  it's just like in the movie The Hunger Games
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  where they have the capital of Pan Am
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  where all the elite, they're in there
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  gorging themselves loving everything
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  and meanwhile out in the districts
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  it's all socialist, communist people are suffering
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  but they don't care because they're living the high life
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  and that was exactly what it looked like
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  and then they act like they're the communist
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  up on the top with red carpets
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  right
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  and then tell those of us producing
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  we stole something
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  we're like what, I'm employing 50 something people
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  paying them well
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  what the hell are you doing Jack Ash?
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  right and they roll out like
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  they have their mom from Ferguson
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  the moms of the movement
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  they have them speaking in the lineup last night
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  but meanwhile all of the protesters
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  and the people that they've activated
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  out of Ferguson
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  are outside trying to bang the gates down
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  saying let us in you scumbags
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  so it's like hey wait
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  well all the people that you say you represent
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  are right outside
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  why don't you go talk to them
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  and see how they feel
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  about you rigging the election
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  and by the way the republicans as you said
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  had the gates to get in
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  30 yards from the entrance
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  and they were telling me almost two miles away
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  he says it's with all the equipment exhausting
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  he's almost
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  four miles because the iPhone can tell you
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  how far you've gone
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  it's almost four miles he was saying to me
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  wow
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  yeah and that's the thing is we
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  get to go back and forth four miles
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  right and they shut down the shuttles
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  that take people there
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  because they were afraid that they were going to have
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  protesters getting in
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  and I guess they do
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  because we never got to the really dramatic footage
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  of people climbing over
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  oh climbing over
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  attacking the cop cars
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  I know Joe Biggs was right there
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  and sick of it as usual
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  he pinned it to your profile last night
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  where they're just all over the cop cars
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  the cops are
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  I mean it's at this point it's like
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  yeah go to Joe Biggs's twitter folks
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  who are you even protecting at this point
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  it's almost like you guys need to get back out
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  and save yourselves because these protesters
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  listen if I was the cops I'm going to be honest with you
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  if I was the police
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  says I mean the average cop I know
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  hard work and people put their lives on the line
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  sometimes you run into a crazy arrogant
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  down a power trip
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  and the other cops hate them
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  okay and it's those bad cops that give them a bad name
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  the police are given submissions that are unconstitutional
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  or wrong we're trying to reform that
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  but foreign global is trying to cause a civil war
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  we're not having any part of that
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  but I'll be honest with you
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  if you're not getting the backing
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  and there's black lives matter
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  and the democratic parties inside
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  and black lives matter
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  and the communists are trying to knock the fence down
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  I was the cops I just walk off
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  I mean quite frankly because there's the people
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  launching this horde against you
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  they're in there stealing stuff
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  diverting them off onto you
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  and I was just saying go have at it man
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  right and they have the people who are
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  the movement right on stage
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  they didn't have any family members
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  of the fallen police officers
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  speaking out last night
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  it wasn't about that at all
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  it was about catering to a certain group
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  imagine if they had both groups together
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  right see if I was a democrat
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  I would have the folks that had died
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  wrongly or questionably
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  and the police that had died wrongly and questionably
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  and I'd have them come together that'd be genius
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  how can we come together but that's not what they're about
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  and then they've got Eric Holder
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  Madeline Albright and then of course
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  Bill Clinton who was the rotten cherry
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  drop of the Sunday of speakers there
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  but it's just the whole
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  did he not look like something out of a zombie movie
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  I just I got to give David Knight
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  a round of applause for even just
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  sitting through that entire I had to shut it off
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  people as well I didn't know I cannot be around
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  democrats it's just like
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  I can't have much of a bunch of pasty white
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  people with your racist
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  folks jumping in my face spitting
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  and me telling me I'm racist right well and that's the thing
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  with the black lives matter protest when they're like all the
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  white people get in the back it's like
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  people there were white
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  they're there to support
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  the movement and then you're spitting on them
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  they don't want you there they think you're
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  scum filth they can't wait to rule
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  over you and dominate you it's not about
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  the same mindset as the Kugler clan people are people
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  and you can have a bunch of dumb black
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  racists you can have a bunch of dumb white racist and it's just
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  the more ignorant people are the more racist they are
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  I mean it's a fact and look
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  everything you're hearing is the opposite of Martin Luther King
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  I'm going to skip this break too
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  because I want to get to Jason and Sean
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  and Patrick and Chris and John last break I'm skipping

[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  with Queen Hillary info wars.com
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  forward slash giant now I got to ask this
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  question I'm going to Jason and John and
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  Christian Sean and Patrick everybody else
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  Leanne what do you think they're going to pull
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  she's sliding in polls internally
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  the numbers are in some swing
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  states she's up to 10
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  points
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  10 points ahead against Hillary things are
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  degenerating quickly they admit he's 5
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  and 10 points ahead already what are
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  they going to pull in your gut
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  I hate to even be
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  negative about this I don't I like to try to think
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  positively about what I want to create in the world
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  but I've been saying this for months I truly
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  think if they lose the game here they're going
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  to do some sort of a false flag and they're already
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  setting up a boogeyman Russia
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  and the media doesn't even question if there's
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  no proof behind it they're just like oh yeah
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  they definitely it was them they hacked into it
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  they're the boogeyman we've always been against them
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  like master mastermind
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  who's just able to control things all
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  over the globe giving him all this credit
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  all this power and no one's even questioning
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  if that you know obviously
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  I've talked to Margaret she said they do actually have some
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  really good hackers so well the point is is that
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Russia has the will when our
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  own government run by criminals is trying to
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  overthrow their elections and trying to start a war
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  Russia's never got involved in modern
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  times in our politics but Russia knows
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  we're run by globalists have taken us over
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  right it's in their interest to let us know
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  hey carbon taxes are to rip you off right and
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  thank god Russia did that we'd have them right now
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  right and Putin's coming out speaking
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  in public right there on camera
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  saying Americans your media
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  is lying to you they're telling you everything
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  is safe out here and world war

[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  thing the dean absolutely Russia has three bases
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  Russia is trying to stop collapsing
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  Russia is trying to just survive they're not
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  a threat communist China is
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  a threat because the globalist are allied with it
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  China and the globalists are the threat
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  China and the globalists are the threats
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  China and the globalists are the threats
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  China and the globalists let me explain something
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  folks we have
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  foreign multinational banks that got
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  76% of the banker bailouts
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  okay we are
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  wide open we are a joke these foreign
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  banks will sell the same house
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  100 times they will sell the loan
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  100 times in
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  many cases the average is like 25 times
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  it's total fraud
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  the globalists are an alien criminal
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  world government system and by
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  alien I mean outside of America
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  at war with nation states
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  and Putin has come out when the hacks
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  came out six years ago that the Russians did do
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  they hacked the UN in East Anglia
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  with over a thousand universities coordinating
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  fraudulent thermometer
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  readings okay
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  jacking numbers up
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  because the earth started cooling
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  stopped it stopped heating
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  20 years ago started cooling a decade ago
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  it's a fact
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  total proof of the organized crime
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  Putin said
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  it's a plan to bankrupt nation states
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  all Russia's got
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  is its minerals and its oil
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  and other systems it's selling
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  to Europe
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  that gives Europe value it keeps energy prices
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  lower the globalists don't want that competition
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Russia doesn't dare sell its aerospace
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  or technologies because it will all be used against them
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  okay and so the issue
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  is this is some love fest with Russia I've never been there
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  but I know the history of it the point is
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  is that it was already taken over by the globalist
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  and put under seven eighty something years
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  of hell and Russia still
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  has mixed feelings about it all there's different groups there
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  but Russia now has dialed into
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  populism dialed into the Renaissance
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  dialed into Alexander Schultz and
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  and Alex Jones I'm not bragging I'm not going to tell you
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  behind the scenes stuff but just believe me Russia's listening
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  and so is the UKIP is listening
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  and so is Donald Trump okay and I'm not going to sit there
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  and brag and tell you behind the scenes stuff but
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  little birds presidential
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  nominees told me that no
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  stop right yeah I said this off-record he says no it's not
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  but I'm not going to beat this up this stuff if I said
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  it would just be a big news story I mean big
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  okay so I'm just going to stop right there but just
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  understand the spirit of seventeen
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  seventy six that we represent is
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  worldwide that doesn't mean America
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  is going to run Russia or China
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  or South Africa or Germany
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  it means the idea of the Renaissance
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  and the open free society we
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  have the truth we have the weapon
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  we have the light in the dark we have
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  what empowers which is you
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  you can look at the
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  evil of the DNC leadership those are
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  evil people who all hate each other
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  they're turned over to evil
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  and I saw a lot of goodness in people's eyes
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  a lot of love a lot of passion
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  a lot of Americana in the people
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  of every race color and creed I saw at the R&C
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  I mean Leigh Ann what was the spirit like there
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  then I'm going to your calls I promise it was it was
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  absolutely wonderful I loved meeting
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  so many different people and they were so proud
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  to come up and be like I'm a black man I'm voting
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  for Trump heck yes I'll speak on camera
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  you know or Hispanics coming up to us
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  and saying we want to let people know that there are
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  a lot of us out there we're not ashamed to do
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  this we're not I get it all and it's not just because
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  they were there it's not just because they went to that it's all over
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  Austin right no I mean
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  it's it's everywhere and I think that that's kind of a
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  key point is the Democrats really are
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  pushing for collectivism and
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  putting us in these groups and they want everyone
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  to say oh you belong to this group and that
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  group and your groups rather than
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  acknowledge which is racism individualism
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  they don't want us to be individuals
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  because groups are easier to control
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  they want to make us all uncomfortable so we
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  don't associate with each other just forget
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  all the uncomfortable crap we got red blood
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  we want freedom it's over thank you Leigh Ann

[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  to try to take it back
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  exactly and I'm outside

[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  I think Trump should touch on Monsanto
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  definitely Hillary's
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  tied with Monsanto they give her money
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  you know it's ridiculous

[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  what's wrong with some people in my generation
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  and it just
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  they're in a trance they think
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  if they go with the system that's what's
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  cool and successful because it's the system
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  they don't know you don't want to be in the
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  system it's designed to limit you
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  and control you and ultimately kill you
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  God bless you
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  from Florida Jason thank you so much
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  yeah I mean there's no choice here
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  Trump is somewhat unknown
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  you know but I got to tell you
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  Hillary we know what we're getting you got to go against it
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  alright John in Texas Chris Sean
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Patrick and others your phone calls are 70
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  seconds away hour number three is about
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  to begin
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  operation sleeping giant
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  operation sleeping giant
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  giant giant giant giant
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  giant giant giant giant
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  if you ever wanted a great deal
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  on a powerful solar generator
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  but we're waiting for an outrageously low price
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  you are not going to want to miss
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  this important message here's why
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  my friends we already see major power grid
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  problems and it's getting worse
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  so please listen solar generators really do
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  provide life-saving electrical
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  power and unlike gas generators
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  solar generators run silently
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  from the sun whether it's dangerous summer
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  storms blackouts intensifying
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  civil unrest you're not going to
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  and here's the best news if you want to get one
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  this week solutions from science has
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  a big sale on their fast charge
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  solar generators and they're giving
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  away a couple thousand dollars worth
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  of off-the-grid gear in addition
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  to the low price for info wars listeners
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  so it's a good time to check it out
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  go to grid wars dot com that's grid
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  wars dot com it's a great opportunity
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  to generate maximum electricity
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  with minimum money go to grid wars
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000]  dot com that's grid wars dot com
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  you're listening to the
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000]  alex jones show

[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  when i was about twelve
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  i was about eighteen

[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  they say that youth is wasted on the young
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  isn't it

[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  in texas go ahead john thanks for holding
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  hi alex
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  welcome
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  if history serves me right
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  during the first american revolution
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  didn't our founding fathers
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  send john paul jones to russia
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  to get his help in our fight for freedom
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  uh we did get some help in fact i
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  think he'd actually been in the russian navy
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  of memory serves
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  he'd serve the czars of memory serves that's right
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  and the czars actually helped lincoln
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  too when the british and again
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  i'm from the south i had family that were high
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  up in it so i don't want to get into all that
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  uh i'm talking generals but the
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  point is they were manipulated by british intelligence
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  to get into that war the north was doing something that was wrong
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  but we were idiots to have that war
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  uh sam houston founder of
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  texas was thrown out of office as governor
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  even after the texas was in the union
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  and he'd been the president for that
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  uh because he wasn't for it
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  so yeah the russians have been
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  been helping america since the beginning of the country
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  don't you think this may be
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  history repeating itself with labrin
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  putin coming in helping us with our
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  second trump revolution well that's because russia
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  always has the has the proto-global
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  is trying to overthrow it
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  and they're always dealing with
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  people trying to take over russia for 800 years
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  so yeah russia sees what's happened to us that they're not
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  stupid they know we
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  look look but before russia was
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  conquered for 80 something years by a
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  globalist infection called communism
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  the globalist put the commies
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  in it's a fact
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  so they've partially gotten
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  that disease out and then they see us
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  totally infected with it so yeah it's in their own
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  interest try to stop it
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  so uh
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  i hope that uh i'm
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  hoping that uh after
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  watching that freak show in philadelphia i'm hoping
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  that the donald can pull it out
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  then uh and uh save us
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  because would it be great to see the united states
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  and russia and everybody
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  else allied against collectivism and
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  communism and we could reform china
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  and humanity could really go to the next level
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  imagine notice the globalist always
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  want to fight with russia that's their plan
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  imagine if those two european
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  uh western powers allied
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  what would happen to the world with that technology
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  and there are good people on both sides
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  want that to happen but it's always being sabotaged
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  um
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  it's uh
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  it'd be it'd be heaven on earth we would
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  have true heaven on earth if we'd have
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  damn close to it i'm telling you the
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  humanity has unlimited potential
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  but there are globalists that are always stirring up crises
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  to gain control and top professors
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  have brought this out it's not just me
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  crisis is their brand
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  they don't produce anything but
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  discord and mindlessness
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  and the time for
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  countries have conquest over each other is over
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  it's now time to have innovation
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  and healthy competition
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  instead of obsessing on sports we should be obsessing
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  on technology undersea development
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  um mathematics
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  interspace travel
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  huge work projects
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  the rock stars in the school should be
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  you know the kid that wins the science fair i'm sorry
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  not the quarterback because what's the
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  quarterback acting cool gonna do once he gets
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  out of college he's gonna go work at a corporation
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  be a yes man we want innovators
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  we want poets and scientists and artists
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  okay and fighters
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  and trailblazers and innovators i'll tell you the heroes
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  will be people that launch on a first colony
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  space mission that's going to take you know
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  80 years to get to the next uh planet
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  i mean that imagine
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  imagine watching that reality tv show
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  and of course by then our technology
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  will advance so much that we'll have jump ships
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  that meet that ship before it even gets there
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  but the point is we're going to do it
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  and it's not going to be some silicon takeover
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  with the globalist playing god humanity
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  is rising the threat
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  of the technotronic tyranny
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  will be defeated
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  thank you john common england you're up next
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  and then our guests
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  a
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  new study suggests
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  that tattoo ink may be toxic
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  reports fox news
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  getting inked may lead to long-term
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  skin problems and an increased
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  risk of cancer according to a new report
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  by the european chemicals agency
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  researchers found red ink
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  was the most dangerous but they warned
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  blue green and black ink is also
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  risky the most severe
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  concerns are allergies caused by
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  substances in the ink and possible
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductive
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  toxic effects the report stated
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  it's also being reported that
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  governments in the e you do not
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  regulate tattoo ink as they do
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  drugs and food at many shops
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  operate without government regulations
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  in the united states the food
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  and drug administration regulates
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  chemicals and products including tattoo ink
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  cosmetics and color additives
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  but due to other public health
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  priorities the fda has not
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  traditionally regulated tattoo
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  inks and pigments you can find
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  more reports on info wars

[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  I want to go to a few of your calls
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  before we go to Bracken we're getting him on the line right now
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  via video Skype

[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  and comments but
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  undoubtedly
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  the police and military now get it
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  it's gone from being something
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  that we thought was happening to
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  we're sure of it now 100%
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  the Democratic Party working with multinational corporations
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  is
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  beta testing
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  a real civil war in America
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  activating
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  black nationalist, Hispanic nationalist, Islamist
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  and when they attack
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  then civil emergencies are cleared
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  and then those that are critical of the takeover
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  are the people that get arrested
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  Germany has now repealed its law
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  post World War II
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  from 1945
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  in the Bundestag
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  both upper and lower houses
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  to allow military
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  on the streets for civil emergency and martial law
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  they're under civil emergency
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  so is France and they are arresting anyone
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  even trying to demonstrate about open borders
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  this is the total completion
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  of the tyranny it's like
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  your soldiers
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  opening the drawbridge to the Huns or the Mongols
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  if you go back in history
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  this is unprecedented treachery
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  by the left
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  it's
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  it's against their own interest
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  but they have such a hatred
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  and such a desire to pull down
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  the Renaissance
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  their Jacobins
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  if you studied the French Revolution it was different than ours
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  they were basically devil worshipers
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  and I've had top historians on you name it
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  they all concur communism came out of the Jacobins
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  they wanted to have a nine day
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  work week change everything
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  break up all the families
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  have like local slave masters
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  that owned everyone
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  but they were calling it liberal
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  to overthrow the civilization to bring in a hell
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  and George Arwell wrote about that in 1984
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  where O'Brien's torturing
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  Winston who's his archetype from the BBC
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  or the Ministry of Truth
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  and he says we want a world more ugly
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  where you live less, where you're ugly
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  where you're starving, where we stomp on your face forever
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  we're the priests of power
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  we want to just hurt innocents and destroy everything
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  and then burn your body and shoot it into the atmosphere
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  and we're not going to stop till we kill everyone
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  and we'll finally just annihilate humanity
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  and you're like wow Arwell
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  this is really whacked out
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  he was a British secret police officer
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  in India
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  then he ran away and was like a communist
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  and did all this stuff then he went and fought
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  in the Spanish Civil War
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  highly decorated then he went and ran propaganda
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  in World War II in OSS
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  at the BBC
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  he ran off, wrote that book
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  thought people were trying to kill him
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  and died six months after it was published
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  and I've read his white papers
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  he totally woke up to realize
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  that communism was the ultimate evil
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  and run by the elite
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  so we're going to go to a few of your calls
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  and go to Mr. Bracken
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  I'm going to go to your calls bam bam bam

[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  we're now two hours plus

[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  terrible food manufacturer in the country
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  they've only been around eight years
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  because they have the best prices, highest quality
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  they consolidated a bunch of top Mormon companies
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  that are the best at it
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  and they do to get around their contracts
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  with other distributors that's kind of business guy
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  I am I figure out ways to go even lower
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  because I want to dominate the market
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  I want to fund ourselves and give you a great deal
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  win-win
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  they are back-ordered a couple weeks
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  okay now most places
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  is months and months but they usually aren't
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000]  that's how fresh it is
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  but I twisted their arm they said look
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  only 24 hours Alex and that's it
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  and we will accelerate it just for you
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  because you're our number one seller worldwide
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  20 to 40% off
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  depending on which food package it is
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  then forward select swareable food
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  then forward store.com
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  24 hours only
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  they only said 24 hours because I had to wait two hours
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  to launch it because it has to end tomorrow
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  has to end tomorrow at this time
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  okay because I mean they can get in a lot of
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  contractual issues with that
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  but if you want to take advantage of that and get ready
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  then forward store.com okay that's how we fund this operation
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  let's go to Tom in England
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  Tom thank you for holding it on the year worldwide
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  hi Alex and thanks for going to me
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  expeditiously
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  I do appreciate it
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  and good luck with your marathon broadcast
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  thank you
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  I wanted to make a point about
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  the false flag attacks
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  that have
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  happened to San Bernardino, Orlando
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  Paris
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  now I'm going to say something controversial
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  and say that these were not
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  Islamic terror attacks
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  they were establishment terror attacks
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  with an Islamic label on it
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  and let me just explain why
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  that's pretty clear
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  I find it fantastically unlikely
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  that they're going to bring people in
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  who are likely to
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  do attacks and let them get on with it
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  because that takes away
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  the fine control
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  over when it happens
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  how many people are killed
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  how intense it is
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  what it distracts
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  there are lots of them
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  sure but the globalists aren't all powerful
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  the false flag is that they're letting in
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  people from radical regions
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  who they know are terrorists in many cases
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  who have already committed crimes
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  to use that to bring in a civil emergency
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  I believe it's a false flag but way up river
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  where it's starting from
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  but I mean you can't deny that if you bring in
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  5 million people
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  from radical Wahhabist areas
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  that you're going to get some terror attacks
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  well
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  what I'm saying is
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  that that isn't the way that the establishment does things
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  and it never has been
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  they use professional operators
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  to commit the attack
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  and then they put up patsies
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  and then the patsies die
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  and that's what's happened in all these attacks
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  we've had patsies
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  you've had jolts galison on
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  let me ask you this question
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  are the Wahhabist murdering Christians
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  in mass in Syria?
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  they certainly have done
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  a shit your call
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  look
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  when norad stands down
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  and the head of the embassy tries to block
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  15 of the hijackers coming in
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  they're told to stand down
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  and the FBI comes out and says we were ordered to stand down
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  and you got all these weird drills going on
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  something went on, it's not the whole government
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  but something went on
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  and the deal with Saudi Arabia was take the blame
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  partially, we'll attack Iraq and take them out
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  but it doesn't mean there isn't radical Islam
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  it's what I'm getting at
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  I don't want to get into all this with them
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  we'll get a stake on it as well
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  let's go ahead and talk to chris and georgia
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  go ahead
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  just a quick question
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  do you think Putin is a traitor
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  to the new world order
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  is pants against it
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  and it's said that trump has black employees
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  moved out of sight
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  when he comes to one of these places
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  for some reason your phone to me is just distorted
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  you said is trump
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  is trump a traitor to the new world order
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  absolutely
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  Russia still has globalist tentacles in it
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  and I'm not saying Russia is perfect in and of itself
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  but Putin is fighting the globalists
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  to fight in the new world order
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  they've got programs to have kids
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  programs for the family
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  they openly talk about it on air
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  now what was your second question
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  well my last two questions were
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  is pants against the new world order
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  and is said that trump has black employees
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  yeah I don't think pants is perfect
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  he's a lot better than cane
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  and there's a technician
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  it's all on trump to make sure that he continues
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  his policies once he gets in
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  what was the third
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  it said that trump has black employees
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  moved out of sight when he comes to one of these places
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  it said that he was sued by the justice department
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  for refusing housing to black
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  I don't black and support trump
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  listen I hear you
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  the justice department sues everybody who's got
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  more than 20-30 employees
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  the EEOC runs around
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  and all these groups
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  and people who make professional money
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  out of claiming they got kicked out of an apartment
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  or something because they were
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  a minority
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  that's a whole business of ambulance chasing
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  the guy owns
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  hundreds of buildings
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  that is just crazy
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  and that's the kind of fables they put out
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  like I had a guy call in and go
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  Putin's banning evangelicals in Russia
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  he's letting every christian group in do whatever they want
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  I said where's your proof
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  oh I don't have any I just heard that
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  it's bull
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  Trump is known as being
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  more inclusive than anybody
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  that's always been his trademark
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  both in management and who he hires and who he
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  employs he wants the job done
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  so again
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  this is the kind of stuff they put these rumors out
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  that have no facts
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  or no information behind them
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  now I'm going to go to Sean
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  and I'm going to go to Patrick
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  and I'm going to go to Ben and Ethan and Christian
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  but first we've got our guest coming on after the break
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  Matt Bracken
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  to get into the fact that as he said
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  a few months ago he said it's going up
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  exponentially
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  where's logarithmically the term
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  where you get an attack every month now it's an attack every week
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  it's an attack every day now it's an attack every six hours
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  what is the whole point of this
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  I've got stacks of these attacks
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  young Welsh girls held in boxes
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  threatening to murder people at nudist
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  beaches or pools
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  murders, bombings, killings, shootings
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  beheadings
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  the media changes the name from Ali to David
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  or won't say it's Islamic
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  when they pledge allegiance to Al Qaeda or ISIS
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  and scream a la la la bar
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  you know snack bar
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  all of this stuff is going on
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  what's the larger plan
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  all this and more straight ahead
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  it's operation awaken the sleeping giant

[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  author enemiesfarnanddomestic.com
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  former navy seal
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  patriot very humble guy but a lot of smart folks
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  we can't tell you the stuff we know
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  just get Matt Bracken on that's very accurate
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  and I mean here we are you were on months ago saying
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  watch it become exponential
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  it is becoming exponential
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  we'll go over three or four attacks a day now
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  with them saying they don't know why the guy cut
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  the priest's head off even though he pledged allegiance to ISIS
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  changing the name from Ali to David
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  on one of the bombers
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  saying a muslim was blown up
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000]  by a bomb and the muslim blows himself up
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  I mean this is beyond
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  1984 level disinformation
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  what is the establishment doing
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  what phase is this
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  Matt Bracken
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  well I would call this maybe the
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  great treason
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  we're seeing something that I've never
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  could have imagined before
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  in Europe and in America
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  I sometimes I think of this
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  1930s example
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  imagine if FDR had
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  ordered J. Edgar Hoover to scrub
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  all mentions of Nazis
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  Gestapo, Himmler, Hitler
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  and drop all investigations
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  involving Germans
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  and any time that there was a German
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  involved in espionage
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  it had to go through a special
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  German American bund liaison
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  that would be provided to the FBI
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  and then imagine the FBI agreeing
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  to all these terms
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  purging, scrubbing, etc well that's actually
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  happened so
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  at the Department of Homeland Security
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  Customs Border Patrol FBI
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  they're in the tank
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  over in Europe we can see
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  the terrible math for the police
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  in Munich one
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  shooter with a Glock 17 although
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  there were reports of long guns
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  a lot of times these are like in Dallas
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  like in
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  Baton Rouge people are
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  making concurrent reports from different
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  directions they get picked up as multiple
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  shooters so we really don't know
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  but assuming it was that
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  one guy with a Glock 17
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  and 300 rounds of ammo
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  allegedly he bought that on the internet
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  I doubt it in Europe please
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  somebody handed him a Glock 17
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  and 300 rounds
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  that's the key is the somebody
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  that handed it to him but it took
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  all 3,000 police and military
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  that they had they were bringing people in from
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  other German states
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  3,000 to react to one pistol
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  shooter who was dead
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  they found out was dead they just
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  didn't find his body for a few hours while this panic
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  went on subway system closed down
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  people leaving the city
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  like it was under attack from aliens
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  now imagine when a Mumbai
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  with multiple shooters
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  or a Paris Bataclan with
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  multiple teams of shooters roaming around
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  shooting up a place then hiding
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  their guns fleeing with the refugees
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  and then rinse repeat
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  we saw in
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  Dallas and Baton Rouge the police can't even
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  protect themselves they have to call
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  in more police long guns
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  because the initially responding police
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  become overwhelmed
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  what happens in this country when we have multiple
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  shooters like the Washington snipers
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  of 10, 15 years ago
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  imagine when that's happening
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  every day and the guys aren't suicidal
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  they just get in their car and drive somewhere else
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  so we're going to have a big
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  problem and local law enforcement
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  is going to be
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  in the crosshairs
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  they're the initial responders but
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  I'm telling you that there's a huge
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  division and split right now between the feds
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  and local
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  as we've seen under Obama the feds are trying
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  to take over all the local
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  law enforcement by having these DOJ
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  bogus investigations
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  now the UN strong cities initiative
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  is going to run them have you seen the footage out of Germany
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  where the Islamists
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  beats up the police for no reason
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  and they can't even take the guy down
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  I mean that shows the type of social workers
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  they're hiring over there because one of the German police
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  in an airport and the guy had a satchel
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  the guys got a satchel swinging around
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  which could have been, you know, four pounds
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  of ATATP or SEMTAC
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  and you know the Germans will cover it up
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  because that's their work
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  and right next to this guy you'll see in the background
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  running interference are these women in burkas
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  now this is a guy that you need to shoot
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  immediately that's a deadly force
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  authorized based on that guy having
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  a bag which could have detonated
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  absolutely a guy starts attacking you in an airport
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  there for no reason blast him
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  and even if he's got nothing in there
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  but a Quran
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  what he's doing is he's
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  and we've seen this over and over again the flying
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  imams after 9-11 probing
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  probing and today
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  they don't have to make a report back to headquarters
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  the report is the YouTube video
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  which gets shared all around the world
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  like you know the one guy can kill
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  one guy can tie up 3,000 police
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  officers you think that other people aren't learning
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  that lesson so yeah we're just in the beginning stages
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  of the terror right now they're just
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  probing and getting intelligence
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  right and using social media
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  to share it so it's dispersed
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  there's no like central nest
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  like if we only found the headquarters in Raqqa
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  and bombed it that wouldn't make any difference
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  it's like trying to kill a jellyfish
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  swarm by shooting 10
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  and our own supposed government is bringing
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  them in we'll talk about why straight ahead
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  with Matt Bracken I'm Alex Jones
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000]  A Texas judge on Tuesday
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  dismissed the last remaining charge
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:07.000]  against two California anti-abortion activists
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000]  who made undercover videos of themselves
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.000]  trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000]  reports CBS News a district judge

[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  upon the request of the Harris County prosecutor's office
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000]  defense attorneys said their clients
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000]  should have never been indicted
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000]  if they had been convicted of the felony charge
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  each could have been sentenced to up to

[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000]  alleged that the defendants use fake

[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  while dealing with Planned Parenthood
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  the defendants who founded a group called
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000]  Center for Medical Progress

[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  but the group was cleared of misusing

[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000]  Because people are actually waking up

[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  water and beverages in my system but
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  right now we're dealing with massive
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000]  parasites which is anything that's harmful

[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  this but it takes money to win a war we
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  don't have George Soros is $25 billion
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  we don't get taxpayer money like MSNBC
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  got 3 billion or more actually a part
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  of that 5 billion went down to them to
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  NBC we don't get 450 million a year like
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  NPR and then beg for money every week
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  once a year we have a super mega sale

[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.000]  grow in the face of this in fact that's
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  why I've gotten the position I'm not
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  even really taking profit at this point
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  in the year because sure I need to have
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  some money put back I need to be able to
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  be secure I need to be able to handle
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  any unforeseen things like lawsuits
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  wherever they don't really happen but
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  knock on wood literally there's any
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  wood around here but you couldn't put

[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  attacks the last day and I mean a new
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  level yeah I think he called it the
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  total treason or the absolute treason
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  where they changed the names from Ali
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  and the Islamic name to David Jones I
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  mean literally David where they say
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  they're not Islamic as they stream all
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  Akbar and blow people up or they say
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  they're the victim of a bombing or they
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  cut a priest head off and they and they
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  said at first oh a crazy man cut someone's
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  throat so this is all happening he and he
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  just talked about probing so he's been
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  right so far Matt Bracken what do you
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  expect to happen next well there's going
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  to be a continuing escalation of these
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  because it's like a jellyfish swarm
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  they're sending out the pheromones like a
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  termite nest it's not command you top
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  down command structure it's more like
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  pheromones or jellyfish so people see
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  these things and say well I can be a I
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  can be a Nike jihadist they call them
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  Nike jihadist because you just get into
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  your head just do it you you can grab a
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  knife and just run a muck just do it you
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  get your 72 virgins now an important
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  fact is I want to tell these dumb asses
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.500]  something you're not going to get 72
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:32.000]  virgins plus whatever that should know who
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  wants virgins anyway sorry go ahead they
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  believe it but if they believe it and
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  they've grown up in some you know
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  pestilential third-world hellhole and
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  they've see fantasy pornos on you know a
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  tablet somewhere and they're told this is
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  what you're going to have the moment you
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  blow yourself up forever and you're just
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  some dumb ass inbred 1400 years of
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  first-cousin co-sanguine in co-sanguinity
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  inbreeding yeah you're going to have a
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  lot of these Nike Nike terrorists
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  whether it's with a knife and axe mixing
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  up some TATP at Central Park bomb that
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  blew off a kid from from a kid a tourist
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  foot they said a few weeks later it was
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  definitely TATP the way I read that is
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  that was a chemist going online and
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  practicing so you leave it it's very
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  unstable concussion in the right when it's
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  at the right dryness stepping on it would
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  detonate it so you put it on a trail
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  where somebody's going to hop off the
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  stone onto the trail and sure enough it
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  works so I would assume that that chemist
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  is now in mass production and also
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  teaching other chemists the in the
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  Islamic State they held the University
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  of Mosul Iraq for a long time in their
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  Manhattan project there while they had
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  research laboratories your petrochemical
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  industry level research laboratories
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  teaching chemists to make TATP wholesale
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  and to teach other chemists and teaching
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  folks how to nerve gas dogs and anything
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  but what we're going to see next is
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  we're going to see the media continuing
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  to run interference and we're going to see
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  our our trees and his fools at the top
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  like J. Johnson of DHS I have to say at
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  this point in 2016 with people screaming
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  a la walk bar every day and wiping
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  people out wiping out infidels anybody
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  in a position of authority or in the
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  media who is promoting the the mindset
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  that there's nothing to see here is
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  either a covert convert whereas the
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  Muslims say a revert because they believe
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  everybody is really an Islamist
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  underneath you know just trying to get
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  out so people like J. Johnson they're
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  either a convert and they're just lying
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  using taquille or they're already
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  making their Demi deal a Demi is that
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  you know the status of the second class
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  citizen by the way I'd read about this
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  years ago I'm confirming this really goes
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  on but I did more research once you brought
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  it up and everything clicked that's why
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  Merkel and Hollande and all these people
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  you're absolutely right actually I would
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  they're bragging that look they're
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  doing as we say to get in the next phase
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  of money and payoffs they've got to let
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  them kill us and then have them take it
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  over so Obama and everybody is showing
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  their good Demi's and now that the
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  mayor is Islamic in London he's openly
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  saying all this now letting folks know
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  that we are his slave go ahead
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  Demi a non-Muslim Demi has to pay the
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  jizya tax and for these people in the
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  process of committing the great treason
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  their their bride price their Demi tax
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  their jizya is to betray us while
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  looking at us in the eye and saying I
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  have no idea like Jay Johnson at the
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  Senate Intelligence Committee hearing a
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  couple weeks ago waving his hand and
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  saying I have no idea about this purge
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  of all the Islamic words I mean like I
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  said imagine FDR telling Hoover and the
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  FBI to purge everything about the
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  Gestapo SS and Himmler and not
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  national socialism and have no
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  investigations of Germans unless the
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  German-American Bund was there to make
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  sure it was not prejudiced against
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  Germans and let's be clear let's be
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  clear for folks that don't know history
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  tell folks who the boond is flesh this
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000]  out people forget that the government
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  has been ordered not to say Islamic
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  and terror now Twitter censoring it
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  explain this people need to read Phil
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  Haney's book see something say nothing
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  he was you know basically in
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  shut out and purged wouldn't it within
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  the Department of Homeland Security
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  where he was a subject matter expert
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  eventually by 2009 they just scrubbed
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  all the books everything that the FBI
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  uses all of their investigations
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  that's why they say oh it's another
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  lone wolf he was radicalized on the
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  internet see the internet is a safe
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  boogeyman and of course the solution
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  is free speech is bad free speech is
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  bad that's who's the one but but it's
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  really the mosques this is the level
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  of treason I call FBI now I call them
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  faking bogus investigations they used
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  to say their other so their other name
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  was fidelity bravery integrity now it's
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  faking bogus investigations and now the
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  mosque are testing that they're allowed
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000]  to preach and push this that's why it's
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  escalating and we are allowing radical
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  imams quote unquote imam which would be
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  like sending some Gestapo agent and
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  saying oh he's a member of the you know
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  the Nordic what was the Germanic
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  Odin religion yeah he's an Odin priest
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  and we need to send him around to all
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  the German clubs all over America in
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  1930s and if you say anything about it
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  you're in you're in a German a food well
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  right now we have these radical imams
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  these Muslim Brotherhood terrorists
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  they're going from mosque to mosque
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  passing out passing out trunk loads of
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  Wahhabist textbooks that preach murder
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  and jihad they are passing them out
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  they're funding these Wahhabi madrasa
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  schools where the kids are just going to
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  be let's not forget the imam in Florida
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  who even has a TV show on broadcast TV
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  a month before was saying murder the
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  homosexuals it's a favor to them kill them
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  and it's so embarrassing to see the FBI
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  today roll over like this I can't
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  imagine J Edgar Hoover the old FBI
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  agents that I knew you know 20 30 years
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  ago they must just be tearing their
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  hair out to see their their their bureau
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  destroyed and made up made like a lackey
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  made up a punk for these Muslim
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  Brotherhood imam terrorists that are
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000]  going from mosque to mosque but the FBI
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  is forbidden to go anywhere near the
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  mosque without calling the liaisons from
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  these Muslim Brotherhood front groups
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  that are now running and directing our
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  policy I mean it's Huma Ahmad didn't it's
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  the whole you know there there's there
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  it would take all day to list all of
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  these Muslim Brotherhood actors that
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  are now running our far as I'll ask you
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  this question if it's exponential
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  which it is now you predicted that when
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  this wasn't happening just you know a
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  couple years ago and then six months
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  ago and three months ago and a month
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  ago on the show if it's now gone from
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  monthly to weekly to daily to every few
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  hours what's happening what comes next
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  well in Europe we have we're very
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  fortunate here in America because we
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  get this war game out the worst case
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  scenario because it's unfolding in
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  Europe in Sweden for example the police
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  spend 90% of their effort cracking down
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  on right-wing extremists that are
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  complaining about the Islamic
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  takeover they don't go to the mosque
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  and throw people out so we can see in
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.000]  this country from the top down that the

[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  disgraceful FBI they are going to
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  continue with the towing the line that
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  we're bringing in refugees and anybody
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  that's against the refugees that's who
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  we're gonna investigate as a hater not
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000]  the people that are bringing in these
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000]  you imagine this is like the refugee
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  thing is a two-pronged attack
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  currently right here and now it's
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  biological warfare when you read about
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.000]  a half dozen people with with drug
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  and drug resistant tuberculosis being
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  dropped into some medium-sized town and
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  your average flyer that's by warfare
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  anybody else flying with that it's a
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  felony if you know you haven't 22%
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  Associated Press admits of the Minnesota
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  folks that have been brought in have TV
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  right and so this is by a war that's
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  right now so these kids in come end of
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  August they'll be in middle school
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  next to your son or daughter coughing
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  that's by a war and in the long term
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  these kids are going to grow up like
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000]  the sarnaev brothers they're not going
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  to ever assimilate their religion
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  orders them not to assimilate so when
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  you see these dimmy politicians saying
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  we haven't done a good enough job of
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  assimilating our Muslims excuse me
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  Muslims have a book which commands them
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  not to assimilate not to have non-Muslim
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  friends to lie to us and always to advance
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  Sharia the real division within Islam
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  is not moderate or non-moderate Muslims
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  moderate or radical it's a division
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  between the tactics of slow stealth
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  hijra we're just going to take it over
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  like the Muslim Brotherhood has taken
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  over our government we're just going to
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  bring in refugees until there's nothing
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  we can do at the other end are the
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  violent jihadists that believe in
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  shooting and blowing people up and
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  driving over people what do you make of
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  the caller earlier calling from London
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  saying oh these are all false flag
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  attacks yeah there's some department
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  somewhere where they've got all these
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  actors it's bogus but like you said
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  the false flag is at the top it's the
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  people that open the gate if farmer
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  Jones has a henhouse and he
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  catches a fox in the woods and then
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  he sticks the fox into the henhouse
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  he's part of it we don't blame the fox
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  we blame him Farmer Jones and then
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  the farmer Jones says I have no idea
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  how Fox got in there then you show a
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  tape of him and he's you know videotaped
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  him you've got him that's my next
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  question how do they know it didn't
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  happen this is clearly a plan Matt this
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  is clearly a plan you but it's all
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000]  accurate you're right how does the
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  political elite that they're going to
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  what they're going to get away with it
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  they have announced martial law with
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  troops on the streets in Germany but
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  for the right wingers at this point
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  the big show like Brexit was a few
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  weeks ago is Trump going ahead by
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  clear margins over Hillary Hillary
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  last night looked like that 1984
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  Apple commercial we're in her red
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  mall jacket it was scary as hell you
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  know that we're going to see I think
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  if Trump goes ahead in the polls
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  assassination attempts to the level of
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  airplanes blowing out of the sky by
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  what I mean is the stakes will be so
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  high that the people that would put a
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  bomb on a plane would be willing to
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  have everybody else on the plane die
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  make no mistake about it at the level
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  of Hillary Clinton imagine if Trump
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  wins and we've got Attorney General
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  Department of Justice being run by
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  Giuliani Andrew McCarthy people like
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  that Hillary Clinton can wind up in
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  prison it's 10 years for each one of
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  those top-secret documents she left
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  on she's a cornered rat and absolutely
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  I think they're going to try to kill
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  Trump or stage a false flag for somebody
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  tries to assassinate Hillary or we
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  don't have an election because the
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  security situation is so tenuous if we
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  have a male Mohammed and Malvo type
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  snipers driving around shooting people
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  middle end of October there won't be
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  an election you know the country will be
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  on a crazy lockdown so you're thinking
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  they may be with all the black lives
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  matter the rest of it clearly thinking
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  to have a civil emergency before the

[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  and go along with it that's not
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  happening just info wars is
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  exponentially growing to be in many
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  cases much larger than major
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  mainstream media outlets and when you
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  put out the truth
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  it isn't like it has to be reapplied
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  over and over again like lies it's

[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  one more segment about what we can do
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  about this but we have never been
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  in more amazing historical times
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  and I've been telling folks we're going
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  into this for a long time but it's here
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  and quite frankly
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  I can't come up with words to describe
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  how serious this is
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  who's been holding the longest here
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  Sean in Michigan and then we'll go to
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  Ben, Nathan, Jonah and others
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  Good brother
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  Hey I want to give a shout out to
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  Sean, my brother
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  Blyker, BL, EIC
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  Hi brother, hey I appreciate that we can't do a lot
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  of shout outs though because sometimes folks do it
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  to harass people I'm sure you're a great guy but we can't do it
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  Sean, what's your question for the guest?
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  Well
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  if he was to look at my Facebook he would
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  know who am I
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  I got to go, I appreciate your call Sean
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  let's go to Jonah in Canada
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  Jonah, you're on the air
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  Hi Mr. Jonah, how's it going?
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  Good, go ahead
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  I just wanted to call
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  and get a little bit of a touch face
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  on the video you released where
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  Putin is warning the media about
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  we're close to war
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  From Putin?
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  Yeah, I've been researching
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  and I've just been noticing
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  that NATO is kind of instigating
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  the fights over in Eastern Europe
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  Yeah, I'm just wondering
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  that NATO is all along Russia's border
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  they've been supporting jihadis
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  they overthrew the Ukrainian government
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  I'm not saying Russia is perfect but Russia is
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  not expanding, the globalists are starting a war
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  with them, please continue
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  Well it's just
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  it's not even just that, it's the build up
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  there's four battalions that are getting
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  sent and Canada is heading one
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  but the other ones are
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  they're all going to the border
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  They're doing war games and mashing troops
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  on the border and proxy troops
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  and there's a number of other
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  mercenaries that have been battling Russians
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  in the eastern part of Ukraine
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  for a long time
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  let's get Matt
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  let's get the rest of your take on that
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  caller, go ahead
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  Okay, well yeah, that along with
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  the missile silos and everything that are
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  going to be ready to fire upon Russia
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  whenever they want, they say it's for defense
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  but it's just it's more of a
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  Putin came out a month ago and said
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000]  this is in danger of nuclear war
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  well it's part
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  of the same fabric I think
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  to foment a crisis that's so bad
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  that there would be
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  blowback that would be
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  believable and acceptable
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  that we would perceive as being part of
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  the larger war, for example
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  the grid went down, if the internet went out
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  and when the internet came back on
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  assuming it ever came back on
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  people like you, me and some others
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  might not be around anymore
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  that's sort of the
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  Turkish Reichstag coup
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  you know, but instead of a coup
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  you have a war that would be
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  so devastating that we would just
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  believe that hey, the internet went down
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  that's right, and Matt, stay there, we're going to come right back
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  caller, stay there, John, I'm going to come back
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  let me have a comment back, but
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  the globalists have created a huge Ponzi scheme
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  to suck up all the wealth
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  build their yachts, their offshore bases
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  now they need to burn the whole house down
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  politically to distract from the
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  heights they've done and a big war historically
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  is the perfect way to do it
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  back in 70 seconds, I'm Alex Jones

[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  The spirit of liberty is so much more beautiful
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  so much more dynamic
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  there's really no choice between it and
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  tyranny.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  The tyranny always seeks to build
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  an artificial matrix-like reality
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  to insert us into their fantasy
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  land into Play-Doh's
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  cave so that we're not aware of the wider
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000]  universe and the wider
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  choices of free will around us.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Truth is we're the real liberals
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  those that promote
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  orthodox Islam and globalism
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  and communism
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  are the losers
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  they can't compete with an open society
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  they don't want to be on a level playing field
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  that's why they're despots
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  and that's why it's time for the sleeping
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  giant that is humanity
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  to rise up
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  in the information war and affect the future
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  battle space so when the new world order launches
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  its final takedown
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  they will be brought down and not us
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  all right, Jonah
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  in Canada
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  finished come back to what Bracken
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  just said to your point.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  Perfect, yeah, so like I was
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  saying the build up of forces
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  in Eastern Europe is the biggest threat to human
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  survival. Yeah, if the Russians
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  were massing troops on our border like that
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  I would be saying get ready for war, I would be pissed.
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  Yeah, and obviously Russia is just
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  going to counter that by
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  bringing more troops and then
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  our media only reports
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  that so then it looks like
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  they're going to say they're building troops
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  so we have to build more troops. Exactly, let's go back
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  to Bracken's right point.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  Here's the issue, Russia compared to us
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  more and more is like promoting freedom
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  because we're run by such authoritarian
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  what's the authoritarian
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  because you're a soldier, smart guy
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  what is the
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  calculus on just starting a war
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  with Russia out of nothing
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  and trying to hype it in the media
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  as a matter of NATO in general say
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  we need lots of dead Russians
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  on Fox News.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  I was actually a Russian studies major
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  so it's kind of interesting for me in that way
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  I've always followed very closely
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  going back through Russian history
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  I tie this directly
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  to the DNC email scandal
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  you can see how the globalists
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  they're immediate go-to
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  boogeyman now is Russia
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  this is important to me more for
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  as a matter of
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  messaging and how the media
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  can all take the same talking point
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  I saw something
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  that Hillary stole the primaries
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  because the Russians don't like it
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  the Russian but it wasn't
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  North Koreans like Sony you know right away it was
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  Russians now we have
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  heard only a little bit of scan information
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  that could actually point really that way
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  one of the things was something real simple
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  like well one of the hackers
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  was using a Cyrillic language keyboard
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  in my world that
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  would mean not Russia because at this level
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  unless it was just a Russian
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  hacker like you know in his mother's apartment
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  but I mean if it's Russian government level
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  then the false trail
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  would be led through a Chinese
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  keyboard or a North Korean keyboard
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  sure but I mean my issue is
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  who cares if Russia did it they're exposing
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  carbon taxes and Hillary stealing elections
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  but here's the thing Russia would have less motive
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  than anybody so to me this is
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  like a false victim targeting
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  thing by the globalists
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  because if the Russians I assume
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  that they have all of the 30,000
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  emails the top security stuff included
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  that was on her server
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  along with the Iranians the Chinese
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  and anonymous hackers
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  they would want Hillary to be in the White House
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  so that they could blackmail her
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  they could dangle some damning top secret
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  SCI SAP
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  program stuff that's a good point this is in
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  drugs report tomorrow unless
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  you know we do this deal
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  but as far as a war with Russia goes
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  I think that once again it's a question
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  of trying to ride the tiger
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  and calibrate just when you're going to jump off
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  a plan to ride a tiger is not
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  the same as riding the tiger a plan
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  to lead up to war with Russia
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000]  but not have a war
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  to just foment a crisis
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  that'll be part of the background for
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  why there's no election this fall
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  is more likely now a lot
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  of wars begin where they thought it would just
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  be a bluff you know we're just going
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  to bluff them and they're going to back down
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  and that's how wars sometimes begin
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  but remember both of these sides have nuclear weapons
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  no you're right
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  I mean does this map historically though
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  show that we really have an out of control
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  elite I mean this is all very reckless
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  well the media to me is
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  becoming a function they're functioning actors
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  now the media that for example
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  are still parroting Islamophobia
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  and the biggest
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  total willing accomplices stay there let's talk about
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  that because never has the media been
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  so in sync with the corrupt
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  elements that have hijacked our government
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  more calls as well from Bosnia
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  New York Tennessee Canada Florida
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  a new study suggests
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  that tattoo ink may be toxic
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000]  reports Fox News
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000]  getting inked may lead to long
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000]  term skin problems and an increased
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000]  risk of cancer according to a new
[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  report by the European Chemicals
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  Agency researchers found red
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  ink was the most dangerous but they warned
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  blue green and black ink
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  is also risky the most severe
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  concerns are allergies caused by
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  substances in the ink and possible
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000]  carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductive
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000]  toxic effects the report stated
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  it's also being reported that
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  governments in the EU do not
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000]  regulate tattoo ink as they do
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000]  drugs and food at many shops
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  operate without government regulations
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  in the United States the Food and Drug
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000]  Administration regulates chemicals
[03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  and products including tattoo ink
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  cosmetics and color additives
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000]  but due to other public health
[03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  priorities the FDA
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000]  has not traditionally regulated tattoo
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  inks and pigments you can find

[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  who's going to come on and talk about the fact that
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  they weren't allowed to look at Islamic terror
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  they were told to spy on everybody
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  that's when he resigned in 2001
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  after the attacks
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  and then they swapped team to his house
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000]  and he said they had systems that absolutely shut this down
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  he's the guy that ran the operations
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  against the Russians
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  one of the greatest mathematicians and code breakers ever
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000]  the guy's an idiot savant
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  I mean he's not dumb when you talk to him
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  he's super smart it's scary
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  scary smart talking about
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  the different ways they do these things
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  I'm not bragging but I was talking about
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  some of the interdimensional
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  lenses and
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  signatures and things
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  he was like how do you know about that
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  from doing some research years ago
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  my dad telling me about how they really break codes
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  and it's some pretty heavy stuff
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  but there's a lot of stuff going on
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  the point is
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  is that
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  science has gotten to a very very high level
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  and I'm just going to stop right there because I don't even fully understand it
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  but it's reached level like magic
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  at this point
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  I want to ask Matt Bracken up
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  next week because so much is happening
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  this is intensifying
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  unfortunately his analysis more and more is coming true
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  and
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  his warning is so important I know we have loaded phones here
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  from Bosnia
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  and from all over the place
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  he'll get to talk to William Benny
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  obviously when he is joining us
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  but just finishing up with Matt Bracken
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  clearly we
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  have an insane elite
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  Matt and I just hope
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  that
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  the Pentagon and others that have been more sane like General Flynn
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  exposing that Obama
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  and others were backing ISIS in Al Qaeda
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  I hope that somehow we're able
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  to derail what's happening
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  I'm not lionizing the Pentagon
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  but they seem to be really resisting a lot of this insanity
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  because they don't want to have their grandkids killed
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  or kids killed I guess
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  they're not psychopaths but the actual elite
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  running things, these globalists, these socialist
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  these George Soros types
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  are very messianic
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000]  I mean Soros has given interviews where he says he believes he's basically the Christ
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  these people are insane
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  and I don't see how we stop them
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  because even though they're frauds
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  they're watching, they're in power
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  and I agree with you that
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  I think they're gonna try to kill Trump
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  I think if Trump gets into power
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  before he actually gets into office
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  they might pull something big
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  I mean we're seeing things happen in this country
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  that have never happened before
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  and it seems like the establishment doesn't care
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  what we know or what we do
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  they're acting like they know something we don't know Matt
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  I think that the train
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  is heading for a bridge that's not there
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  possibly and that's what they know
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  they've got a plan for a siding
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  but the rest of us go over the edge
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  then they declare it an emergency
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  and how unfortunate it is
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  as far as things that we can do
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  I think that
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  I despair of waiting for any generals
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  or senior FBI
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  SES is what they call senior executive service
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  those are the civilian generals
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  that run all of these agencies
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  I'm waiting for any resignations
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  other than Phil Haney
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  I really haven't seen any whistleblowers
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  it is really a shame
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  so we have to accept the fact that FBI, DHS
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  they've been suborned
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  they're being run by Muslim Brotherhood
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  either knowingly or as
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  useful idiots
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  but where it's going to matter is these refugees
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  the refugees are a battle front
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  the refugees are part of this war
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  they're a fulcrum of this war
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  if your town accepts 100 Muslim men
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  called children but they could be 30
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  and they're saying that they're 16
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  if your town accepts them
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  your town just got 100 Hitler youth
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  for example
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  going back to my 1930s analogy
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  so we need to put pressure on law enforcement
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  at the local and state level
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  not to cooperate with the feds
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000]  who have clearly been suborned
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  by team tyranny
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  for example, if you're in local law enforcement
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  and you're tasked with providing
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  coverage at a demonstration
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  where the FBI
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  is going to come into town with a half dozen guys
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  and they're expecting 50 local law enforcement
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  to be their muscle
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  refuse to cooperate
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  the people that know when these secret
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  flights are coming in at night
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  getting loaded onto the big buses
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  taken to rehabilitated
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  bankrupt hotels
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  which are now being used as
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  secret refugee transit centers
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  the people that know this information need to leak it
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  if you're not part of
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  team tyranny and team treason
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  then you need to at least be calling
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  Alex Jones
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  if you're more resistant you're actually on that team
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  and you'll be treated that way
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000]  here's my final point, that's it
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  our own media and the European media
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  now the name is Ali
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  they change it to David and then they give him an English
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  last name as well
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  surname
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  they will not say when it's an Allah Akbar or Pledge to ISIS
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  it's unified information
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  warfare
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  that you wouldn't just expect your own government to use
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  it's such black propaganda
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  that you would only expect to be used
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  by an authoritarian state
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  and then it's used against us
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  so what I'm saying is I've never seen them
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  take the gloves off like this and put brass knuckles on
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  this is clearly a military operation
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  there's got to be a hundred times
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  the refugees they're saying coming in
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  my alma mater has 231
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  and that's just a high school in Austin
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  all the other high schools have it
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  all the other sub schools have it
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  thousands per school
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  total from 1st grade to 12th
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000]  they say 400 in Texas
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  total hell it's 402 high schools
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  I mean what is going on here
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  and the media that are
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  acting as the mouthpiece
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  as the gobbles
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  you know arm of it
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000]  the media are now players
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  the media that is selling this invasion
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  by saying oh I had no idea
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  look if you have no idea in 2016
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  then you're either a useful idiot
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  or you're a witting
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  trader
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  and we are going to start holding people to account
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  because we can all see
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  when they're screaming Allah Akbar
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  when they're killing priests or driving people
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000]  kids over in a truck
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  when they're screaming Allah Akbar we know what it is
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  and anybody who's at this point
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000]  saying we don't know what it is
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  we're looking for their motives
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  you are a trader FBI
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  please wake up
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  throw some cold water take a cold shower
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  think about J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  taking a dive like you cowards
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  you disgraceful dishonorable cowards
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  I have done
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  I expect so much more from you
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  covering up for the Muslim Brotherhood
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  looking the other way at these terror mosques
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000]  then Orlando happens
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000]  and you pretend you had no idea
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  it's disgraceful and dishonorable
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  and we're going to hold you to account
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  at Nuremberg after the last world war
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  you know I was just following orders
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  got people hanged
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  if you think your excuse is going to be
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  I was just following orders
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  that's going to get you hanged
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000]  if there's some super 9-11 that happens
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  there will be an accounting
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  man I hear you and I'm not defending the FBI
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  and others but you know in San Bernardino
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000]  two years before they were tracking
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  the husband and wife going back
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for training
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000]  they started a criminal justice department
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  investigation on the two agents
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  for investigating those two
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  and they are all over them
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  prosecuting them and firing them if they do
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  I think it really falls to us the American people
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  even more than the FBI
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  for the fact that we're so passive
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  it's allowed this to happen
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  we've got William Benning about to come on
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  I just want to ask the FBI agents
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  is your paycheck and your pension
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  worth more than your honor
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000]  your integrity and your country
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  look in the mirror Mr. FBI man
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  fidelity, bravery, integrity
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000]  is it integrity
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  or is it just paycheck and pension
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  seriously
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  well I mean I tell you
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  it would be one thing if they were taking us over
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  over a couple generations they appear to be doing this
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  very very quickly and so
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000]  we need to just do this for your pension
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  I mean there's not going to be any future here
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  obviously things are getting so cataclysmic
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  Matt Bracken thank you so much
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  for the time the website's excellent
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  the essays, the books, enemies, foreign
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  and domestic.com we'll talk to you soon
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000]  Thanks
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  Now joining us
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000]  for the hour
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  I'm leaving in about 25 minutes because I've got to go get ready
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  for the rest of the broadcast is one of my heroes
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  but
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000]  I think it's already going to come in and be talking to him
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  and giving him the floor
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000]  William Benny you talk about where are the whistleblowers
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000]  William Benny
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  is one of the top code breakers
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  one of the top mathematicians
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000]  I mean just separately mainline news
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  says he's one of the greatest code breakers in history
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  and this is a guy that helped defeat the Soviet Union
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000]  he's broken down already here
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  previously that they were tracking
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000]  Al Qaeda
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  and other groups and specifically what was going on
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  but it only cost
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  20-30 million dollars a year
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000]  and
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  or even lower but they wanted to spend
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000]  billions on spying on everybody and so he
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  resigned
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000]  tried to talk to congress as you're supposed to
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  legally and lawfully and they said they
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000]  swat team him tried to prosecute him
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  tried to prosecute others
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  and it's continued on with Obama not just Bush
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  so he's the former technical
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  leader for the
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  national security agency the guy that actually ran
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.000]  the NSA not the political director
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  and
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  basically equivalent to multi-star general
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  before becoming a whistleblower in late
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  2001 after more than 30 years with the agency
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  Benny has been described as one of the best
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  analyst and code breakers in NSA history
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000]  he continues to speak out about the NSA's
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  data collection policies and continues
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  interviews the media regarding his experiences
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  he's come to Austin to visit with us
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000]  he has a lot of courage expose facts
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  dot org
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  a good American dot org
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  that's the new documentary film
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  that he and Drake and others are in
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000]  there's also obviously a long over stone movie
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  coming out dealing
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  with all of this and so here to talk
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  about the film
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  here to talk about the latest developments
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  here to talk about what's unfolding is
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000]  William Benny William thank you for joining
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  us
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  we have him there guys or do we lose him
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  yeah I watched you there for a second Alex
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  yeah but I'm here good to have you sir
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  good to talk to you
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  well it's good to be back with you
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  where do we start I mean I want to get into the film
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  what's happening in NSA but
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  just the fact that they know about these jihadis
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000]  all over the place even though
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000]  when they're convicted terrorists they're still letting them in
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  I mean how do you respond to that
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  well I just think they're all deluded
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  they're insane
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000]  I mean they're not doing anything smart
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  I mean you should let people into the
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  country only when you could bet them
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000]  and know who they are where they're coming from
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  and what they stand for
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:07.000]  I mean otherwise it's just
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  like open borders in its insanity
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  absolutely sir where to begin
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000]  with the NSA
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  and what's developed since the last time you were on this six months ago
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  well since then Alex
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  we've started a coalition
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  of privacy groups and civil
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000]  liberties groups inside the US here
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  and we've got connections worldwide
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000]  now and we're trying to get
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000]  that coalition is
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  being joined by about 30 members of
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000]  Congress and we're
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  getting this coalition to move
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  to first to open up
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000]  the DODIG report which
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  exposes all the crimes and
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  fraud and waste that they've got
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  but it really goes into the reasons
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000]  why
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000]  they did this bulk acquisition
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  data because there was so much money behind it
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000]  and there was so much corruption
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  internally between the companies involved
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000]  and the officials
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000]  of the NSA
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000]  in fact that report
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  according to my sources
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000]  implied that they
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000]  they let or referred to criminal
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  prosecutions to
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000]  Department of Justice
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000]  so and those of course
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000]  went nowhere because
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000]  if they opened up the can of worms
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000]  there with those referrals
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  that would expose everybody to criminality
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  and they didn't want to do that
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000]  so it's the same too big to fail
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  Hillary's too corrupt to jail because it'll bring everybody down
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  the banks are too big to fail so let them loot us
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000]  yeah I mean
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  they're all a part of it too
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000]  so you have to all stick together
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  I mean if you're all criminals one has to defend the other
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  that's the point
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  very well said sir
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  let's talk about a good American
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  the new films
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000]  coming out very very exciting it's a gripping
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  docket thriller about a groundbreaking
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  surveillance program the brilliant mastermind behind it
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  and how this
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000]  perfect alternative to mass surveillance was killed
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000]  by the NSA management for money
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000]  three weeks prior to 9-11 I gotta say
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  you got a lot of courage what you did
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  15 years ago what you've been doing since then
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:09.000]  and now being in this film
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  well yeah
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.000]  the film basically goes through my career
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000]  at NSA and toward the end it gets into
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  what led up to mass surveillance
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.000]  how we got there
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  and how they corrupted the entire process
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000]  and why they did it for money of course
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  as the main driver
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000]  but also to build empires they wanted to build empires
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  in contracting
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  and in government that was
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000]  also a large motive for them
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  but it also
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  gets into saying that there was simply
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000]  an alternative to mass surveillance that existed
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  all along
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:43.000]  and they suppressed that and they did it because
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  they wanted mass amounts of money
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:47.000]  so we all got fleeced because of these
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  criminals that's right
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000]  and then as you explained
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000]  since you talked about this
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.000]  you didn't go public to a few years after
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  you first talked to congress but
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000]  everything you talked about has been admitted
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000]  that they surveil everything so it's like
[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000]  needle in a haystack everything's worthless
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  instead of targeted surveillance it's legal
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000]  and lawful
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  yeah that's right
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  it would have been very simple to get warrants
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.000]  to do the things you want to do
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000]  there was no impediment to doing that
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.000]  that was true all along
[03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  and yet they made out that it was such
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:21.000]  a difficult process in all of that
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  that was just another pack of lies
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  which all these lies are also exposed
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000]  in the DoDIs
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  plus you don't need a warrant to target overseas assets
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  no not there but in the US
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  sure but I mean most of it is overseas
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  I mean because a lot of the stuff
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000]  between the US and overseas you can always
[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:39.000]  just target the overseas end correct
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:41.000]  yeah but now you see
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  what they're doing is over half of it
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:45.000]  is in the US
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.000]  and we know it's being politically
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  used in fact a lot of experts
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  have talked about the fact that a lot of NSA
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  is directly targeted in other agencies
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:55.000]  at people in their own agencies
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.000]  yeah that's right
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000]  and I use I maintain
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  they use it against Elliott Spitzer because he was going
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000]  after the bankers on Wall Street
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.000]  for criminality and defrauding people
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  so they had to get rid of them
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000]  to protect their bankers
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.000]  yeah why did they go after Spitzer
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.000]  for a hooker I mean I'm not for him or against
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:15.000]  him but there is this vitriol against Spitzer
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.000]  and I just don't see how
[03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.000]  having a hooker is the reason
[03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000]  to make a big national scandal
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000]  yeah I guess the
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  protect them
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000]  the probable cause for going after him
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  was to protect their
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  bankers
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:33.000]  not for any other evidence of criminality
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  I mean they had to go into financial transactions
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  credit card and phone and stuff like that
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.000]  to find something to use against
[03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  them to get rid of them
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  now let's say you're on national TV
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000]  which you basically are this is a bigger audience
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000]  the most national TV shows
[03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  what would you just impart in five minutes
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000]  to the general public about what's happening
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.000]  in this culture
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  well
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000]  we're losing our fundamental rights
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.000]  I call it treason against the founding
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  principles of this nation
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.000]  they're subverting the constitution
[03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  and they're doing it mostly in secret
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000]  and they're trying to get everybody over time
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  slowly and incrementally
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:11.000]  like raising the temperature on the frog
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  in the water until you get them cooked
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000]  that's fundamentally where we're
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  in the water being slowly cooked
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  and at the end result
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  is the state that's the total
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.000]  surveillance state basically a totalitarian state
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  for whoever's in the White House
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  so I think we're
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  electing an imperial president basically
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  sure
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000]  I mean I know you're pretty much nonpartisan
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  but when you look
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000]  at the fact that they try to say that
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  super delegates they just created
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  back in the 70's but never implemented
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  could just nicks delegates
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  in popular vote
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  they failed with Trump but with Hillary
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  Sanders clearly won most
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000]  of big states and would be the nominee
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  but they just had super delegates
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.000]  aside that she would be the nominee
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.000]  unprecedented to see
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  that type behavior
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  that type of behavior going on
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  and it just makes me ask you wow
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  you know we don't have a fourth amendment
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  why even have voting I mean at a certain point
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  the bottom falls out
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.000]  well plus
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  of course the DNC
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  DNC were
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  kind of slanting the entire
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  process against Bernie
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  well absolutely
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  they stole the election from him and the emails have come out
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  so who do you think is really behind those emails
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  the latest ones getting hacked
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000]  they keep saying it's the Russians
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  well I don't know
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  he has a problem with Hillary
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  with NSA
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  and I know that NSA of course had those emails
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  so
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  also probably CIA
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000]  because they share and
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  many other countries in the world
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  could also access them through different programs
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  IC reach or
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  or X
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  key score those programs
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  could get into that data and by the way
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  to trace who's ever tapping
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  into that you could use X
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000]  key score as Edward Snowden said
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  very easily to trace who's doing that
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  and you know they had
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  some private company look in and they looked
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  I guess they looked for
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.000]  a specific
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  set of attacks which the Russians used
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.000]  and they found one so
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000]  Russians were hacking so were everybody else in the world
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  I was about to say it's like a feeding
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  frenzy we're feeding carpet
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  in the Japanese garden because
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  I mean everybody's targeting the DNC
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  and RNC they admit major agencies
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  are spying on Congress I mean this is a free for
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.000]  all
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  so you're saying
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  there's no way to tell where those emails came from sir
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000]  well I mean you have to have a real
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  good spread network log that
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  goes into the DNC server
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  but as far as I know they haven't done
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  I think that's probably what the FBI is going to be
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  about and there they'll be able
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  to lay out how many people hacked in
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  well
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  why does it seem that Democrats are more sloppy
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  than Republicans I mean maybe that's just a misconception
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000]  but it seems like they don't do much
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  to protect what they're doing
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  yes and in fact
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  that's one of the questions I had here
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  which got written up in a blog
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  if it was a known attack
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  why didn't they have a defense for it
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  if it's known why they should have a defense for that
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  I mean
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  yeah like when we have known attacks here
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:21.000]  every month we have services that just update
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  plugins and we have security companies
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000]  that are always updating stuff why don't they do that
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  that's right yeah exactly right
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  and
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  that was the whole point
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  the other
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  that means
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  like for example in NSA
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  one problem sticks because
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  that will close windows for them
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  they won't be able to see into other things
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  or hack into them if those things are closed
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  so they'll make it more difficult
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  so that's one of the reasons they don't care
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  they leave the internet with holes in it
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  so they can run around stealing just as easy
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000]  yeah because
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  then it's a window
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  whoever has that system or
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  firewall or whatever it is they're hacking through
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  it allows them to get in
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000]  to see what they're doing if they
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  they've got a problem
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  they can't
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  William Benny
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000]  let me ask you this question
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  are things getting better or worse with spying
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  I know you're not in the agency anymore but talking to your colleagues
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  I mean has there been any reformers
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  just getting worse
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  I think it's just getting worse because they keep
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:25.000]  arguing they need more data when in fact
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.000]  even internally in NSA
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  an analyst is saying data is not intelligence
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  you know we're drowning in information
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  and we can't figure anything out
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.000]  because there's too much data to look at
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  that's what's being said about the area
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  because you're not profiling everybody knows you're profiled
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  I'm sorry what was that
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  because they don't do targeting they're not targeting
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.000]  right that's just
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000]  mass collection and dumping
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000]  wow
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  well tell me about the new film I can't wait to see it
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  it's coming out in September I'm told
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  yes it'll be open
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  opening in
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000]  I think the 23rd
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000]  of September here in the United States
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  and it's basically
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  we're going to be using it
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  with this coalition of privacy groups
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  and civil liberties groups as a
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000]  as a lever to try to
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000]  strike a hammer to open up that deal
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000]  to the public
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  because most of what they redacted
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  out of the report is unclassified
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  and that's really
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  the knucklebusters
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  for the intelligence agency
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  it exposes all their crimes and all their lying
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000]  and everything to people
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  they came along and said everything was legal
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000]  well you know it wasn't
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  I mean the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.000]  ruled their bulk acquisition was illegal
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  and so the federal judges
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000]  a couple of them had ruled it was
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000]  absolutely stay there we'll do a few more minutes with our guests
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000]  and a bunch of breaking news and more
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  thank you Mr. Benny a true American hero
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  we're on the march the empires
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000]  on the run
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[03:29:55.000 --> 03:30:17.000]  network
[03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:33.000]  we're live
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:38.040]  If they had been convicted every
[03:30:38.040 --> 03:30:41.000]  the defendant's almost
[03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.000]  They found
[03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:45.000]  Again
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:49.760]  A grand jury initially began investigating Planned Parenthood, but the group was cleared
[03:30:49.760 --> 03:30:51.680]  of misusing fetal tissue.
[03:30:51.680 --> 03:30:55.720]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[03:30:55.720 --> 03:31:04.520]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[03:31:04.520 --> 03:31:08.000]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:09.000]  Here's why.
[03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:12.880]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[03:31:12.880 --> 03:31:17.480]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:31:17.480 --> 03:31:22.160]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and
[03:31:22.160 --> 03:31:23.880]  produce electricity from the sun.
[03:31:23.880 --> 03:31:28.800]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[03:31:28.800 --> 03:31:31.200]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:33.880]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:31:33.880 --> 03:31:38.840]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving
[03:31:38.840 --> 03:31:44.280]  away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for infowars
[03:31:44.280 --> 03:31:45.280]  listeners.
[03:31:45.280 --> 03:31:46.840]  So it's a good time to check it out.

[03:31:47.840 --> 03:31:48.840]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:31:48.840 --> 03:31:54.120]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.

[03:32:15.680 --> 03:32:18.760]  heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:18.760 --> 03:32:22.040]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[03:32:22.040 --> 03:32:25.160]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:25.160 --> 03:32:28.000]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your

[03:32:50.400 --> 03:32:52.160]  Your body will be very grateful.
[03:32:52.160 --> 03:32:55.440]  On the web at infowarsteam.com.
[03:32:55.440 --> 03:33:12.800]  The
[03:33:12.800 --> 03:33:21.200]  world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:25.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:25.560 --> 03:33:29.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:29.800 --> 03:33:31.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:36.560]  We are the heart of the resistance against the global takeover, against the corruption,
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:37.560]  against the looting.
[03:33:37.560 --> 03:33:39.400]  It is an information war.
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:42.720]  William Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency, the quote
[03:33:42.720 --> 03:33:46.480]  leader of the NSA was the title, is our guest.
[03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:47.760]  I'm going to keep for another five minutes.
[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:52.120]  I appreciate his work and I'm going to get into some of Donald Trump's speech from earlier
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:56.560]  and some of your phone calls from Bosnia and Connecticut and New York and England, you
[03:33:56.560 --> 03:33:57.560]  name it.
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:33:59.640]  Anthony Gutiard is going to be taking over some too.
[03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:02.920]  We've got another 24 hours plus coming up.
[03:34:02.920 --> 03:34:06.880]  I'll be back later tonight with this marathon 28-hour broadcast.
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:12.520]  Mr. Benny, the new film, A Good American Coming Out in September, there will be a trailer
[03:34:12.520 --> 03:34:17.400]  out soon exposing all this with yourself and other whistleblowers.
[03:34:17.400 --> 03:34:21.840]  What are points you want to impart to folks that they should know about?
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:26.880]  We're going to use the film as a lever to get a movement started in Washington, first
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:33.480]  to expose the DODIG report, but then to go on and move toward a shifting this bulk acquisition
[03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:39.360]  out and forcing them into a targeted approach, which would be more productive and actually
[03:34:39.360 --> 03:34:41.800]  succeed.
[03:34:41.800 --> 03:34:45.560]  This is kind of the lever we're trying to use to do that and we, of course, need a little
[03:34:45.560 --> 03:34:50.520]  help to get that going, but, and that's on one of the links I gave you to, if people
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:55.080]  want to help, they can look at that link and see the different ways they can do that.
[03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:56.080]  Sure.
[03:34:56.080 --> 03:34:57.080]  Which link is that?
[03:34:57.080 --> 03:34:58.080]  Agoodamerican.org?
[03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:04.640]  That's the, that's actually the site for the, for the, where we put down how to do a targeted
[03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:05.640]  approach.
[03:35:05.640 --> 03:35:09.280]  We're putting it on the web for everybody to read so you can see how you can do it.
[03:35:09.280 --> 03:35:10.280]  Sure.
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:13.520]  I was given exposefacts.org and AGoodAmerican.org.
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:17.080]  Can you pull up the site for folks to donate or to help spread the film?
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:21.360]  It's the, it's the one that's the, it's the Kickstarter link.
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:27.280]  Oh, oh good, that's a good American on Kickstarter and so folks can go out there, it's there
[03:35:27.280 --> 03:35:28.280]  on screen.
[03:35:28.280 --> 03:35:29.280]  Please continue.
[03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:30.280]  Yeah.
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:31.280]  Yeah.
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:35.840]  So, and what we're going to be doing is trying to, to get them to start doing smart things
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:40.680]  and, and abide by the constitution and the laws of the country, instead of being a lawless
[03:35:40.680 --> 03:35:42.560]  organization, which is what we have now.
[03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:43.960]  Oh, it's super dangerous.
[03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:45.640]  People think of a foreign power as a threat.
[03:35:45.640 --> 03:35:48.400]  Sure it can be, or what about multinational corporations?
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:51.400]  What about combines in our own government taking over?
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:54.280]  Look at third world countries or, or, or Europe's history.
[03:35:54.280 --> 03:35:56.120]  That's usually the number one threat.
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:35:57.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:35:57.720 --> 03:36:01.840]  But now we've become our, we've become the greatest threat to, I mean, no country in
[03:36:01.840 --> 03:36:03.520]  the world was ever going to threaten us anyway.
[03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:09.680]  We, we had, we were always too powerful, but, but we, we can't, against ourselves, we can
[03:36:09.680 --> 03:36:10.680]  grow.
[03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:14.880]  And all the, the oath of office for everybody in, in Congress and in the White House and
[03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:20.400]  every employee of the government is to protect and defend the constitution against all, all
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:22.960]  enemies, both foreign and domestic.
[03:36:22.960 --> 03:36:27.880]  Now, what we have here is a bunch of domestic enemies who are subverting the constitution
[03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:30.120]  and that needs to end.
[03:36:30.120 --> 03:36:36.200]  Well, we just really appreciate you enclosing unprecedented persecution of the press, unprecedented
[03:36:36.200 --> 03:36:41.360]  persecution of whistleblowers, clearly exposing criminal activity.
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:45.520]  Has that led up any, I mean, I know even liberal sale bomb is the worst in history.
[03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:46.520]  More than any modern.
[03:36:46.520 --> 03:36:51.920]  No, no, no, they just said, since sterling off based on metadata to, to jail for a couple
[03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:52.920]  of years.
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:55.200]  So, I mean, you know, that's not led up.
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:36:59.720]  The whole point is when Obama came in and said, you know, we won't, we're not, let's
[03:36:59.720 --> 03:37:00.720]  not look back.
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:01.720]  Let's look forward.
[03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:05.720]  And he applied that equally to everybody except for whistleblowers.
[03:37:05.720 --> 03:37:10.600]  So anybody who exposed the dirty laundry of the government and all the crimes and fraud
[03:37:10.600 --> 03:37:16.120]  and waste that they were committing, anybody who did that was, you, you prosecute them
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:19.160]  no matter what, you always look back and find them and get rid of them.
[03:37:19.160 --> 03:37:20.160]  That's what they're doing.
[03:37:20.160 --> 03:37:21.160]  That's right.
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:22.360]  They continue to do.
[03:37:22.360 --> 03:37:23.840]  That's absolutely right.
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:27.080]  William Benny, former leader of the national security agency.
[03:37:27.080 --> 03:37:29.040]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:30.040]  Thank you.
[03:37:30.040 --> 03:37:31.040]  Wow.
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:34.560]  The great part about my job is I get to meet honorable people.
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:38.040]  That guy could have been paid $10 million a year.
[03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:40.560]  He didn't brag about, I've read news articles at big corporations.
[03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:41.560]  I mean, top guy.
[03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:48.520]  And I mean, inventor of most of the NSA stuff, that guy's like freakishly genius and he wouldn't
[03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:49.520]  do it.
[03:37:49.520 --> 03:37:50.520]  He won't do illegal stuff.
[03:37:50.520 --> 03:37:55.480]  And he hates it that they use his technologies to spy on everybody like interdimensional
[03:37:55.480 --> 03:38:00.840]  stuff because any big mathematical equation will have like a shadow that's smaller than
[03:38:00.840 --> 03:38:03.160]  it's all this really sophisticated stuff.
[03:38:03.160 --> 03:38:08.040]  And that guy's like super genius, but see, he doesn't want to prey on people.
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:10.120]  And so there's the difference right there.
[03:38:10.120 --> 03:38:12.200]  He's one of the guys that broke the Russian codes.
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:13.200]  You name it.
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:15.440]  Let's turn his mic on real quick.
[03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:17.160]  Anthony Guterri's in here with us.
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:18.800]  We arrived in shotgun a little bit in the next hour.
[03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:19.800]  What you're saying, Anthony?
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:25.560]  Yeah, he's an honorable guy because he understands you don't crap in the pool.
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:27.040]  Evil people think you do bad things.
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:28.360]  It doesn't affect you too.
[03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:29.360]  Or your kids.
[03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:33.880]  And they wonder why they have such bad luck, but I tell you, I want to take a few phone
[03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:38.040]  calls here and then play part of this Trump speech today, the full speeches on infowars.com.
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:43.840]  We're going to go to Nimmiyaha, I pronounced that right from Bosnia and a few other callers
[03:38:43.840 --> 03:38:46.240]  here in just a few minutes.
[03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:48.720]  Anthony, you're already in here with us.
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:50.040]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:51.240]  We're running the biggest specials.
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:55.360]  I don't know if it's saying a lot, the biggest special here or there on one or two items.
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:56.920]  We have thousands of items.
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:03.360]  This is the biggest special ever, 40% off on storeable foods, 40% off on brain force,
[03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:05.600]  30% off on a bunch of the other nutraceuticals.
[03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:10.680]  The lowest discounts are 20% off on the Patriot apparel, the Hillary Rape shirts, the Hillary
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:16.840]  for Prison, the Molan Lombay, Operation Sleeping Giant is live at Operation Sleeping Giant.
[03:39:16.840 --> 03:39:21.840]  You just go to infowars.com forward slash giant and the small profit we make off each
[03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:27.400]  item hopefully will be outweighed by massive orders to give us the confidence to decide
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:32.000]  if I can hire a couple more reporters, couple more camera people, couple more writers, couple
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  more editors.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:37.480]  I really need six to 15 people and it's a hassle to manage folks until we've got some
[03:39:37.480 --> 03:39:41.720]  good crew here and good folks to train people and we just get overworked and over task trying
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:46.520]  to do four or five shows a day and work seven days a week and be able to cover events in
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:48.880]  different parts of the world.
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:49.880]  We're doing it.
[03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:52.960]  Now we're up here Saturday and Sunday, we're not bitching, it's just we're up here Saturday
[03:39:52.960 --> 03:39:56.960]  and Sunday as he was up here Sunday for about eight hours, I was up here about five hours,
[03:39:56.960 --> 03:40:00.880]  I was up here Saturday about four hours, so was he and we're not complaining, we love
[03:40:00.880 --> 03:40:01.880]  doing this work.
[03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:05.840]  We want to train people so we're seven days a week, but everybody didn't have to work
[03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:10.880]  seven days a week and Rob do is having to work 18 hours a day and you know, look at
[03:40:10.880 --> 03:40:15.960]  why he's not too happy, like a wet cat sometimes, what do we all do when we get mad?
[03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:19.960]  But the point is, is that we're really busting our ass here and we appreciate your prayers,
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:24.320]  your support, you cannot find a better place to get great products that are game changers
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:31.800]  and get a great deal and support quite frankly craved maniacs when it comes to liberty.
[03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:36.040]  I mean we've got the spirit of liberty, there's a reason we are kicking ass.
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:40.840]  When you see those hunchback crones and reanimated corpses and slithering demons, I love Drudge
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:47.080]  Report, Soros slithers into the convention, weirdo Nazi collaborator, 85 year old Fricozoids,
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:51.480]  I mean if we can't kick their ass, that's our fault and here's the deal, we are kicking
[03:40:51.480 --> 03:40:52.480]  their butt.
[03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:57.720]  Here comes wet cat, come on in here, you heard me talking about it, look at him wearing shorts
[03:40:57.720 --> 03:40:58.720]  and a sports jacket.
[03:40:58.720 --> 03:41:02.560]  Now I feel bad for do, he'll be like, I've been working all week till three a.m. to finish
[03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:06.560]  these videos, I'm like dude don't work hard but we have to, because he's like here bring
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.720]  him, this is not a plan, here's wet cat, stuff's gotta get done and you know I finally feel
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:16.200]  like I slept eight hours last night, I felt like I slept for a week, we were literally
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:21.680]  sleeping three to four hours a night at these RNC, we almost got a couple fistfights, yeah
[03:41:21.680 --> 03:41:26.000]  we did but you know that's part of, it shows how intense we are, we're intense people.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:29.920]  It's nine o'clock at night, you've been going since seven a.m. and the communists just
[03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:36.040]  attacked here, you gotta get crazed and go to the next level, exactly, but then we were
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:37.960]  like six more hours after that.
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:41.080]  That's the way it is sometimes, you know, Lord Palpatine, I tuned into the hatred that
[03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:45.120]  you should be upset, it'd be weird if you weren't crazy, right, exactly.
[03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:49.040]  So yeah, I'm coming up at what, three o'clock in just like 20 minutes, I guess you're gonna
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:54.120]  finish out the hour and, hey, vitamin mineral fusion, drink it every day, this wasn't even
[03:41:54.120 --> 03:41:57.680]  a planned plug, m4slife.com, so delicious.
[03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:01.760]  I tell my kids, I go, yo, want some fruit punch, hey, we want fruit punch, they can serve
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:05.760]  all the vitamins and minerals and they love it, it tastes great, the kids love it.
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:06.760]  And that was, yeah.
[03:42:06.760 --> 03:42:10.960]  The ad we cut was before the 18-wheeler got here, it was with the little mini sampler
[03:42:10.960 --> 03:42:11.960]  one.
[03:42:11.960 --> 03:42:12.960]  It's like a lot bigger.
[03:42:12.960 --> 03:42:13.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:42:13.960 --> 03:42:14.960]  It's like hilarious.
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:15.960]  I keep saying, re-cut that ad.
[03:42:15.960 --> 03:42:16.960]  Look, here's your little cup.
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:17.960]  Ten times bigger.
[03:42:17.960 --> 03:42:18.960]  Yeah, that's like it.
[03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:19.960]  And it's good stuff.
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:20.960]  That's, brain force is amazing.
[03:42:20.960 --> 03:42:23.640]  I haven't even had brain force yet because I'm going to wait until the wee hours of
[03:42:23.640 --> 03:42:24.640]  the morning because I'll be doing it.
[03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:26.760]  There's not a lot of heavy brain force right now.
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:28.320]  I heard your brain force plug.
[03:42:28.320 --> 03:42:31.600]  I've noticed the brain forces in an association we're really tired with.
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:32.600]  Right.
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:35.080]  It'll get you totally awake and then you start, something, it's bad, but when you're
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:39.000]  really awake, when you're super tired, it's like picking out all the details.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  Yeah.
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:42.640]  Stimulants and, and being tired, you start getting a little grumpy.
[03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:43.640]  It happens.
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:44.640]  Maybe that's just you.
[03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:46.160]  I haven't seen you today either.
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:47.160]  I, you got, I got.
[03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:48.160]  I get, I get me.
[03:42:48.160 --> 03:42:49.160]  It's totally natural.
[03:42:49.160 --> 03:42:50.160]  It's totally healthy.
[03:42:50.160 --> 03:42:52.360]  It's just that if it's nine o'clock at night, you got to work till two o'clock in the morning
[03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:53.600]  and you take some, you're going to be awake.
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:54.600]  Oh yeah.
[03:42:54.600 --> 03:42:55.600]  It's only a coffee where you're kind of awake.
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:56.600]  You feel like crap.
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:57.600]  You're awake.
[03:42:57.600 --> 03:42:58.600]  You feel good.
[03:42:58.600 --> 03:42:59.600]  You want to kick, you know.
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:00.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:01.600]  It's not good.
[03:43:01.600 --> 03:43:02.600]  It does really work.
[03:43:02.600 --> 03:43:06.040]  I'm getting, getting a little bit of sleep, I feel super charged, but at, you know, when
[03:43:06.040 --> 03:43:10.480]  I came in and did that Lewis Farrakhan interview, which is where that ad plays from, I literally,
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:11.640]  I was, I was dead tired.
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:14.320]  It was eight o'clock and I'm like, there's no, I'm going to finish this.
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:20.720]  And the brain force till three a.m. it was solid, like editing, you know, when you're
[03:43:20.720 --> 03:43:21.720]  editing, you're in the zone.
[03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:23.680]  Don't take, don't, don't go too far.
[03:43:23.680 --> 03:43:26.960]  Just don't take more than two days in a row.
[03:43:26.960 --> 03:43:31.880]  See what it's for is to take one at five when you got to keep working till say 10, then
[03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:33.200]  it's okay.
[03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:34.200]  Don't take two.
[03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:36.280]  I took two.
[03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:37.280]  And I finished the project.
[03:43:37.280 --> 03:43:38.280]  All right.
[03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:39.280]  I'm going to go get ready for this one.
[03:43:39.280 --> 03:43:42.640]  They sell stuff at gas stations for like 20 bucks for two pills per pill is crazy.
[03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:43.640]  That gives you a headache.
[03:43:43.640 --> 03:43:44.640]  It doesn't work as well.
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:45.640]  It's terrible.
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:47.800]  This is $17 for a whole bottle.
[03:43:47.800 --> 03:43:49.920]  They sell a lot of crazy stuff at the gas stations.
[03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:50.920]  Even Whole Foods.
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:54.040]  They have these, this new thing now is to sell one pill for like $20.
[03:43:54.040 --> 03:43:55.160]  I wasn't on, dude.
[03:43:55.160 --> 03:43:56.680]  I just had to tell him, stop working.
[03:43:56.680 --> 03:43:58.920]  He had to come in because you called him a wet cat.
[03:43:58.920 --> 03:43:59.920]  So he had to come in.
[03:43:59.920 --> 03:44:00.920]  Less a joke around.
[03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:01.920]  Man.
[03:44:01.920 --> 03:44:02.920]  Take the mic.
[03:44:02.920 --> 03:44:03.920]  You know how wet cat looks.
[03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:04.920]  You can go in.
[03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:05.920]  No, no.
[03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:06.920]  Dude's awesome.
[03:44:06.920 --> 03:44:07.920]  He's so into this.
[03:44:07.920 --> 03:44:08.920]  He won't stop.
[03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:09.920]  I'll tell you that.
[03:44:09.920 --> 03:44:10.920]  I said, dude, go home.
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:13.320]  But I mean, once you get in this fight, you want to expose it because there's like stacks
[03:44:13.320 --> 03:44:15.360]  of, by the way, do we have the Hillary hyena video?
[03:44:15.360 --> 03:44:16.440]  I want to play that.
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:19.400]  This was banned and removed off the internet already.
[03:44:19.400 --> 03:44:22.000]  And then they were airing it on national TV and it was removed.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  And I realized it.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:24.000]  I always hear her laugh.
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  She sounds like a hyena.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:28.000]  Do we have that?
[03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  Queue up the Hillary hyena.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:30.760]  I'm going to take a few phone calls.
[03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:31.760]  Then maybe just later.
[03:44:31.760 --> 03:44:54.080]  I want to hear a big, God, that woman's a demon.
[03:44:54.080 --> 03:44:55.080]  There's something.
[03:44:55.080 --> 03:44:56.080]  I forget what's national.
[03:44:56.080 --> 03:44:57.080]  I have an article on force.com.
[03:44:57.080 --> 03:45:00.920]  A national cable channel just played that as a joke and they got threats and stuff removed
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:01.920]  it.
[03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:02.920]  And then it's been being removed.
[03:45:02.920 --> 03:45:03.920]  Who was it?
[03:45:03.920 --> 03:45:04.920]  TBS.
[03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:05.920]  Yeah.
[03:45:05.920 --> 03:45:06.920]  Yes.
[03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:07.920]  TBS.
[03:45:07.920 --> 03:45:08.920]  In fact, we want to retweet that at infowars.com.
[03:45:08.920 --> 03:45:09.920]  Real Alex Jones.
[03:45:09.920 --> 03:45:10.920]  Let's play that again.
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:12.920]  Her laugh is indistinguishable from a hyena.
[03:45:12.920 --> 03:45:15.920]  And have you seen her now in public where she starts to go on?
[03:45:15.920 --> 03:45:19.320]  I mean, what do you think is going on with her?
[03:45:19.320 --> 03:45:21.920]  Well, you know, I almost want her just to get in.
[03:45:21.920 --> 03:45:26.320]  So she probably just launched nukes and just go, hell, Satan launched it up.
[03:45:26.320 --> 03:45:27.320]  It's like a hyena.
[03:45:27.320 --> 03:45:29.360]  I can imagine that.
[03:45:29.360 --> 03:45:32.160]  Just pressing the launch codes, which are zero, zero, zero, right?
[03:45:32.160 --> 03:45:33.160]  She's pressing zero, zero, zero, laugh.
[03:45:33.160 --> 03:45:35.160]  Who for a while was zero, zero, zero?
[03:45:35.160 --> 03:45:36.160]  Yeah, zero, zero, zero.
[03:45:36.160 --> 03:45:37.160]  The government's so inept.
[03:45:37.160 --> 03:45:38.160]  It's zero, zero.
[03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:39.160]  No one even said it.
[03:45:39.160 --> 03:45:40.160]  No one cared.
[03:45:40.160 --> 03:45:41.160]  No one even changed it at all.
[03:45:41.160 --> 03:45:42.720]  Because they're also delusional on drugs.
[03:45:42.720 --> 03:45:43.720]  Here, here.
[03:45:43.720 --> 03:45:45.960]  Let's, the word is Hillary's totally hopped up on drugs.
[03:45:45.960 --> 03:45:47.960]  Let's go ahead and play the hyena again.
[03:45:47.960 --> 03:46:09.400]  God, she's so fake, she's kind of like younger, a little muppet in the field and sing with
[03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:10.400]  it.
[03:46:10.400 --> 03:46:11.400]  You know, like, oh, hi.
[03:46:11.400 --> 03:46:12.400]  That would be great.
[03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:13.400]  I'm a psychopath.
[03:46:13.400 --> 03:46:14.400]  You don't know it.
[03:46:14.400 --> 03:46:15.400]  No, hi, I'm sweet.
[03:46:15.400 --> 03:46:18.400]  Do you like that?
[03:46:18.400 --> 03:46:19.400]  That would be good.
[03:46:19.400 --> 03:46:20.400]  And have a hyena in there.
[03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:22.400]  It could be a hyena even, actually.
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:24.400]  Well, hyena puppet.
[03:46:24.400 --> 03:46:25.400]  Yeah.
[03:46:25.400 --> 03:46:26.400]  That's a really good joke.
[03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:30.720]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[03:46:30.720 --> 03:46:35.400]  It's me in Yea in Bosnia.
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:36.400]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:37.400]  Thank you for holding patiently.
[03:46:37.400 --> 03:46:38.400]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:46:38.400 --> 03:46:39.400]  It's Nemanja.
[03:46:39.400 --> 03:46:40.400]  But I know it's very difficult to pronounce.
[03:46:40.400 --> 03:46:45.400]  Nemanja?
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:46.400]  Nemanja.
[03:46:46.400 --> 03:46:47.400]  Nemanja.
[03:46:47.400 --> 03:46:48.400]  Nemanja.
[03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:49.400]  Nemanja.
[03:46:49.400 --> 03:46:50.400]  I'm from Texas.
[03:46:50.400 --> 03:46:51.400]  Like, Monchaka is Manchak, okay?
[03:46:51.400 --> 03:46:54.400]  So I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to textify your name.
[03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:58.400]  All right, now I'm going to go ahead.
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:46:59.400]  Thank you very much.
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:00.400]  It's an incredible honor.
[03:47:00.400 --> 03:47:04.400]  I will try to go straight to the point, but I have multiple points, so we'll see how much
[03:47:04.400 --> 03:47:05.400]  time you'll give me.
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:10.240]  First of all, one thing which I have noticed recently is that in the United States and
[03:47:10.240 --> 03:47:16.760]  generally in the West, they could use more and more this narrative of progressive, how
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:21.000]  people should elect progressive for a society to move forward.
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  Cancer is progressive.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:27.160]  Now, this narrative is, yeah, this is straight out of communist playbook.
[03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:31.000]  And I know it's because here, you know, Bosnia, the governor was a part of what we're doing.
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.920]  The third, lean forward is the, like, Karl Marx slogan.
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:34.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:36.760]  No, they, they're using communist nomenclature.
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:37.760]  Go ahead.
[03:47:37.760 --> 03:47:43.280]  Yeah, but what they're doing also, I remember, partially, I remember, and I have books which
[03:47:43.280 --> 03:47:47.600]  have been printed, you know, during the communist era, the official narrative, you know, in
[03:47:47.600 --> 03:47:52.280]  the first years of communism was that the, you know, someone who is in opposition to
[03:47:52.280 --> 03:47:56.560]  the system is a counter-revolutionary, so he should be either acquitted or imprisoned.
[03:47:56.560 --> 03:48:00.960]  But later, it became sort of a trendy, you know, thing or something with what is happening
[03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:03.520]  to you in the West right now.
[03:48:03.520 --> 03:48:10.240]  So the narrative was that communism was progressive, and everyone else is backward, ugly, stupid,
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:13.000]  you know, unworthy of any recognition.
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  So if there is a...
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  Communism is the future.
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:22.360]  It's going to create eternal life in space planes, but it can't even produce a car.
[03:48:22.360 --> 03:48:23.360]  Something like that.
[03:48:23.360 --> 03:48:24.360]  Yeah.
[03:48:24.360 --> 03:48:28.440]  Now, the another thing which I have noticed also, I think that, you know, people in the
[03:48:28.440 --> 03:48:34.360]  West, basically, you were taking for so many decades, democracy for granted, and I think
[03:48:34.360 --> 03:48:39.280]  that many people haven't noticed something that we have noticed here, and that is that
[03:48:39.280 --> 03:48:46.200]  democracy is no longer, you know, taught as a value, you know, in the West.
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:54.040]  It's no longer something which is to be understood as a virtue in its own, it is simply a tool
[03:48:54.040 --> 03:48:58.680]  which is only as useful as it serves its purpose, you know, because this is what...
[03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:02.200]  I agree, but I just want to know why we treat Madeleine Albright a mass murderer like a
[03:49:02.200 --> 03:49:07.400]  rock star when she looks like a bloated maggot in a blue dress.
[03:49:07.400 --> 03:49:12.680]  Great question, because, you know, here, I'm a Thurber from Bosnia, and, you know, we
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:15.520]  hear Thurbs that have really had the chance to see her.
[03:49:15.520 --> 03:49:18.520]  You've already enjoyed the Clintons running a G-Hot on you and giving one-third of your
[03:49:18.520 --> 03:49:19.520]  country to them.
[03:49:19.520 --> 03:49:20.520]  Absolutely.
[03:49:20.520 --> 03:49:26.040]  Yeah, this is exactly what we have felt, and so many people here have been...
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:29.280]  And how do you like those liberal DU bombs on civilian targets?
[03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:30.280]  Very liberal.
[03:49:30.280 --> 03:49:31.280]  The pro...
[03:49:31.280 --> 03:49:38.080]  Yeah, and you see, well, we are not in the European Union, so we haven't seen any, you
[03:49:38.080 --> 03:49:42.480]  know, terrorist attacks here yet, however, they may come very soon.
[03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:46.560]  Tell me, what happened to Serbia, though, when they bombed Belgrade?
[03:49:46.560 --> 03:49:54.320]  Yeah, well, Serbia has been defeated, and, unfortunately, it has been taken over by
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:58.400]  globalist minions who have been in power since the year 2000.
[03:49:58.400 --> 03:50:00.400]  Yeah, and I'm told it's a beautiful country.
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:03.400]  Everybody I talked to says that whole area is as beautiful as it gets.
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:09.040]  It is beautiful, but I want to also bring another idea, you know, because I have heard
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:14.200]  today on your show there were guests, and also you are saying that European leaders
[03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:17.920]  are demons who have sold out to the Muslims, et cetera.
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:23.560]  I think, I mean, if you're interested in my opinion, I think that these European leaders
[03:50:23.560 --> 03:50:29.360]  are simply globalist minions who have an intellectual capacity which is maybe enough
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:30.360]  to run, you know, a building.
[03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:31.360]  No, I agree.
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:33.840]  They hired just fake people to be their front.
[03:50:33.840 --> 03:50:34.840]  That's it.
[03:50:34.840 --> 03:50:35.840]  That's why this show is so powerful.
[03:50:35.840 --> 03:50:38.280]  We're just telling folks what's in the white papers, what's really happening.
[03:50:38.280 --> 03:50:39.280]  We're not that smart.
[03:50:39.280 --> 03:50:43.360]  It's a fair to idiots we are, and we're just showing a real playbook saying, see what
[03:50:43.360 --> 03:50:44.360]  happens.
[03:50:44.360 --> 03:50:47.920]  And once people understand, they go, whoa, really, and again, this whole thing is based
[03:50:47.920 --> 03:50:48.920]  on stealth.
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:52.680]  Anthony Uchiarty is going to take over for the next 10, 15 minutes, and then the next
[03:50:52.680 --> 03:50:55.000]  guest host comes in.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:56.880]  Stations, I encourage you to pick up the show.
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:50:59.920]  Some stations won't get it, infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:05.440]  My name is Don Wiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack, lost 35
[03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:09.240]  percent of my heart to damaged tissue, and was supposed to spend the rest of my life
[03:51:09.240 --> 03:51:10.640]  on disability.
[03:51:10.640 --> 03:51:12.040]  What did I do?
[03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:18.160]  I took Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of 7 herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave
[03:51:18.160 --> 03:51:19.620]  me back my life.
[03:51:19.620 --> 03:51:25.840]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:27.880]  the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.880 --> 03:51:32.760]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:36.520]  I'm 60 years old now, and I still work every day.

[03:51:54.400 --> 03:52:01.880]  Extend your life with Extend-O-Vise.

[03:53:00.240 --> 03:53:04.680]  This is a healthcare alert from the Pain Relief Hotline, if you, a family member or a loved

[03:37:31.220 --> 03:54:25.120]  it's operation sleeping giant, 28-hour broadcast for four hours into it, this is the
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:26.120]  fourth hour.
[03:54:26.120 --> 03:54:28.920]  I'm Anthony Gutiarty, that was a lot of fun with Alex.
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:35.520]  Now to demonstrate the significance of this broadcast, 28 hours, which is actually a lot
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:39.360]  of time, a lot of manpower, think about all of the people making this possible, all of
[03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:42.720]  the people staying here, 28 hours.
[03:54:42.720 --> 03:54:49.400]  Most people are going to stay 24 to 28 hours for this broadcast, but none of that means
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:54.480]  anything without every single person watching right now, sharing the streams, sharing the
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:58.960]  information, helping support the entire operation.
[03:54:58.960 --> 03:55:02.680]  So I want to say hats off to every single person listening, and you actually have to
[03:55:02.680 --> 03:55:05.240]  think about where we are historically.
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:11.960]  Where we are in, if historically this was a mountain, we are reaching the peak.
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:18.480]  Stories are getting so insane that it's time to be 100% unapologetic, it's time to be 100%
[03:55:18.480 --> 03:55:23.920]  brazen, because we get things like these stories that we're going to talk about.
[03:55:23.920 --> 03:55:32.160]  Like the Olympics Committee saying, any non-sponsors are banned from tweeting about the Olympics.
[03:55:32.160 --> 03:55:36.840]  So if you're not a sponsor of the Olympics, you can't even tweet about the Olympics.
[03:55:36.840 --> 03:55:42.320]  You have things like regulators, this just came out today, want to allow more toxic chemicals
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:43.560]  in Florida's water.
[03:55:43.560 --> 03:55:46.120]  So how many times have we beaten back the toxic chemicals?
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:47.680]  They want to allow more toxic chemicals.
[03:55:47.680 --> 03:55:52.440]  They said the state panel will decide whether to declare higher toxin levels in drinking
[03:55:52.440 --> 03:55:53.440]  water.
[03:55:53.440 --> 03:55:57.440]  So just raise the levels, there's more toxic chemicals, it's good for you, it's totally
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:55:58.440]  fine.
[03:55:58.440 --> 03:56:01.920]  And you know, there's been a lot of anti-police stuff that kind of puts us in a position
[03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:06.080]  of saying, you know, look what's going on, but we also have to remember things like this,
[03:56:06.080 --> 03:56:10.560]  Boston police use of cell phone trackers without warrants raises questions and they're using
[03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:12.440]  this across the country.
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:14.480]  So what does that bring us to?
[03:56:14.480 --> 03:56:22.800]  It brings us to a point where they have openly screwed Bernie Sanders out of a nomination,
[03:56:22.800 --> 03:56:25.720]  whether you support him or not, they have.
[03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:31.200]  The anti-establishment message of a lot of people that followed Bernie was completely
[03:56:31.200 --> 03:56:32.400]  just hijacked.
[03:56:32.400 --> 03:56:36.960]  And now it's your force to worship Hillary Clinton, whether you want to or not.
[03:56:36.960 --> 03:56:39.840]  And the Bernie people are banned from the events and everything like that.
[03:56:39.840 --> 03:56:41.320]  It's total insanity.
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:42.320]  So what do we do?
[03:56:42.320 --> 03:56:47.200]  Instead of apologizing and sitting up here and being afraid and cowering in fear, we
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:51.480]  unapologetically stand boldly against it.
[03:56:51.480 --> 03:56:56.960]  And all of this insanity, that is Operation Sleeping Giants time to awaken the giant,
[03:56:56.960 --> 03:57:02.240]  not be crushed by the political fake, political correctness, the ideology, prison that we
[03:57:02.240 --> 03:57:03.760]  let ourselves sit into.
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:07.560]  So that's why I'm unapologetically enthused about this.
[03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:09.760]  And so is everyone else here right now.
[03:57:09.760 --> 03:57:10.960]  And I'm honored to be a part of it.
[03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:12.840]  And thank you for being a part of it.
