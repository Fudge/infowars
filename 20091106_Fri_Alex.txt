[00:58.600 --> 01:07.800]  inconsistent very suspicious news coverage on the massacre at ford hood texas just about

[01:57.000 --> 02:05.400]  sorts of chicanery coming out of ford hood it's geographically six times bigger than
[02:05.400 --> 02:14.080]  dallas texas it's the main base is 340 square miles but then there's a bunch of other spur
[02:14.080 --> 02:21.640]  bases off of it i mean it's just deep in the heart of texas obviously our prayers go out
[02:21.640 --> 02:30.840]  to the 12 dead 31 wounded i wonder if they'll call for gun bans on base ban the military
[02:30.840 --> 02:37.240]  from owning guns i mean that's the answer for the citizens this guy was a psychiatrist

[02:41.880 --> 02:49.920]  shooters shooting people it's always the same with colin bine and 77 all these events it
[02:49.920 --> 02:56.520]  has the same mo we know colin bine was staged we know 77 was staged we know 1993 was staged
[02:56.520 --> 03:01.920]  that's even been in the new york times i don't know if this was staged this guy's a psychiatrist
[03:01.920 --> 03:06.440]  they have the highest level of any profession of suicide they have the highest level of
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.720]  any profession of being committed these are people that think all of the public has a
[03:11.720 --> 03:20.200]  chemical imbalance and needs to be on ridland and prozac i will bet all the tea in india
[03:20.200 --> 03:26.520]  that this guy was self medicating as a psychiatrist he wasn't just a psychologist he had a medical
[03:26.520 --> 03:37.920]  degree in quackery okay and no i'm not saying there isn't some true information in psychiatry
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.520]  and psychology it's just that the different schools and the the way the government brings
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.920]  it forward it's become a tool of oppression and it's just it is a fake science to tell

[09:49.120 --> 09:57.160]  know a lot of you've been watching the news and you've seen all the conflicting reports
[09:57.160 --> 10:03.960]  i don't think i've ever seen a mass shooting story that's had this many conflicting reports
[10:03.960 --> 10:10.400]  except for columbine and i've done a lot of deep research on columbine and we were not
[10:10.400 --> 10:15.680]  told the truth about what happened there they smuggled over one hundred and twenty bombs
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.400]  according to cbs news into the building the school was more than half empty that day with
[10:20.400 --> 10:25.520]  the word to not go to school floating around because there was going to be a shooting the
[10:25.520 --> 10:32.840]  next day there was the principal and sheriff were meeting for lunch when all of this went
[10:32.840 --> 10:39.080]  on at a subway sandwich shop down the street most of the witnesses reported men in black
[10:39.080 --> 10:47.520]  uniforms and mask shooting people at least four shooters not to harrison clibald made
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.880]  a video about how they were going to kill everybody they worked with the school and
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.440]  the video production department their parents were both involved in secret above top secret
[10:57.440 --> 11:07.880]  black programs with nasa and the pentagon both harrison clibald were on serotonin
[11:07.880 --> 11:13.880]  reuptake inhibitors and it was confirmed that's what that a swat team shot at least
[11:13.880 --> 11:19.960]  two students that was in the rocky mountain daily news that was confirmed in police recordings
[11:19.960 --> 11:25.520]  that were sealed by the court and it just goes on and on but it's like nine eleven
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.800]  we know the official story is not true that's been proven but we don't know exactly what
[11:30.800 --> 11:37.840]  happened that's the problem with an investigation you know when you're being lied to you just
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.400]  don't know what happened now i will say this about what happened in fort hood number one
[11:44.400 --> 11:52.880]  the media is hyping this like it is the greatest event in modern times though i pulled up some
[11:52.880 --> 11:59.160]  of the numbers there have been scores of mass shootings and other bases there was one killing
[11:59.160 --> 12:05.160]  more than eight people a few years ago at fort bragg a bunch of other events and normally
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.280]  when you have a mass shooting and it's really someone with combat stress post traumatic stress
[12:10.280 --> 12:15.920]  disorder or a lot of the troops came back and shot up their families or their commanders
[12:15.920 --> 12:22.040]  or their subordinates because they were on in the last six seven years this experimental
[12:22.040 --> 12:31.760]  anti anti malaria drug which was not approved but the pentagon used it and then now they've
[12:31.760 --> 12:36.440]  had to pull it off the market and not give it to the military because it causes psychotic
[12:36.440 --> 12:48.480]  breaks remember we had a documentary filmmaker on but joe bellinger and he was down in south
[12:48.480 --> 12:54.200]  america doing shoots 24 times and he said that he took that same anti viral drug and
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.520]  basically had an apocalypse now moment like martin sheen does where he literally was having
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.040]  a psychotic break in his hotel room so a lot of these mass shootings were caused by that
[13:05.040 --> 13:12.880]  drug alone clearly i've talked to people that have been on it they say it is just like a
[13:12.880 --> 13:19.200]  bad acid trip or something it is just horrible and you give this to the delta force these
[13:19.200 --> 13:25.400]  highly trained people they're going to go crazy you know they come home from combat
[13:25.400 --> 13:32.280]  their wife screaming at them and they just kill them so that's going on he was about
[13:32.280 --> 13:38.400]  to be sent to iraq i've read they don't put people in iraq on anti malaria drugs they
[13:38.400 --> 13:44.600]  do in afghanistan so i don't know i mean there's just too many factors too many pieces of
[13:44.600 --> 13:51.240]  the puzzle at this point for for myself to be able to come on air and tell you concisely
[13:51.240 --> 13:57.080]  that i know what's going on i don't okay i don't just sit here and make up conspiracy
[13:57.080 --> 14:06.200]  theories for no reason this guy could have been just a lunatic psychiatrist they are
[14:06.200 --> 14:12.840]  the number one profession to be committed they are the number one profession the highest
[14:12.840 --> 14:22.040]  level of suicide of any profession of any professional field they of course are the
[14:22.040 --> 14:29.600]  number one medicated group doctors and medical workers number one are the number one group
[14:29.600 --> 14:34.320]  according to the justice department and other statistics that are out there to abuse drugs
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.040]  because they have access to it and then of that group psychiatrists and psychologists
[14:40.040 --> 14:45.320]  are at the top of the chart i mean they are at the tip top of the capstone of using their
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.720]  own poison that they dole out to children and women and people that have car wrecks
[14:50.720 --> 14:55.600]  oh you're depressed because you broke your collarbone and arm and smashed your face in
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.520]  here we'll put you on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor we won't tell you that the drug
[15:00.520 --> 15:07.680]  insert says it causes psychotic breaks and mass murder and delusions of grandeur or extreme
[15:07.680 --> 15:16.000]  depression and then now they have prozac type drugs for prozac type drugs they they stack
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.720]  them they advertise that oh you're getting depressed or wanting to kill your children
[15:21.720 --> 15:29.640]  on prozac or on lou vox or any of these other hundred plus drugs oh well we have these other
[15:29.640 --> 15:37.600]  drugs that go on top of that but nowhere i did a lot of web searching this morning maybe
[15:37.600 --> 15:41.320]  curtain demo or paul watson can find it or steve watson can if that's the case or erin
[15:41.320 --> 15:48.280]  dykes as they listen right now but perhaps listeners can email in to show tips at info
[15:48.280 --> 15:55.200]  wars dot com right now you know the power of the group out there is amazing when it
[15:55.200 --> 16:02.160]  comes to research but is anyone discussing whether or not this guy was on serotonin
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.880]  reuptake inhibitors or other anti psychotics because that's what these are there they're
[16:07.880 --> 16:13.760]  in the hallucinogen family the psychotropic family which is in the overall anti psychotic
[16:13.760 --> 16:21.120]  family and they actually make you go psychotic in many cases 99% of the mass shootings are
[16:21.120 --> 16:25.840]  women drowning their babies in bathtubs or driving cars off cliffs with their children
[16:25.840 --> 16:32.640]  in them or chopping their children's hands off or splitting their throats are on prozac
[16:32.640 --> 16:38.440]  family of drugs so he's a psychiatrist they say he'd been having mental problems had been
[16:38.440 --> 16:46.000]  written up was trying to get out of the military i would say there is more than a 99% chance
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.720]  i would be surprised if it didn't come out that this guy was a complete fruit loop now
[16:53.720 --> 16:58.160]  we still have to ask ourselves why were we hearing about two other shooters why were
[16:58.160 --> 17:12.080]  we hearing that this deranged individual was
[17:12.080 --> 17:20.600]  why were we hearing that this deranged individual was dead for four hours from the time that
[17:20.600 --> 17:28.520]  the story broke why were we hearing that Nadal Hassan was dead until at least four hours
[17:28.520 --> 17:39.520]  after let me see it 130 central it broke and then it wasn't till 730 that the AP reported
[17:39.520 --> 17:50.080]  that and it came over my iPhone so that's more than four hours that is six hours so
[17:50.080 --> 17:56.120]  they didn't report for six hours that he was alive and then they said they have these
[17:56.120 --> 18:01.840]  other people in custody and witnesses reported multiple shooters or were people panicking
[18:01.840 --> 18:09.080]  and seeing military people that somehow got to firearms in their own vehicles or had firearms
[18:09.080 --> 18:15.120]  and that's how we're getting these reports we don't know right now and the military
[18:15.120 --> 18:22.160]  lies so much the military brass lie more often they tell the truth so frankly we may never
[18:22.160 --> 18:31.040]  know but he is a psychiatrist he had been having problems and had been written up and
[18:31.040 --> 18:37.480]  was trying to get out of the military and so I don't know I don't know we'll get your
[18:37.480 --> 18:46.640]  take on it after we come back from this quick break we'll talk to skip and Steve and Paul
[18:46.640 --> 18:56.000]  and Mike and Connie and others toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 I do have

[24:29.240 --> 24:34.000]  live thanks for joining us today let's let's go to your phone calls and get your take your
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.480]  response to everything that's happening the dollar continuing to plunge gold continuing
[24:38.480 --> 24:43.440]  to rise unemployment at record levels the government's telling us the economy's wonderful
[24:43.440 --> 24:51.000]  that more NAFTA more get expansion is going to be great globalization is good you've got
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.840]  this spooky shooting going on at Fort Hood this guy just looks like a complete lunatic
[24:55.840 --> 25:03.360]  when I look at his photo will this be used to crack down and set up a bigger police state
[25:03.360 --> 25:11.120]  no doubt of that let's talk to skip in california skip you're on the air go ahead hey first
[25:11.120 --> 25:17.200]  I want to say half off to you for fall the republic it's definitely your best work and
[25:17.200 --> 25:22.400]  that's a pretty bold statement considering what you've done already well thank you sure
[25:22.400 --> 25:28.200]  um the other day you actually had a suggestion and I think you just threw it out there and
[25:28.200 --> 25:34.320]  then went on to other things but I think you should really kind of rethink that idea and
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.360]  what the idea was is you said you could probably make a write a book about a you know a hundred
[25:39.360 --> 25:48.520]  of the key techniques that the elite use against the public I think if you were to actually
[25:48.520 --> 25:56.720]  make a DVD where you take you know the best tricks that the media uses to pull the wool
[25:56.720 --> 26:02.000]  over everybody's eyes you kind of put it out there I think what would happen is you know
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.080]  your viewers and anyone else that sees it would really be able to identify those techniques
[26:08.080 --> 26:13.720]  every time they feed in the media it kind of I don't know maybe intensify everyone's
[26:13.720 --> 26:18.960]  ability to know absolutely I mean for more than a decade I've wanted to make documentaries
[26:18.960 --> 26:24.240]  about media manipulation because a lot of people recognize certain basic forms of it
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.960]  one simple form is divide and conquer but then there's hundreds of subgroups of that
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.920]  I mean when the media comes out and you say as a citizen hey I don't want a trillion one
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.600]  hundred billion dollar government takeover of health care I don't want the government
[26:40.600 --> 26:45.200]  in my life the government's too big they say oh you don't like black people and you're
[26:45.200 --> 26:51.280]  like what does that have to do with anything oh you're a racist oh the tea party people
[26:51.280 --> 26:58.200]  were there protesting yesterday Keith Oberman and slime ball Chris Matthews all of them
[26:58.200 --> 27:04.160]  yesterday the same talking point said this is racism they are injecting racism they are
[27:04.160 --> 27:09.920]  just putting it where there is no racism involved no one was thinking about race it has nothing
[27:09.920 --> 27:16.400]  to do with it on its face and it's just meant to distract and divert that's just one example
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.800]  and when I say there's a hundred we'd have to limit it to a hundred there's several hundred
[27:21.800 --> 27:26.400]  tricks they use and I've just learned to spot them all and they think it's funny it's like
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.400]  I said over a month ago I said they're gonna have artificial scarcity they're gonna come
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.880]  out and claim that there's not enough of the vaccine advertise where it's available and
[27:34.880 --> 27:40.080]  then have big lines of people show up because they know that a lot of people don't want
[27:40.080 --> 27:44.640]  it over seventy percent they know they can't sell it so if they create the illusion that
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.760]  people want it people will stampede to get it then it comes out in CFR meetings with
[27:48.760 --> 27:55.520]  top health officials then bragging how they want to do this so again I'm not a genius
[27:55.520 --> 28:01.520]  I've just learned their tricks and it's very hard to watch television or to read the newspaper
[28:01.520 --> 28:09.120]  knowing these people's tricks because it's so obvious once you know the tricks it's
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.640]  enraging to see this and you just get sick of it I appreciate your call skip let's talk
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.520]  to Steve in Texas Steve you're on the air go ahead yeah good morning Alex hey before
[28:20.520 --> 28:26.120]  I get my take on what happened yesterday at Fort Hood I just want to let you know I'm a
[28:26.120 --> 28:32.480]  member with the campaign for Liberty and I got an email from them earlier this week about
[28:32.480 --> 28:38.000]  the amendment that Ron Paul talked about on your show yesterday for the HR 1207 and it
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.240]  gave the names of the 13 Democrats who have sat there on board with this bill that he's
[28:44.240 --> 28:49.680]  pushing and so I called every one of them and they also gave the numbers for Pelosi
[28:49.680 --> 28:54.720]  and Bernie Frank as well and in the process of calling every one of them and encouraging
[28:54.720 --> 29:01.360]  the 13 members to support this and Pelosi and Frank as well with as far as you know telling
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.520]  them to have an open vote on this I also said to each one of them and made a point to tell
[29:05.520 --> 29:12.200]  each one to go to info wars dot com and get a copy of follow the republic and watch that
[29:12.200 --> 29:16.800]  to get educated so I'm just trying to do whatever I can to get the word out thank you what's
[29:16.800 --> 29:22.360]  your view on the massacre okay what you had said that was one of my first thoughts was
[29:22.360 --> 29:28.520]  I wonder which psychotropic medication this guy was on and here's my bottom line take
[29:28.520 --> 29:33.120]  on this you know you brought this out the Pentagon controls the media you got North
[29:33.120 --> 29:39.600]  com and the NSA and FEMA and all these black pop of propaganda groups I believe this was

[33:02.320 --> 33:13.600]  lies and disinformation it's alex jones only on the gcm radio network if you study criminology
[33:14.480 --> 33:27.440]  a good investigator generally has been involved in investigations for decades
[33:27.440 --> 33:36.320]  because you have to have a wide knowledge of the criminal mind and you have to have a wide
[33:36.320 --> 33:38.720]  knowledge of subtypes of criminal
[33:42.240 --> 33:47.600]  criminal types and then criminal groups and how those criminal groups have operated in the past
[33:48.240 --> 33:53.760]  because if criminals are one thing if psychopaths are one thing if control freaks and scam artists
[33:53.760 --> 34:03.200]  are one thing they are repetitive they are compulsive they do the same types of things over
[34:03.200 --> 34:12.560]  and over again they have signatures and i will tell you that i didn't start the show saying this
[34:12.560 --> 34:21.760]  guy could be mind controlled but the minute it came out yesterday that he was a army psychiatrist
[34:21.760 --> 34:29.120]  and an officer alarm bells went off everywhere and then right down the line alarm bells have gone off
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  but it could be because more often than not it is that he was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[34:38.000 --> 34:43.200]  and i will say it again the drug inserts of all those drugs by law we recall conspiracy theorist
[34:44.400 --> 34:49.360]  10 15 20 years ago when medical doctors came out and pointed out that elia lily's
[34:49.360 --> 34:58.400]  trials in 1981 of prozac caused massive increases in suicide and violent actions including murder
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.400]  and then due to lawsuits and that coming out in the last decade what four years ago they started
[35:04.400 --> 35:10.560]  by law first in england then in europe now in the u.s what was six years ago in england in europe
[35:10.560 --> 35:17.360]  and then four years ago in the u.s by law the drug insert says this can make you become psychopathic
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.880]  kill yourself kill others delusions of grandeur's mania i mean the list goes on and on go read it
[35:22.880 --> 35:29.360]  for yourself you can go to prozac's own website and click on the drug insert page and read it for
[35:29.360 --> 35:35.040]  yourself i mean don't believe me but pretty much everybody knows that these drugs aren't
[35:35.680 --> 35:42.000]  aren't associated with they are wedded to mass murder mass shootings killings people killing
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.520]  their children i mean women in the history of the world never chopped their two-year-olds
[35:47.520 --> 35:54.480]  arms and legs off i mean that was just unheard of now it's a routine occurrence because this stuff
[35:54.480 --> 36:06.400]  puts them into another dimension psychologically another planet so it could be that he could
[36:06.400 --> 36:13.440]  be a muslim extremists they do exist there are muslim nutballs just like there's christian
[36:13.440 --> 36:19.040]  nutballs that go out just like there's hindu nutballs who do go out and shoot and kill people
[36:19.040 --> 36:28.480]  there there is such a thing as real terrorism but none of the facts fit that and then you have
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.240]  all the conflicting stories by the media and the fact that they didn't announce for six hours six
[36:34.240 --> 36:41.040]  plus hours that he was still alive and they said he was dead on and on and on and they haven't released
[36:41.040 --> 36:47.120]  his file they're saying he was in trouble and trying to get out and it had been in counseling
[36:48.160 --> 36:56.160]  99 chance he was on drugs i'm going to go back to steve paul mike connie nick in a moment but
[36:56.160 --> 37:01.600]  but steve brought up mind control and i'm not going to discuss mind control here on this show
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.480]  unless i give you a little bit of background but in the interest of time to be able to take your calls
[37:08.320 --> 37:15.840]  perhaps we should set up in the next few weeks a two or three hours group of guests on the radio
[37:15.840 --> 37:23.520]  medical doctors and historians on the declassified history of mind control not just in the u.s but
[37:23.520 --> 37:30.640]  in russia china england and many other nations you know hollywood has this image of the manchurian
[37:30.640 --> 37:37.760]  candidate and you know popular remake came out a few years ago you need to understand that that
[37:37.760 --> 37:48.080]  original film was based on real programs and in 1976 and 77 mk ultra mk Naomi and a whole other
[37:48.080 --> 37:57.520]  group of programs were declassified to a certain extent just the basics of the program programs
[37:57.520 --> 38:09.680]  were released and almost all of it was blacked out but this fits it's always an army officer
[38:11.520 --> 38:19.200]  look at the beltway sniper about to be executed the army lived on army bases witnesses saw white
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.760]  men in white van shooting people over and over again but these guys get caught turns out both of
[38:23.760 --> 38:31.360]  them have been under psychiatric care that is a 95 chance that was staged and if we went over
[38:31.360 --> 38:35.040]  that evidence see we there's a lot of sites and articles have been written about it and make your
[38:35.040 --> 38:41.200]  head spin and it's time and time again in these mind control programs the strongest evidence
[38:42.160 --> 38:50.560]  that we can just quickly cover here is timothy mcvay he's highly decorated in gulf war one
[38:50.560 --> 38:57.280]  and he clearly gets sheep dipped that's come out in federal documents he goes out of the army
[38:57.280 --> 39:09.120]  into black ops he ends up traveling all over the united states interfacing with militias
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.840]  interfacing with gun shows interfacing with white supremacists interfacing with the branch
[39:13.840 --> 39:21.600]  devideans all these different groups to try to create a history so that when he was set up as a
[39:21.600 --> 39:30.800]  patsy later they could connect him to all these groups for political demonization
[39:30.800 --> 39:47.680]  and the state police an hour plus after the okc bombing on april 19th 1995 the state police see a
[39:47.680 --> 40:01.440]  large uh junker big yellow junker car driving erratically mcvay pulls over starts crawling
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.080]  around on the ground saying it hurts it hurts tell him to stop i got a chip he's foaming at
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.600]  the mouth throwing up obviously drugged out of his gourd is what the state police said in the
[40:11.600 --> 40:17.120]  report because they're not part of the conspiracy and he's got a gun on the dashboard and he's
[40:17.120 --> 40:25.440]  saying get it out get it out i got a chip in my butt chip in my hip they grabbing the feds taking
[40:27.120 --> 40:35.200]  meanwhile the feds order state police in north carolina to release the iraqi republican guard
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.680]  members who had later came out were cia they ordered them to release them even though they
[40:39.680 --> 40:46.320]  were trying to get on a plane with box cutters wire blue jumpsuits they're ordered to be released
[40:46.320 --> 40:55.360]  international security then it comes out that the adl affiliated southern poverty law center
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.280]  that the southern poverty law center was running elaheem city where mcvay was based out of this
[41:01.280 --> 41:05.840]  white supremacist compound that came out in fbi documents in lawsuits that the feds were ordered
[41:05.840 --> 41:15.680]  to release two years ago all of that's going on and then mcvay is taken to denver colorado and the
[41:15.680 --> 41:23.440]  entire time guess who his government appointed psychiatrist is who stays with him five days
[41:23.440 --> 41:31.840]  a week he's not allowed to talk to the media guess who mcvay's court appointed psychiatrist is it's
[41:31.840 --> 41:39.600]  jolly in west who was the us head of mk ultra with dr ewing cameron i mean this is declassified
[41:39.600 --> 41:48.320]  they have the king the mac daddy of mind control somebody who took foster children along with
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.040]  dr ewing cameron i mean they have history channel specials about this and would reprogram
[41:53.040 --> 41:59.760]  children and women and men to where they had a totally new identity and didn't know who they were
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.560]  and he could snap his fingers and give him orders and they would bark like a dog they would shift
[42:04.560 --> 42:11.600]  into different personalities they did it with pcp lsd shock therapy peyote uh six months in
[42:12.240 --> 42:18.160]  isolation tanks 10 minutes will drive most people crazy in the salt isolation tanks the
[42:18.160 --> 42:23.120]  temperature of the womb that makes the brain completely freak out on hallucinogens with
[42:23.120 --> 42:30.640]  earphones on giving them commands for six months at a time i mean total mind control slave guaranteed
[42:30.640 --> 42:40.320]  declassified that they can make a total manchurian candidate now the head of this program becomes
[42:40.320 --> 42:46.880]  mcvay's doctor and is there with him many years later when he's executed in terra hood indiana
[42:46.880 --> 42:54.400]  at the federal execution center by the way west died two years ago died a few years after that
[42:54.400 --> 43:02.320]  after the execution so the government thinks you're so stupid that they have the modern
[43:02.320 --> 43:10.080]  father of a total mind control system he was the twin head of it with ewing cameron
[43:10.960 --> 43:21.200]  dr ewing cameron jolly and west is the doctor of tim mcvay you cannot make that type of stuff up
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.880]  no one would believe a hollywood script like that because people would say the government wouldn't
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.640]  put the head of mind control over mcvay that's how stupid they think we are so yes there is
[43:30.640 --> 43:37.600]  mind control and this guy's a psychiatrist this guy's at ford hood which is a major mind control
[43:37.600 --> 43:41.600]  facility i'd have to say it's the biggest in the country and we've listed it as the real
[43:42.480 --> 43:49.120]  black ops command center next to the globalist love multiple bases but it's a twin base with
[43:49.120 --> 43:55.760]  colorado springs probably more important they've got underground nuke bases under the mountains
[43:55.760 --> 44:06.320]  underground railways they got it all i mean this is black ops central or he may just be a prozac
[44:06.320 --> 44:18.960]  had he went crazy very small chance that he is a quote muslim extremist and and did it for these
[44:18.960 --> 44:28.080]  reasons but notice he told people this we're being told and i could go on and on and on and on with
[44:28.080 --> 44:34.400]  mind control but it's a conspiracy theory because people haven't looked at the facts just like
[44:34.400 --> 44:37.840]  Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 it was in the
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.560]  major newspapers in southern california especially san diego that officers came back from the ships
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.280]  and said this was very immoral our ships were not attacked this was staged but see people then
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.600]  read the article told their friends about it and decades later it was just a conspiracy theory no it
[44:55.600 --> 45:01.520]  was admitted and then four years ago they declassified okay it's true we staged it to get into the war
[45:01.520 --> 45:06.800]  well it's the same thing with me saying oh jolly and west the head of mind control was mcvay's doctor
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.200]  you're not going to go look up the facts you're going to tell your neighbor about it they're
[45:11.200 --> 45:16.400]  going to laugh and say oh that alex jones oh that alex jones he says there was a government plan
[45:16.400 --> 45:21.920]  to fly jets into buildings in bomb dc and commit terror attacks called operation northwoods no i
[45:21.920 --> 45:29.520]  didn't say that it's declassified abc news baltimore sun associated press look i wish this
[45:29.520 --> 45:36.320]  stuff wasn't true every day okay think about doing this every day i am sick of it but i i'm not delusional
[45:36.320 --> 45:42.880]  i can't just not want to believe something so then i just wipe the slate clean and forget about it
[45:42.880 --> 45:47.280]  and going about my business like this isn't true so i don't know what happened at ford hood but
[45:47.280 --> 45:53.120]  i'll tell you this it stinks to high heaven it's got every indicator but the problem is a lot of
[45:53.120 --> 46:00.880]  the indicators mirror other scenarios but having the media hype at the way they are that's kind
[46:00.880 --> 46:07.680]  of the cherry on top it could be mind control he could be on prozac he'll be on that regardless if
[46:07.680 --> 46:11.680]  he's on mind control or not that's part of it you know the public's under mind control that's what
[46:11.680 --> 46:17.840]  the prozac does it puts you into a dream state do a highly suggestible hypnotized state it's like a
[46:17.840 --> 46:24.000]  truth serum it's a programming serum and 20 of the public and growing is on it that's why you can't
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.880]  talk to him because it's designed to put you under their total control when you watch the hypnotic
[46:28.880 --> 46:34.480]  television set i mean for heaven's sakes ladies and gentlemen they figured out how to control
[46:34.480 --> 46:39.680]  populations all right i said i go back to your calls steve you're bringing up mind control i thought
[46:39.680 --> 46:44.160]  i'd do a bit of a treatise on that now make your comment go ahead yeah i appreciate you bringing
[46:44.160 --> 46:48.960]  that up i'll see i just wanted to say i heard you know before i get back to finish in this point
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.640]  up i had heard that the same doctor you were talking about there was a sign of mcvay was also
[46:52.640 --> 46:58.880]  assigned to surhan surhan yes he was yeah so and people need really need to get educated on this
[46:58.880 --> 47:04.560]  stuff they have no understanding of how the you know the government corporate media controlled
[47:04.560 --> 47:10.080]  you know deal works but and controlling people in part of them but i the reason i say i believe
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.560]  this is a false flagged error attack and i believe your intel is going to bring us out he has all
[47:14.560 --> 47:19.920]  the classic signs but here's one of the main ones do you remember what they are now saying this guy
[47:19.920 --> 47:28.320]  was yelling before he committed this act a la akbar okay and you brought this out real muslims when
[47:28.320 --> 47:32.720]  they're going to commit an act like this they don't say a la akbar and i can't remember it was a la
[47:32.720 --> 47:39.200]  but it's something after that it's not akbar that they say they say operative say i mean i mean to
[47:39.200 --> 47:43.120]  paraphrase it they say and this what they're supposed to say under their religious law
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.240]  and i and i can pull up the actual quote and because some of the real hijackings and attacks
[47:48.240 --> 47:56.400]  they actually say this they say uh basically a la is god and his prophet is muhammad right
[47:57.200 --> 48:02.240]  you know and and i have to ask why did the base commander report that this guy was dead
[48:02.240 --> 48:10.080]  and also that it was not base police that killed him but it was civilian well that's
[48:10.080 --> 48:14.080]  that's the really that's the really good news here but the problem is they've been caught lying
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.560]  or putting out this information on so many fronts that this would be another lie remember
[48:19.440 --> 48:27.040]  remember the young lady who they said in iraq killed all the iraqi troops and then it turned
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.200]  out that she hid in fear and it was all just a pr campaign to get women to join the military
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.680]  right and then they killed a bunch of the people in her unit when they came back because they were
[48:35.680 --> 48:40.880]  speaking out right right and the pentagon clearly killed them just to keep their story going just
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.960]  like they killed uh pat tilman and that's clearly in the record for anybody that looks at it and his
[48:46.960 --> 48:55.120]  family knows that uh but the they're saying a civilian police officer contractor on base a
[48:55.120 --> 49:02.000]  kimberley uh munley uh got shot herself and shot him four times the other officer wither
[49:03.040 --> 49:08.160]  was firing as well uh and i'm not seeing women aren't great shots and can't defend themselves
[49:08.160 --> 49:15.520]  and can't make good police officers it's just the pentagon has a fetish with with with lying
[49:15.520 --> 49:21.360]  about women engaged in heroics as part of their military recruiting drive for women they want
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.440]  a draft of women that's been admitted they've introduced the legislation uh but they're saying
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.880]  that she heroically acted and acted very very quickly here's a quote really a pretty amazing
[49:30.880 --> 49:36.400]  aggressive performance by this police officer and if it's true great job to her i mean i mean it was
[49:36.400 --> 49:46.480]  a uh it was a female security guard at one of these churches uh who was packing heat when this
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.600]  nut went into that big church in colorado and started trying to shoot people and she killed
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.960]  him within seconds so he only killed a couple people so yeah it's great i want women with more
[49:56.960 --> 50:02.400]  guns and uh you know normally the police when the feds are in control like blacksburg and other
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.600]  places they order them to stand down for hours so the shooter can do their business and the
[50:07.600 --> 50:12.480]  you know the men all put on 14 layers of body armor and strut around and don't know how to lace
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.840]  up their helmets and boots instead of just charging in and killing the person that's doing it i mean
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.480]  i'm not a macho person but somebody's running around with a gun killing people i mean i couldn't
[50:22.480 --> 50:28.560]  control myself i would grab a firearm and immediately you know charge in uh probably
[50:29.360 --> 50:35.200]  without even having tactics because i don't know that's just how i'm wired i mean i'm not looking
[50:35.200 --> 50:39.600]  for a fight but as soon as one starts i can't control myself i mean i'm ready i mean once it
[50:39.600 --> 50:45.840]  starts happening i like it and i don't know how they've castrated the men in this country uh to
[50:45.840 --> 50:51.040]  just turn them into complete cowards but hey this this woman's obviously not a coward maybe the men
[50:51.040 --> 50:56.080]  can learn from her in future shooting situations and i said she killed him i'm going with the old
[50:56.080 --> 51:02.240]  story she she wounded him with four shots we'll be right back studies have shown that many people

[54:18.720 --> 54:25.280]  false flag event but you also have a lot of people losing their jobs under incredible stress
[54:25.280 --> 54:32.240]  you've got veterans who serve two three four tours that are completely mind blown
[54:34.400 --> 54:39.120]  who are out there every time there's a mass shooting there are copycat shootings because
[54:39.120 --> 54:43.760]  it introduces the idea into people's minds this is how you're supposed to respond to stress
[54:45.440 --> 54:51.280]  shootings in Orlando office building Orlando police have responded to a possible shooting
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.880]  in an office building in downtown Orlando and as of about two minutes ago they're reporting
[54:56.880 --> 55:05.120]  that there are people down in fact that's the latest news that it's eight people down or eight
[55:05.120 --> 55:15.120]  people dead eight people shut so we'll continue to watch this and see now people aren't worried
[55:15.120 --> 55:20.000]  about the government healthcare bill that's about to pass they're not worried about an expansion of
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.720]  foreign banking power or the global carbon tax that's on the verge of passing they're not worried
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.400]  about the dollar plunging and gold going above one thousand one hundred dollars one thousand one
[55:30.400 --> 55:37.360]  hundred and two and surging to an all-time mega record people aren't concerned about that now
[55:38.160 --> 55:45.120]  no the mass shootings have begun and how many times did i say this year how many times i i need
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.800]  to just get more staff just so we have somebody who marks down my predictions and so we record them
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.200]  so we have them listeners always find them on youtube and in archives and post them but
[55:55.200 --> 56:00.880]  how many times did i say in january they're going to have a staged flu hype and a mass shooting
[56:00.880 --> 56:08.960]  a string of mass shootings around the country using muslims i said in the cards with the
[56:08.960 --> 56:14.480]  preparatory brainwashing that i've seen the media and on the television shows and in the dramas
[56:14.480 --> 56:19.760]  both fiction and nonfiction they're getting us ready to have tsa like security on the streets
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.680]  of america and the malls on the highways they want to put north com on the streets they're doing it
[56:25.680 --> 56:34.320]  incrementally and if this continues and if the mo is similar to ford hood we are now entering
[56:35.280 --> 56:41.680]  as we get more information an area where this is looking really suspicious and i'm not the only one
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.240]  that said this rush limbaugh for years have pointed out why every time they're trying to pass anti-gun
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.760]  bills or they're suddenly mass shootings and all of these things are suspicious i mean somebody
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.160]  shooting his wife or shooting their neighbors or shooting their bosses one thing but when people
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.120]  just start running around blasting scores of people and they're always on prozac they're always
[57:01.120 --> 57:08.880]  blacksburg it doesn't matter always on it kip kinkle harris clibald the indian reservation
[57:08.880 --> 57:14.880]  shootings i mean it's i i have only found maybe one or two cases where they weren't on these drugs
[57:14.880 --> 57:25.200]  and then their medical records are sealed so shootings in orlando office building
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.480]  this is what's being reported with quick and loans and father they're on commercial right now i was
[57:34.480 --> 57:40.080]  just going to pop in for a second show people what what what's seeing and saying but they really
[57:40.080 --> 57:46.320]  they really have nothing to report and all this is a distraction but but we are forced to cover it
[57:46.320 --> 57:52.720]  instead of the complete world government takeover the record unemployment all these other big
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.960]  issues that are happening okay i'm going to go to break we're going to come back and then just
[57:56.960 --> 58:00.720]  callers i know you got a lot of points to make but i tend to then have long-winded answers i want
[58:00.720 --> 58:07.760]  to get more people on air paul mike connie nicky kevin just have your your your comments ready just
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.360]  make them i'm going to the next person and then we'll get into all the economic news and all the

[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:32.640]  when you have a government with a strong documented history of mind control namely mass
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:42.080]  shooters and lone gunman you are forced to look at it but then you have a second tier of mind control
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:48.720]  right at 20 of the population on psychotropic drugs in the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:54.240]  that they admit in the drug inserts can cause psychotic breaks and mass killing and is intimately
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:01:04.160]  wed to almost all the major mass shootings that's another form of mind control that we see
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:10.560]  or this individual could just be another nutty psychiatrist how many times they've been caught
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:14.560]  raping their patients how many times they've been caught killing their families why do they have the
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:19.680]  highest suicide rate why do they have one of the highest mass shooting rates this is a very
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:26.320]  disgusting guild of people on average and that could be the case or he could be a muslim crazy
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:32.640]  we don't know but now there's been another mass shooting starting in orlando florida
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:37.120]  an office building we'll give you more on this as it develops let's talk to paul and
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:43.920]  origan paul you're on the air thanks for having me you bet uh i wouldn't be surprised if we see
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:50.640]  uh three or four more mass shootings or something similar to the the dc sniper uh you have been
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:55.600]  telling us for a while now that we are going to be making that switch in the next month or so to
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:01.520]  to the the world government or or the banking regulations they're not going to be covering
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:06.080]  that if let me ask you this because i wish i had the clips ready how many times in the last six
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.480]  eight months have i said they're going to stage mass shootings and if you see a whole bunch of them
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.760]  together you know it's staged especially if they're military or involved in psychiatry i mean
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:22.240]  that's exactly what i say and then what do you see happening it doesn't look good you said it several
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:29.040]  times i also wanted to make a point uh we were talking about mind control um i don't know if you've
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:33.840]  seen these they're getting these the kids ready nowadays for this stuff you know to be plugged
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:38.640]  into the functional mri's and things like that there's a toy on the market called the mind flex
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:44.560]  have you seen that yes they've got a bunch of games where children hook into wires and interface
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:51.680]  their brain and brain scannings wonderful and spy toys to spy on your parents and lots of the
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:57.680]  playmobil and and and lego toys are all about checkpoints and searching people and police dogs
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:04.320]  and and and most the new toy soldiers say you in on the sides of the vehicle usa has been removed
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:13.040]  it's bad and it's conditioning right yes they're just conditioning us i also wanted to make a
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:18.960]  point that we are getting through to people alex um i'm a part of a martial arts community online
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.760]  and part of that community talks about things like uh like what you talk about we do bring up
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:28.560]  things and we show people your films and there's a police officer on here that that was being
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:34.000]  briefed yesterday about uh needing to take the swine flu shot and he basically just raised the
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.960]  questions that you know how this hasn't been tested i mean what are they putting in this vaccine
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:43.600]  and he could tell that you know there are several officers there that are not going to be taking
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:48.480]  the shot and he just made point to them that you know if everyone's sick are we easier to control
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:55.120]  and and they all kind of just kind of uncomfortably laughed and um kind of took his point to heart
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:02.160]  yeah everybody who's got any instincts or any discernment and and who has done any intellectual
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:10.240]  research knows something's wrong i mean the bad stuff's going on everybody has this ominous feeling
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:13.680]  and it's not al-qaeda that's got a scared folks whether you believe in that or not
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:19.200]  everybody knows it's the government it's the corporations it's what they're putting in the
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:24.480]  water i mean we have a government that admits they spike the water with chemicals to brain damages
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:31.680]  give us cancer and sterilizes i mean they they admit it so how do we trust anything they do

[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:17.760]  cnn and the associated press are both reporting at least eight people shot in a
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:30.320]  downtown orlando high rise the police are dressed up in army style uniforms southeast asian camo
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:36.560]  completely ridiculous uh because they like to play soldier and the government wants to acclimate
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:41.440]  everyone to troops on the streets so that they're indistinguishable just like what we saw at the g20
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.000]  police dressed like military military dressed like police riding around with sound cannons
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.720]  shooting people with it for no reason and attacking old one with police dogs completely out of control
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:59.680]  and uh they're just milling around putting on all sorts of combat gear and the witnesses have
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:08.560]  identified a man in a blue polo shirt and jeans going around shooting people and watching the news
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:12.320]  during the break it looks like the police have not stormed the building they've blocked off the
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:18.960]  highways around the area and are cordoning off so lord knows how many more people will die
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:25.600]  because the police don't just storm the building like this woman police officer reportedly did
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:34.480]  shooting uh nadal hassan four times and not killing him though they said for six hours he'd
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:38.800]  been killed and now they're saying he wasn't killed and then there's saying there were two other
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:49.440]  shooters but now there weren't if it is true this female police officer killed this guy
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:56.000]  before the feds could get control until everybody to stand down and you imagine how many more people
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:02.160]  this fruit loop would have killed i don't know anybody comes around here trying to have a mass
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:09.840]  shooting i'm gonna i'm gonna fight got a firearm right here right beside me on the radio not playing
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:17.360]  games the answer is more guns less crime look at chicago look at new york look at their higher
[1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:23.120]  crime rates connie nicky kevin michael and others were going to your phone calls here in just a
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:28.160]  moment after i take those calls i i do want to say today that i i want to let some first time
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:33.680]  callers get involved as well a lot of these people are first time but are not frequent
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:37.920]  callers but don't people to be able to get involved on air with us the toll free number to join us
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:51.760]  is 1-800-259-9231 but i wanted to just for three or four minutes we may have him pop back in when
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:57.040]  bob Chapman joins us next hour i wanted to have ted on because this is a big day the dollar continues
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:01.440]  to drop even though the imf put hundreds of billions of dollars of gold on the market trying to drive
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:06.880]  the price down earlier in the week it's gone above one thousand one hundred and two dollars today
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.440]  and i wanted ted to be able to give us is a 30 year gold broker and the owner of modest resources
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.560]  his view on this ted briefly what's your take on what's happening with the gold right now
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:21.520]  well i think you have an appropriate name for your latest documentary follow the republic
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:28.400]  um the dollar is falling again today gold has gone up or 11 over gone up over 1100 dollars
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:35.760]  an ounce to 1102 we have unemployment figures now coming out at 10.2 percent and that's the
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:42.000]  government reported figures that's in crew that's horrible you know that's just a terrible economy
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.840]  i mean you have to go captain says it's really more like 20 percent if elix if they if they factor
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:54.960]  everything in it's well over 20 percent you know people know that but again it's just another nail
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:59.840]  in the coffin well there's also the underemployed people i mean most people i know even with good
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:06.160]  degrees have got two three jobs just trying to pay all the stinking taxes and i'm sorry go ahead
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:11.760]  yeah no that's okay because your point is well taken i mean the taxes are going up because we
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:17.760]  continue to have to pay more money back to this monstrous federal reserve system that lends us
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:24.640]  the money in order to have currency i i i all i can say elix is what would you prefer to have
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:31.120]  fiat paper currency or would you rather have gold and silver now the united states government was
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:37.760]  set up to have gold and silver as money we the people of the united states as miners were creating
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:44.720]  the currency we were making it we owed it to nobody after we did there was no debt associated with it
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:52.560]  this country is being drawn into the sea of debt and this is exactly what thomas jefferson was warning
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:13:00.560]  about when when uh when uh uh when the first central bank was being put together and here we
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:05.600]  have it right here they laid it out for us and we've screwed it up we let this federal reserves
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:11.520]  us to come in in 1913 and now we're so far into a sea of debt that not even foreign nations want
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:17.360]  to hold on to our currency anymore sad sad sad and it's all about this republic failing
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.120]  you know without without a change to that system we're going to continue to stay on the same road
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:28.400]  that we're on elix and i just can't tell you enough that it just makes me feel sick to my stomach
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:32.400]  and it should to everybody who's listening to this show well you know i don't mean
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:39.040]  you know ted that's what's frustrating about this is we should feel really good in the last six years
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:43.760]  telling people that we think buying gold is a good investment a good hedge against inflation
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:49.040]  saying that the globalist plan to tank the dollar kill the republic to bring in world government
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:53.680]  i mean we were reading their own documents all we were doing was telling people what they said
[1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:59.120]  being laughed at being ridiculed being attacked still being attacked as it's all openly announced
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:03.920]  and we should feel really good about the fact that we told people to buy gold when it was below
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:13.520]  $300 an ounce what was the low uh 270 something what was it ted 248 at its bottom oh excuse me okay
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:23.440]  okay 248 and telling people to buy it then and then now it's $1,102 plus and rising and i don't
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:29.440]  feel good ted i don't feel good that i've been right about all this and people know me all
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.560]  over the world and everybody tells me oh great job because at the end of the day we still got
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:40.160]  the same crooks running things my children's future is in deep trouble uh i mean this i mean
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:44.960]  we could handle just being a third world country and falling apart but we're going to have tyranny
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:50.800]  and spies and corrupt bureaucrats that are only going to raise more taxes on us they're just not
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:57.120]  gonna stop i mean this is really a bad tyranny we're dealing with and it actually makes it sick
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:04.480]  it actually makes me nauseous to be right i wish every day i was wrong i wish this guy
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:09.920]  was a muslim extremist i wish that was real because that's a lot less scary than criminals
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:15.920]  running the government that would set stuff up like this i wish every day 9 11 was an outside job
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:22.160]  i wish every day the army was good i wish every day the police were good i wish every day none of
[1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:29.120]  this was true believe me believe me ladies and gentlemen i'm just some redneck from texas you
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:36.320]  think i like having to sit here and and and know that the idiot public doesn't understand what i'm
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:41.760]  saying and thinks i'm some anti-american when all i'm trying to do save this country i'm sorry to
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:47.600]  start ranting ted i'm just seeing our country gutted and knowing the traders that hate our nation
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:55.680]  are posing as patriots makes me sick well there you go i mean just right on target because right
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:03.200]  now we're watching the value of our currency drop i mean we have lost about 40 percent of the value
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:09.920]  of the united states currency within the last couple of years alone i mean if you go back to 1971
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:17.920]  since gold has been separated from the us dollar it's worth about 18 cents i mean 18 cents put up
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:22.960]  100 pennies in front of you and then take all but 18 of them and throw them in the garbage can because
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:26.720]  that's what happened what do you think the trend is going to be in the future do you want to wait
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:33.440]  till it's worth two cents i mean we're the type of economy and the way that we're trying to solve our
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:41.040]  problems is identified you can you can pretty much set it right against what happened in argentina
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:49.520]  in brazil i mean it just the jimbabwe and the issue here is this is not an accident or a mistake
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:54.640]  they're not screwing up we have the internal goldman sacks documents we have the fellow reserve
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:17:01.200]  documents we have the morris strong quotes the un documents i hear them brag on npr scores of times
[1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:07.120]  over the years when my wife has it on making dinner where they brag about globalization will be good
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.160]  and carbon tax will be good to teach us to live with less yeah with these control freaks running
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:18.720]  our lives it's by design get that through your head ladies and gentlemen that's what fall the
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:25.680]  republic covers that's why it's such an important film this is being done by design that means it
[1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:30.160]  can be stopped it'd be one thing if we were all just a bunch of idiots in the government we're
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:35.680]  idiots and the banks were morons and oh gosh we really screwed up it'd be a lot harder to fix no
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:41.760]  this is artificial we've got industrial base we've got science we've got technology we've
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.960]  got the people globally to build an incredible society if we could get rid of these parasites
[1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:53.280]  and they're sucking the life blood out of our economy because they're threatened by a true free
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:59.440]  market the big money wants a monopoly and they want to kill capitalism and kill the free market
[1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:04.400]  and blame their crimes on it as they bring in their world socialist government where they take
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:08.000]  our money and give it to the bankers now listen ted we're almost out of time want to come back

[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:12.880]  next hour let's go to connie in illinois thanks for holding connie you're on the air
[1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:24.160]  that's alex um two things uh one is something from yesterday um just before your last guest
[1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:30.400]  yesterday you had an englishman that was speaking to a u.s audience and i was wondering what was
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:35.040]  that man's name and what was the bill that he was referring to because there was no reference to it
[1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:45.520]  after or before that yes that's lord mongton and he is mongton he's a viscount he's from england
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:52.480]  and we've done multiple radio shows on it it is the framework convention on climate change
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:58.400]  i've done an entire hour just on the treaty and everything he says is in there is in there
[1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:04.400]  but you don't have to believe lord mongton uh ban chi moon a week and a half ago two sundays ago
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:11.120]  wrote a global editorial published in hundreds of papers including the new york times his editorial
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:16.560]  was in the front page uh calling for global government he said we need a global government
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:21.600]  the carbon tax will fund it and then the media attacks lord mongton calling him a kook
[1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:27.120]  when he reads the treaty but then separately ban chi moon the head of the un says it's global
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:38.560]  government so uh it's it's mind boggling okay so uh in reference to it here in the states though at
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:44.160]  this point it's just simply the the framework convention for climate change and that's not
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:50.400]  actually uh either a senate or a house bill at this point the framework convention on climate
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:54.800]  change is the international agreement but countries have passed or are passing laws
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:00.480]  that mirror it and go under its control so if you actually read the legislation
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:08.640]  what the house has passed is even worse than this but because the house is complying
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:14.800]  and now the senate's poise to pass it with international law you understand in fact this
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:22.880]  whole treaty talks about nation states and regions uh mirroring or bringing their laws
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:29.200]  into harmony into line with the un treaty i understand it but do you know what the senate
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:34.560]  bill number is so they you know i don't have it in front of me but it's just everywhere uh i mean
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:41.920]  it's it's it's the climate change bill and i don't happen to have it memorized um but it's it's just
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:47.680]  it's actually actually uh let me see if roiders gives us the bill number that's the problem the
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:52.400]  mainstream media never does that it's a senate panel approves democratic climate bill this is
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:58.720]  yesterday a key u.s senate environment committee approved a democratic climate bill on thursday
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:02.720]  that would require industry to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse gases by at
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:08.160]  least 20 the bill approved by the environment and public works committee will now become
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:14.160]  one of several initiatives in the senate aimed at attacking global warming so no i don't have the
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:23.040]  bill number ma'am check out and then in reference to the shooter um yesterday when when the information
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:29.520]  broke and i was listening to uh a christian radio station at the time um the thought that came to my
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:40.560]  mind was that it it was a it was a staged thing um in that it was going to be used um in terms of
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:48.720]  of fear mongering um against militia against not militia but against the military um so that they
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:59.760]  indeed will be um and to be put on a terrorist watch list and and uh can then have their guns
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:05.360]  taken away from them because after all the military is crazy right so anyway that was just my my
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:12.320]  thought on that and um for people that that are new to listening and they're just wondering if what
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:21.040]  you're saying is crazy or not um it's so easy to do a web search just to look up simple things
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:27.920]  for example rocket fellers and eugenics when you when you put that in there there are tens of thousands
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:38.320]  of um replies that come up i i just went to two of them and one of them had said was talking
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:46.240]  about mk ultra and the the psychiatry that was being developed in england being transported
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:53.120]  to the united states to bring the united states under the subservience of uh yes the tavistak
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:58.720]  institute and i appreciate your call really a lot of great points from connie we're going to get to
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:03.600]  nicky kevin michael nick and others i've got a guest coming up for about 10 minutes about the
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:11.840]  military out arresting people off of bases tasering an 81 year old man but it's one thing to read
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:16.240]  millions of websites talking about the raw the rocket fellers being the masters of this whole
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:23.840]  system or being the prime movers behind it the real workhorses but then i had dr blalock on and
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:29.920]  all the other scientists and they actually quote the documents and the rocket fellers are the fathers
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:38.960]  of eugenics that's an encyclopedia britannica they are the people that develop the mind control
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:43.760]  systems that financed it they're corrupt robber barons and they went to the scientist and they
[1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:48.880]  said figure out how to control these people figure out how to make everybody our slaves
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:57.360]  that's what elites always do we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:42.240]  on that but we've been following in texas and california and new york alabama regular army
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:49.680]  regular marines national guard sometimes 10 15 20 miles from a base setting up checkpoints
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:56.320]  helping police search for drunk drivers as part of a pr campaign to acclimate the public to accept
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:01.040]  north com not just federal police but federal troops policing america and that's even in the
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:09.200]  army times and we see more and more of these reports this is not a fairbanks alaska and we've
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:15.840]  checked it it is a state highway but now the military spinning it and saying well there
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:19.040]  that's part of the base even though it's not their property they're allowed to go out on the highway
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:28.080]  and so they're just setting precedent here and they pulled over this 81 year old individual said
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:37.840]  that he ran from him and tasered him so i thought we would get the fairbanks news minor
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:42.880]  reporter on that's the mainstream paper there in fairbanks the daily paper the news minor
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:50.560]  and we are joined by chris fryberg to break down what's happening there in fairbanks with the
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:57.840]  with the air force base in this case so that that would be air force police but we see the army
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:06.080]  doing in other areas coming out off of base and and in tazering 81 year olds thanks for joining
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:12.320]  us chris oh thanks thanks for having me out alex interesting article titled 81 year old tazered
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:19.440]  by ellison air force base police tell us tell us what really happened here well uh i i've talked
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:25.120]  to um uh i i'll send and they said it's under investigation and they they can't really talk
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:31.280]  about it i i talked to the 81 year old his name is glenn welcox he's a fiscal alien priest uh he
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:37.280]  he told me that he was going down the highway uh the the this is a public highway maintained by
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:46.480]  the state um that uh the the air force pulled him over for going 11 miles over um he he it may or
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:51.840]  may not and wanted to accept the traffic ticket that's not clear he thought he had been waived off
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:59.280]  to to go ahead uh he took off the air for air force police said that that was not the case they called
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:05.360]  in the state troopers took off after him went down down the highway apparently he was detained he
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:12.240]  said for about two hours well they tried to figure out what what uh what to do um so there was some
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:17.920]  kind of conflict he was outside of the side of his car ended up on the ground and and he got tazered
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:27.120]  by the police describe this area to us geographically please and the name of the state highway uh this
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:32.160]  this is called the richardson highway uh it's one of our the major highways in the state we don't
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:38.720]  have all that many of them um this is this is a little past uh fairbanks about 20 miles down the
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:45.840]  road um and this is a uh there's a couple of miles that are right next to the the base um i i'd
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:50.960]  always thought it was the uh you know patrolled by the state the the air force says that they have
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:58.320]  uh the right uh to do it they're claiming that it's it's their highway too now have you had a
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:03.200]  chance to talk to the state police or others because i just pulled it up a few days ago on
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:07.520]  google maps and at first people were asking why were they off base doing this now they're just
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:12.480]  saying look we can do whatever we want we don't need no stinking badges or we don't need any stinking
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:19.360]  jurisdiction and then the fact that he pulled over the first time we talked to him on the phone
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:25.280]  i don't want to say he sounds senile but uh he sounded a bit out of it you know he's an 81-year-old
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:33.760]  person he leaves and uh then they pull him over again holding for hours and hours too much time
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:37.920]  on their hands uh i would imagine he's already getting cold up there i would imagine it's already
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:44.160]  pretty cold up in alaska oh yeah it's been below freezing lately and so i guess he didn't like sitting
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:49.600]  on the side of the highway while they sat in their warm patrol cars and then they tasered him uh how
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:57.760]  did all this end uh what well it he he said that because of his advanced age and he has a lot of
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:02.960]  health problems he said he's had a quadruple bypass um he said he can't quite get his hand behind
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:07.200]  his back which is what they they ordered him to do and he said he was trying to tell them i can't
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.160]  do it i can't do it and that's when he ended up on the ground um that's when he got tasered uh he
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:17.440]  was taken into custody had to spend the night in jail on the way to wait to jail though he said that
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:22.880]  one of one of the policemen did finally uh put the handcuffs on and in front of him um but yeah
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:27.280]  he said it was a very unpleasant experience he still has a lot of bruises on his arms from it
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:36.080]  we saw this at the g20 they said nowhere in the city are you allowed to be out and so they would
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:41.520]  ride down neighborhood streets we have video that we shot of this they would pull up to a nine-year-old
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:49.120]  with a baseball and a football you know kids playing and aim sound cannons at them and broadcast no
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:54.480]  one's allowed on the streets they would go to the university when the college kids were out at night
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:39:00.000]  wasn't even demonstrations and attack them there's video of police dogs and i keep repeating this
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:07.760]  because i can't get over it like 65 seven-year-old women come out of stores with bags and they they're
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:12.400]  being real nice they get and there's officers in stormtrooper outfits and they say sir we're just
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:16.960]  shopping and he's like get out of here and the police dog's biting them and they're billy clubbing
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:26.720]  people so they love these rules where if you don't immediately jump or stand on one leg even if you
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:31.280]  only have one leg or if you don't get out of a wheelchair there's all these famous footage where
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:35.840]  they arrest people in wheelchairs they're at the police department the jail they say get up and
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:43.120]  the person goes in one video i'm a quadrupede and they laugh at him and just throw him out and his
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:48.880]  bones break because they're like rubber from from not walking and they just laugh at the guy there
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:53.680]  you know with his broken bones and there's several of these videos and so this guy is literally
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.760]  looks like from what i've read and seen but you know more of this than i that they're wanting to
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:03.760]  see if he's drunk or something because he's 81 a little bit out of it and i guess they were saying
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:11.600]  stand on one leg and he doesn't submit so they they show him who's boss hey buddy you're not allowed
[1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  to be a little over the hill you didn't understand what we said boy because we've talked to him too
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:23.440]  on the phone that's basically what we got is they were giving him orders of things to do
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:30.240]  out there in the dark in the cold and he was just like a old blind dog or something that
[1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:34.480]  you know an old blind dog in the ditch and it doesn't jump when you say so you you torture
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:40.320]  it i mean i i mean this is do we have to watch him the military like like like attack dogs tearing
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:49.600]  the throat out of a rabbit here or what is this um yeah you know i'm i'm not sure i can i can really
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:54.800]  answer that for you alec i guess we just got to watch old people everywhere i mean i see reports
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:41:01.360]  every day of 92 year olds who are blind and half death getting tasered and beat up because they don't
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:08.080]  mind the cops or or autistic children every day getting beat up or shot i mean retarded i mean
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:13.200]  can't police tell when they pull up to an elderly senile person or a retarded child not to fill them
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:22.480]  full of lead well i i'm getting a little angry here and i appreciate the reporter coming on with
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:27.360]  us where is this going are they charging him with something is are we going to put this dangerous
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:35.040]  terrorist in jail uh he he was originally going to be charged with uh uh fourth degree assault
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:40.080]  resisting arrest failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer which is a felony they did drop
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:46.000]  the the assault charge um but but the other two are sticking uh he said he's gotten gotten
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:52.640]  attorney he's going to to fight it uh well we'll see where it ends up well that's the incredible part
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:57.520]  i can't tell you how many videos have surfaced on youtube or that we've shot where the police beat
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:03.600]  people up no one resists them and like an added insult it's not enough i knocked your teeth out
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:08.080]  and hurt your kidneys i'm going to charge you with assaulting me but i guess they had a little
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:14.000]  pang of conscience about sending an 80 plus year old man down the river and so they are dropping the
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.880]  assault charge against him i guess because the squad car video doesn't show that uh i'm i'm not
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:25.280]  sure exactly why but they they did drop it well sir are you doing any further investigation
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:31.040]  into why they're now declaring that the state highway is now their jurisdiction um you know
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:36.640]  that that's something that that i've i've tried to look at uh into a little bit they they claimed
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:43.280]  it's uh an exception under the state constitution um and i'm working on a follow up follow up on
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:49.120]  that right now so now i guess you're saying they're claiming an exception to the state constitution
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:54.800]  that oh it's against the constitution but we have an exception under homeland security and so i guess
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:59.920]  this week it's the roads around the base next next week it's going to be the whole state and maybe
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:05.120]  the army in your bedroom at night well we're as of right now they're they're claiming that under the
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:10.480]  the state constitution under under military roads they have concurrent jurisdiction uh with with the
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:16.480]  local local authorities and then at the same time they're also saying that this this part of the the
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:20.640]  Richardson State highway which you don't have to go through any kind of checkpoint for they're
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:25.280]  saying that that's part of part of the base and then they have the right to patrol that are they
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:35.120]  is the base generating fines uh revenue off the citizens um actually this was charged uh by the
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:41.040]  Fairbanks district attorney so any any revenue would would go to the the state rather than than the
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:44.960]  air force man that's amazing well i don't want to just sit here and talk at you i know you're a
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:49.680]  journalist and a reporter chris but uh you've you've obviously met with this older gentleman
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:55.840]  we've just talked to him you're saying yes bruce is all over him uh we i mean he's he's not a
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.360]  criminal from what we've seen he doesn't have a criminal record uh he's had triple bypasses i mean
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:08.640]  i i guess uh i mean does this irritate you or or any of the locals upset about this you know i
[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:13.760]  i i see see a lot of uh the the crime up here that's that's my job and there's a lot of weird
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:20.800]  things that happen um when i when i first saw this uh at the courthouse i was shocked that uh
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:26.560]  someone of of this age could really be tasered for any reason you know i i wonder what kind of
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.600]  threat an 81-year-old could pose to any any kind of law enforcement here especially there there were
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:37.440]  four uh enlisted airmen in their in their 20s there and i know that's that's been the general
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:44.240]  feeling here is you know why why did they need to do this why did four young uh uh presumably in
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:49.680]  shape airmen have to taser an 81-year-old man um and there's been a lot a lot of people do bringing
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:55.680]  up posse comatotus and wondering you know hey why is the air force allowed to patrol that area of
[1:44:55.680 --> 1:45:00.400]  the state highway well i'm going to be honest with everybody just because it's important for this
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:11.040]  man's defense we've talked to him to glenn m wilcox this 81-year-old gentleman and i believe
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:17.680]  uh he's a veteran too isn't he uh he was with the civil air patrol yeah well the issue here
[1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:22.800]  is this guy has no criminal record he's a patriot uh we've talked to him i'm just going to be honest
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:27.280]  now maybe we've caught him at bad times we've talked to him several times but i don't know how
[1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:33.280]  police when they walk up to a senile old man and we've talked to him i mean it's really sad
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:38.480]  i don't know how they don't have anything but compassion for him instead they beat him up in
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:49.920]  tasering and it's just it's so predatory and so anti-human and really more than out raging i i
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:55.520]  i just have nothing but disgust for these cowards that did this and they think it's normal they're
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:02.320]  so mentally ill they think he did not follow orders he did not stand on one foot uh he you
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:11.600]  and you have voltage sent through you i am robot and it well i'm glad to hear locals are upset
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:15.760]  about this i mean i'm am i right in saying what you've told me is that locals are concerned
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:22.400]  there they're very a very upset from the comments i i came in into work on the next day and i had
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:27.360]  you know several calls and i on my on my voice band i've gotten several you know since then
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:32.720]  saying you know how did how did this happen and i've got yeah people are very upset well you've
[1:46:32.720 --> 1:46:39.040]  talked to him uh and the two times we talked to him he's like in and out it sounds like
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:44.720]  i mean everybody knows folks you know it sounds like something like Alzheimer's to me uh you've
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:48.160]  talked to him and i know you don't want to make a medical determination here but i mean does he
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:55.920]  not seem like he's not all there you know i i can't can't really go go into that i mean you
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:01.840]  know i i just talked to him for a few minutes about about what happened and i mean he seemed um
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:06.560]  he seemed to have known what what had happened to him and he seemed very very angry about it
[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:11.360]  okay maybe the times we've talked to him we woke him up or something but you're saying he can't
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:18.160]  remember exactly what they were telling him to do well no he said that they were that they were
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:22.240]  trying to tell him to put his hands behind his back and he kept saying you know no i i'm old
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:26.640]  i have these conditions i can't put my hands behind my back and that's when he ended up on
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:33.760]  the ground it ended up getting tazer yeah that's the we got that and they were asking him other
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:39.280]  things too over the phone maybe we should just try him again guys and and and try to get him
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:44.720]  maybe we caught him at bad times and he's been beat up and tasers and in three bypass surgeries so
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:50.640]  maybe maybe we just caught him when we called him when he was taken a nap the two times uh because
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:56.480]  if he is normally like the way he was when we talked to him then the police are really out of
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:02.720]  control uh and this is scary uh so where is this going so so he still has charges against him and
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:07.760]  they're not going to wrestle he's in jail i guess the the the charges are are still still pending
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:12.240]  and and that's gonna wind its way through the the court system what's wrong with the district
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:18.480]  attorney in your town uh you know you know that's something that that that you would have to uh
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:23.920]  to ask him i'm not here why he's pursuing what is his name uh his name is michael gray
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:29.920]  michael gray's a big man i guess he's really proud of himself as if this 81 year old done
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:34.880]  nothing to anybody has already been beat up tasered slammed on the ground you said you saw him i mean
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:41.040]  how bad are the bruises um i actually i talked to him on the phone so i i okay he told you about

[2:02:02.800 --> 2:02:08.400]  loved your movie that you just made thank you follow the republic and i just got something to
[2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:16.080]  say about uh that the shooting yesterday with uh hassan this guy's a military guy is a major
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:21.440]  has a doctor and the only photo that they have of him is some black and white photo where he looks
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:27.760]  like some psycho that just seems kind of weird doesn't it and then they conveniently have him
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:34.000]  in his muslim garb look the whole thing if you go over it's stinks to high heaven he's making these
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:40.480]  anti-war statements he's making these statements reportedly against the political system i mean
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:47.200]  if a private does that they drum them out of the military in 10 seconds but he reportedly said all
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:53.120]  this and they said no you're going to iraq and then they lied and said he was dead for six hours
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:59.200]  and then people are reporting other shooters and then he's a psychiatrist uh i mean this thing's got
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:06.800]  mind control or patsy written all over it i just i was looking at all the different news sites cnn
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:11.600]  fox everyone and the only photo they have is some black and white photo of this guy a couple photos
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:18.800]  and then that video and i mean if he's a major you would expect him to you know have at least one
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:24.560]  photo where he's decorated in uniform or something and they got some weird photo out there which just
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:31.680]  it just seems weird that's all well it's a mess it is certainly a mess and the globalist love
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:36.880]  divide and conquer and we're a nation of all these different groups and religions and people
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:42.160]  and in the name of multiculturalism they actually remind us of our differences and hype it up
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:48.000]  to create more division it's the perfect cover story there's the establishment saying oh the tea
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:54.480]  parties yesterday they were out protesting the healthcare bill because they're racist that's
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:04:02.000]  racist to inject the term racism into it that is divide and conquer we have time later i'll play
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:09.600]  these clips of mafios and oberman just disgusting they know exactly what they're doing and and and
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:14.880]  now with the afghan war faltering and the citizens not wanting the war and all this news coming out
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:23.200]  this conveniently happens but i mean he could be a crazy person who was a muslim wacko you got
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:29.680]  wackos from all groups he could just be mentally ill but the psychiatrists have the highest statistics
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:36.720]  as i've said of being mentally ill and on drugs or he could be mind control mind control exists

[2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:56.960]  hundreds i mean it was scores of tv stations in texas alone with the media freaking out every
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:02.400]  time a poster was put up saying it was evil and unamerican and then that would blow up in their
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:10.800]  face and even more would be posted wildly successful and certainly hundreds of thousands of people
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:16.720]  total have seen the videos that are posted some have 10 000 views 5000 views a thousand views
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:22.160]  eight thousand views and we've been posting the three or four entries a day as they come in and i

[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:57.360]  and then charlie's picking the winner it's whatever strikes charlie sheen as the best produced the
[2:09:57.360 --> 2:10:03.360]  best message the best adaptation of the 15 page 20 minutes with the president and the key is the
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:10.240]  20 points those are the most important 20 points of 9 11 truth that that we've identified this is a
[2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:18.080]  14 000 prize first place second place is 1000 third place is 500 everybody wins by getting the truth
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:23.360]  out about 9 11 truth so in the last nine days i would ask listeners send 20 minutes with the
[2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:28.320]  president dot com there's a banner on info wars dot com if you go to info wars dot com
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:33.600]  and click on the banner it goes to 20 minutes with the president dot com it's a really nice
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:38.000]  site has charlie sheen's message to the president there it has the 20 minutes with the president
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:43.600]  article there and it could be two black guys talking two white guys a black guy and a white guy
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:48.400]  a white guy and a black girl it could be a chinese person it could be a native american
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:55.200]  it doesn't matter it could be video clips with a voiceover but we got nine days left on this
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:02.400]  and you send them in fact we have a special email just for the contest don't we it's linked up there

[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:24.640]  to sheen at info wars uh dot com contested info wars because we get our problem is we're having
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:29.360]  trouble with email management we're putting in a new system we get three four five thousand emails
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:34.080]  a day most of them are spam but over a thousand or good emails we battle to read them to scan them
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:38.720]  but it's kind of like and it goes in its own box but sometimes it get the point is make sure you
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:46.000]  get your entry into us as well and so we can post them but there's nine days left in this ladies
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:54.480]  and gentlemen nine nine days left until the close on november 15 then we've got to have time to review
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:59.280]  them make sure we get them all and and and then charlie can judge them i'm going to judge second
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:03.920]  third place but uh when we had the idea of the contest i said how about ten thousand bucks he
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:09.360]  said yeah but taxes it'll be three four thousand let's do thirteen thousand five hundred i said
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:15.360]  yeah but thirteen five sounds weird let's do fourteen thousand fourteen thousand dollars uh
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:20.720]  to whoever does the best job and again everybody wins it gets the word out to everyone and i like
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:24.880]  a lot of the entries that have come in but we're not seeing two hundred three hundred entries like
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:32.880]  we saw on the on the joker obama uh poster drive now i know more coming in but it's not too late
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:37.840]  for you to do this it's not too late for you to get involved i want to see your creativity i want to
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:43.760]  see what you're going to do so again ladies and gentlemen i want to commend everybody out there
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:50.160]  that has been involved in it great work few of them aren't too great pretty pretty half-hearted job
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:54.640]  on some of them but that happened with the obama poster contest as well the point is these videos
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.840]  will then drift around forever pointing out the key 20 bullet points but you can do it however you
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:07.200]  want in whatever way you want but get on it today ladies and gentlemen 20 minutes with the president

[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:18.400]  dot com is a word you'll spell out 20 minutes with the president or two zero with the president
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:25.200]  dot com both of those addresses get you there don't they both those urls two zero with the president
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.840]  dot com and 20 spelled out with the president dot com oh really because we wanted to zero with the
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:35.360]  president that was the url we bought can we get that linked up to
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:44.240]  okay okay now that somebody else has that all right all right so you just spell it out 20
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:52.480]  minutes with the president dot com okay uh going to bob Chapman uh former military intelligence
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.040]  ran the biggest newsletter financial newsletter out there for a long time retired came back
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:02.560]  with the international forecaster dot com and a lot of just amazing predictions he said
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:11.280]  many many months ago that the stock market would go back up gold would explode he predicted that in
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:15.920]  the fall he i don't want to go back over all his predictions here we've done that before
[2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:21.040]  we just need to pay attention to what he's saying now and i want to start going to your phone calls
[2:14:21.040 --> 2:14:27.920]  for those that are holding at the bottom of the hour specifically questions for uh bob Chapman
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:31.520]  but i know some of the callers are already holding so you can bring up other issues he'll be able
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:36.400]  to comment on that but after we go through this raft of calls if you're calling in just questions
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:43.280]  for bob Chapman on the economy and the balance of the hour that we have 1-800-259-9231 is the toll
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:48.960]  free number to join us on air bob Chapman good to have you here with us well thank you it's good
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:56.640]  to be here again gold is above one thousand one hundred and two dollars now somewhere up in that
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:03.840]  area it's been trading back and forth uh over eleven hundred uh exactly as we predicted and
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:11.440]  you know it's surprising about this and and it's very disappointing to me uh analysts economists
[2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:18.800]  newsletter writers they polled them uh hurlbert has a service where they polled them and um
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:26.000]  96 percent of them said that gold was going to go back down again i mean you talk about a
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:33.360]  massive egg in your face i don't know what these people are thinking about and they're not reading
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:38.480]  the tea leaves right but anyway we're happy we were right our subscribers our listeners
[2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:43.040]  uh they're making money and so that's what it's all about but more and more than that
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:49.600]  they're protecting themselves but bob you've made this point many times most of those analysts
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:55.440]  aren't stupid they're paid and put on national television and given syndicated columns to lie
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:16:04.400]  to people well that's true and then you have the factor of acceptability uh a lot of these
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:11.760]  writers will know what's going on but they won't talk about uh the very hard facts uh they'll
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:19.600]  color them they'll say well maybe the people at the sec of the cftc will pursue the fact that the
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:28.000]  market is being manipulated or it's just full of excuses and and that draws them into the middle
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:34.320]  so to speak so they're not thought ill of within their profession i get a different viewpoint
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:40.720]  i don't care what anybody thinks i hope that i'm right and i i say what i say and i've been
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:47.440]  pretty successful at it and i hope it continues that way but nothing stands in my way and i think
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:53.920]  less of them for that well you tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may and 95
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:17:00.480]  percent of the time you're accurate so am i and that's why we're so successful at reaching people
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:04.240]  but it's kind of sad i mean it's like telling somebody you're going to die of cancer and now
[2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:10.080]  we're dying of cancer as a country the republic is in bad shape if we don't remove these criminals
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:15.360]  immediately it's over but it may be even too far gone for that we just need to remove them so it
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:20.880]  doesn't get a hundred times worse uh bomb what happened with the imf dumping all this gold in
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:27.520]  the market ted anderson ron paul in fact i'm going to play that clip later of ron paul uh said that
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:32.960]  clearly the imf and world bank came in and tried to drive down gold and it for the first time in
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:38.960]  modern history their attempt to drive it down failed and blew up in their face and this is a
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:45.760]  major c change uh for the dollar for the markets for gold a do you concur with ron paul and ted
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:54.000]  anderson and b what does this mean in the short term i agree it's a seminal moment and we've just
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:18:02.240]  passed it i said there would be an untoward event and that was it and uh the only question i have
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:12.240]  about that is that i suspect there's a possibility that the indians didn't buy that gold i think
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:18.960]  there's a possibility that that goal could have been sold some time ago and what they were effectively
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:24.320]  doing was completing the transaction by covering a short position other where they had sold
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:33.200]  and they would have it somebody ostensibly buy it back when in fact they weren't now india
[2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:44.720]  was one of the signatories to the imf in 1947 and they chose a number of countries to hold gold
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:55.440]  and india was one of them and uh perhaps it's possible that the gold that india held may have
[2:18:55.440 --> 2:19:03.200]  been sold previously and india was just saying well we're buying it and that would have completed
[2:19:03.200 --> 2:19:09.520]  the transactions because essentially they were sellers on behalf of the imf before so that's
[2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:18.320]  possible uh the other thing is maybe they did in fact buy the gold i don't know which but i do know
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:27.200]  one thing they're both good and uh the chinese say that we can get gold cheaper by buying gold
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:33.520]  produced in the country and they're right they were a big gold producer but they have to wait
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:39.920]  for it to be harvested and brought in and so i think chinese chinese are going to line up there
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:49.120]  and uh if there is gold for sale in reality all right bob go ahead and there is okay stay there
[2:19:49.120 --> 2:19:54.480]  bob chatman's our guest we're going to continue to talk about these joblessness numbers record high
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:59.840]  and that's even cook numbers we're going to talk about where gold's going from here and your phone

[2:23:59.760 --> 2:24:12.400]  i'm going to play a clip of ron paul talking about the attempt of gold manipulation by the
[2:24:12.400 --> 2:24:16.000]  imf when we come out of the next break bob chatman's our guest
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:25.440]  bob the mainstream media and the the imf the world bank but g20 have gone from saying will we go off
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:31.120]  the dollar to yes we're going off of it and it's now begun will it be a long protracted death or a
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:39.840]  quick death why does the establishment want this why are they doing this this jobless recovery
[2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:48.400]  oxymoron over 10 unemployment those are cooked numbers break it down for us well the unemployment
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:56.320]  numbers are easy that's u3 that they're talking about 10.2 percent up from nine and three quarters
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:03.200]  percent nine and five eighths whatever it was the real figure is the u6 which is 17.5 percent by
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:10.240]  their seven seven yeah seven seven and five eight percent according to their own figures
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:18.560]  now that includes u3 which is the 10.2 percent uh those who are no longer receiving checks uh those
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:24.560]  who are discouraged and those who are forced to work part time uh there's one thing that's left
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:30.560]  out of there and that is called the birth death ratio which means uh the government says well
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:36.000]  gee we can't check on everybody so we'll guess and so they always guess in their own favor
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:43.440]  except the twice in the last six years and so with that said if you extract the birth death ratio
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:56.480]  you will come up with a new unemployment figure of 22.4 percent that is depression level is it not
[2:25:57.440 --> 2:26:05.200]  uh it's right on the fringe uh at least in in an uh in unemployment and unemployment is
[2:26:05.200 --> 2:26:12.480]  tends to be a lagging statistic and that means that unemployment is going to get worse
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:19.680]  even if the economy gets a little better or better and so I had projected in January and we've
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:28.320]  talked about this before 22 percent and so um I was wrong uh it's a little higher than that
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:36.160]  but that's okay at the time I made the projection the number was 13.5 percent so you know we were
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:43.760]  pretty much on next year it'll probably run sideways to slightly higher maybe 23 or 4 percent
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:50.240]  it all depends whether we get stimulus and how much the stimulus is they're talking about it now
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:57.120]  we projected 2 trillion in January for this coming year now it looks like they want to do
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:04.320]  uh somewhere between 400 and 800 billion stimulus from congress and they want the banks to lend
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:11.600]  the 14 percent decrease that they've instituted in the last year and if they do that they'll come
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:17.520]  up with about 1.5 to 2 trillion which is right in the ballpark of what we were looking for but
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.240]  it's only gonna buy you another year all they're doing is throwing money at this thing and it's
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:27.520]  not solving the problem that was about to say bias another year until total collapse I mean
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:34.160]  the people are losing their jobs the the the the industry is falling apart retail sales are
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:40.240]  plunging every indicator is that the crash is already here but we have all these painted
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:48.800]  trollops the info babes and and the cutesy guys for the girls on fox and cnn and msnbc and cnbc
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:55.120]  explaining to us that well it's bad for you but good for the banks so the economy's good
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:04.320]  well that's rather jaded uh the whole thing is a scam and in as much as the banks the brokerage
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:10.160]  firms and the insurance companies and transnational caused this problem in the first place and the
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:15.040]  other ones that are getting bailout not the transnational but the others and so very little
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:23.440]  has gone to the public and I noticed they're going to extend unemployment benefits and as well as the
[2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:30.720]  eight thousand dollar credit for housing and they're going to try to keep the interest rates down as
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:39.600]  long as they can and that's like a band-aid on an ax wound exactly now you you ask for a timeline
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:47.120]  here must have been six months since paul craig robinson i were on here together and we both said
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:53.600]  you know two and a half to three years well here we are six months later and now it's a year and a
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:29:01.280]  half to two and a half years and they're going to pull the plug up in that area sometime and so
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:08.400]  that would put us into uh 2011 and a half uh the 2012 and a half somewhere in there and that's when
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:14.880]  the whole house is going to fall down and you want to have gold and silver coins because if you don't
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:21.600]  you're going to be in deep doo doo well some are saying okay it's a bubble in gold well regardless
[2:29:21.600 --> 2:29:27.600]  then for investment that's the that's the way that bubbles in their heads elix believe me i mean
[2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:34.240]  they don't know what to do they've been so wrong so often it's it's just totally pathetic okay well
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:41.360]  then let's discuss i mean let's take inflation officially since 1980 we got a break got a break

[2:34:50.800 --> 2:34:54.960]  have bob finish the point he was trying to make then i'm going to play this ron paul clip and go
[2:34:54.960 --> 2:35:00.480]  to your calls sorry that the satellite break cuts you off those are hard breaks bob go ahead and
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:07.120]  finish up your point and so official inflation since 1980 would make goals somewhere between 24
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:13.680]  and $2,500 an ounce that is the very minimum it should be selling at my figures for official
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:22.640]  inflation since then a $6,700 an ounce john williams who you all know the eminent economist
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:29.280]  says it's $7,150 per ounce and i'm not going to argue with him because he's a better economist
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:38.720]  than i am so gold is vastly underpriced absolutely gold isn't going up because it's a bubble like
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:45.200]  oil or uh some other commodity it's because the dollars devalued and people worldwide are trying
[2:35:45.200 --> 2:35:50.160]  to get into something that's real intangible because all the economists we've talked to have
[2:35:50.160 --> 2:35:56.000]  said that as the dollar goes it's also going to hurt other global currencies and regional
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:01.600]  currencies it's just they're not going to be hurt as bad so there's a flight from currencies
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:08.080]  into hard assets isn't there that's exactly right everybody's going to get hurt in very
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:15.120]  in degrees and it's been happening for six years it's nothing new every currency in the world has
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:22.240]  gone down against gold in the last six years and they've all been inflated by increasing
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:30.160]  money and credit and lowering interest rates and more money than they've got coming in amazing
[2:36:31.760 --> 2:36:35.920]  what is the federal government going to do as the world starts refusing to buy their t-bills
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:45.520]  or buy their dollars and and and other government offerings as obama spends more money than all
[2:36:45.520 --> 2:36:50.720]  presidents before him combined that's official we thought bush was bad tripling the size of
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:55.040]  government obama has taken that to a whole new level of course he's just a puppet but the point
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:37:00.160]  is the establishment is doing this what are they going to do i guess just run debt up and steal
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:06.720]  steal steal until everything implodes and then have their new banking system as the answer
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:11.920]  won't people see through the fact that the very same banks that engineered the crisis
[2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:19.280]  are now posing as the saviors bob yes they will and it's not going to work unless ultimately they
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:26.320]  have a currency which is backed by gold and so going full circle how are they going to
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:33.360]  to be able to continue to finance the u.s. debt the federal reserve that private corporation
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:41.120]  they have been monetizing debt that means they've been printing money out of thin air
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:49.120]  and using it to buy treasury bonds agency bonds which is fanny freddy and jenny and fha
[2:37:49.760 --> 2:37:56.160]  they've been making swaps with foreign nations 500 billion at a time they've injected
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:38:06.080]  12.7 trillion dollars into the financial system just through banking and wall street
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:13.040]  in the last year we're on the hook for 23.4 trillion if we don't get any of the money back
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:17.680]  i mean the figures are astronomical they'd be paid for by the great great great great great
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:25.440]  great great great grandchildren of us and this is how buried we are and the only way out of this thing
[2:38:25.440 --> 2:38:31.360]  is official devaluation which means gold would have said in a a much much higher price
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:36.880]  than it is now and uh that that would have to be default on debt and i believe that's
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:41.440]  going to happen a year and a half to two from now and i'd like to get paul craig's
[2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:47.440]  robits his view on that uh because we had him on pretty close yeah i had him on a few weeks ago
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:54.320]  and he's beginning to revise his forecast of it being further out he says that it's
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:39:00.320]  it's beginning to look like it may happen sooner rather than later uh because the deterioration
[2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:05.760]  is accelerating but uh i guess we're all here together and we're going to find out here's
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:12.960]  what ron paul had to say yesterday here live with us when i asked him about the death of the dollar
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:17.280]  and he said that he thought that would be more incremental but then he got off into gold here's
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:22.240]  congressman ron paul what's going to hurt the economy i wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:27.440]  it's less important all the time i mean the fact that they can still have 60% reserves means it's
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:33.120]  still still there but the market i look at the market signals and i think the thing that happened
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:38.800]  this week was very very significant that is when the imf announces that they're going to dump 200
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:44.400]  uh tons of gold on the market well you know or an early person would think and they were hoping
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:47.760]  well a lot of that gold out there that's going to drive down the price of gold and make all the
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:54.960]  fiat currencies look better but what happened a bank from asia india buys the whole lot which
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:40:02.160]  sent a signal i think to the world markets that in essence gold has been re-monetized they it
[2:40:02.160 --> 2:40:08.640]  never gets demonetized but it has less importance as money when all the country's rejected but i
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:14.320]  think this is a major major signal that the dollar is getting closer it's on its last legs and gold
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:19.680]  is getting more important and as the chinese buy less and less they they have already started buying
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:25.600]  gold and they don't want to buy too much too fast and you know shoot the price up uh you know too
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:29.840]  quickly i think that's coming i think the gold price is destined to go a lot higher the dollar is
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:37.040]  going to go a lot lower and uh they cannot be thrown gold they can disrupt and play these games
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:42.800]  for a long long time but in many ways this is very very good because it tells us that the
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:47.440]  government no longer can get away with just printing money to finance their schemes as their
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:53.120]  schemes that are so damaging to us whether it's the welfare or the warfare it all hurts the people
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:58.080]  because they have to pay the bills so uh some of these things are good signals although it means
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:04.800]  that we have to be concerned about the chaos that might erupt all right that was a short snippet of
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:13.120]  Ron Paul's interview with us live here yesterday bob your comments on that hot totally along the
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:18.160]  the lines of what Ted Anderson and i have been talking about for a long time and i agree and
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:27.760]  i'm sure Ted does and i think uh that um we're right on course uh you my feeling is this thing
[2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:33.600]  was all created for a reason it just didn't happen and i think there's a point along the way
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:42.720]  that they had planned to switch from the inflationary depression to the deflationary and i think that
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:49.360]  their plans have been so disrupted by your program and programs like it and the international
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:55.600]  forecaster and others who not only tell you what's going on in that realm and others but also
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:02.560]  the total truth of who's behind it and what they're doing and your next next guest in in a way
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:07.120]  in in a way is going to be telling you telling you the same thing i mean these people on wall
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:13.360]  wall street are criminals i know i've been there i've done that did you read the mclatchy newspaper
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:18.960]  in big investigation with an award-winning financial writer actually got the internal
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:26.400]  goldman sacks documents where they planned to sell the housing market uh derivatives knowing
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:33.040]  they were going to implode wanting to bring down bear sterns i remember over a year ago on this show
[2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:40.960]  you said goldman sacks has all their people as regulators they grabbed bear sterns for no reason
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:49.040]  and some other brokerage firms and investment banks and you in fact yesterday as as i had another
[2:42:49.040 --> 2:42:55.520]  guest on and as i covered that article again i remembered how over a year ago you had said
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:43:00.880]  exactly what was happening and now so many others are saying it uh and of course we have
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:07.520]  professor black one of the former top federal investigators he's in fall the republic uh
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:13.840]  saying the same thing i mean it's really coming out that these guys are a bunch of crooks well
[2:43:13.840 --> 2:43:21.200]  what you were referring to were was that they were selling cdo's collateralized debt obligations
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:28.960]  and they were bonds which contain mortgages and pieces of mortgages and they browbeat
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:36.800]  the rating agencies s and p moody's and phitch into giving them triple a ratings when in fact
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:44.320]  their ratings were triple b the difference between a ten and a three and they knew that this toxic
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:50.480]  garbage was going to start falling apart so the minute they sold them to the buyers and of course
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:57.280]  they did have some still in inventory when all this happened they sold them to the buyers and then
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:03.680]  they shorted them they bet that they were going to go down to here they've just sold them on the
[2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:09.520]  long side to institutions throughout the world particularly in europe and then they turn around
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:14.640]  and shorted the market at the same time and that's what the right writer is talking about now now
[2:44:14.640 --> 2:44:22.640]  let's explain this you have a bond and you and you sell it to alex jones golem and sax does
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:28.960]  then they turn around and they go into the market and they sell the bond that you just bought
[2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:39.200]  just like they they they want it to go down because when you sell short it has a tendency
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:46.080]  to make the bond of the stock to go lower and if other people see that they'll sell too so if they
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:54.000]  sell the bond short at par which is a thousand it may go down to ninety five or ninety and
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:58.400]  it's somewhere along the way they're going to buy their short position back and they're going to
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:04.720]  make a profit on the downside by betting that your bond is going down which it did i was about to
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:11.840]  say so so in layman's terms goldman sax unlike any other group has regulators internationally in the
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:18.800]  treasury in the private fellow reserve in the government on record running everything they
[2:45:18.800 --> 2:45:25.520]  go out and package crap derivatives knowing its crud knowing its bad mortgages they get it triple a
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:31.200]  rated as solid gold they tell everybody it's great in press releases they sell it to banks
[2:45:31.200 --> 2:45:38.320]  institutions individuals to the investing world to governments to calpers in california to your
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:46.880]  school district to the cop union pension funds everything they know it's a time bomb they know
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:51.280]  it's a car that's going to blow up in an hour but they sell it to you off the lot knowing it's
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:56.960]  going to explode and kill everybody on board then to make sure it happens it's already crap they go
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:02.320]  out and bet against it to drive it down then it goes way down then they use government bailout
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:08.880]  money to come buy it back up what has value picking and choosing at at literally dimes on the dollar
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:14.880]  at the bottom and then they all post record profits and give each other record bonuses i mean that
[2:46:14.880 --> 2:46:19.760]  is diabolical and the article goes on to say they didn't just do it for incredible profit
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:25.280]  they did it to devastate other financial institutions because they are the regulators as
[2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:31.600]  goldman sacks they have their operatives everywhere they can then come in and use regulators to
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:36.960]  shut down and force the sale or liquidation or takeover to to to other federal reserve
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:43.840]  grouped banks that they're allied with or themselves that was so brilliant that i think
[2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:48.720]  that you might get a letter or a call from goldman sacks asking you to go to work for them
[2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:56.000]  no seriously so that's a perfect alex and you know i know that you're not someone
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:00.880]  who has been trained in that industry and that was a wonderful explanation thank you well no i'm
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:05.120]  just here every day reading it looking at it i mean you know i i mean i just understand what
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:10.400]  these central i mean that's what rothschild did in 1815 staging the collapse of the market
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:15.520]  so he could buy it up i mean it's the same trick just more sophisticated that's right
[2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:20.800]  right and i'm glad writers are getting on if i don't have time to write special item
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:28.160]  and do special uh investigation i i'm i'm publishing so much now and 30 right i was a
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:33.120]  week in the radio but i'm glad they're there i welcome them i love them and i hope they work
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:38.160]  harder and harder and harder and i hope more of them come and i hope more of them come on radio
[2:47:38.160 --> 2:47:46.560]  and and in the internet because we need all the help we can get i'm just blown away by whole
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:53.200]  bold goldman sacks is and of course they're just one of the culprits uh but they don't care they
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:48:00.320]  they are a law and to themselves they're crooks in three thousand dollar suits they don't care
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:09.280]  about the constitution the laws uh the sec protects them and uh you know the Shapiro uh work for the
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:18.240]  sec uh did uh you know there's so many of their alumni so to speak in banking worldwide as you
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:23.600]  pointed out as well as in the brokerage business that have gone to washington it's it's ludicrous
[2:48:23.600 --> 2:48:32.320]  now it's not new they have been other firms dylan reid and jp morgan chase jp morgan used to be the
[2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:39.120]  anointed ones and in the current years uh goldman sacks has come along and taken over the helm so
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:46.560]  to speak uh for the treasury uh jp morgan chase for the fed and one handles one area and one
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:52.320]  handles the other but they were on the country and we've got to stop them so we have a gang of
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:58.000]  crooks because they want world government and that's what this is all about exactly we because
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:03.200]  then they're the world government and they write the laws they control the army and they can legalize
[2:49:03.200 --> 2:49:07.200]  all their crimes right now is an important transition for them because they've been doing
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:13.360]  it under color of law but if they're able to get their police state in place heaven help us uh
[2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:20.960]  why is goldman sacks every time we turn over iraq why is it one of their alumni in a federal
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:26.480]  regulatory position i mean i i i don't see many regulatory positions where you don't have
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:35.440]  a goldman sacks ringwraith uh in there in the cockpit it's planned that way look at the seamless
[2:49:35.440 --> 2:49:44.320]  change between bush and obama team a replace team b where do they come from all the bureaucrats
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:50.960]  a council and foreign relations trilateral commission build a burger group hardcore alumnus
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:55.440]  they all want world government we didn't have any change and so it's all the same
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:02.800]  you know it must be great if you're just totally ruthless and evil and i i mean that's
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:08.480]  sarcastically but it must just be great because they get to take over kill enslave bankrupt whoever
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:12.480]  they want and then talk about how great they are building this great new world order when
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:17.360]  they're just a bunch of criminals not only that most of them are pedophiles
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:23.840]  man these people that's even more sickening
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:33.600]  do you think that they've gone too far though bob well they have but we have to play it out
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:37.920]  and they're gonna have to make their moves and we're gonna have to make ours uh they think they
[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:43.680]  got the the army in their pocket and they're sadly mistaken they're not gonna follow them
[2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:48.400]  i haven't asked you yet what you think of the shooting at ford hood
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:57.040]  too early to tell alex yeah i agree with you but the truth will come out later but by then nobody

[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:38.400]  damn companies you know and uh i was in our march when we went down to uh washington dc and all
[2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:42.560]  of these buildings were on the same street and if i had a paper and pencil i would have put signs up

[2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:04.560]  else on the planet it's happening here we better grow up and admit it and and and tell these people
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:09.920]  stop it and start bringing them to justice because they're not going to quit until we grow a backbone
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:16.080]  bob Chapman that's the way to do it and that's why we're getting the word out and that's why
[2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:20.960]  you're going to washington and letting them know that you don't agree with what's going on uh they
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:27.120]  had that uh march on thursday it appeared in none of the major media except for them calling them
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:31.440]  racist it had nothing to do with race right i don't want government run health care you know
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:36.800]  they can't run cash for clunkers they can't run this and and that's being nice to them uh nick
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:41.520]  did it here for me i don't think they're going to get away with that because it's a non sequitur
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:48.400]  has nothing to do with what they were doing i mean stupid i'm talking about the government in the
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:55.040]  media and saying those things it's amazing let's talk to arnold in california arnold welcome
[2:55:56.400 --> 2:56:00.320]  yes thank you alex thank you so much uh for having me on uh first time caller
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:04.160]  i've been listening to you for a long time and here here's something that um
[2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:10.320]  um i quite don't understand uh it seems like the cia seems to be more connected and doing
[2:56:10.320 --> 2:56:17.200]  business outside of the us to hoard all this money in in the international trade and i know
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:23.280]  that because i'm somewhat connected internationally and this is what i always hear from the people
[2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:28.720]  before you can do anything it seems like you have to give the cia their cut first
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:39.200]  bob uh first of all i don't have firsthand knowledge historically i do and uh i wouldn't
[2:56:39.200 --> 2:56:48.320]  be surprised if they weren't extorting everybody it is a criminal organization well the thing is
[2:56:48.320 --> 2:56:54.000]  is that every i was in the military myself and i know that every branch of the military has their
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:57:00.080]  own intelligence and it seems like if the cia supposedly intelligence outside of the us why
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:06.320]  do we need them if the military already has their own well it's a good question it it's
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:14.400]  something that existed and starting in the late 1930s modeled on mi6 it was os s in 1948 it became
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:20.720]  the central intelligence agency in 1953 it was brought under the national security agency
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:26.720]  which was formed that year so it became part of it and that same year the army security agency
[2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:33.280]  was formed and i work for them so i worked indirectly with both those organizations particularly
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:44.000]  nsa and so the cia exists probably so that wall street and others can run the opium trade and
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:51.040]  extort money from people and pull stamps like made off and the new gun hand episode and things like
[2:57:51.040 --> 2:57:56.880]  that i mean these guys are top criminals and there's no doubt that the opium trade founded skull
[2:57:56.880 --> 2:58:04.000]  and bones it founded out of os s cia that's in mainline history of the cia and you've got all
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:09.440]  these other compartmentalized federal intelligence groups and international intelligence groups
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:13.280]  and there's a lot of good people that work for them but they're all compartmentalized
[2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:18.400]  doing a separate job that isn't part of the criminal hierarchy bob Chapman we're going to

[2:59:31.280 --> 2:59:37.040]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen

[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:25.120]  so much going on with the economy joblessness federal government supporting and above 10
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:32.720]  how can we have a jobless recovery there's also been a terrible shooting in florida
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:37.600]  in an orlando office building these eight people shot there
[3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:46.480]  and of course you have the 12 dead 30 plus wounded at fort hood with all the security there
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:53.200]  showing that nothing can stop a nut except for the second amendment and this female police officer
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:58.560]  who reportedly shot this individual four times and stopped him thank god that she didn't wait
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:04.080]  like they did at blacksburg and other places she charged in and took this guy out so she
[3:01:04.080 --> 3:01:10.960]  certainly deserves a lot of praise for that but they've changed the story too many so many times
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:15.440]  who knows what's going on for six hours they said this guy was dead then they said he was alive
[3:01:15.440 --> 3:01:22.560]  so our hearts and prayers go out to all of those at fort hood and not just in texas but in orlando
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:26.720]  florida just terrible okay we're going to break here in a few minutes but he'll be with us for
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:34.560]  several segments and i'm really excited about this interview because i uh saw the article in
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:41.200]  mclatchy newspapers uh not this sunday but last sunday and it dubbed tale professor black we've
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:46.560]  had on a federal regulator former federal regulator and so many of john perkins who we've had on
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:52.800]  confessions of an economic hitman all these other insiders talking about golden sacks just
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:57.840]  just really involved in a lot of amazing behavior uh but the headline is how golden sacks secretly
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:04.080]  bet on the u.s housing crash and to go over that is the author of the investigative reporter award
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:08.480]  winning investigative reporter greg gordon and he's written for some of the biggest newspapers
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:14.720]  in the country and right now is writing for mclatchy news service and newspapers and he's
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:22.800]  he's he's broken a lot of just huge international uh investigative stories and and maybe later we
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:28.000]  could talk about a few of those but to talk about golden sacks secretly bet on us housing crash
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:33.680]  is greg gordon greg thanks for coming on with us my great pleasure we're about to go to break but
[3:02:33.680 --> 3:02:40.560]  just in a nutshell uh this is one of the most in-depth detailed investigative reports i've seen
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:47.040]  on the banking industry in goldman sacks this is just amazing job thank you so much uh in a
[3:02:47.040 --> 3:02:55.120]  nutshell what did you discover well we wanted to find out uh how golden sacks got out when nobody
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:03:02.080]  else did and and so the first story of the series is really about how goldman was was
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:09.040]  uh selling off at some stage it became a sell-off we don't know exactly what that date is but in
[3:03:09.040 --> 3:03:17.120]  2006 and 2007 goldman sold 39 billion dollars of of bonds essentially bonds backed by risky
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:26.000]  mortgages in the united registered in the united states uh and uh these uh uh securities uh many
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:32.880]  of them have gone south and and then in addition goldman was peddling uh more exotic securities uh
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:39.520]  many of which were tied again to risky mortgages in the united states offshore and at the same
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:46.320]  time goldman was betting in these dark markets uh through uh uh devices that are known as credit
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:52.080]  default swaps but they're basically insurance-like bets uh you're buying a little insurance policy
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:58.160]  on on some specific thing and they were they were betting that the housing market would go south
[3:03:58.160 --> 3:04:05.200]  and these bonds would all lose value so they start quietly dumping on the market
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:11.120]  triple a rated paper that was tied to derivatives or exotic instruments as they're called
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:18.320]  and at the same time betting against it after they dumped it man that is uh that is amazing
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:28.160]  well i want to be clear they were making bets that on on similar uh uh but not exactly the
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:32.640]  same security but on similar issues so in other words they were betting that the housing market
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:37.200]  is going to go bad and if the housing market goes bad all these all these mortgages are going to go
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:42.880]  south because or many of the mortgages because uh people were going to find themselves underwater
[3:04:42.880 --> 3:04:47.600]  in their houses we know people people across the country have homes that are that are worth less
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:51.360]  than their mortgages sure sure that's been well documented we're going to break come back in a

[3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:16.400]  he's written multiple parts in a detailed series the first of which we've been covering off and on
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:21.520]  for the last week and a half how goldman secretly bet on the u.s. housing crash let me just read
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:28.640]  you a couple lines from red gordon's syndicate of article it says uh the piece together to piece
[3:08:28.640 --> 3:08:34.800]  together goldman's role in subprime meltdown mclatchy reviewed hundreds of documents sec filings
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:39.440]  copies of secret investment circulars lawsuits and interviewed numerous people familiar with the
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:49.040]  firm's activities and then they go through in this article piece by piece uh mr. gordon did
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:58.480]  exactly how this was done and so just stating in layman terms what do we know goldman sacks did
[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:03.280]  they are the only big group to get out of this you talk about how this was used against their
[3:09:03.280 --> 3:09:09.280]  competition like bare sterns and others all these other groups went belly up but goldman sacks came
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:17.360]  out smelling like a rose record profits record bonuses at the same time we see an over representation
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:23.520]  of goldman sacks alumni in regulatory and government positions and i want to get into that with you
[3:09:24.240 --> 3:09:28.320]  as well but i know as a journalist you just want to stay to the facts but i also want to talk about
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:34.160]  these documents that you've got to hold up but i mean let's go through exactly what's happening here
[3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:40.560]  and and and where this is going and let me say that it's not an accident that so many goldman
[3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:48.320]  executives go on to uh senior jobs and in the in the government because goldman for for decades
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:59.760]  has encouraged its its uh members once they you know have obtained uh their wealth uh to go and
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:03.680]  do spend some time doing some public service go and work for the government so you know it sounds
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:08.800]  noble but the problem is that when the guys get into the government they end up being treasury
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:14.880]  secretary uh or head of the commodities futures trading commission which uh to regulate some of
[3:10:14.880 --> 3:10:22.880]  these uh derivatives as you call them that are that are traded uh you know outside the normal
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:30.320]  markets um you you create appearances at the minimum that are that are very awkward and and
[3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:36.720]  and in some cases disturbing now here you had hank paulson being serving as a treasury secretary
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:43.600]  at the end of the bush administration last fall in september when when everything blew up and it
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:51.360]  seemed as if every decision every key decision that was made maybe it's just a coincidence but
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:59.120]  seems as if every key decision uh where goldman sacks was a stakeholder the decision benefited
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:06.880]  goldman sacks they took over bare sterns when bare sterns collapsed and goldman had uh had
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:12.800]  contracts with bare we don't talk about this in the series but it's true and and goldman was able
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:18.560]  to you know settle out when when jp morgan took over bare sterns and that was a deal arranged by
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:26.400]  by uh paulson and then and then uh layman brothers which was a big goldman rival was allowed to go
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:32.080]  under and that is going to be a decision that will be debated for a very long time but layman's
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:40.960]  collapse caused a lot of uh disturbance in the in the markets and and there've been uh there's
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:45.520]  been a running debate about whether layman should have been rescued with the rest of them uh layman
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:53.040]  had had really had heavily in subprime and lost heavily and then uh the decision was made to bail
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:12:00.320]  out aig the american international group and goldman had placed 20 billion dollars of these
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:07.760]  insurance like bets with with the aig the american insurance or international group the american
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:16.960]  international group and so uh the goldman got paid off out of this money uh others rescue money
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:23.520]  from the government goldman was paid 12.9 billion dollars and over eight billion dollars of that
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:31.840]  related to its its secret bets uh hedging its uh subprime and and other you know related
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:39.600]  risky mortgage backed securities and and and it's also noteworthy noteworthy that when these uh
[3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:49.680]  the this 12.9 billion dollars was paid off it was a hundred cents on the dollar so it was decided
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:55.200]  even the officials at aig wanted to offer considerably less money to the various uh
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:13:00.640]  counter parties on all these bets it was holding and and by the way aig made a dreadful mistake
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:05.920]  because aig did not reinsure all these bets it just assumed that the housing market was going to
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:11.040]  go up forever and when it turned south all of a sudden instead of just getting these nice premiums
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:17.680]  from goldman and i presume bear sterns and layman brothers every year you know paying paying uh
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:22.640]  maybe a hundred million dollars a year in premium so that they could have this insurance
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:30.160]  but all of a sudden aig had this they had this you know it's reimbursed them off and pay off
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:36.400]  maybe uh 50 60 billion dollars and it it didn't have the money and that's when everything melted
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:44.720]  down well so goldman sacks really uh always benefited uh from the decisions that were made
[3:13:44.720 --> 3:13:51.280]  by it's by the government officials including its alumni gregg gordon's our guest he's an
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:57.280]  investigative journalist with mclatchy washington bureau and there's several parts in the series
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:00.960]  one is how goldman secretly bet on the u.s housing crash another
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:06.240]  goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes another one mystery why did goldman stop
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:12.000]  scrutinizing loans it bought now now let me just be clear on this reading over these pieces
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:19.680]  you have goldman sacks 2006 2007 everything's supposedly wonderful the housing market's going
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:25.120]  to keep going up forever anyone who says that's not the case is a conspiracy theorist we must
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:29.360]  give everyone a loan even if they don't even have a job or lie on their application it's the
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:37.280]  american way meanwhile they're putting out promotions saying housing's great these these
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:47.840]  instruments were selling are wonderful while betting against similar instruments did the
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:56.640]  goldman sacks massive shorting did that contribute to the overall bubble beginning to burst because
[3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:03.360]  because that gets into a whole another area not only you know are they telling people these
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:08.000]  these derivatives are great while they're separately betting against them secretly
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:15.760]  but did their shorting contribute to the bubble beginning to deflate well a couple things alex
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:21.040]  one um there were derivatives they were sold generally offshore but the stuff they were selling
[3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:28.080]  here uh and and even to offer to uh foreign uh customers but they were they were registering
[3:15:28.080 --> 3:15:33.600]  and selling them here were were bonds they were good old high yield bonds rated triple a
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:41.360]  rated triple a but yet goldman was hedging them secretly hedging them and when you do
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:45.120]  and the second thing is i just want to mention when you talked about goldman promoting the fact
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:49.600]  that the that the housing market was doing so well i've seen reports that goldman's chief
[3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:55.440]  economist was warning that the that the that a bubble was approaching but that strikes me as
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:16:03.360]  is also very um uh inconsistent or odd in that goldman had these triple a ratings on these securities
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.840]  of course they got him from ratings agencies but they always hedge their bet i mean i mean i mean
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:12.640]  sure they're out here selling them but didn't they also mention oh there might be a problem
[3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:19.520]  you know irrational exuberance down the road so oops see i told you so oh look all my competitions
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:25.520]  destroyed now oh look i'm making record profits oh look we're so noble we happen to have our people
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:32.240]  all over federal regulation systems oh man we're becoming the you know the only player now
[3:16:32.240 --> 3:16:36.560]  gee we sure screwed up we sure screwed up into all this money and power
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:45.600]  and you know the thing about they they always hedged their bets these were triple a and i asked
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:52.720]  golden sacks can you give me another example of triple a securities that you hedged like this
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:58.080]  and they did not provide such an example they said we hedged in a lot of our markets etc but
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:03.920]  to be betting the other way at the same time you're selling something as triple a the question is
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:09.200]  should they have told the investors we also are betting that the housing market's going to turn
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:14.400]  it out because it was a risk factor right in they list the risk factors in all the
[3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:19.600]  perspectives which go to investors before the we're talking about by the way pension funds
[3:17:19.600 --> 3:17:27.360]  insurance companies foreign banks union health and welfare funds institutional investors
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:33.920]  goldman says it only sold these securities to institutional investors so so the question is
[3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:40.960]  uh when when they were peddling these things why didn't they disclose that they were also
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:46.320]  betting the other way and would the investors then still have purchased these securities if they
[3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:49.920]  knew that goldman was betting that the housing market was going to turn south because one of the
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:55.920]  risk factors said uh you know it could really impact these securities if the housing market
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:18:01.280]  especially in california and florida where things were red hot and where usually about
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:06.960]  40 45 percent of every bundle of uh securities that goldman and others sold
[3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:12.640]  came from those states and again or based on mortgages that were issued were written in those
[3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:19.360]  states and so so what would have happened uh to the sales of key securities if goldman had
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:24.480]  acknowledged two investors that disclosed in formal filings with the sec or in the
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:29.840]  circulars they they passed around uh on the on the deals they did in the cayman islands
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:34.400]  what would happen would they be able to make these sales and that's a big question
[3:18:35.600 --> 3:18:40.480]  well i mean here's an example i have a gold sponsor and i have the gold sponsor on the
[3:18:40.480 --> 3:18:45.440]  air and i really believe gold was going to go up the last six years from 300 bucks an ounce to
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:53.760]  a thousand and it has you're a smart guy but but if so i mean it's simple i mean i tell people i
[3:18:53.760 --> 3:18:58.400]  believe this is great doesn't mean it's perfect nothing's a silver bullet silver and gold is as
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:05.360]  close as you get but then if it came out that i was internally betting against gold to go down
[3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:11.520]  which i believe it's going to continue to go up for a while if i was wrong that'd be okay but if
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:18.000]  it came out that i knew it was going to go down and i was telling people oh it's great here by it
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:22.080]  i could get in a lot of trouble for that the question is will goldman sacks get in trouble
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:27.200]  or do they have so many of their people in regulatory positions and larry summers running the
[3:19:27.200 --> 3:19:34.640]  white house economic area that that they're not going to get in trouble that's a good question
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:39.840]  well let's talk about that when we come back amazing series i didn't know it was a series
[3:19:39.840 --> 3:19:45.040]  to show how stupid i am i just read how goldman secretly bet on the u.s housing crash these are
[3:19:45.040 --> 3:19:51.760]  big thick meaty documented articles these are not little skinny things and then he's got a

[3:24:05.440 --> 3:24:09.440]  reg gordon investigative journalist mclatchy washington
[3:24:10.160 --> 3:24:19.680]  bureau and he's broken national investigative pieces the mini apple of star tribune
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:28.000]  the detroit news united press international he broke major stories on 9 11 epa scandals
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:39.040]  just so many other issues and he is here with us today okay the question that i posed when
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:45.680]  the break was does goldman sacks get in trouble for this i mean there's not even that i know of
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:53.760]  an investigation being done and the sec is filled with goldman sacks people and i remember paul
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:25:00.320]  sin it's in my film fall the republic he's up there testifying and they say you were at goldman sacks
[3:25:00.320 --> 3:25:06.160]  how did you congressman stern is asking him from florida how did you give your company money and
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:10.640]  he goes oh i got a waiver from and he said where'd you get a waiver from and he said oh i got a
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:17.360]  waiver from the treasury department from himself i mean it's just where does this go or or do they
[3:25:17.360 --> 3:25:23.760]  just continue to get to write the rules because i interviewed a professor yesterday that you quote
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:31.440]  in your article and he said he said that it that that that all of this is just continuing
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:36.720]  that that the same people that set all this up are just continuing and so nothing's being reformed
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:45.760]  you're talking about laurence kotlikov of washington university i believe yes and
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:51.440]  there are a lot of questions about i'm not covering the reform process because i've been
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:55.360]  doing this but there are a lot of questions about whether the right reforms are being done
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:03.600]  congress did create a commission to investigate the the the crash the causes of the crash
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:08.880]  they also we also have the securities and exchange commission which has
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:15.120]  is trying very hard right now to make amends for for really blowing the bernie made off
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:20.480]  investigation for years i mean there just was a big inspector general's report that came out
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:28.160]  last week that talked about at least six instances in which sec investigators had the had right under
[3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:34.640]  their nose opportunities to to expose this gigantic ponzi scheme that has hurt so many people and
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:40.720]  each time they they missed it they missed the the obvious failed to take the obvious investigative
[3:26:40.720 --> 3:26:45.600]  step that would have exposed the whole thing and made off basically kept shaking his head saying boy
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:50.080]  i was lucky that time so we're going to have to see whether the sec which right now under mary
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:58.720]  Shapiro its new chair is going to look at at goldman and really at all the investment banks
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:27:05.520]  and and whether or not they properly fully disclosed what they knew about these risky
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:12.320]  mortgages and one of the last piece of the series i looked at goldman's relationship with new century
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:19.040]  mortgage a company that really was one of the classic high flyers in this sort of go-go industry
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:27.200]  a new century in the mid 90s was a small company doing some subprime mortgages which were a little
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:33.920]  bit riskier than the traditional mortgages and maybe had about 300 million plus in sales
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:41.520]  in a decade later new centuries revenues approached 60 billion dollars in one year
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:48.560]  which is a staggering they were the number two behind america west and a new century had about
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:56.720]  nine deals in which they sold or their mortgages ended up in pools of of securities that that
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:04.960]  goldman sacks sold as high yield bonds and in addition a goldman sold off new century
[3:28:04.960 --> 3:28:14.640]  uh uh related securities offshore in at least three deals so we we we i callied up about
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:19.520]  five billion dollars plus in in mortgages from new century and i i think the numbers
[3:28:21.200 --> 3:28:29.280]  a bit higher and maybe quite a bit higher that goldman was was uh uh peddling in you know after
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:36.800]  converting them into bonds or other securities and and new century i got inside new century i
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:43.760]  looked at a 550 page federal bankruptcy examiner's report by the way the only one done on any
[3:28:44.560 --> 3:28:53.360]  defunct mortgage company from that era and i got networked into a bunch of former new
[3:28:53.360 --> 3:29:00.960]  century employees and they described how essentially all the lids were removed from the mortgage
[3:29:00.960 --> 3:29:11.840]  lending process late in this uh you know really red hot housing market right as it crested that's
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:18.400]  when there weren't enough borrowers to keep up with the wall street demand and so the the
[3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:27.520]  lending criteria the credit criteria just began to uh become yes uh it disappeared into thin air
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:33.120]  so this is systemic fraud from top to bottom i mean that's what it's been one of the things i
[3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:38.880]  just won't mention is alex and that is that like other wall street firms goldman hired contractors
[3:29:38.880 --> 3:29:44.240]  to look over these mortgages stay there we gotta break we gotta break come back and explain that
[3:29:44.240 --> 3:29:52.960]  to us okay and then we'll ask you about some other points in your series we're on the march

[3:33:21.280 --> 3:33:26.000]  bottom that they run all the regulators they control the entire system these big banks and
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:31.360]  brokerage firms and they're going to destroy our society if we don't stop them and that the fraud

[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:21.040]  the same system is still there the same people that ran all this are still in positions of power
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:26.400]  they control both the major parties and it's just getting worse and worse
[3:34:26.400 --> 3:34:30.080]  greg gordon has written three parts that i see in the series there may be more
[3:34:30.080 --> 3:34:34.560]  how goldman secretly bet on the u.s housing crash goldman takes on new role taking away people's
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:39.120]  homes mystery why did goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought i want to briefly in the 10
[3:34:39.120 --> 3:34:44.080]  minutes or less that we have left with our guest today go over some of that we'll give you the
[3:34:44.080 --> 3:34:48.960]  latest on the shootings around the country unfortunately in florida and texas some new
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:54.160]  developments there okay going back to greg gordon greg you were trying to say something as we went
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:34:58.960]  to break i was just going to mention that the wall street firms as you would expect them to do
[3:34:58.960 --> 3:35:09.440]  hired contractors to look over pools of mortgages before they they were actually purchased and it's
[3:35:09.440 --> 3:35:16.000]  very interesting what happened here i've managed to find some of the people who were looking over
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:21.920]  these loans including a former project manager who would not be identified for fear it would ruin his
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:30.000]  career who said that he watched as the number of loans that were reviewed in each pool the
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:36.560]  percentage of loans declined steadily from me from really a hundred percent at the beginning
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:42.960]  to 10 percent or less at the end so they weren't looking at but a small sample of the loans at the
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:48.720]  end then you had the problem of the of the reviewers these are some of these people were
[3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:53.120]  very experienced have been in the lending business for 10 20 years and they'd look at a loan they'd
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:36:01.040]  say hey this this person is a landscaper making $10,000 this person's a is a hairdresser claiming
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:10.400]  $10,000 a month and and and this person here is a checker at walmart claiming a $5,000 a month
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:15.840]  in income and they're getting these big loans but how do you justify this we have to stop this
[3:36:15.840 --> 3:36:22.160]  loan because this is not legit and they'd be told no we have to follow the guidelines of the mortgage
[3:36:22.160 --> 3:36:28.560]  lender and this mortgage lender this particular kind of loan is a what's known as a stated income
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:35.200]  loan the stated income loan became known later on as a liar's loan there was no verification
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:42.960]  of the of the credit qualifications so we had fraud engineered into the system so here's the
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:50.160]  issue we see made-off go to jail we see ken lay get convicted but looking at this it seems as if
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:58.640]  their crimes are smaller diminutive are dwarfed by these bigger institutional hedged frauds where
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:04.560]  they all kind of you know pass on the guilt to each other and then everyone just acts stupid
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:12.560]  and you know there's no kingpin made-off or or or ken lay but in the aggregate it's it's it's it's
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:19.440]  galaxy's bigger and you can't get rid of these people they run the system still i mean it are
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:24.880]  we just drifting towards destruction well i don't know whether we're drifting towards
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:30.240]  destruction but it's it's clear that this was a chain of profit that began from a real estate
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:38.960]  agent through the appraiser the mortgage broker the mortgage lender the securitizer and the and
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:45.760]  the ratings agencies you couldn't have done this however at this scale without the ratings agencies
[3:37:45.760 --> 3:37:50.960]  who bestowed these triple a ratings on these securities and without wall street which which
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:57.520]  turned a fairly nominally sized market into a two trillion dollar market so so they're the kingpins
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:05.680]  so so the buck stops with the with the with the regulators or we'll see i'm not going to get by
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:09.360]  but i'm not going to i'm not going to make any predictions what the regulators are going to do
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:14.960]  not after the made-off case uh we'll see whether they are willing to go in there and subpoena
[3:38:15.840 --> 3:38:23.920]  goldman sacks to find out exactly what bets and what the the chronology was uh the timing of all
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:30.880]  these secret bets and what they were and what people knew most important perhaps probably
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:34.960]  what did people know while they were making the secret bets did they know they were peddling
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:39.200]  toxic waste and they needed to ensure themselves and that's why they bought 20 billion dollars
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:45.280]  and insurance like bets with aig or or was this just uh as they as goldman sacks would put it
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:54.320]  were they just positioning repositioning their portfolio it's it's just mind-blowing to see
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:59.760]  something like this at this magnitude going on and no one's been brought to justice to add insult
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:07.360]  to injury record profits for goldman sacks record bonuses and it's going on at these other big firms
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:15.120]  bonuses at aig bonuses at jp morgan bonuses all around while the real economy goes belly
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:23.360]  up and unemployment skyrockets that's correct well we'll have to see uh we'll have to see
[3:39:23.360 --> 3:39:28.480]  whether we get an investigation you asked me before about about the uh but what goldman is
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  doing now and it is it is interesting and sad to note that like the other wall street firms
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:41.520]  goldman sacks this 24 karat wall street firm has been reduced to going into court around the country
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:48.640]  and and filing papers to seize the homes of people who borrowed uh on subprime mortgages
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:52.480]  and who would never have many of them would never been able to get these loans if wall
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:56.560]  street hadn't created such a big market now they're losing their homes a lot of these people
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:01.360]  because their credit is so filed up we'll never be able to qualify to buy up to to get another
[3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:08.160]  mortgage again well it's a predatory vertical integration of the economy uh strip mining is
[3:40:08.160 --> 3:40:13.680]  is the way i would describe it but but certainly goldman has come out better than anybody in this
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:18.640]  a lot most of their competitors are dead and gone they've made record profits they've got their
[3:40:18.640 --> 3:40:26.240]  people everywhere in every regulatory agency in the white house and so it paid off i mean it looks
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:32.720]  like this paid looks like uh you know why did uh why did that famous gangster rob banks because
[3:40:32.720 --> 3:40:38.240]  that's where the money was and i guess nobody will even point the finger at him and so they'll
[3:40:38.640 --> 3:40:45.120]  i mean i guess that's it they win let's let's say this the in fairness uh and and you know nobody's
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:49.600]  feeling terribly fair toward goldman's wanting to be terribly fair toward goldman sacks because
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:54.800]  they're making so much money in this horrible climate right now economic climate but but
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:41:00.000]  goldman this is this is not the only market goldman was in and they're very smart they get the best
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:03.840]  in the brightest out of every week schools and they're very smart they make a lot of money in a
[3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:10.720]  lot of places what's what's uh uh drawn our attention is just the fact that goldman wasn't
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:18.320]  a small player and they got out they made it out safely and nobody else really did and they just
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:24.080]  so happened to have all the regulators well amazing and and and now they're running around
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:28.400]  you've got an investigative report on that one of the most aggressive groups i correct me if i'm
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:36.720]  wrong going after people's houses well there was a disturbing example uh a couple named uh tony
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:44.320]  and ceilia becker from san jose at a 1500 square foot house and they took a couple of mortgages out
[3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:49.360]  to support a jewelry business that have been hit with the wildfires and other things that happened
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:54.000]  in california and and uh they were they were having some financial problems they took these
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:59.600]  mortgages out just to free up some cash to try to keep their business afloat and they fell behind
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:04.000]  nonetheless on the payments when the second wildfire kind of wiped out the whole area around
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:09.840]  there around their business and so they they needed to they've discovered a clause in the mortgages
[3:42:09.840 --> 3:42:16.480]  that allowed them to negotiate uh to defer some of the loan payments and they needed to negotiate
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:22.080]  with their lender to get this deferral the only problem was nobody would admit to being the lender
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:28.000]  the goldman had bought the mortgages from a subprime lender and and denied that it owned
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:31.920]  the mortgages which might have been technically true because they were stuck in a trust at the time
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:37.040]  but they knew where they were and and this couple wrote a letter to goldman's chairman none other
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:44.560]  than henry paulson at the time 2003 and it took three years before a sort of an obscure
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:50.720]  goldman subsidiary acknowledged at a court hearing that yes goldman held their mortgage
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:56.480]  and then it took another three years until just a couple months ago they finally got a concession
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:00.880]  from goldman and goldman gave them a new mortgage and at five percent interest now this couple it
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:06.160]  was a novel case because they had some claims some investment loss claims against goldman
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:10.880]  it's mother wall street firms and goldman settled up with them but the question is how could goldman
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:16.960]  take so long just to acknowledge that that it owned their mortgage yeah how can you well i mean
[3:43:16.960 --> 3:43:24.160]  i've got a mortgage and over the years it's been sold i think five times and then i would have
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:28.400]  them threatening me over escrow money and i'd say i paid that bank and then they wouldn't
[3:43:28.400 --> 3:43:34.000]  say who bought it well another company now has it send your check here send your check there
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:38.400]  you know make your wireless payment here make your wireless payment there and then i read about
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:45.840]  it's been on cnn where people actually own a house but then they say paperwork wasn't filed right
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:53.840]  and so banks come in and start repossessing i mean this is crazy it's a very common problem a lot of
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:43:59.120]  these a lot of these wall street firms did not always file papers in the local with the local
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:05.040]  registrar of deeds it's called an assignment of mortgage and it makes clear who the mortgage holder
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:10.560]  is and a lot of times they didn't file these papers properly so many people when they try to
[3:44:10.560 --> 3:44:14.400]  modify their mortgage or refinance or whatever they run into all kinds of problems because they
[3:44:14.400 --> 3:44:20.000]  can't figure out uh you know the title companies they want to know who who has the mortgage who
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:23.760]  we're paying off are they going to get a pay off figure if you can't even figure out who owns the
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:30.960]  mortgage and it just goes on and on and on and instead of more transparency it looks like we're
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:35.280]  it looks like we're getting less well i guess we're going to see more in this series or are you
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:40.240]  done writing about the goldman sacks for now we got a lot of leads in response to this series we'll
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:45.920]  see if any of them uh turned fruitful but we're i'm i'm trying to find i'm following a number of
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:51.280]  them right now trying to see where they go we'll see if we can some can gen up some good uh follow
[3:44:51.280 --> 3:44:56.320]  stories okay greg gordon with the classy newspapers award-winning investigative journalists and i mean

[3:45:16.960 --> 3:45:23.440]  prison planet reportedly blasted eight people uh you've got this well it's guaranteed to be a prozac
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:30.320]  head psychiatrist at fort hood they're trying to spin into terrorism it could be that could be a
[3:45:30.320 --> 3:45:37.440]  staged event we'll find out later as bob Chapman said it is too early right now for me to see
[3:45:37.440 --> 3:45:41.600]  sit here and tell you that i don't have any idea what's going on i'll tell you this it stinks to
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:51.920]  high heaven my nose is rarely wrong and it's telling me that this stinks bad and if we keep
[3:45:51.920 --> 3:45:57.600]  seeing more shootings and they turn out to be on drugs or turn out to be army psychiatrist or
[3:45:57.600 --> 3:46:07.200]  you know it just very very suspicious right now and uh we are we are looking at that in detail
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:14.800]  meanwhile we've got distractions in and around this story uh the big talk on the fake conservative
[3:46:14.800 --> 3:46:19.120]  stations you know they don't want to talk about the global carbon tax treaty they don't want to talk
[3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:25.840]  about all the really serious issues or how the republicans are in bed with goldman sacks jp morgan
[3:46:25.840 --> 3:46:31.200]  the private federal reserve just as much as obama no they're all oh we're the conservatives we'll be
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:35.280]  back in power in the next year and a half in congress and we'll fix it all yeah let's see if
[3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:41.520]  that happens when they get in just like we'll see if it happens when obama got in and then when i'm
[3:46:41.520 --> 3:46:46.080]  attacking the republican congress in a year and a half when they get control of the house which they're
[3:46:46.080 --> 3:46:52.720]  probably gonna do i'll be called a commie again i'm being called a right-wing extremist right now
[3:46:52.720 --> 3:46:58.720]  because i don't like the political horror that reads off a teleprompter who's barack obama no
[3:46:58.720 --> 3:47:03.600]  i'm a constitutionalist i'm a truth teller i'm somebody that just tells the truth lets the
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:10.400]  chips fall where they may we make a mistake we admit it we're right we trumpet it we're here
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:17.600]  you can judge us by our track record by the fruits of what we produce what we create what we do but
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:25.120]  this indignation of the citizenry getting mad having their political angers dissipated like a
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:31.760]  steam valve on ridiculous crap obama's giving a speech yesterday they load his teleprompter
[3:47:31.760 --> 3:47:38.480]  i've gone and pulled the video up with prepared remarks he reads off the the i'm not defending
[3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:45.120]  obama but i'm not going to spend all day on some puppet and ask the listeners what do you think
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:52.240]  of obama not caring about the troops what do you think of obama being disrespectful to him
[3:47:52.240 --> 3:47:59.280]  that's a mind game the media is playing with you this guy gets up there reads off a teleprompter
[3:47:59.280 --> 3:48:04.880]  says oh our hearts go out to everybody who was hurt you know after he said thanks to congressional
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:10.160]  medal honor winner and thanks to the people that are there two minutes in he talks about the shooting
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:16.960]  as if he's the president as if he's running anything it's all about it's obama and everything stops
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:26.160]  with obama and obama really runs things that way in three to seven years whenever he leaves office
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:33.200]  whether he's one term or two it can all be blamed on him and then we'll get another fake
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:38.240]  right winger and then in four day years it can all be blamed on him again and then we'll get another
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:44.720]  democrat and then we can build them up and tear them down and make it all about how they're making
[3:48:44.720 --> 3:48:50.400]  the decision obama's making the decision on whether to increase troops in afghanistan they've
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:56.480]  already sent in two groups of troops they've increased it right at 40 000 more but they make
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:49:01.600]  it all about a debate will there be more after that and what decision will he make will he make
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:10.080]  the right decision it's just all a big theater game no doubt about it it means nothing
[3:49:13.760 --> 3:49:19.920]  it means absolutely nothing did the media make a big deal about it when obama's
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:23.360]  controllers six months ago wanted to make veterans pay for their own medical care
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:31.200]  no because the establishment doesn't care about the veterans they're scared of the veterans they
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:36.720]  don't like you they use fake patriotism to control you that's why they're banning a lot of veterans
[3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:42.320]  from owning guns are veterans with guns dangerous you bet they are some are dangerous to criminals
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:47.520]  some are dangerous to their wives and kids that's just the way it is to be an empire with a bunch
[3:49:47.520 --> 3:49:53.680]  of trained killers coming back and living amongst us you don't take my guns because a bunch of trained
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:50:00.560]  killers may go crazy at any minute and you sure don't blame the whole military because a small
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:06.720]  percentage of them are going to go cuckoo for cocoa puffs and fly over the cuckoo nest that's why
[3:50:06.720 --> 3:50:11.360]  i've got my guns some crazy vet goes running around trying to shoot a bunch of people i'm
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:16.720]  going to go out and deal with them it's not because i'm macho or tough folks it's what you're supposed
[3:50:16.720 --> 3:50:21.520]  to do i don't know how they turned this country into a bunch of cowards and how it's amazing
[3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:27.440]  that this female cop went to shot this reported lunatic four times didn't kill him they said he
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:31.840]  killed him for six hours and they're all marveling that a cop would just run in and shoot somebody
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:37.040]  what do you think cops did 20 30 years ago they didn't need all the gear and all the crap
[3:50:39.680 --> 3:50:44.560]  but a woman is now tougher than the average cop and i just don't even know what to say about it
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:51.040]  anymore it it again it makes my head spin that at every other major shooting two three four hours
[3:50:51.040 --> 3:50:56.240]  they make the cops wait while the shooter runs around killing everybody i guess the feds give
[3:50:56.240 --> 3:51:02.400]  that order so the kill rates higher now maybe the cops aren't cowards i don't know hello friends this

[3:53:09.520 --> 3:53:14.080]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[3:53:14.080 --> 3:53:17.840]  had all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[3:53:17.840 --> 3:53:22.640]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[3:53:22.640 --> 3:53:28.720]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of

[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:37.680]  you're on the air hi alex long time listener here i want to pass on the observations that the
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:43.200]  official countdown to judgment day tea party tour rally after attending the abalone rally this morning
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:47.760]  and hearing just a few of their host speakers it appears that the tea party movement's been hijacked
[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:52.880]  big money republican agents who are pushing the pro-military pro-war agenda of the old bush neocon
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:57.840]  regime they have speakers promoting u.s aggression against radical islam tear and the main guy running
[3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:02.480]  the tea party tours pushing his book which supports the neocon fallacy of a total islamic attack on
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:07.600]  9 11 the majority of this abalone crowd does not know your work and if you mentioned 9 11 was an
[3:55:07.600 --> 3:55:12.880]  inside job they spit in your face and they spit in my face today and consider you an obaminoid
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:17.040]  i made the mistake of passing out tear storm fires about false flag tear but these area
[3:55:17.040 --> 3:55:21.840]  veterans and local dies air force base folks can't accept that the u.s military has been hijacked
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:26.000]  the tea party tour will not have speakers who expose the new old order and that the elite
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:32.800]  insiders are behind 9 11 so they demonized cindy sheham and the abalone crowd brood booder
[3:55:32.800 --> 3:55:37.680]  when her name was mentioned they never speak of the phrase new old order this tea party caravan
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:42.640]  is headed to austin at five o'clock you're where you're at today you need to be there and push 9 11
[3:55:42.640 --> 3:55:51.520]  truth absolutely i mean what's happened is this is what glenbeck's for he guides and takes the
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:57.520]  ron paul revolution he's taking it over only by ron paul coming out public not attacking back
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:02.720]  and others but stating the true principles can we take control of it back but i mean this is
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:07.840]  why the leader in power they know how to control the left obama was meant to take control of that
[3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:18.080]  glenbeck rush limbaugh created fake clone on the right two wings on the same bird and again the
[3:56:18.080 --> 3:56:23.840]  mainline tea party people there is no new world order the carbon tax isn't global government glenbeck
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:28.720]  a few weeks ago attacked the british lord that came out and said global government i mean come on
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:34.960]  glenn so see he does that at key points he admits things that are true and then goes back on them
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:39.920]  that's why i like lou dobbs a lot better i mean he doesn't go as far as back on some issues but
[3:56:39.920 --> 3:56:45.360]  he's consistent and isn't involved in backstabbing that i've seen and that's why his house is getting
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:50.560]  shot up but i appreciate your call um look it's not going to matter if they take over the tea
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:56.000]  parties people are finding out about world government the economy is collapsing we're there
[3:56:56.000 --> 3:57:02.640]  educating people about the real threat the best film to give a neo connoid who are the real
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:07.920]  obama supporters the bush people just held over into obama they should love obama he's keeping
[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:13.040]  all the neocons in the defense department give them fall the republic this shatters the left
[3:57:13.040 --> 3:57:19.600]  right paradigm they've never been exposed to this they're like they're like blind people who've never
[3:57:19.600 --> 3:57:25.200]  seen trying to describe something to them they're trying to describe the way the seashore looks
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:32.160]  they've never seen they can't interface they can't understand they can't begin to even
[3:57:32.160 --> 3:57:36.560]  realize what we're trying to say to them if you just argue with them they think you're a liberal
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:41.680]  you're coming don't give me mouse a tune you know they don't want to hear bush triple the size of
[3:57:41.680 --> 3:57:48.160]  government they want to believe the lie but if you say hey this film exposes obama which it does
[3:57:48.160 --> 3:57:54.080]  but it also exposes bush and the whole agenda watch this that's why ted's gonna run some ads on
[3:57:54.080 --> 3:57:59.120]  national radio for the neocons because we need to deprogram these people and the left this film
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:05.360]  it's been to deprogram people in the control left right paradigm who think that inside the box
[3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:09.920]  you know inside this little contained area that's the whole world we're gonna go no
[3:58:10.800 --> 3:58:18.160]  look for yourself it's much bigger it's much more sophisticated and a lot of them won't wake up now
