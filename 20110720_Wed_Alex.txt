[00:19.040 --> 00:40.200]  Texas Alex Jones well we have a information packed transmission lined up

[00:55.240 --> 01:00.080]  I thought was joining a shesday joining us today to give us his take on the whole
[01:00.080 --> 01:03.640]  news corps scandal that's threatening to bring down the prime minister and the
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.520]  head of news corps Rupert Murdoch Tony Gosling BBC researcher radio talk show
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.800]  host of the proprietor bill de burg.org he'll be joining us with James Corbett
[01:14.800 --> 01:20.400]  with the corporate report Webster Tarpley on the latest on Libya is Gaddafi
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.640]  really going to step down will the ground invasion set for late September
[01:24.640 --> 01:31.080]  early October be called off what about the press reports of Berlusone the El
[01:31.080 --> 01:38.320]  Presidente of Italia of Italy reportedly being involved shipping the arms into
[01:38.320 --> 01:41.920]  Gaddafi when we know the British government was that's on record including
[01:41.920 --> 01:48.040]  Gordon Brown before him and Tony Blair before David Cameron so it's a barrel
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.160]  of snakes and those three guests are joining us today but not until the midway
[01:53.160 --> 02:02.480]  point or the point of no return at 1230 central standard time today now if you're
[02:02.480 --> 02:08.760]  watching on prisonplanet.tv we can show you this giant array of news and I talk
[02:08.760 --> 02:14.040]  about this a lot every day every week it gets crazier and crazier the news
[02:14.040 --> 02:20.720]  contained here is evidence of everything we talked about 16 years ago a decade ago
[02:20.720 --> 02:27.560]  five years ago coming true it's all here genetically engineered crops designed
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.200]  to sterilize you government taking babies blood at birth bio weapons programs
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.880]  toll roads you pay for three times global government bank receivership
[02:38.880 --> 02:44.440]  dollar complete devaluation police with retina scanners at checkpoints taking
[02:44.440 --> 02:54.360]  blood and then a lot of other really bizarre crazy stuff in the mix you know
[02:54.360 --> 03:01.720]  a federal court will rule that if you accidentally serve a Hindu a pastry with
[03:01.720 --> 03:07.480]  some meat in it that you that you're liable but if the TSA wants to grab
[03:07.480 --> 03:14.280]  your child's genitals and violate federal and state law it's okay or I've
[03:14.280 --> 03:17.600]  seen federal court rulings were criticizing the police can get you in
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.840]  jail but then there's been a federal court ruling that a man was allowed to
[03:21.840 --> 03:28.160]  say that he wanted to kill Obama that's in the LA Times today so a lot of
[03:28.160 --> 03:34.560]  really bizarre stuff and by the way I read his supposed free speech it is a
[03:34.560 --> 03:41.960]  call to action and I'm a public figure I don't like a precedent where but this
[03:41.960 --> 03:48.400]  goes for anybody where somebody can say I'm gonna kill you and you don't get in
[03:48.400 --> 03:56.080]  trouble I am for any type of speech 110% until you cross the line with a call to
[03:56.080 --> 04:04.000]  action and the minute you say well we ought to go kill this person or we
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.720]  ought to go kill that person number one if you're actually gonna go try to kill
[04:10.720 --> 04:16.680]  somebody well how about you not talk about it that's another good rule but
[04:16.680 --> 04:22.040]  here's another statement the last thing we want is for anything to happen to
[04:22.040 --> 04:31.320]  President Obama that would turn this lame duck destroyed burnout globalist
[04:31.320 --> 04:37.520]  personality into a martyr so we want to take good care of Obama so down the
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.600]  road we take the Republic back Obama and his cohorts and the Republican Party as
[04:41.600 --> 04:47.440]  well can have nice prison cells where they're gonna live out the rest of their
[04:47.440 --> 04:54.680]  lives and where we can basically have them on display even the Bible talks
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.200]  about once the Satan's defeated he'll be on display for a thousand years that's
[04:58.200 --> 05:04.400]  a good idea hi this is Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct Babs you

[07:04.000 --> 07:08.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[07:08.200 --> 07:12.500]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[07:12.500 --> 07:16.480]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.840 --> 07:25.160]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:25.160 --> 07:28.920]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.920 --> 07:33.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.040 --> 07:37.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.840 --> 07:43.520]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.520 --> 07:47.040]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[07:47.040 --> 07:52.640]  www.MySolarBackup.com that's MySolarBackup.com remember the government

[07:59.520 --> 08:05.400]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.400 --> 08:22.760]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:22.760 --> 08:30.560]  it is Wednesday the 20th day of July 2011 we've got a jam-packed roster of
[08:30.560 --> 08:35.120]  guests joining us in the second hour of transmission today I'll tell you more
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.560]  about those guests coming up but we're going to break down the Libya situation
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.880]  is war on or isn't it I mean we know the continued bombardment is ongoing but
[08:44.880 --> 08:48.680]  is ground invasion going to happen as the military has been told to be ready
[08:48.680 --> 08:54.400]  for in late September early October I certainly hope it's off the table because
[08:54.400 --> 09:00.880]  if it isn't it is going to be a huge casualty causing event that's death for
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.840]  folks that don't know their military terms for our military and the Libyan
[09:06.840 --> 09:11.880]  military and the Libyan people most importantly so we're going to be going
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.280]  over that with Webster Griffin Tarpley economist and doctor of history James
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.880]  Corbett of the Corbett Report will be joining us and Tony Gosling a reporter
[09:18.880 --> 09:23.800]  from England on the huge scandal that is threatening to bring down the Prime
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.040]  Minister of England David Cameron and the head of News Corp. Rupert Murdoch I
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.320]  got some into this today but later I want to be reminded by the producers to get
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.560]  back into the fact that four months ago media matters memo went public and they
[09:40.560 --> 09:45.320]  admitted it was their memo that they would get hired at Fox and sabotage and
[09:45.320 --> 09:54.440]  infiltrate to quote destroy them and I made the point that if I tried to get
[09:54.440 --> 10:00.720]  my employees hired into competitors operations that that's espionage not
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.760]  that I have any competitors as I've said I'm not in an industry I'm not in a
[10:04.760 --> 10:10.840]  business I'm on a mission to restore the Republic and the spirit of 1776 worldwide
[10:10.840 --> 10:17.360]  a rediscovery of freedom but this is serious crimes admitted by judicial
[10:17.360 --> 10:24.000]  watch similar to what we see News Corp doing and so I say burn Rupert Murdoch
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.480]  and burn George Soros burn them all this selective enforcement stuff though
[10:29.480 --> 10:33.600]  really gets me mad and if you're not gonna enforce across the board well
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.960]  then leave Rupert Murdoch alone I'd rather just have anarchy and everybody
[10:37.960 --> 10:43.120]  fends for themselves if you're not going to enforce it across the board you
[10:43.120 --> 10:49.840]  know it's better that ten guilty men go free that one innocent man one innocent
[10:49.840 --> 10:56.360]  man go to prison or be executed I've got some good news before I plunge into all
[10:56.360 --> 10:59.840]  of the news and information I have in front of me I have a tendency to always
[10:59.840 --> 11:04.120]  kick the broadcast off with some observation I've made of the media I
[11:04.120 --> 11:10.720]  don't watch a lot of television but I do monitor talk radio on XM serious got
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.440]  serious in the house XM in the car same company but different channels to
[11:15.440 --> 11:19.480]  smorgasbord some of the same channels on each I listen religiously to talk
[11:19.480 --> 11:26.640]  radio late at night when I'm reading and I scan the dial online and on the AM
[11:26.640 --> 11:32.440]  dial and the good news is liberal shows conservative libertarian rock and roll
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.840]  shows I was listening to the Dudley and Bob show on 93.7 FM here in town the
[11:38.840 --> 11:47.720]  kale BJ FM twin of the AM I'm on 590 and the callers were making jokes about it
[11:47.720 --> 11:51.560]  and the host were they don't normally talk about serious issues about how
[11:51.560 --> 11:57.120]  ridiculous it is that the main star witness who could bring down the police
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.560]  for bribery and we've already had the two police chiefs resigned in London the
[12:01.560 --> 12:05.240]  Metro police commissioner and the head of Scotland Yard and could bring down
[12:05.240 --> 12:08.680]  the prime minister confirmed to be involved in it I mean the head guy
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.280]  running the whole operation was his head media director from news corps in
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.760]  Cameron's camp Cameron's a kept politician of Rupert Murdoch that's not
[12:17.760 --> 12:23.240]  debated is political mistress you could say and you've got this huge scandal
[12:23.240 --> 12:29.560]  news corps execs arrested and magically the star witness dies and then tells his
[12:29.560 --> 12:32.360]  friends they're after me they're threatening to kill me and then the
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.520]  newspapers I read quotes yesterday are calling it a conspiracy theory you're
[12:36.520 --> 12:40.840]  a conspiracy theorist if a guy saying they're after me I've got to hide don't
[12:40.840 --> 12:44.040]  don't if anybody asked if I'm home I'm not hiding out in the house with his
[12:44.040 --> 12:52.200]  lights off and he dies and the police within 20 minutes come out and say and
[12:52.200 --> 12:55.680]  I love the shows I've been listening to her all reading the quotes that we don't
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.960]  believe there's any foul play and this appears to not be suspicious and so we're
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.400]  not opening a criminal investigation a star witness dies I mean you better have
[13:05.400 --> 13:11.240]  the most complex autopsies on earth dot on this guy the poisons corporations
[13:11.240 --> 13:14.840]  can get a hold of that governments can get a hold of remember of the 100
[13:14.840 --> 13:19.320]  biggest economies in the world 50 plus are not governments or countries they
[13:19.320 --> 13:27.080]  are corporations I told you last week if this continued look for deaths I told
[13:27.080 --> 13:31.320]  you that if Congress doesn't drop fast and furious against the ATF caught
[13:31.320 --> 13:38.880]  shipping guns into Illinois with the FBI and DEA into Texas into Florida into
[13:38.880 --> 13:43.120]  Cal folks they're shipping guns into gangs everywhere there's gangs that work
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.280]  for the government and there's gangs that get killed by the gangs that work
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.640]  for the government it's called the untouchables it's called the real mafia
[13:51.640 --> 13:55.800]  structure in America and if one gang gets up at a it happens to beat the gang
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.680]  muscle that works for the big banks that control the police they send in police
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.400]  hit teams and every major police department has a squad of hit men and
[14:04.400 --> 14:09.400]  that's come out in Boston it's come out in New York it's come out on in LA was
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.520]  the first place it came out in the 60s they got his teams of men with badges
[14:13.520 --> 14:19.120]  and guns and when they hit they hit hard okay I don't have to sit here and
[14:19.120 --> 14:22.760]  explain this to people I shouldn't have to but stop acting like little children
[14:22.760 --> 14:27.680]  you better admit how corrupt and rotten we've gotten oh you don't think the
[14:27.680 --> 14:31.280]  banks are involved in narcotics trafficking 500 billion a year just in
[14:31.280 --> 14:35.640]  cocaine and heroin coming into the US laundered in banks that have all been
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.000]  caught laundering it and don't get in trouble small bank gets caught they go
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.160]  to jail that happens all the time competitors get caught they go to
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.280]  jail police have been caught in every major department in the country living
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.960]  in multi-million dollar houses and driving brand new Corvettes with drugs
[14:50.960 --> 14:54.640]  and then it's not enough to go shake down the drug dealers now they pull you
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.320]  over to Dallas on record throw a bag of chalk in the back of your brand
[14:58.320 --> 15:02.640]  new Mercedes and take it no judge no jury asset for which your seizure federal
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.760]  law all right you see I'm now ranting and I'm gonna burn up this entire hour
[15:08.760 --> 15:15.200]  and I've got so much news it's almost like before you exercise you're about
[15:15.200 --> 15:18.200]  to go on that little two-mile jog you're out of shape like I am and you kind of
[15:18.200 --> 15:21.640]  hesitate and kind of stretch for a while and you're like oh man this is
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.320]  gonna be quite a marathon here and you don't really get to it ladies and
[15:25.320 --> 15:31.480]  gentlemen the news before me this stuff is insane but getting back to what I was
[15:31.480 --> 15:37.840]  saying the good news is every radio show I listen to and I've never heard
[15:37.840 --> 15:47.760]  something like this every show local talk rock shows country stations because
[15:47.760 --> 15:53.400]  I scan through the dial are all making jokes and laughing at the government and
[15:53.400 --> 15:58.480]  giggling when they say oh you're a conspiracy theorist if you question that
[15:58.480 --> 16:01.800]  the police within 20 minutes of the guy being found dead said it's nothing no
[16:01.800 --> 16:07.320]  foul play move along I mean I could be hiding in my house saying help me they
[16:07.320 --> 16:11.200]  said they're coming to kill me and then I'm found dead and the police show up
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.320]  saying nothing nothing going on there's still no criminal investigation in LA
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.800]  with one of the richest men in America this big big pharma owner he owns one
[16:22.800 --> 16:26.960]  of the big three pharma companies and his son falls down the stairs goes into
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.800]  a coma and dies then his girlfriend who was watching the child when it
[16:31.800 --> 16:36.480]  reportedly happened is found hanging off the front balcony her mouth bound her
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.960]  arms and legs bound hanging dead she's taking care of the kid dad gets mad
[16:42.960 --> 16:49.440]  that his son's in a coma kids now died somebody dies the point is even if it's
[16:49.440 --> 16:53.440]  a crime of passion and I'm not saying the dad did it and I'm just I'm saying he
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.920]  might be a suspect let me see his sons in a coma the woman watching him the
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.000]  girlfriend the hot girlfriend she is found obviously murdered and the police
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.960]  say this we don't think there's anything you can read the quotes we don't I
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.280]  forget the exact what's something like we don't really see anything suspicious
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.680]  and we're not you're looking at this right now is foul play being involved you
[17:16.680 --> 17:20.560]  can pull up the quotes in both cases are very similar with something like that
[17:20.560 --> 17:24.960]  even more ridiculous when you read it I read it on the show Monday you know the
[17:24.960 --> 17:29.880]  quotes out of that case and I hear this these shows not all of them but several

[24:26.280 --> 24:29.800]  continue in this short segment just going over the waterfront of news and
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.840]  I'm coming back to getting into it more detail than the entire first 30 minutes
[24:33.840 --> 24:40.200]  of the second hour will be open phones now continuing with the story I was
[24:40.200 --> 24:44.280]  telling earlier before I get back into just the headlines here and a brief
[24:44.280 --> 24:50.280]  analysis before I dive back into the top stories the good news is everybody does
[24:50.280 --> 24:57.120]  know that the dice are loaded that the fight was fixed that the bad guys have
[24:57.120 --> 25:02.080]  won but people don't believe they have power and they believe that they're
[25:02.080 --> 25:06.760]  alone they don't know that everybody knows everybody at the end of the day
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.960]  knows this country is going in the wrong direction that we've entered a very
[25:11.960 --> 25:19.240]  decadent cycle of civilization but people feel powerless folks when you get
[25:19.240 --> 25:23.040]  involved when you speak out when you say no to corruption when you don't
[25:23.040 --> 25:29.000]  submit to unconstitutional activity you politically and physically sabotage
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.680]  evil you slow it down and and you give humanity time to develop strategies to
[25:37.680 --> 25:42.280]  defeat these people we're having a lot of victories and the reason we're
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.560]  starting to have victories against the globalist is because people like myself
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.480]  and others were willing to be criticized we're willing to be laughed at
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.520]  we're willing to be attacked Ron Paul 35 years ago myself 16 years ago many
[25:56.520 --> 26:00.560]  others going back more than 50 years we're willing to be demonized we're
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.040]  willing to have the FBI try to plant hand grenades in their garage like Bob
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.680]  Chapman he's had to leave the country because he kept beating them in court
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.440]  and they kept coming after him for other things a lot of people paid with their
[26:13.440 --> 26:21.400]  lives show that this information common sense could be mainline again and so
[26:21.400 --> 26:25.360]  that's the great important news is that more and more I listen to talk radio I
[26:25.360 --> 26:31.240]  hear the information I talk about being discussed and I hear people not buying it
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.800]  when a woman is obviously murdered and the police say she wasn't or when they
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.720]  obviously it's a hit when the star witness dies and tells folks they're
[26:39.720 --> 26:45.280]  coming after me it's obviously a hit when they kill the DC madam and I told her
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.000]  on there I said you better tell folks you're not to commit suicide she said I
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.160]  never will and I said listen you need to release the full names your client list
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.040]  or they're going to kill you and she said well I'm gonna hold on to that and I
[26:56.040 --> 27:01.920]  said that's a bad move and they murdered her and she told her condo
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.160]  manager she was good friends with she says I'm getting some documents my mom
[27:05.160 --> 27:11.400]  before I've got to go to prison people are following me and of course they
[27:11.400 --> 27:15.000]  killed her they grabbed her they hung her in her mom's shed her elderly mother
[27:15.000 --> 27:23.160]  shed and got the documents out of the car and I even had her manager of the
[27:23.160 --> 27:28.720]  condo send me her lease and it was not even her handwriting the handwriting of
[27:28.720 --> 27:32.600]  her suicide note looked like it was a completely different hand it wasn't
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.000]  that it was a bad fake it wasn't it was shoddily done they might as well have
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.040]  drawn it in Crayola but but but see now they don't even write fake suicide notes
[27:40.040 --> 27:46.360]  you mean you got a woman hanging down and bound and gagged dead and the police
[27:46.360 --> 27:55.480]  in L.A. say it no investigation and you know they kill this guy in England star
[27:55.480 --> 27:59.880]  witness and no investigation just forget suicide notes you know what we just
[27:59.880 --> 28:06.720]  found the body case closed they have why is the system why has the United
[28:06.720 --> 28:10.160]  Nations come out in the last year we got the documents a year ago actually
[28:10.160 --> 28:14.560]  Newscore did and the UN admits they're real and then they say a year ago we're
[28:14.560 --> 28:17.920]  gonna move now to openly saying humans are bad yes we want to reduce
[28:17.920 --> 28:21.280]  population that's what carbon taxes are about we're gonna move away from global
[28:21.280 --> 28:26.080]  warming to just weather change period is unnatural the sun doesn't affect climate
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.800]  it's all humans humans are bad we got to get rid of them and now you see them
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.560]  announcing that that that's their official policy and hey you know what we
[28:34.560 --> 28:40.080]  are you Genesis and since alternative media is becoming the media and exposed
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.720]  us we'll just hide in plain view see when they would just deny all of this it's
[28:44.720 --> 28:50.480]  better because it's it'll wake up even the most brain dead three and a half
[28:50.480 --> 28:53.960]  years ago when they came up with a film New World Order I guess three years ago
[28:53.960 --> 28:59.580]  it was during the Democratic primaries and Obama and the Secret Service and
[28:59.580 --> 29:03.120]  Hillary drive by the Secret Service with Secret Service plates Ames machine
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.320]  guns at us on video then the media saying where's Hillary where's Obama they
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.280]  gave the media the split in Virginia by Dallas Airport right by the airport it's
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.400]  Bilderberg we call the media hey they're here media laughs at us there's no such
[29:16.400 --> 29:20.080]  thing as Bilderberg try videotape all this and videotape world leaders there
[29:20.080 --> 29:25.800]  and then the New York Times comes out and says as Alex Jones was having a full
[29:25.800 --> 29:33.000]  on schizophrenic event imagining all of this when they reviewed the film they
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.760]  because they hate their readers they think you're dumb so so they said
[29:36.760 --> 29:40.720]  there's no Bilderberg there was no Hillary or Obama and Alex was literally
[29:40.720 --> 29:46.360]  in a park by a hotel having a full-on hallucination man thank you New York
[29:46.360 --> 29:51.280]  Times I mean even the dumbest people know you're a pack of liars we're on the

[34:12.520 --> 34:18.560]  of the world the example of freedom I'm getting chills that's 1776 have you
[34:18.560 --> 34:23.880]  actually read the founders quotes their letters their debates their statements
[34:23.880 --> 34:29.560]  have you studied politics do you know how to read US code have you studied
[34:29.560 --> 34:35.160]  court cases I have and I've interviewed hundreds of top legal scholars and they
[34:35.160 --> 34:40.480]  all agree it is a beautiful document and that's why it's under assault we're in
[34:40.480 --> 34:44.680]  trouble because we've allowed it to be overturned no one debates at the
[34:44.680 --> 34:49.080]  Constitution is pretty much been overturned and then now that they've
[34:49.080 --> 34:54.480]  overturned it they're blaming the blight that's on our republic the tyranny
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.960]  that's here on the Constitution that'd be like if you fired an employee and two
[35:00.960 --> 35:10.160]  years later somebody was let the sink overflow let the sink on and you blame
[35:10.160 --> 35:14.120]  Bob who you fired two years ago all right all right I'm gonna shut up and get
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.520]  into the news here okay so I already mentioned this stuff FB IRS 16 an
[35:18.520 --> 35:22.480]  anonymous hacker crackdown we're gonna get into that 20 signs that the fabric
[35:22.480 --> 35:27.280]  of American society is coming apart at the seams I'm going to get to that peer
[35:27.280 --> 35:30.600]  pressure causes people to literally alter their memories of recent events
[35:30.600 --> 35:33.600]  this shows why a lot of people are like in a trance and they'll buy whatever
[35:33.600 --> 35:38.920]  ridiculous story they're told but there's a breaking point as the system
[35:38.920 --> 35:42.760]  gets more and more corrupt as it gets more and more out in the open as their
[35:42.760 --> 35:46.920]  cover stories get more and more ridiculous you're gonna have those that
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.640]  will buy anything they're told get deeper into delusion you're gonna have
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.320]  others who kind of wake up from their delusion and become more and more awake
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.800]  as things get more obvious things are not going well for the social
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.880]  engineers we've also got the death panels we're gonna be breaking that down
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.640]  they're here and in all the quote trendies denied the death panels existed
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.320]  made jokes about it you know Stephen Colbert made jokes about it well it's
[36:13.320 --> 36:17.720]  all in there and they admit case for killing granny cover a newsweek hey Ted
[36:17.720 --> 36:22.080]  Turner says kill old people you know you get rid of them we've got Bill Gates
[36:22.080 --> 36:26.720]  coming out saying hey death panels are good I mean I can play the clip of him
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.320]  these people aren't playing games they always oh there's no Bilderberg group
[36:32.320 --> 36:34.920]  only the other meeting right there here's their own documents shut up
[36:34.920 --> 36:39.960]  doesn't exist they play a Jedi mind trick on you these aren't the droids you're
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.960]  looking for move along and then you buy into it because of the peer pressure
[36:44.960 --> 36:49.360]  and they've got the big study out on this a big study I've seen countless
[36:49.360 --> 36:56.560]  others there's a new big study out where if if a barn door is red but you're in
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.120]  a sports stadium and the authority figure in the top hat says the barn door
[37:01.120 --> 37:08.400]  is blue the majority of people will see it as the color he says that matter the
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.640]  born barn doors really red it's like if you're watching on prison planet dot
[37:12.640 --> 37:18.960]  TV the TV slide behind me says info wars.com in red but if I was in a
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.280]  sports stadium of people and I was the authority figure and people saw me as
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.920]  the authority figure if I said that's blue and especially if I had a group of
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.720]  experts up there with me who said yes it's blue the majority of people would
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.200]  actually see it as blue but again that's coming up this is the mind control
[37:39.200 --> 37:43.640]  that's why the cops say yeah she's hanging with her feet and legs arms and
[37:43.640 --> 37:49.560]  legs bound dead we don't see anything any signs of foul play here we're not
[37:49.560 --> 37:53.120]  even gonna do an investigation when they're supposed to regardless you know
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.000]  they go to an 85 year old man's house who looks like he's died of a heart attack
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.600]  they've got to do an investigation but they just tell you hey you know this
[38:01.600 --> 38:06.760]  isn't a murder move along move along it's time to break that trance they're
[38:06.760 --> 38:11.440]  intentionally trying to get you deeper into that trance right now okay here's
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.240]  the other big news I'll be breaking down UN Security Council consider climate
[38:15.240 --> 38:19.240]  change peacekeeping I'm gonna break down what's behind that carbon price battle
[38:19.240 --> 38:25.120]  is lost experts say Brisbane Times really goodness in Ireland in Australia
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.760]  in many areas no matter how much they propagandize the public know it is a
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.560]  scam then they ran a hoax the other day saying that Lord Monkton is not a Lord
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.760]  even though he's an hereditary Lord and peer of the crown on record not that
[38:39.760 --> 38:45.200]  even matters they they tried to say well he's officially not a voting member of
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.400]  the House of Lords well yeah because they just voted to get rid of that and now
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.840]  they've created political Lords who are the new royalty and have voting power
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.720]  but he's a hereditary Lord it's like saying Queen Elizabeth isn't the Queen
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.560]  of England so so there's this big oh that guy's a fake pretender to royalty you
[39:02.560 --> 39:06.320]  know to you know to being a peer and then it turns out it's all a hoax and
[39:06.320 --> 39:09.960]  you know his passport says he's a Lord and everybody knows he's a Lord and
[39:09.960 --> 39:17.640]  going back generations and this is how they do it so it's totally imploding
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.040]  Australia so while he's there they run this hoax that he's a fake because tens
[39:22.040 --> 39:25.360]  of thousands are coming out to hearing speak now instead of just thousands and
[39:25.360 --> 39:29.520]  so they're panicking so they run the hoax he's not a Lord he's he's a fake he's
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.880]  a fraud when they're the frauds so carbon price battle is lost political
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.600]  experts believe the battle to sell carbon tax the Australian public has been
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.360]  lost and the Prime Minister can do nothing to change voters minds on the
[39:42.360 --> 39:50.520]  issue and it goes through all the numbers on that 61% do not believe any of
[39:50.520 --> 39:58.840]  it continuing more on CERN scientists gagged a politically incorrect global
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.480]  warming data oh guess what their study found with the particles mimicking the
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.200]  Sun's particles it's the Sun not just heating the earth but creating the
[40:07.200 --> 40:13.680]  nuclei to form water vapor that forms clouds and then condensation wow man
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.280]  that I needed CERN that cost 50 something billion dollars to tell me that
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.280]  okay all righty and then they gag them oh the scientists found the Sun's what
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.160]  runs our climate more than anything else wow let's let's gag them do I need
[40:28.160 --> 40:34.800]  scientists to tell me that fish swim that the sky's blue that Al Gore is a
[40:34.800 --> 40:40.760]  man bear pig I mean do I need to even research Al Gore which I've done to just
[40:40.760 --> 40:46.120]  look at him and go alert danger will Robinson danger will Robinson danger
[40:46.120 --> 40:51.600]  danger that's a big fat con man I love that clip we've got in the fall of the
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.400]  Republic I don't love it kind of cry but you know in a laughing gallows humor way
[40:55.400 --> 41:00.800]  where he's on Larry King live with a smug fake attitude obviously lying and
[41:00.800 --> 41:06.320]  Ross prose going listen Larry within a decade if we put NAFTA into place it
[41:06.320 --> 41:12.800]  will destroy the wages okay Canada had $5 an hour average more than us but
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.040]  those jobs all went to the United States under a trade deal well Mexico their
[41:17.040 --> 41:21.800]  average pays a dollar an hour lower you will hear a giant sucking sound it will
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.440]  destroy the middle class and what's left of our industrial base Larry and Al
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.120]  Gore you just tell Ross bro was straight shooting straight shooting total body
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.520]  language plus the facts were true you got to judge both Al Gore's with this you
[41:35.520 --> 41:42.240]  know what eating grins like laughing it bro listen Larry this study I have here
[41:42.240 --> 41:51.680]  shows it's gonna double jobs in just two years this is a good deal Larry yeah
[41:51.680 --> 41:56.040]  and women hanging with their arms and legs bound from front front porch is
[41:56.040 --> 42:03.160]  dead there's no sign of foul play and everything's wonderful and oh my gosh
[42:03.160 --> 42:07.360]  the Sun doesn't affect the climate okay shut up Alex get to the news it's like
[42:07.360 --> 42:13.760]  Dr. Strangelove you know we can't control himself okay I wanted to mention
[42:13.760 --> 42:16.880]  this because there's all these big news articles about how evil it is to have
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.640]  more than two children some are saying even one is bad and my wife said people
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.800]  at Whole Foods march up to her and obviously jealous that you know they
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.000]  waited to have kids till too late generally it's always an archetype and
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.920]  mad that my wife has you know these incredibly beautiful wonderful vibrant
[42:32.920 --> 42:37.320]  children that aren't brain damage from vaccines and they'll say you've got too
[42:37.320 --> 42:40.640]  many kids of course I'm glad they've done that with me because I'd say get out
[42:40.640 --> 42:47.920]  of my face you witch I mean literally get away from my children scumbag but I
[42:47.920 --> 42:55.360]  did a video titled death-loving media attacks children and I got into some
[42:55.360 --> 43:08.960]  examples of this and I saw a comment a bunch of them actually by P Marie 2003
[43:08.960 --> 43:16.800]  39 minutes ago but but it's he's P P Marie 2003 and she's a she's agreeing
[43:16.800 --> 43:25.080]  with another individual Kevin Moria's and it says that that's that handle it
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.320]  says exactly what is wrong with eugenics eugenics is what brought Alex the
[43:30.320 --> 43:35.480]  wonderful food he had for lunch it gives us premium Egyptian cotton dogs that
[43:35.480 --> 43:41.760]  can detect trapped victims huge horses that pull plows for Amish
[43:41.760 --> 43:48.040]  foreignless blackberry plants I'd like to propose we spay neuter anyone on the
[43:48.040 --> 43:54.480]  left side of the IQ bell curve wouldn't that help it sure can't hurt and I
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.600]  could talk for an hour but I'm not just about that mindset that attitude these
[43:59.600 --> 44:05.560]  are people who are want to be elitist and what they don't understand is the
[44:05.560 --> 44:09.840]  globalist are targeting them as well if you actually study the eugenics war
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.120]  they're putting bisphenol A in their products they're putting sodium fluoride
[44:14.120 --> 44:17.680]  in their water they're putting cancer viruses in their vaccines every major
[44:17.680 --> 44:21.680]  GMO crop has the side effect and it turns out we've talked to industry
[44:21.680 --> 44:25.680]  insiders that's the real effect you're told oh it's so the tomato lasts longer
[44:25.680 --> 44:31.800]  but it's also had a system flipped in it to create enzymes that reduce fertility
[44:31.800 --> 44:35.240]  autoimmune disorders you name it and we're talking in every major study within
[44:35.240 --> 44:39.600]  three to five generations the rats the guinea pigs are deformed and can't have
[44:39.600 --> 44:44.760]  babies can't procreate and you see the wages of this doubling in cancer the
[44:44.760 --> 44:49.880]  last decade doubling in diabetes I mean pull those numbers up just type in
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.000]  diabetes doubles in last decade here let's put it on the screen for much
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.960]  just from last week then I found an article from ten years ago where it
[44:55.960 --> 45:02.280]  doubled from that 200% increase in 20 years how many medical doctors I have
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.080]  to get on this show for you to talk about how 50 years ago if there was a
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.960]  child with cancer they would fly medical students across the country to see them
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.080]  it was like seeing elephant man or something it was like seeing a seventh
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.200]  wonder of the world now there's kids all I mean you go to the mall there's kids
[45:18.200 --> 45:22.040]  with their chemo injectors on their arms ball-headed and you know they're
[45:22.040 --> 45:25.200]  they're they're they're just sucking the money out of the family before they put
[45:25.200 --> 45:30.160]  them in the grave there it is diabetes rate doubles worldwide and what sources
[45:30.160 --> 45:33.960]  that from scroll up the top for me please I remember a source of course was
[45:33.960 --> 45:38.400]  the that's Fox News but again we don't just believe Fox News what was the study
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.480]  and that was a worldwide study let's scroll down a little bit that was June
[45:42.480 --> 45:46.380]  27th the number of adults suffering from type 2 diabetes is more than doubled
[45:46.380 --> 45:50.520]  across the globe and it goes on the research has found rates of type 2
[45:50.520 --> 45:56.000]  diabetes which is the lifestyle factors linked to obesity increased and remain
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.360]  the same in this part of the world with 347 million people currently affected
[46:00.360 --> 46:08.440]  and it goes on to break that down that's even different numbers than I saw
[46:08.440 --> 46:15.600]  okay because the reports I saw said double the last ten years okay now let
[46:15.600 --> 46:18.540]  me just continue with the rest of the some of the news I've got here what we'll
[46:18.540 --> 46:25.200]  know me back to this eugenics so they just make this statement about let's
[46:25.200 --> 46:34.240]  sterilize spay neuter the the term for cats and dogs were animals and you got
[46:34.240 --> 46:38.600]  to love most these pointy head people have two degrees from a college so
[46:38.600 --> 46:42.560]  they're the accepted priest class but they're working at the local grocery
[46:42.560 --> 46:47.440]  store and then they look hatefully when you go through the line you know you've
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.000]  got the dad that started businesses from nothing didn't finish high school it's
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.120]  got his beautiful wife has three kids he's a hundred times more street smart
[46:55.120 --> 46:59.440]  than they are he can skin a buck run a trot line at the end of the day his IQ
[46:59.440 --> 47:04.000]  is really higher and you got this loser sitting there with all their degrees
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.600]  lecturing them about paper plastic and look at your kids you shouldn't have so
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.520]  many kids I'll guarantee you this person if you go and we'll try to interview
[47:14.520 --> 47:19.320]  him I'll guarantee you it's a woman who hadn't had kids so she's better about it
[47:19.320 --> 47:25.200]  so she externalizes it and then hates families I'll guarantee you that it's
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.200]  somebody who says we'd be better off with humans at the end of the day but
[47:30.200 --> 47:35.200]  again let's spay neuter anyone on the left side of the IQ bell curve but but
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.760]  what happens once you sterilize them and if you were so smart you'd know systems
[47:39.760 --> 47:45.800]  are always gamed or people buy out of it so who's gonna set what the IQ test
[47:45.800 --> 47:52.720]  are who's gonna determine those or there's a lot of idiot savants who can
[47:52.720 --> 48:00.440]  engage in great art great music or have a great capacity for love who are loving
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.360]  people that isn't measured by your stupid chart are we gonna sterilize them
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.600]  well yeah that's what they did to well really millions of Americans but on
[48:09.600 --> 48:16.960]  record 500 plus thousand from the 1920s in 1987 when it officially ended now this
[48:16.960 --> 48:23.320]  whole eugenics situation is just an attitude it's an attitude where they
[48:23.320 --> 48:26.920]  just dehumanize you you know what did the state board say when they were asked
[48:26.920 --> 48:30.360]  wired more than two-thirds of foster kids in Texas on an average of seven
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.840]  psychotropic drugs mirroring the national average and the head of the board
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.080]  said because they got bad gene pools and the state rep said well what's your
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.840]  proof well they just do oh that's real science you got a bad gene pool so we're
[48:43.840 --> 48:46.360]  gonna come take you from your parents and then some good doctors the only
[48:46.360 --> 48:48.520]  reason this came out there were state hearings four years ago it's in my
[48:48.520 --> 48:51.480]  film in game because a lot of doctors that were involved with CPS said look
[48:51.480 --> 48:57.600]  we took healthy happy kids for you know too much dog hair on the sofa or or
[48:57.600 --> 49:03.480]  dishes in the sink and I watch these kids as a CPS doctor go from being on the
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.280]  football team in the sixth grade to being in wheelchairs they put them on
[49:08.280 --> 49:11.680]  so many drugs then you start having convulsions and they put you on more
[49:11.680 --> 49:17.120]  then they have a brain surgery because they make more money off of a screwed up
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.480]  kid and if you're lucky enough for him not to kill you they just dump you off
[49:21.480 --> 49:25.080]  when your mind is wiped and you're one of those homeless zombies who you know
[49:25.080 --> 49:31.800]  talking to themselves this is what they do is factories of death and you just
[49:31.800 --> 49:35.200]  get some they're always so stupid you know that the head psychiatrist on the
[49:35.200 --> 49:40.400]  board you just let him barely talk he's like they've come from bad team pool you
[49:40.400 --> 49:44.800]  come from a bad gene pool punk if you had good genes you know you got to lift up
[49:44.800 --> 49:48.840]  the week if you had good genes you'd understand that humans don't feed on
[49:48.840 --> 49:54.400]  each other we don't take our predatory instinct to hunt wild bison or to hunt
[49:54.400 --> 49:59.280]  cave cat or to go fishing and spearing fish in the water we don't take that and
[49:59.280 --> 50:05.760]  then use it against our own species that is a abarism of the agrarian city

[54:17.520 --> 54:22.720]  here's some of the police state news the good news and the bad news this is out
[54:22.720 --> 54:28.120]  of CBS 4 Denver no felony charges will be filed against the Colorado woman who
[54:28.120 --> 54:32.720]  allegedly sexually assaulted a transportation security administration
[54:32.720 --> 54:43.120]  agent in Phoenix and reportedly the TSA person grabbed her breast so she
[54:43.120 --> 54:50.160]  grabbed theirs no no no it's only a felony when you grab them back but the
[54:50.160 --> 54:57.640]  prosecutors have dropped the case so that's good news the attorney for
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.040]  center client was violated endangered and threatened by the actions of TSA
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.040]  agents she denies doing anything wrong oh you just grabbed my breast I'll grab
[55:06.040 --> 55:10.400]  yours oh you're we're tackling you and arresting you see they're not gonna be
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.720]  able to sell this stuff unless we're in a trance light state one of my crew
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.400]  members was bringing up Darren Brown that's his name right the hypnotist on
[55:21.400 --> 55:25.440]  these shows where he can the person says they want a blue bike he convinces them
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.080]  that they always wanted a red bike and if you look at the morons they screen
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.800]  for the show that's why a hypnotist magician will get five or six people up
[55:33.800 --> 55:39.120]  on stage and do a little test to find who the most suggestible is and then
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.440]  through television and culture they're trying to make us suggestible more
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.920]  suggestible the television lowers the brainwave rates on average while you're
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.160]  watching it and then it makes it easier for you to get back into that phase
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.760]  there's another bit again getting to it next hour big study out showing how
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.600]  people are incredibly suggestible and will change memories on the spot for
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.140]  peer pressure and that's all that's happening with Darren Brown he's conning
[56:06.140 --> 56:12.400]  you claiming slapping his hands and the words that he's using are what is getting
[56:12.400 --> 56:18.480]  you to be going to mind control it's peer pressure the people decide to be
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.400]  conned it's pure bull only weak minds would be involved in such a thing it's
[56:23.400 --> 56:27.480]  all flim flam all these control freaks all these weak people you know they
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.680]  want some they think subliminal messages are powerful they think they're
[56:31.680 --> 56:35.320]  gonna get power out of them it doesn't have power it doesn't have power it
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.960]  doesn't have power when you're aware of it when you're aware the carbon scam is
[56:39.960 --> 56:43.680]  a scam no matter how much they say your children are gonna die if you don't pay
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.320]  David Rockefeller and Lord Rothschild money it doesn't matter you know it's
[56:48.320 --> 56:52.520]  a fraud it's like somebody you work with that you've caught lying over and over
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.640]  again you finally know their liars and you're not gonna put up with their bull
[56:55.640 --> 57:01.680]  anymore they they manipulate good people to be gullible stop being gullible they
[57:01.680 --> 57:06.640]  think you're so gullible the government murders people every week shoot some cuts
[57:06.640 --> 57:13.360]  them up hangs them upside down tied up and then tells you they weren't murdered
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.520]  oh I've had enough I've had enough okay so so the good news is the prosecutors
[57:19.520 --> 57:22.840]  are like well they grabbed your breast well okay we're letting you off good
[57:22.840 --> 57:29.160]  that's humanity don't be toady prosecutors don't be toady juries if you
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.120]  think somebody really violated a law but the laws of fraud let them go that's
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.000]  what the founders said do just because the government tells you jury
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.560]  nullification doesn't exist the Supreme Court's rule just supposed to rule the
[57:40.560 --> 57:48.160]  facts as well as the law continue here city council attempts to outlaw free

[58:19.040 --> 58:23.040]  face and the city council goes on the news and defends it says we are the
[58:23.040 --> 58:28.720]  bosses and it's a mind-control game it's an agenda 21 beta test this is going on

[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:28.560]  are casting 800-259-9231 some of the news I have not gotten to yet is this
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.840]  report here out of Texas and Indiana and we told people this would happen we
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.480]  told folks in in game we told people in countless radio interviews central Texas
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.120]  toll roads need more state subsidies and expected so you see you pay for the
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.960]  toll road because they're existing roads most of them that's illegal but it's
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.760]  still done bush signed a waiver executive order guess he's king who needs
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.800]  Congress who needs laws for existing roads we made toll roads you pay for it
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.600]  that time you pay for it with the tolls and now you're going to pay for it with
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.560]  billions and billions of dollars in Texas and Indiana and other states this
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.800]  is how central does business the Spanish company all over the world biggest
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.760]  toll road company in the world just like Goldman Sachs is the biggest banking
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.240]  takeover arm in the world because they know how to come in financial
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:19.000]  politicians in a long-term game take over your roads and just absolutely rape
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.080]  the living daylights out of you so we're going to be getting into that report
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:32.200]  also more on the complete and total fiction just just mindless fiction of
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.040]  the Republican leadership I've seen reports of boner I mean Boehner running
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:44.200]  around threatening junior house members freshman who are tea partiers saying
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.520]  you've got to get behind raising the debt ceiling and 10 years you know trillion
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.840]  and a half dollars of cuts which is cuts none of it means anything as Ron Paul
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.720]  and as the Chinese and as economists as our debtors have said if they continue
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:07.560]  the QE to QE 3d devaluation of the dollar we're dead already financially it's
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:13.080]  like Rathakon where spot goes in to fix the generator and it gets radiated and
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.560]  he's stumbling around about to die and the captain Kirk will try to go through
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.800]  the door to be with his friend and help him and they hold him back you know the
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.360]  doctor and the engineer and they say he's dead already all of this is the
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.400]  Republican and Democratic prostitutes of the elite pimps who have maneuvered
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.920]  America from the greatest creditor nation in the world of the greatest
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.480]  debtor nation in the world and funded their global corporate empire off our
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.960]  blood sweat and tears and our name which they destroyed all of this has been
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.480]  about maneuvering us into the docks to be mothballed and then cut up in a
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.520]  scrap and and discrediting liberty in the free market once and for all
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.080]  blaming everything they've done on that and so their plan is going very well
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.920]  as far as execution this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.240]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.600]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.520]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.160]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.880]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.320]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:50.640]  FBI case then does a 180 reversal days later now the fourth guy they tried to
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.200]  frame for it remember the first three it turned out hadn't done it the fourth
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:00.680]  guy they took to an FBI psychiatric facility he was a bio weapons researcher
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:07.840]  and killed him and it was only in two newspapers a minor footnote that while
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:14.600]  he was in their custody he OD'd on prescription Tylenol and yes ladies and

[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.760]  the whole operation was launched and it was the most weaponized form ever found
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:32.400]  remember they first claimed that somebody made it in a bathtub they had to
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.120]  keep the fear going after 9 11 and have a new story to distract you from looking
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.600]  too closely at the ridiculously shoddy first report of 9 11 that regardless of
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.080]  what you believe really happened on 9 11 6 of the 10 commissioners say it's a
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.640]  complete fraud and senator Graham governor Graham has come out and said the
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.760]  US government did protect the hijackers with the Saudis on MSNBC well we
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:02.200]  already knew that at the time it was in the Associated Press and Newsweek that
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.400]  the hijackers were trained at US military bases with super secret security
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.840]  clearances and no one knew why and then that just got swept under the rug to
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:16.320]  again they're telling you that a red barn is blue ladies and gentlemen it's
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.160]  red America is under red level attack the criminals have taken over they've

[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.800]  corruption and setting up a police state grid so they can continue doing what
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  they're doing at an even greater level okay that's coming up Steve Watson did
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.480]  a detailed report government admits Bruce Ivins did not have access to

[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.600]  reading him these articles I know I can hardly believe it but it's it's that's
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.600]  what's happening there they're artificially trying to transform our
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.720]  society also again I'm gonna get into toll roads all over the country we're
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.800]  paying for them three times over and that's how they sign the deals up that's
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.920]  how this is done worldwide central Texas toll roads need more state subsidies
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:08.520]  than expected builder of Texas roads may default on Indiana project central of
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.080]  Spain saw another statesman article where they were exposing that he was
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.280]  Al Gore's former chief of staff that he was for forced inoculations and for the
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.200]  Napa superhighways and toll roads and imminent domain that doesn't matter he
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.720]  tells you how much he loves Jesus he now reminds me of like Robert Tilton or
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.400]  something up there we're talking about Rick Perry at the start of the next hour
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.760]  at her tarply joins us got some interesting things I'm gonna cover with
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.880]  Rick Perry that I told you was gonna run I live in Austin I got more insiders
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:47.080]  over there than you can shake a stick at Rick Perry scared to death of me which
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.120]  is crena creepy it's told that by a Fox News host a Fox News executive people
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.840]  that work for Perry he sent his head media person to in game that premiered
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.120]  three and a half years ago that he was gonna be the presidential nominee in
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.440]  2012 and believe me that's who the establishment is planning to put into
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:08.920]  the presidency his name is Rick Perry and he's gonna run with Michelle Bachman
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.800]  or Sarah Palin as I told you a year ago the word was Palin then but they may
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.280]  drop her like an old shoe it'll be a combo hard to beat and if you're like
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.720]  Obama idiots who thought who got all into your guy winning and oh he's gonna
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.680]  save us and all this look at who's behind him the same people behind Obama or
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.480]  behind Perry and I know conservative mainland conservatives are gonna get
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.320]  conned again but but not as quickly and not as easily and they're gonna wake up
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.080]  quicker and so will Democrats last time it used to take four to six years for
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.840]  folks to wake up to a politician being a globalist and lying to him now it takes
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.520]  a matter of months Congress has never had a 9% approval rating so you guys
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.960]  just keep doing what you're doing also Iran's acceleration of its nuclear
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.720]  program angers the West and we talked to Bob Baer and the famous CIA officer
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.880]  today and talked about the Jerusalem Post saying no it's not true Israel isn't
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.520]  gonna strike Iran in September we're trying to get him on to break that down
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.920]  we got that news more on what's really happening with the whole budget deficit
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.400]  well as Ron Paul has said is the Chinese have said it's all smoke and mirrors
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.680]  they're already defaulted they're already hyper inflighting the currency and
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.440]  they've signaled they're gonna completely devalue it that's why every
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:32.280]  commodity is going up especially gold and silver it is it is a planned
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.840]  implosion of the world economy to go into receivership to the big six
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:43.360]  megabanks who will then offer global VAT and carbon taxes and most people will
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.320]  go along with it because Bill O'Reilly has been endorsing it we've got to pay
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.400]  our debts we've got to get square it's the right thing to do I hear
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.080]  conservatives calling in going I'm ready to not get my military check so my
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.080]  children have a future your children don't have a future if we don't go
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.600]  into fractional reserve banking and arrest the banksters and get rid of the
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.360]  Federal Reserve that got set up in 1913 if we don't get the power of the
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.000]  issuance of currency and credit back under Congress no amount of austerity
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.120]  no amount of cutting will ever fix anything it's their plan to cut and
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.480]  screw everything up yes dependencies bad with welfare because it makes you
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.800]  dependent and now the bankers have an army of people that will burn every
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.040]  sitting in the US if they don't get their welfare checks and now they'll hold
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.160]  the public hostage with their welfare Queens they work for the corporate
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.040]  welfare Queens it's pressure from below and above that's the real paradigm not

[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.200]  Pamela Sean Brian we're going all you and more Chris in Canada you're on the
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:46.760]  air welcome hey hey everybody hey yeah my question mostly is in regards to how
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:51.840]  the economic breakdown and you know devaluation the American dollar it's gonna be absolutely horrible
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.080]  it's just again and the government's gonna pose as the savior the whole time
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.600]  when they engineered the stinking thing it's gonna be hellish exactly hey what
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.480]  at Geithner say he said it's gonna be the worst thing in our lives and last a
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.040]  long time no kidding they plan the whole deal I told everybody this of course
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:11.320]  QE to didn't fix anything of course tax increases aren't fixing anything it's
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.640]  meant to destroy everything because the banksters are all exempt from the taxes
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.960]  they put on us and you moron liberals won't get that to your stinking scumbag
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:29.240]  heads I'm sorry go ahead great I live in a pretty sheltered area kind of
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:34.280]  Central Western Canada north of Montana North Dakota most people here don't know
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.760]  what's going on in Western or Eastern Canada much less the rest of the world
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.240]  so you know I'm having a little bit of trouble waking people up not knowing
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.040]  what's going on is good the New World Order likes that that means they're not
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:49.840]  conspiracy theorist being informed is evil sir in fact you're even able to
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.320]  speak which is a sign of evil sorry go ahead well I'm just wondering what would
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.080]  you or your staff want to do a little more maybe a short special on what's
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.480]  maybe how this would affect Canada yeah they're gonna bankrupt you last because
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.800]  it's one of the Queen's holdings and they always tell Ireland you're the best
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.800]  in Europe now because you're doing what the globalists say and then as soon as
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.160]  they enter the EU receivership contract they're imploded and told you the worst
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.840]  they're gonna absolutely implode candidate devalue your currency land
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:27.120]  grab and then poses your saviors and they already have anti free speech laws
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:33.800]  anti gun laws CPS in your kids Canada has some of the nicest most gullible
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.640]  people on average just as gullible as Americans and you will be the last to be
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:45.440]  absolutely imploded I was thinking is by the time it gets here it's too late
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:52.840]  yeah they're gonna gang rape you last what about do you know much about
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.720]  Harper I know we went to Bilderberg in 2003 I mean I had a no confidence vote so
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.440]  the Queen suspended parliament three times for him and Canadians don't want
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.920]  to admit that their whole systems run by the Queen of England under imperial
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.240]  charter under the governor general so I get emails saying well he she suspends
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.200]  parliament there's gonna be a new election no in two of the three places
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.080]  they just suspended it because they were about to vote their job and kick him
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.160]  out of there and bring in a new prime minister because they didn't like her
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:28.920]  agenda do you know of any like the political parties here are any of them
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:36.320]  do any of them stand any chance what what needs to happen he is not even go
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.160]  off parties go off individuals and a track record that they do what they say
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.880]  they're going to do even if a politician you don't totally agree with them if
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.880]  they're better overall and always do what they say they're going to do they're
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.640]  good but if somebody doesn't have a track record and promises you a bunch then
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.560]  you got to look out the biggest thing is waking the general public up as Thomas
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:01.640]  Jefferson said the tyrants will disappear like phantoms at dawn we don't
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.880]  need to convince you that the threat of forced entry is on the rise and that
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.600]  your door locks are inadequate now you can virtually eliminate the threat of
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.240]  your door being kicked in with the door sentinel the door sentinel offers

[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.000]  was an effective way to wake people up I yelled and screamed because I get
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.720]  angry because it's so obvious to me look they're robbing us they're scamming us
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.680]  it's like rowdy piper and they live trying to make the guy put the sunglasses
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.080]  on just look just don't trust them look beneath the surface start questioning
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:14.720]  that's the metaphor you put the glasses on you see the monsters well you start
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.960]  investigating history and current governments that's why I woke up folks
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.560]  I'm a history buff and if you know history this stuff is always going on and
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.920]  the fact that they were telling us that you're a conspiracy theorist if you're
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.560]  saying don't trust government I mean if you don't stay on top contractors
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.600]  building your house you're in for a ride if you don't stay on top employees
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.760]  you're in trouble if you don't stay on top your relationship you're in trouble
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:43.480]  but oh let's just let the national security apparatus do whatever it wants
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.200]  governments killed 200 plus million people last century and they're gearing
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.800]  up to make that look like child's play let's go to Kyler in Texas then Pamela
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:59.960]  and others Kyler you're on the air hi welcome can you speak up for me because
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:04.040]  I can barely hear you okay woke up I watched your documentaries and stuff
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.320]  and I saw like the work that you done a lot of stuff you did I didn't believe
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.400]  it a lot but I looked it up and I confirmed it was a pretty pretty
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:18.000]  excited to know that it's real how well yeah it is exciting in a scary way how
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.720]  how old are you Kyler 15 15 well so so you what you saw one of my films and
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.720]  looked up the information yeah like especially like the radio show like
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.160]  right now you say a lot of stuff and I'm like wow crazy and I go looking up
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.400]  through right have you looked up the Rockefeller Foundation with patents on
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.520]  cancer viruses and your vaccines and steroids in your vaccines yep all that
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:51.960]  stuff yeah personally I get mad when I learn they're doing that and and when I
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.000]  see TV ads telling people to go line their kids up and I see little kids
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.960]  with their parents at grocery stores I want to run up and warn them please
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:04.320]  don't inject your children and sometimes I do even though they get mad at me
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:09.280]  because I know these murderers are soft-killing our children and I'm angry
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:15.080]  about it because I'm normal I'm normal and you're normal now too Kyler this
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.200]  stuff existed before you knew it existed now you know it exists do you have a
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.360]  burning desire to warn everyone you know yeah pretty much like the other day I
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.960]  was at Walgreens and then like they were like oh won't come to parties to give
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.880]  you the immunizations for the flu shot I'm like why in the heck would they come
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.120]  over to parties to give you a flu shot what are they that was a psychological
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.240]  warfare pitch I've read about that they say the word party associating getting
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.680]  a shot with a party and it's also meant to familiarize that party friend I'm
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:51.040]  friend come close then right there you know of course the mindless drone giving
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.560]  you the shot as compartmentalized doesn't know why they're told to give you
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:58.760]  that script yep anyways I wanted to talk about like the education system today
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.080]  because like we're being totally brainwashed and doctrina like I'm sure
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.920]  you because you have kids and you probably know what's going on well minor
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.320]  homeschool but they do go to some homeschooling school events but but
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.000]  even there we run into some of it but it's right folks overall tell me what
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.120]  they're teaching with the government training camp they're teaching us
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.320]  basically the buying to evolution everything and like Darwin and then
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.440]  they're also teaching us about global warming and overpopulation and then I
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:31.520]  have a kid with me that talks about it's by Thomas L. Friedman on hot flat and
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.800]  crowded and basically we were forced to read the entire thing every single word
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.200]  and then take quizzes over it at the end of every week and it basically just
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.160]  brainwash ourselves with it and I'll read you the back of it real quick if
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:53.800]  you want oh yes tell me it says green is the new red white and blue ah right so
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:00.560]  let's just destroy the American flag for the sake of defending the earth and it
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.640]  goes on to say Thomas L. Friedman declares and proposes that a national
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.040]  strategy is needed to save the planet and to make America healthier richer more
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.720]  innovative more productive and more secure green oriented practices and
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.480]  technologies are the only way to mitigate climate change and by the way all
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:24.240]  that sounds good when you get the real documents it's about cutting resources
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.440]  off to countries so they implode financially and then here's the London
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.680]  Guardian sending in the UN green helmets that's the new group after your
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.640]  country's imploded or after they use weather weapons on you UN wants green
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:42.520]  helmet climate arming UN Security Council to consider climate change

[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.880]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.080]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.920]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:39.320]  challenges number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.160]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:06.480]  1-877-327-0365
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:40.240]  thank you for joining us we are at the midway point in this global
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:45.680]  transmission I will get to Pamela, Sean, Brian, Annetta, Mike and others when
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.520]  Webster Tarpley leaves us at the start of the next hour I got to get into Rick
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:54.800]  Barry the Natva superhighways are back charging people three times for already
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.440]  paid for existing roads and it's even in the Texas papers admitting it's a scam
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:06.960]  I heard two different local talk radio shows yesterday talking about how it was
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:12.360]  a scam I mean I didn't hear this stuff five years ago where the star witness
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:17.360]  is killed in the Rupert Murdoch case and the police say nothing to worry about
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:23.440]  and the public suddenly doesn't buy it spontaneously or the banksters come out
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:29.440]  with a new bailout and no one buys it or they're pushing more toll road scams and
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:38.000]  no one buys it so much good is happening the carbon taxes are falling apart in
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.080]  Europe and Australia the big papers in Australia say that it's dead now they
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.880]  play possum it is technically dead but they're gonna try to bring it back the
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:54.320]  point is we kick globalist hind in when we take the field and stop being
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.280]  gullible and buying into whatever narrative they put out I mean it's like
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.120]  being a child in three years old my parents saying Santa comes down the
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.640]  chimney and I said he's too fat to come down our chimney with a little bit
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.400]  chimney and my dad said there were about 10 minutes trying to convince me he
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.680]  finally said son you're right there is no such thing as Santa Claus it's the
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.320]  difference between fiction and nonfiction you know when you're reading a
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.600]  fiction book when these politicians put out this fake narrative it is a fiction
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.000]  the whole debt limit ceiling garbage is a fiction we're technically already
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.400]  defaulted the communist Chinese have said that Ron Paul has said it every
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:36.000]  economist we've had on have said it they're going into QE3 Bob Chapman said
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.920]  a month ago two months ago he said they're going to continue QE3 and they
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.680]  already are and he gave the numbers and then now they admit they are but they
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.200]  said they weren't I mean ladies and gentlemen we've reached a new level of
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.640]  lying and that shows the ruling classes in trouble we're gonna talk to doctor
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.160]  Webster Griffin Tarpley of history also an economist here in a moment he just

[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:35.640]  Webster Griffin Tarpley dr. Tarpley do you want to get into the livias
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.720]  situation first the economy or this whole news core scandal where the star
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.360]  witness magically dies and within minutes of finding the body the cops say
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.760]  not criminal go away we're not going to release details go to sleep I mean
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.040]  everything is accelerating the world is getting crazier and crazier so we talk
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:40:00.240]  about the war the the so-called default or the news core situation what do we do
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.800]  Libya first and then move on quickly to the other two sure go ahead the whole
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:10.120]  thing basically on Libya I think the main thing to understand is that the
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.400]  coalition of aggressor imperialist countries that's attacking Libya is
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:22.000]  tending to fall apart we have Norway which provided 10% of the air strikes on
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.400]  Libya with their six jets have cut that to four and by the end of the month it
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:33.960]  will be zero so Norway is essentially going home the Netherlands had provided
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:39.880]  six jets they now say they will not do any more bombing they will only do the
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:45.960]  no-fly zone the addiction that is is going on there and here in the United
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:52.200]  States we just had a vote on the the Kucinich resolution in the House of
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:41:00.640]  Representatives 10 days ago where you had 229 war mongers lining up against
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:07.080]  199 who were in favor of cutting the funding and and ending this military
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.880]  adventure so that is a margin hold on it's not military it's kinetic and it's
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:15.440]  peace hardly don't be a conspiracy theorist here I'm sorry I'm just
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:20.680]  incorrigible it's a 15 vote margin now think about that 15 votes you're 15
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.640]  votes away from having the House on record against this war and in favor of
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:29.880]  cutting off the funding that would be a tremendous political and they normally
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.080]  sign on headlong to anything this is this is big to show that they have
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.480]  almost become anti-war or anti-peace I'm sorry in the House of Representatives
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.800]  well a lot of these are people from the from the Tea Party and again you know I
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.600]  don't agree with them on much else but on this one I think that's fine and and
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.480]  they should therefore go ahead and do their thing partly I think you've been
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:55.600]  stereotyping the Tea Party it's a very diverse group of people well the ones
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.720]  you see in the House of Representatives all say exactly the same thing they have
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:04.240]  the same mantra which I don't agree with for one minute but still let them do
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.960]  some good I think it's likely that these people in the Tea Party are going to get
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.960]  leaned on by Wall Street Wall Street is telling them right now no they admit
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.720]  that Bainer is twisting their arms to give us this fake quote austerity
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.280]  package that does nothing to fix the derivatives bubble yeah we don't want
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.840]  the austerity we don't want the derivatives either but I think when you
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.760]  look at somebody like Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell has gotten a message from
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.600]  Wall Street raised the raise the debt limit or else and I think there are
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.480]  separate reasons that make that plausible idea but he's been told do this
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.320]  or else and he's gonna have to force these House Tea Party guys to knuckle
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:46.120]  under once they've finished with that they're gonna be very humiliated and
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  very angry and they're gonna be looking around for an issue where they can go
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:56.440]  against Obama and Libya is the perfect issue because here Obama is now many
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.000]  many months into impeachment territory right he's violating the War Powers Act
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  he was supposed to get permission by 60 days that was May 20th and then he was
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.880]  supposed to get out by June 20th that was a hundred and that was 90 days and
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.480]  we're now above 120 days and he's still going ahead with this yeah he says he
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.800]  doesn't need Congress but you I mean describe the what you saw in Libya and
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.040]  then let's get into the real meat and potatoes here Webster what do you make a
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.720]  France in Italy saying they want to broker a peace deal is there anything to
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.360]  that is there anything to Gaddafi stepping down but then allowing real
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:39.080]  elections what's the inside baseball on that well remember Gaddafi in technical
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:42.840]  terms has no official post now it's there's no doubt that he's the dominant
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.320]  personality running this entire thing but in terms of stepping down what do you
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:51.920]  step down from does it mean he has to go into exile I don't think any of that is
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.960]  likely to happen because I've seen in that that demonstration that you that
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.680]  you put on your program there on Friday July 1st after we got finished with that
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.280]  I went down and went into the crowd and talked to a lot of people and they're
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:12.080]  all very heavily invested in in Gaddafi and I think with some reason
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.640]  essentially the choice is Gaddafi or chaos so whatever you think of Gaddafi
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:21.840]  he's better than than chaos and from the Libyan perspective I think even more
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:28.160]  so it's more like Tito in the Bosnia area and then after he was removed the
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:33.720]  whole place disintegrated yes I did that's a very good comparison and so I
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.880]  don't okay then then why do we suddenly see France saying okay we want peace and
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:43.280]  and Italy saying that what does that signal because they're still moving
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.960]  towards the September-October round invasion the Italians Berlusconi said
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.920]  last week that he thought the whole thing had been a terrible mistake and
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:57.280]  that he had been forced into it by the Italian Parliament now the Italian
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:01.560]  Parliament in this case means something calling itself the Democratic Party
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:07.200]  which is the neo-communists and remember Italy has a neo-communist president
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.000]  Napolitano that guy was a was a member of the Italian Communist Party so these
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.760]  people unfortunately far from being communists work for the CIA and for
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:20.160]  Soros that's essentially there that's where they're coming from so they're
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.160]  pro-war they're they're pro-nato warmonger it's the it's the it's the
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:34.240]  comminoid banker system something like that the bankers the communists for
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.680]  for a finance capital or something like this which is it's a sub degree what
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:45.560]  they always were right going back to to Marx but he the Italian situation is
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:50.800]  strangely enough there you also have a right-wing opposition it's the northern
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:56.040]  league right the the old Lombard League now the northern league and they're
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.800]  demanding that this thing be brought to an end and that would pretty much end the
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.720]  whole adventure because then all the key bases that are being used to carry this
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:07.400]  out are pretty much so is it safe to say from your research and I would concur
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:13.880]  with this that momentum is now shifting away from a ground invasion and the the
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.600]  war is falling apart for NATO I think it may be and it's also the case that the
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.720]  the the Libyan pro-gaddafi forces have done quite well for themselves lately
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:30.200]  the rebels are manic they make these very unwise advances and you've had two
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.920]  cases now in the past week where the rebels have rushed forward and then
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.680]  gotten mowed down right when you have 10 10 to 15 dead on the battlefield in this
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:42.720]  kind of a war that's a lot and if you have a hundred to a 200 wounded that's
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:46.080]  a lot and we've had that last week and now we've apparently we've got it again
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.840]  today so that's quite serious so the rebels are very weak there are rabble
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:55.200]  in arms the French are flying in weapons to the western mountains that
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.720]  violates the UN resolution the British in the US are shipping in weapons through
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:04.080]  Egypt across the Egyptian border that violates the UN resolution they don't
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:08.480]  care about the UN resolution so I think that the political support for this is
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.600]  collapsing also it has to do with the tremendous financial difficulties of a
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.360]  lot of these governments the real question is France and so cozy and I've
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.360]  just seen a news bulletin going by in the crawl that the French are now
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:28.200]  willing to talk without the departure of Gaddafi being the precondition is that
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:32.960]  right yes that's that's what I'm saying actually they said that yesterday okay
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:37.960]  fine so that's that's what I've been bringing up yeah I think it may well be
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.200]  that some of them want to cut their cut their losses because they the only way
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.960]  they can do anything more is to have that ground invasion and then of course
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.920]  you get into the body bags and a tremendous wave you run into two million
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.520]  North Africans that have been handed AK-47s and grenade launchers that you
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.840]  witnessed in that crowd of at least a half a million ready to die that is not
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:03.840]  going to be a cakewalk no it's not so I think this is this is a piece of
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.360]  absolute folly plus it's very expensive in in monetary terms so I think they're
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:13.480]  it may well be that some some more greater realism is coming forward
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:19.440]  except that you've got so cozy and to some degree Obama who have tied their
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:24.960]  prestige to this but especially so cozy so it's going to be a big personal
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:30.200]  defeat for so cozy if this doesn't end with the departure what do you make of
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:34.680]  the Dominic Strauss-Kahn thing turning out to be a complete fraud well that I
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.760]  think this is an interesting scenario and I have this from a very good French
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:44.680]  source and from a from a good German source too the week after his arrest
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:51.480]  Strauss-Kahn was going to fly to Berlin and meet with German Chancellor Merkel
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:57.480]  and depending on the outcome of that meeting an envoy was going to go from
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:03.640]  Berlin to Libya to Tripoli to meet Gaddafi and his circle and the goal of
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:10.320]  all of this traveling was to begin to set up another reserve currency for the
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.780]  world that is some alternative supplement maybe at the beginning to the
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:20.160]  dollar something that would not replace the dollar immediately it would be the
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:25.640]  pilot project that would exist alongside that well he'd been talking about the
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.240]  end of the dollar in the month before they set him up yes so this was what
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.680]  Gaddafi had had he had been talking about you know a gold back currency for
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:39.280]  for Africa there are all kinds of possibilities here but that was Strauss
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.720]  Kahn's plan for the week that never was for him because he was arrested before
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:49.400]  the week he was arrested on the weekend and that week never began for him so it
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:54.200]  means that that's similarly to to Saddam Hussein right Saddam Hussein had
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.640]  ship shifted all of his money out of the dollar into the euro the oil for food
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:04.200]  fund went from the dollar to the euro due to the influence of Saddam Hussein so
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:09.120]  in this case it's it's Gaddafi but also joined by Germany also joined by Strauss
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.680]  Kahn so it seems that the and the reason the banksters are devaluing the dollar
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.960]  they want an incremental dollar devaluation to drive down every other
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:22.000]  currency the stated policy of global concerted coordinated devaluation they
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.440]  don't want a move away from the dollar and then other currencies to go up they
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.120]  want a global hyperinflationary depression to consolidate control so this
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:35.240]  is the key juncture for the Anglo-American elite correct well we
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:38.920]  maybe we get into that because it's a complicated situation now let's break
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.800]  down the debt ceiling the technical default the Chinese have been talking
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.800]  about on the other side of WebsterGryff entirely then your phone calls then I'm

[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.600]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.360]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:13.880]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:17.440]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:21.800]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:26.160]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.920]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:38.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.560]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:19.760]  all right we got Webster five minutes the next hour and then I'll get to your
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.360]  calls and into the whole situation with the toll roads all over the country one
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.080]  of the biggest scams out there we're exposing the whole carbon tax fraud next
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.600]  is the globalist power grab where they buy your politicians off and then they
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:36.640]  hand your existing roads over to the toll road companies who've been caught
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:42.520]  engaging in all sorts of chicanery but Webster looking at the economy we
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.160]  suddenly have Geithner two weeks ago on meet the press saying it's going to be
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.240]  the worst time of our lives it's gonna be the hardest time it's gonna last a
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.120]  long time so they've gone from saying we're in the middle of a boom which
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:58.720]  everybody knew was asinine to going my gosh it's gonna be horrible you better
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:04.040]  give us trillions more in bailout you better cut your services raise taxes and
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:07.760]  pay it all to offshore banks that will fix it when it's a black hole that we
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.200]  know is impossible to pay induced via fraud so where is this going I mean it
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:19.320]  looks like the Obama hoax their front man to sell austerity is absolutely
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:24.640]  evaporating well I think we have to start first of all with the the fact that
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:30.200]  Italy has now joined Greece and Spain at Greece Spain Portugal Ireland in this
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.360]  euro crisis now once you have the two thousand that was planned I mean they're
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:39.640]  just taking I'm sorry go ahead well planned it's a world economic
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.440]  depression right we have London going down in 2007 2008 we have a bubble New
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:49.600]  York going down every bank in Wall Street bankrupt in September of 2008 and
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.480]  now you've got the same thing coming home in the European government bonds but
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.040]  also the European banks if you take a look at Comet Spank the second largest
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.800]  bank in Germany they seem to be in some kind of a downward spiral that looks
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.960]  very much like Lehman Brothers and people are looking at Bank of America here
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.560]  in the United States in somewhat the same framework it is a world economic
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.960]  depression now that means that in order to get out of that you've got to have a
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:21.280]  recovery program what will not help you and I repeat not is a chaotic
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:27.120]  deflationary panic crash of the whole thing which is what the Austrian school
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.080]  I guess always prefers right that you've got to have the highest possible
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:35.080]  unemployment liquidate stocks liquidate bonds liquidate the former liquidate
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:39.480]  labor liquidate everybody that will that simply won't work now concerning this
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:44.200]  this debt limit the problem that you face is that the productive economy of
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.640]  the world is stuck together with these zombie banks the hedge funds and their
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:54.240]  derivatives if you want to separate them that is exactly what should be done
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.120]  that's what I've been fighting for for quite a while if you want to know how to
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.640]  do that at the top of my website toply.net there's a five-point program
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.120]  that explains a whole series of measures how to do that you've got to
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.000]  basically bring Glass-Steagall back triage the debt arrest the banksters who
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.840]  the Senate committee admitted engaged in fraud ban ban ban some derivatives ban
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.080]  credit and give out zero percent credit to small businesses yeah precisely and
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.920]  all these things at that point you can cut loose the speculators the zombie
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.720]  banks and let them go down but the way to do that is not to have the bankruptcy
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.400]  of the United States we basically have two choices no there at the end of their
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:38.480]  road they mean to bankrupt as they admit instead of them being bankrupted they
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.360]  created the fraud to bankrupt us but they're the authors of it they own it
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:46.200]  we're not going to cut them loose we're going to put them in handcuffs all right
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.800]  fine which is which is fine and that in many cases criminal prosecutions are
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:56.440]  still long overdue from 2007 2008 but generally the proposition is either the
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:00.920]  United States will put Wall Street the hedge funds and the rating agencies into
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.240]  bankruptcy receivership and a lot of them in jail or the Wall Street characters
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:10.280]  the zombie banks the hedge funds and the rating agencies will decree the
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.720]  bankruptcy and the destruction of the United States now in that case you get
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:19.000]  neo feudalism you get something worse than what you had in Europe during the
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.640]  dark ages because at least they had a church to put well that's what I want
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.680]  to talk about because I mean this is not something to scare you folks I'm
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:34.160]  scared I mean the road we're going down is absolute total post-industrial
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.760]  complete collapse and it's not like the depression when most people were
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:47.680]  self-sufficient back in one minute you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:55.200]  today you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:59.160]  respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:02.560]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:07.400]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:10.960]  name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:15.240]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.120]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.960]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:31.160]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:35.320]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:41.600]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:46.280]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have

[01:59:52.080 --> 02:00:06.520]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:13.720]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:21.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:30.080]  by the way this came out a few weeks ago and fell under the radar but the
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:34.440]  Malawi voices reporting and we've done some ferreting and confirmed it 131
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:39.960]  children vaccinated at gunpoint in Africa and UN's been caught doing this
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.880]  through their subsidiaries before that's coming up Webster Tarpoli finishing up
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:47.600]  with you and I appreciate you joining us your courage to go to Libya and hopefully
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:54.480]  we'll have a end of this bloody war for all sides but continuing from your
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:59.200]  economic analysis as an economist and a historian uniquely suited in the four
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:05.240]  minutes we've got left if the current course of global austerity and banker
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:11.880]  hegemon continues on its its its its current trajectory what is going to
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:14.920]  happen to this country in the world well the immediate threat now is this
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.120]  question the debt limit and I I'm in favor of raising the debt limit with no
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:23.680]  no conditions attached because if you don't do that what is it we're told
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:27.160]  that we don't need the government we only have the market and the market is
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:31.080]  more than enough I'm afraid this is this is false this is historically not
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:35.240]  true you would get chaos you would indeed get a catastrophe I think the
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.800]  catastrophe is much worse than what what Geithner has talked about specifically
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:45.240]  the dollar was a reserve currency what does that mean it means that central
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.760]  banks all over the world have their reserves in dollars right that's less
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:55.320]  than it used to be some euros some gold some other things but the vast majority
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:00.960]  still dollars now if the United States doesn't pay on the Treasury bonds the
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:06.120]  Treasury bonds will have a sharp collapse in price that means interest
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:11.240]  rates go up the dollar will have a sharp collapse maybe a panic maybe you'll have
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:15.480]  finally everybody rushing for the exits and at that point the central bank
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:20.120]  reserves of the world will be devalued at that point you will have a world panic
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:25.640]  and a world panic is measured in megadeth it's measured in millions of people who
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.240]  won't make it maybe not here some here I'm sure but you know maybe more in Somalia
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:35.920]  or some other some other poorer parts of the world therefore if you want to have
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.400]  a new reserve currency that's a great idea but then again you need something
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:44.440]  that looks very much like the US Treasury market with a trillion dollars a day of
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:49.840]  turnover and the ability to take just about any amount of paper and turn it
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.920]  into money trillions if necessary of dollars any day that that's liquidity
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.120]  so you're going with the model of flooding the people with money because
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.400]  they're already devaluing they're just flooding the banksters with money I would
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.840]  avoid the default I think the default would be catastrophic and people who
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:11.320]  say otherwise are wrong now in terms of what to do fight back the Webster the
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.760]  defaults already technically happened the Chinese government said that the
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:20.760]  Chinese are crybabies oh really Ron Paul look debating debt ceilings they've
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:24.720]  already created a debt system and possible to pay yeah it has to be
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.200]  reformed but the way to do it is not a deflationary panic crash that gets you
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.840]  worse than worse than the Great Depression within a couple of months the
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.760]  Chinese should cut out of the internal affairs of the United States I'm not
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.120]  interested in the Chinese whining that they bought these bonds that was a very
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.920]  foolish investment for them to begin with so they get more or less what they
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:49.280]  what they bargained for I'm not here to I'm not a lawyer for the Chinese and the
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:53.400]  Republican Party seems to want to pay the Chinese before they pay the American
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:59.080]  people I'm not for that so I think that we don't have a default we
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:03.440]  have not had a default and the idea to blur the line I think is also also
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.800]  misleading rather what can we do these waiting agencies are attacking the
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:11.680]  United States now I've always often said those guys should be trembling in the
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:17.160]  dock waiting for the sentences dressed in in you know orange jumpsuits based on
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:22.080]  what they did in 07 and 08 and in Italy the man of the hour is a guy called

[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:09.960]  then this guy dies mysteriously in the cops within minutes of getting to the

[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.720]  sign there's a cover-up Princess Diana no foul play in five minutes

[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.680]  foul play that's a telltale sign and the way they operate and even though it's
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:01.200]  obvious when they do it they do it so the cops who are involved in the

[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:52.480]  just well CNN even reports the 20 billion a year has lost in tourism and
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:57.720]  hotels and things because of this has it hurt your business that what TSA's been
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:03.560]  doing it's down it's down people don't want to be touched what's legal in the
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:08.160]  airport is illegal outside I can't tell you how many people I know and then
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:13.200]  people I talked to who know folks who like to go see a boxing match or UFC or
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:16.800]  shows in Vegas and they don't go now they're like why should we go we're

[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.520]  that because I physically couldn't control myself me either me either so
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:31.400]  you're hearing that from your customers that they're not traveling as much
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:37.880]  because of the groping yes hmm yes I do that's what the Travel Association say
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:41.400]  okay so read as part of the article
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:50.120]  well the bottom line is the 14-year veteran of airport security resigned
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:57.280]  shortly afterwards because he had to grow this man who went back into line
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.760]  like eight times before they finally touched him he took to Viagra before he
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.600]  got in line yeah let me read the headline I remember the guy in the in the
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:12.640]  Speedos but now we learn the rest of the story man takes Viagra wear sweatpants
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:16.600]  for TSA Pat down natural international airport we got to get this up on
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:21.160]  info wars.com and prisonplot.com a Wyoming man walked through TSA checkpoint
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:25.840]  with a raging erection Tuesday daring TSA officers and even fellow passengers to
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:32.480]  give him an invasive Pat down I'm next Warren Kelvin 34 screamed as he pushed
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:36.400]  to the front of the line security according to TSA official see this takes
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:40.760]  their enjoyment away when you want it this is a great tactic I'm not saying I
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:46.560]  would do this myself Kelvin had ingested to Viagra and wore sweatpants
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:50.640]  without boxers for the Southwest flight from Nashville to Phoenix I thought he
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:56.120]  was carrying a baton in his pants said Amanda watershed second-ship supervisor
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:01.480]  at a terminal at national international airport and then it goes on to say that
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:04.840]  he went through the thing four times before they would do it and it freaked
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:08.640]  out the people that were ordered to grab it well good it freaks people out to be
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.000]  grabbed and finally the TSA is like I'm not wow this is incredible this is
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:19.560]  incredible anything else well you know this just leads me to think if on a
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:24.280]  certain day maybe in the beginning of September anybody who's in the airport
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:27.240]  when they walk in they start to take their clothes off you know we need a
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:31.080]  group of nudists to go in who really don't care about this stuff and just
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:35.160]  stand there and strap well it's a family show I don't want to go much further
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:42.000]  but thank you Pamela for holding Cini in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:49.920]  Shawnee hey yeah Shawnee I want you to know that you are in my prayers and when
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:56.280]  I say you I mean you your family your staff their family are in my prayers and
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:05.880]  I pray honestly for you okay my second thing is I don't know if you have heard
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:12.800]  this and it wasn't directly told to me but I'm awake so I hear things when
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:20.800]  someone say something to me I know this veteran and we were talking one day and
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:25.400]  he said oh I've been out trying them get this trailer moved on to this property
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:32.120]  and I said oh what kind of property what kind of trailer and so he said a
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:37.240]  farming trailer tractor trailer I mean tractor that you use for farming you
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:43.760]  know to tip the land whatever so he said well I said what are you what what are
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:47.600]  you planning on growing on your land like that and so he said well whatever
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:53.960]  the government give me to grow allow me to grow on it so I'm thinking maybe it's
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:59.160]  something some kind of project they have going on with well no they do under
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.120]  under the executive orders they have a martial law program where they will
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:06.640]  basically not gonna read the executive orders you can just type in as executive
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:11.080]  orders for forced work brigades for farming and industrial uses and then
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:14.000]  they're talking about in the depression they're engineering they want to bring
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.200]  us into it slowly so we don't wake up too fast like the boiling frog they want
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.240]  to turn the heat up slow to put us into forced work brigades so so he's in the
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:28.080]  military and he's talking about farming yes he's an x veteran that was in the
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:32.960]  military yes oh so he's talking about getting government grants to do it well
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:37.880]  I don't know he didn't really come out and out and tell me but he did tell me
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.160]  that you know whatever the government gives him to grow on the land that's
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:45.080]  what he's gonna grow on the land so I don't know amazing I'm currently gonna
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.080]  apparently they're gonna give him money to do this because yeah I know he's not
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:52.680]  gonna just do it for free because he's all about making money you know what I'm
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:58.880]  very interesting try to send us some more info on that anything else okay I
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.160]  know that's it that's all I wanted to say and I just want you to know that God

[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.640]  really realize the the influence I have and so thank you for the prayers I need
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:28.480]  it and I am humbled but by the way I got to reading this article a little bit
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:33.280]  closer the Washington Fancy says in in small print under the headline you're
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:37.680]  leading misleading source of politics so I think this is satire but still
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:43.320]  entertaining about the man takes Viagra wear sweatpants for TSA Pat down that is
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:49.320]  a satire article similar to the onion Annetta in Virginia go ahead Annetta
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:54.960]  yes hello Alex how are you good welcome thank you I wanted to say thank you for

[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:30.480]  covering I think it's ridiculously horrible but things have got to get bad
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:34.680]  before they get better exactly and I think it's the call before the storm and
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:39.560]  I think everybody's waking up and doing their part well that's the good news

[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:54.040]  propaganda that's in it you see the liberal and conservative fake movements
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:59.520]  prop each other up just because Stephen Colbert attacks somebody doesn't mean

[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:08.280]  update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:11.560]  flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.000]  rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.640]  under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best part for
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:21.920]  our listeners who garden for self-reliance proto grows unique blend of
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:25.720]  sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:29.480]  creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by providing
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:32.640]  geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:36.000]  nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.760]  fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:41.840]  nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:45.320]  or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:49.200]  non-hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods

[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:12.200]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:16.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:24.240]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:28.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:32.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:36.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:44.160]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:18.520]  is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal

[02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:14.680]  America's New Slavery for more than 13 years author Jose Calazzo has been
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:19.160]  trying to prove that the US government has the capacity to read a person's
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:24.120]  thoughts with a revolutionary technology known as fmri functional
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:29.120]  magnetic resonance imaging and there is proof that it exists America's New
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:33.760]  Slavery explores this technology and it's many possible applications in
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:38.840]  national security who has access to it how is it being used does America's
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:43.880]  salvation rest in this technology these and many other questions are answered
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:50.360]  in America's New Slavery the new books by Jose Calazzo available on bn.com
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:57.360]  amazon.com and borders.com America's New Slavery all Americans should be
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:59.920]  concerned
[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:10.400]  okay I'm not gonna have time to play this whole five-minute piece but the
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:16.520]  video is up on info wars.com and prisonblender.com and Stephen Colbert a
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:22.400]  spin-off of John Stuart and his brother runs the New York Stock Exchange his
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:27.880]  name's not Stuart they sell this globalist model and make fun of
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:33.000]  conservatives make fun of Ron Paul and others and so when conservatives and
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:38.040]  good people see Stephen Colbert making fun of Rick Perry people think well he
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.400]  must be a good conservative and they make fun of Jesus and they make fun of
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:46.280]  Christians Rick Perry is cynically going to all these prayer meetings he's again
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:50.480]  Al Gore's former Chief of Staff in Texas forced inoculations nap the super
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:57.120]  highways toll roads the list goes on and on but by Colbert attacking him that
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:01.520]  actually helps him with his base see people don't understand that and then
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.640]  Colbert goes on and attacks separation of church and state implying that a
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:10.080]  presidential candidate can't pray or be a Christian or can't go speak to
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:14.800]  Christians this is very very dangerous that's why in schools public schools
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.680]  kids have been caught with Bibles just in their bag and they'll confiscate them
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.840]  that's not separation of church and state separation church and state says
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.480]  the state can't say there's an official subgroup of religion that you've got to
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:31.320]  follow and that you've got to go to church at this date and that government
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:35.280]  can make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:39.760]  a free exercise there of or the press or the rather people to peaceably
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.680]  assemble for a redress of grievances first amendment so that this is real
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.360]  tyranny that they put out as joking and funny and people actually think it's
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:54.160]  illegal it's illegal for Rick Perry to go speak to a group of Christians and
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:58.600]  then Christians see Perry being bashed and think oh he must be good this is how
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:04.600]  the left and right prop each other up here it is but I am intrigued by one
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:09.480]  candidate who hasn't declared yet Texas governor and future Josh Brolin role
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:17.280]  Rick Perry and I am not the only one who is sporting a Texas longhorn the new
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.360]  infatuation is Rick Perry governor of Texas I'm very interested in Rick Perry
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:25.520]  who's your dream candidate to get into the race I would love for Rick Perry to
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:32.680]  get into it this man needs to be president I complete I completely agree
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:37.360]  this man needs to be president we haven't had a Texas governor in the
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:42.520]  White House for almost three years think of all the unclear brush we built up
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:47.760]  and folks Perry may be going for it because on August 6th he is holding a
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.200]  rally called the response this is Governor Rick Perry and I'm inviting you
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.280]  to join your fellow America I told you to announce then fasting on behalf of
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:02.160]  our nation with the economy in trouble communities in crisis and people who
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:07.560]  drift in a sea of moral relativism we need God's help I sincerely hope you'll
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:11.640]  join me in Houston on August the 6th and take your place in Reliance Stadium
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:17.680]  with praying people asking God's forgiveness yes come pray and fast at
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:22.560]  Reliance Stadium but bring your wallet because the NFL concession stands even
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:29.200]  nothing costs $12 governor Perry knows that prayer is the only way to fix our
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:33.920]  problems folks as he told a group of donors with the tough challenges facing
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:39.280]  America quote it's time to just hand it over to God and say God you're gonna
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:46.720]  have to make this firing words Perry has looked at our problems squarely in the
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:53.200]  eye and said I got nothing jumping anytime here
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:59.480]  this is all an attack on Christianity the only group it's okay to attack after
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:03.280]  this the atheists took a break from scratching in God we trust off our
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.600]  nickels to attack the governor the freedom from religion foundation is
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:12.240]  arguing that Perry's attendance violates the separation of church and state this
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:17.200]  is exclusively Christian and it is absolutely crosses the line of church
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:24.120]  and state not true godless man cube tackle the first amendment the response
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:30.400]  rally is open to everyone its website clearly states that people of all ages
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.640]  races and backgrounds will be in attendance to proclaim Jesus as savior
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:42.200]  see he doesn't cross the line between church and state it erases it all right
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:47.680]  let's stop right there and it goes on that is a brazen front line it goes on
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:53.680]  for three more minutes attack on the first amendment of course the first
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:57.200]  amendment's freedom of assembly Rick Perry can go speak anywhere he wants to
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:02.240]  every once I mean presidents speak to Muslim religious meetings do they attack
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:04.960]  the Muslims and freak out and hyperventilate over that talk about
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:10.600]  separation of church and state they're saying that a political candidate who's
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:14.160]  not even announced even if he has announced can't go speak to a group of
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:18.520]  Christians that's like saying you can't be a Christian to be president why do
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:22.240]  they only attack Christianity they would never have a show making fun of
[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:26.600]  Buddhist they would never have one making fun of Muslims why are they
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:30.480]  attacking Christianity because the tenets of Christianity if they were
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:38.120]  actually looked at are the opposite of the New World Order anti-human system
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:41.640]  that we're all just animals so let the globalist do whatever they want with us
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:46.000]  and we don't have any free will so an attack on the first amendment by a bunch
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.160]  of fake liberals who are really Nazi anti-American scum and it helps Rick
[02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:57.520]  Perry we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:57.520 --> 02:29:59.880]  network
[02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:06.560]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:11.120]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:15.080]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:19.600]  turned in members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:24.400]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:28.760]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:34.000]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:38.320]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:41.800]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:47.040]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:44.040]  and I wanted to get both of their perspectives on what's happening over in
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:47.520]  the UK right now because this could bring down the UK Prime Minister with
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:52.960]  major geopolitical ramifications this could bring down Rupert Murdoch and the
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:56.960]  news corps empire undoubtedly media matters has been caught trying to
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:00.920]  infiltrate news corps and quote sabotage and quote destroy them so they
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:04.400]  should get in trouble as well so definitely there's politics here but
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:09.480]  still there's something is going on here the main lead investigator the main
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:13.800]  lead whistleblower that caused the police chief to be brought down of the
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:19.480]  Metro the head of Scotland Yard to be brought down the news corps except to be
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.200]  arrested and big hearings in England was found dead he told friends and family
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.040]  they're gonna kill me they're after me the police within minutes of finding the
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:33.120]  body at his house said nothing going on nothing suspicious move along and we've
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:37.800]  got all this news here so we're joined by James Corbett of the Corbett report and
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:43.120]  Tony Gosling of Builderburg dot org both great journalists and researchers to
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:47.800]  break this down but here's the headlines coming out today news international
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:52.000]  that's the news corps division in the UK deliberately blocked investigations
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:57.040]  London Guardian the Murdoch rot is deeper than hacking scandal and larger than
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:01.400]  the Murdoch Empire the excavator news London independent hacking crisis
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:06.480]  edges closer to UK Prime Minister David Cameron also Buckingham Palace God
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:11.720]  smacked by Andy Coulson's appointment as David Cameron's AIDS he headed up the
[02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:15.760]  news of the world and these operations are now working right inside the
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:20.720]  government news corps stock shot back up yesterday after Murdoch you know
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:24.520]  denied any involvement said that you know said that he knew nothing like
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:30.800]  Sergeant Schultz Rupert Murdoch sewer press son attacks Tony Pharrell the
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:36.720]  police terrorism investigator who said that 9-11 and 7-7 are inside jobs so
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:41.920]  they're back at their normal business of covering up the truth gentlemen
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:46.520]  joining us Tony Gosling and James Corbett we talked to Tony earlier in the
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:50.680]  week he's with us in a moment but let's first talk to James Corbett joining us
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:55.440]  from Japan who's been filing reports on this what is your take on these
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.720]  developments well first thank you for having me on about this especially this
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:03.840]  this story which I think is absolutely so important right now but I think what
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:07.760]  this story is essentially it's an onion and we're just peeling back the layer
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:11.640]  after layer after layer and getting closer to the heart and I imagine we're
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:14.640]  not going to get down to bedrock we're not gonna find the heart of the onion
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:18.240]  but we are gonna peel off quite a few layers and some some heads are gonna
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.400]  roll whether figuratively or unfortunately in some cases literally as
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:24.960]  we've already seen with the death of the whistleblower as you as you already
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:29.360]  pointed out but but I think what we're seeing here there's definitely politics
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:32.760]  going on and there's definitely a reason that this was coming out at this
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:37.360]  time I think there the fact that Murdoch was going for the B sky B network and
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:42.440]  trying to consolidate the power even more in Europe just as this this came to
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:46.400]  a head I think that that's more than coincidental but but regardless of why
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:49.760]  this is happening or how it's coming out right now or how much of the truth
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:53.520]  we're going to get I think this is still a golden opportunity for people who are
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:58.480]  trying to expose the the absolute horrific revolting disgusting things
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:02.880]  that these vermin were doing in the name of of selling a few newspapers I mean
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:07.480]  hacking into the phones of dead children I mean you just could not get any more
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:11.680]  disgusting than this and the fact that it's a vast criminal conspiracy I mean
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:16.440]  this is where conspiracy theorizing meets conspiracy fact I mean and the
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.840]  bribing of police you've got that going on and it's just the beginning and now
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:25.320]  you've got the whistleblower dead and the police say move along that's really
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:29.320]  suspicious it's not only suspicious it actually goes to the heart of the
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:33.240]  scandal because the question is who do you get to investigate a death like that
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:36.760]  it's obviously not the Metropolitan Police who as you say are deeply
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:40.800]  implicated in this scandal it's clearly not the Parliament which is obviously
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:43.640]  going to be beholden to the Prime Minister who's deeply implicated in the
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:47.560]  scandal what it's not the press because obviously they're deeply it's not
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:52.400]  Scotland Yard maybe because they've they've they're deeply involved like I
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:57.200]  mean who do you get to do it clearly this is an absolute institutional
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:01.240]  breakdown and if I think for the people of Britain this is an absolute key
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:05.520]  moment to to really grasp what the power structure is and how it how it
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:09.200]  operates but the way I see this basically I think this exposes how
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:13.880]  government is just this vast reservoir of power that's been centralized and put
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:17.240]  into this place where where politicians can then be put in the back pockets of
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:20.840]  media moguls or whoever has the money to buy them up and they can put their
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:24.720]  snoot into the into the vast reservoir of power and drink from it whenever they
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:28.120]  need it whenever they need a regulation change through a law enforced to
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:32.120]  wherever they need Scotland Yard to look the other way and this this exposes
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:35.360]  that dark heart which is why it's such an important story and I hope people are
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:39.040]  really following this closely because I think basically we're vampire hunters
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:42.960]  and there's the New World Order vampire and we've got a big fat wooden stake in
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:45.880]  our hand ready to drive it through their heart and I think this story is
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:48.720]  something we can use to do that I want to come back to James Corbett of
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:52.320]  Corbett report calm here in just a moment but going to former BBC
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:59.520]  investigator radio host and Bilderberg sleuth Tony Gosling Tony looking at this
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:05.280]  clearly the old BBC order is in trouble clearly Murdoch was consolidating power
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:08.800]  and his political minions so there's a power struggle going on here but you
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.840]  had this death to this I mean who would stand again by the investigator dying
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:18.680]  they admit that this could bring down the prime minister what can you tell
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:24.840]  us about your intel being there in England and all your media sources
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:28.280]  about the mysterious death of the whistleblower who we know told his
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:32.240]  neighbors that they're coming to get me you know I'm hiding in my house with a
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.120]  lights off and then he's found dead and the police within 20 minutes they move
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:41.840]  along not suspicious and don't give us any details what do you know about Mr.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:44:08.960]  here yeah sure and he was a kind of old-traditional style police with journalists someone who'd been working on tabloid papers for many years from before the Murdoch era and so he was kind of an interesting character because he was quite an honest guy and he obviously didn't like the kind of work that they were putting into thankfully BBC panorama interviewed him before he died so we've got a lot of his information on record but of course he
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:20.240]  didn't mean to say you can stand up in court now and testify against Andy Cawson and that seems quite clear that the guy's been assassinated is Bedfordshire police that will investigate it and of course they've already come out with some
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:28.400]  statement from the PR department saying that there's nothing suspicious here it's a bit weird Alex because the last time I was talking to you earlier in the week the police was stood over
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:49.320]  sure and I was body scratching their heads and wondering what was going on it was just literally just the story broke just literally after I was speaking to you but I think what James was talking about there what is at the heart of this onion I think what we've got here is becoming clearer and clearer that the links between these three major institutions that is
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:45:02.760]  Downing Street and New Zealand and also the Scotland Yard are Masonic links this is one of the things that's coming out in many little bits and pieces of books over the years
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:22.760]  I mean it's the Masonic mafia that's been big national news in England for those that don't know that you can't become a judge or a high level barrister even get a job now if you're not a Mason and that's a form of discrimination and you're saying there's that nexus point between the head of news of the world going to work for Cameron and the police please continue
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:41.760]  Yeah so I think that's becoming pretty clear it's even it even came out in the Guardian article about three weeks ago that one of the characters involved in this affair has been going around actually he managed to recruit a Masonic police officer who went around recruiting various tax officials
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:57.760]  who took about customs officials people like this who had access to private information for the specific purpose of selling that information to news international and giving them the guarantee that there would be no prosecution because he was a senior police officer this was all happening within Masonic lodges in central London
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:19.760]  so that's actually exposed it was fascinating to hear Simon Hughes the chairman of the book democrat party on news networks at the BBC's main news programme on the evenings here last week actually saying we have to make sure that whoever's in charge of this judicial inquiry into phone hacking because of the horrific nature of hacking into phones of dead soldiers and this kind of thing
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:47.760]  and this is what's upset the establishment so much in Britain and we have to make sure that this is not a free Mason and this was actually said on national television on the main news programme so it's not just me saying this this is the highest echelons of the Liberal Democrat party making it quite clear that they will make sure that there is no suspicion that the judge in charge of this judicial inquiry into phone hacking is in any way connected through some sort of secret society
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:47:07.760]  with some of the main players involved and this kind of thing has come out through really simply through looking at interesting connections between individuals with a revolving door syndrome you know where they're working at news international suddenly they pop up working at Downing Street then suddenly they disappear and pop up again at Scotland Yard
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:23.760]  how is common purpose involved I mean this is sensational to have even the government talking about we can't have masons investigating this I mean sensational is the only word for those that don't know they love to use the secrecy
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:43.760]  you're being a bit generous to the Liberal Democrat saying that they are government even though they are in the coalition they're very very much the junior partner and because Nick Clegg is such a weak character that's one of the reasons why I say that he's the Liberal Democrat leader but he's basically he's simply the fag the public school boy fag from public school of David Cameron
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:58.760]  he just runs around doing everything that David wants to do and trying desperately to please David who could never be pleased enough but I was listening to all the commentary today from the House of Parliament with Cameron really on the ropes being interrogated by all these
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:16.760]  legally trained MPs and it was quite clear that he is playing exactly the same game as Rupert Murdoch was yesterday and that's for some of the police. Murdoch played the part of a quizling who couldn't find his pants and was like jeez sonny they let me out of the nursing home to come to this.
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:32.760]  That's right he was exactly right and he was saying that you know we didn't know we didn't know well one thing I could tell you is that inside of his work in journalism at London in the 1990s is that everybody knows except maybe the public that Rupert Murdoch is intensely
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:50.760]  intensely interested in how journalists get stories every story that appears in one of his newspapers which is a major sensation of any sort he would be immediately, particularly if he's flying across one part of the world on the phone to that journalist how did you get that story well done
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:49:06.760]  he wants to know everything about the way his organization is operating so for him to stand or actually sit down at the cultural media board select committee yesterday and say I didn't know I didn't know and I know this is all a big surprise to me.
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:22.760]  Well here's the issue I want to go back to Corbett from it and then back to you but going to James Corbett I mean that more and more this is looking like it could bring down the Cameron government but then what do we get from that and how will this affect news international and news
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:37.760]  core and other divisions around the world James? Very important question because we have to be very careful not to let them get us to throw them in the briar patch and give them the power to regulate free speech in the press even more because as you know I mean
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:54.760]  Britain is just a terrible place for free speech as it is it has nothing even close to the First Amendment types of guarantees of freedom of speech so certainly we wouldn't want to see even greater regulation of the press as a result of this if that only indicates that basically whatever
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:09.760]  media or multimedia mogul billionaire can come along and buy some more politicians and have the whole scandal kick off again in the future so I think the answer to this has to be a decentralization of power and this is a greatly destabilizing event and I think we could conceivably see the
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:24.760]  Cameron government fall over this at some point down the road so it is a huge thing that's happening right now and again there's a lot of back room politics taking place but... Yes we're going to break...
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:39.760]  This is the establishment fighting with itself in Britain actually the Conservative Party generally represents the establishment of what's happened is because of the horrendous nature of this Murdoch activity and also the fact that it is competing in a way with the official security
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:55.760]  he's running his own little intelligence gathering bunker at New International but this has really split the Conservative Party from the sort of shall we say internationalist Conservatives to the more nationalistic Conservatives and I think that the majority of the traditional Conservative
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:12.760]  with a small seat Tory party absolutely enough to stay there stay there Berkey water filters are in high demand storeable foods are also in high demand big Berkey water filters dot com has always kept our focus on the Berkey water filter products but increasingly our customers have been asking for

[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:41.760]  the fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to

[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:30.760]  we saw the NSA involved in a bunch of thieving one of their people blows the whistle on it they indict him you just got probation last week we see this whistleblower being killed telling neighbors they're coming to kill me hiding in his house in the dark
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:54.760]  the police show up and tell the press don't worry nothing going on here and then talking to Tony Gosling he's talking about conservative members of the conservative party instead of the David Cameron carbon tax internationalist who were just part two of Gordon Brown trying to basically dominate England and control it
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:55:08.760]  Is that what you were getting at Tony Gosling? Yes Alex I mean essentially we're talking about a lot of retired military a lot of retired professional people really make up the establishment and the establishment in this country is like a big oil tanker
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:22.760]  Cameron is trying to turn that oil tank around failing miserably letting down the party many people in the party including Christopher Shale who was David Cameron's immediate boss he died at the Glastonbury Pop Festival a few weeks ago in mysterious circumstances
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:38.760]  he was saying in a lead to memo two days before he died that the post-cursor party was losing its way with a bunch of spids and this kind of thing and so you can see what's going on here you've got basically Cameron is kind of implanted
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:50.760]  infiltrator inside the conservative party and they've realized this is not a party or at least many of the traditional conservatives in the establishment and they're trying to get rid of him because they know he'll lose the next election and destroy the economy
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  they've got all these deaths taking place which shows this is only the tip of the iceberg blackmail private intelligence groups you name it going on Stephen Corbett what do you Stephen Corbett James Corbett Corbett that was playing Stephen Corbett earlier
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:22.760]  James Corbett Corbett report what do you make of this war on whistleblowers all over the world whether it's the DC madam or whether it's NSA people are now this whistleblower and then out of the gates the government saying you know no foul play move along
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:36.760]  right well it's pretty obvious what the agenda here is overall and that's to try to discredit anyone who does step forward with information from behind the scenes because obviously that's the type of thing that can bring down governments and I had a report up recently about
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:52.760]  the types of organizations that are supposed to be protecting whistleblowers like the project on government oversight and other groups like that that are supposedly about saving the whistleblowers and protecting them but are you know actually funded by the very foundations that are run by the rock
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:57:06.760]  carnagies and the usual suspects who have a vested interest in making sure that the truth doesn't get out but I think another aspect of this whole Murdoch scandal that I hope doesn't get lost and I've got a huge video report going up in the next couple of hours on Corbett report dot com so I hope people will get that out
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:18.760]  because it contains some of the clips of for example Murdoch talking about how he tried to use his media in the United States to shape the Iraq war policy and to try to promote the Bush war doctrine said that it gave us two years ago
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:32.760]  that's right exactly to build a burger Charlie Rose who was interviewing him at the time and I also got the clip of the Fox PR propaganda video that they put out about how they deliberately consciously insert global warming propaganda into as many different
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  shows as they possibly can so that they can help indoctrinate people into the world leading the conservative movement just like David Cameron is a wolf in sheep's clothing leading the tea party opposition type folks in his country absolutely
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:58:02.760]  take a look at James Murdoch the guy who's obviously been being groomed to take over the whole the whole Kid and Kaboodle once Papa Murdoch dies he's not only a non executive director of Glaxo Smith Klein the wonderful nourishing manufacturer of all those good
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:18.760]  hardy healthy vaccines but he's also married to a woman who works for the Clinton climate initiative so we have another billionaire family that's so obsessed with carbon footprints and all of this in the neo eugenics of depopulation so again it just keeps going down
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:34.760]  and that's why they got Bill O'Reilly endorsing carbon taxes and VAT because the big bankers in Murdoch are pretty much exempt from taxes they want to raise our taxes so in reality they're funding Hillary Clinton and the rest of it and David's court paid negative taxes last year
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:50.760]  yeah we'll be I'm gonna go into overdrive main shows over internet only coming up stay with us thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN Live.com today

[03:00:06.760 --> 03:00:26.760]  alright retransmissions coming up we got five more minutes left live and I could have Tony Gosling James Corbett on Stephen Corbair on for hours you know discussing this news court thing this is not just about phone hacking this is a much larger situation that's why these deaths are involved
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:50.760]  and I wanted to go back to Tony Gosling and finish up with James Corbett Tony looking at the tea leaves from across the pond it looks like news corps is floundering around even though their stock of news international news corps went up yesterday after the hearing do you think Murdoch's going to be able to survive this where do you see this going
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:01:09.760]  I really don't think Murdoch can survive because it's like an express train this story there's so much more to go I can tell you where I think this is going in the direction next which was hinted at a couple of times in the House of Commons debate today which is to do with the official vetting systems that are used to vet various individuals who are working in central
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:29.760]  government and particularly in Downing Street and this is a really explosive issue which is being now looked at and a vetting is obviously completely nonsense Andy Coulson this guy who now seems is a major criminal has been working in Downing Street for the last two years he only resigned very recently
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:41.760]  but this is this was several people are now asking what about this vetting system that said that Andy Coulson was a fit guy to work for you Mr Cameron so yes this is coming home to Cameron I think Cameron ultimately will have to resign over this
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:59.760]  why are they saying this hurts the Queen I don't think I think the Queen is trying to stay a little bit away from it but let's not forget what the vetting system is absolutely crucial they try and keep it secret but the company that does the underground security system is an Israeli firm which wasn't properly
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:19.760]  vetted and this is run by this guy Daniel Bodner it's called Varyn systems and they were converse technologies until they changed their name and as you know this is the same company that was responsible for the massive Amdok scandal around about 2000 and this is an Israeli military running a private firm which is running all of the security on the
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:35.760]  London underground system these are the kinds of lapses in vetting which I think is where this story is now heading well they're not lapses if they can't get British intelligence to do what they're told they'll bring the Israelis in they would much rather have a company which is actually
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:53.760]  accountable to do the public transportation security this is what the passengers and the people of London want but what's happening is they're using these corrupt vetting agencies to actually implant the enemy into the heart
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:03:15.760]  Tony it's clear we're going to have to get more updates from you this week and next week as this develops thank you so much for spending time with us I understand Molek Murdoch thank you Tony we got a minute and a half two minutes last word James Corbett go ahead
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:31.760]  well okay just to just to back up what I said before the break news news corp made a 10 10 and a half billion or so dollars in pre-tax profit over the past four years 2000 2007 to 2010 and they paid guess how much taxes they paid negative four and a half
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:46.760]  billion they actually got four and a half billion dollars back in taxes so this is exactly the type of crony capitalist system that we've been unfortunately force fed into and and that's exactly why these types of mega conglomerates are always going to be able to buy whatever
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:04:01.760]  politicians they need to get whatever regulation they need to do whatever they want and that's exactly why I think ultimately the real solution to this is in the hands of the people because the people vote with their dollars and if they don't support these massive mega corporations
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:16.760]  these they will fail I mean we can make a difference and and I think we have to start doing that because clearly the government's not going to do it for us and the police agencies aren't going to do it for us and this this scandal is is too wide too big but again I think this is a golden
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:28.760]  opportunity for people who are trying to expose this type of collusion because here it is right out in the open it's playing itself out on the TV for the dumb down sheeple to to imbibe every every night and they can't get away from it
[03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:41.760]  so this is a golden opportunity to shove this in people's faces and really expose what the system is doing well I like the area you got into earlier how they lead the carbon tax grids they lead the forced inoculation grids the Murdoch family
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:54.760]  they admit they propagandize for global warming taxes and then they lead the opposition to the global warming movement so they can have it falter at the key moment they're behind Rick Perry Al Gore's former chief of staff in Texas
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:05:01.760]  I mean it is just incredible and they run the fake conservatives in England and that's coming to a head retransmission starts now
