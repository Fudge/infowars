[00:00.000 --> 00:19.560]  Yes, it was election night. It was November 8th, 2016. We are now through the storm.
[00:19.560 --> 00:31.000]  And it is November 9th, almost Wednesday, worldwide broadcast. We are seeing horrible
[00:31.000 --> 00:42.360]  sore losers. We are seeing Hillary not give her concession last night. We clearly saw massive
[00:42.360 --> 00:48.600]  election fraud in places like California where we're told Mitt Romney got more votes
[00:48.600 --> 00:55.380]  than Trump. We are seeing the total weaponization of the media to the next level with total
[00:55.380 --> 01:07.000]  racial division and the media inflicting psychological wounds on the inheritors of America. Whether
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.880]  they be Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter. And it just shows us that our work's
[01:13.880 --> 01:25.040]  just begun. Yes, this is incredibly positive. Trump has been given the trifecta. The Republicans
[01:25.040 --> 01:31.120]  have the House, the Republicans have the Senate, the Republicans have the White House, and
[01:31.120 --> 01:43.880]  now they will have the Supreme Court. That said, if folks will just listen to me, because
[01:43.880 --> 01:51.840]  I live this, I know this, we're going to lay out the enemy's attack plan and how we're
[01:51.840 --> 02:04.520]  going to counter them. But you're witnessing providence. The globalists are in terror,
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.360]  but the enemy is going to strike back. And now is the time to realize the Republican
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.920]  Party leadership, Paul Ryan, all of them must go. We cannot make a deal with them and now
[02:15.920 --> 02:22.280]  play nice in politics. Trump has to know the media, the Democrats and the Republican Party
[02:22.280 --> 02:27.000]  are going to come after him even more. We have to get behind him. We have to pray for
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.600]  him. And ladies and gentlemen, we have to remove the criminals at the top of the Justice
[02:36.600 --> 02:43.400]  Department, the FBI, Congress. We have to dig them out, not in an vindictive way. These
[02:43.400 --> 02:51.560]  are shameful people. CNN, MSNBC, all of it is already a husk. They must fall completely.
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.960]  There needs to be prosecutions for racketeering via the emails, organized crime between the
[02:56.960 --> 03:05.640]  media and the White House and Hillary. The crime's all there, fraud, colluding, bid-rigging,
[03:05.640 --> 03:11.160]  influence peddling. You name it, the entire book they've committed over and over again.
[03:11.160 --> 03:16.840]  Because they're not going to stop. This would be like World War II and just kicking the
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.400]  Nazis out of France and out of Russia. They were months away from atomic weapons. They
[03:22.400 --> 03:31.720]  would have had a nuclear war, an atomic war. You cannot leave them there. We have to go
[03:31.720 --> 03:38.360]  in to Berlin and dig them out of their goddamn holes. And excuse me, I don't use the Lord's
[03:38.360 --> 03:44.480]  name in vain. I mean, they are GD devils. And I love God, and I just want to say this.
[03:44.480 --> 03:54.480]  I want to thank Jesus Christ for this providence, and I want to thank God Almighty, Father of
[03:54.480 --> 04:02.240]  the Holy Spirit, Christ. I want to thank the Trinity for the second chance we've been given.
[04:02.240 --> 04:08.200]  But if we do not repent and seek God's face, and if we don't deliver on real jobs and real
[04:08.200 --> 04:17.360]  prosperity and real love and show everybody what real Western Christian values are, the
[04:17.360 --> 04:22.240]  enemy that poses like they're that is going to end up winning. They have inflicted such
[04:22.240 --> 04:29.520]  wickedness and such hate and such race-baiting garbage into these desperate women and others
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.480]  that are absolutely scared to death because they're not being fulfilled, so they think
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.520]  doubling down on the state will bring them there. We're going to go to break. I'm going
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.280]  to come back and briefly speak to Paul Watson. I'm going to lay out the numbers and what
[04:41.280 --> 04:49.160]  we're facing and how the globalists are planning to counter us straight ahead on the other
[04:49.160 --> 04:55.520]  side of this break. But this is, this is, Defense Ship 1 in the battle for not just
[04:55.520 --> 05:01.160]  the Republic. This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com, and this is one of the most amazing times
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.800]  to be alive right now in history. Something your grandchildren will look back on and go,
[05:05.800 --> 05:11.840]  grandpa, grandma, you are part of that. That is mind-blowing. Think about this. In 24 hours,
[05:11.840 --> 05:18.360]  we will know who the next president of the United States is. This is so crazy. This
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.440]  is down to the wire. Let's look at some of these headlines that are happening right now
[05:22.440 --> 05:28.640]  on Drudge Report. Obama encourages illegals to vote. Stocks go boom. High drama in Sunshine
[05:28.640 --> 05:33.440]  State. Election in-game fight. Final charge through battleground states. Trump pops the
[05:33.440 --> 05:39.400]  biggest lead at IDP. LA Times has Trump plus five. Traffic to get into Trump's rally in
[05:39.400 --> 05:45.320]  Pennsylvania backed up for miles. WikiLeaks server under hack attack as DNC emails released.
[05:45.320 --> 05:49.800]  Think about this. This is our Brexit. They're telling us we can't win. George Washington
[05:49.800 --> 06:15.080]  Brexit before it was cool. This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com, and we will prevail.
[06:15.080 --> 06:34.600]  We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[06:34.600 --> 07:03.320]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[07:03.320 --> 07:09.920]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[07:09.920 --> 07:15.320]  it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates,
[07:15.320 --> 07:21.360]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.240]  Now when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.160]  clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an
[07:31.160 --> 07:37.400]  antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. This is a formula to deliver the maximum
[07:37.400 --> 07:43.400]  amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the
[07:43.400 --> 07:48.280]  product that I take. infowarslife.com and the profit we make. We fight the global. We fight
[07:48.280 --> 07:53.160]  the new world order. Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free
[07:53.160 --> 08:07.320]  888-253-3139. We got you in a stranglehold, globalist. Leading
[08:07.320 --> 08:15.640]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:15.640 --> 08:18.200]  I want to have a little victory laugh. I'm about to go to Paul Watson and lay out what
[08:18.200 --> 08:26.840]  we're facing. The good, the bad, and the ugly. This is historic. Donald Trump is 1776 reborn.
[08:26.840 --> 08:33.560]  We are living it. Obviously, the Trump revolution is powered by you, the info war. You are recognized
[08:33.560 --> 08:39.320]  as the front lines. But can we replay that because I want to play a little bit of stranglehold
[08:39.320 --> 08:43.960]  here because this is some of the music we play around here to get our game face on.
[08:43.960 --> 08:51.080]  Can we cue that back up and play that? We are living in an extremely historic time,
[08:51.080 --> 08:58.360]  to say the least. Everybody knows that. The enemy has always known that the information
[08:58.360 --> 09:11.080]  we cover is historical and is basically a rediscovery of what humans are. The enemy
[09:11.080 --> 09:22.760]  wants to keep us in an artificial system of total control. Now, it's not a power trip.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  Trump's people listen to me. A frontal assault on the lies of the new world. You listen. It's
[09:31.000 --> 09:40.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And most people are lazy in politics. Most people don't
[09:40.440 --> 09:46.600]  actually try to go research how things work. And their whole system is based on you not knowing
[09:46.600 --> 09:52.200]  how it works. We're here exposing the rabbit tricks, like a book you go by that tells you
[09:52.200 --> 09:58.440]  how they do all those magic tricks. Then you know it's not real. We don't want a system
[09:58.440 --> 10:06.040]  based on magic tricks, based on sorcery, based on the public of trance. We don't want a system
[10:06.040 --> 10:16.520]  based on delusion. We want a system based on true renaissance. And in the fight for human
[10:16.520 --> 10:24.760]  liberty and the future of this species, the victory last night is one of the greatest
[10:25.880 --> 10:31.880]  in the entire compendium of our human journey. The globalists have now realized that we were
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.640]  asleep because they were strangling us. They thought they'd beaten us. They thought they
[10:37.640 --> 10:41.160]  thought we were conscious of what they were doing in their own delusion. Now,
[10:43.640 --> 10:47.320]  they begin to realize that they don't have us in a stranglehold.
[10:49.160 --> 10:55.160]  We've got them in the stranglehold. And we cannot let go until the light
[10:55.160 --> 11:02.600]  goes out of their eyes. We're going to Paul Watson here to give his take on this after
[11:02.600 --> 11:08.840]  working, I know, for 20 plus hours, 30 hours or more without sleeping. But I thought we'd have
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.760]  the Motor City Madman bring us in here. We have a lot of guests obviously coming on today. We have
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.840]  Trump's victory speech. We have analysis of Hillary. But most importantly, let me give you the big
[11:20.840 --> 11:30.360]  news because all of this is key. And I don't say this to be arrogant. I say this because if we
[11:30.360 --> 11:38.920]  don't do these things, we're going to lose. And it just makes me love this republic and love
[11:38.920 --> 11:44.600]  this world and love the good people of it more that providence has come again.
[11:44.600 --> 11:53.400]  Lightning has struck the same place again. Everything the founders of this country
[11:53.400 --> 12:00.600]  stood for, their incredible honor and courage and will and vision is our inheritance no matter
[12:00.600 --> 12:04.920]  what color you are or where you came from, if you embrace it. And that's why the enemy
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.160]  wants to pull it down because they cannot compete with that Renaissance
[12:09.160 --> 12:17.320]  that came through Europe, came through the English Isles and came into our republic.
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.800]  They want to kill it because it is the Renaissance. It is competition. It is free will. It is open,
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.360]  true free societies. Why do you think George Soros calls his group the open society? Because it's
[12:28.360 --> 12:35.320]  the opposite of an open society. Everything they tell you is the opposite of what they're doing.
[12:35.320 --> 12:39.560]  They say they're liberal because they're the opposite. They scramble everything. So here's
[12:39.560 --> 12:44.920]  the bottom line. I'm going to lay it out today. They're going to scorch earth in the next two
[12:44.920 --> 12:47.800]  and a half months they have left. You think opening the borders and bringing people in with
[12:48.760 --> 12:55.400]  cholera and TB and even wet leprosy is bad. They are going to gut everything. They are going to be
[12:55.400 --> 13:01.720]  giving secrets to the Chinese at a over the top rate. They're not going to slowly sell them now.
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.760]  It's going to be wholesale everything. They're going to, just like the UN troops in Haiti,
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.760]  just crapped in the $20 million water supply system just for fun, just to watch the kids die.
[13:13.320 --> 13:17.080]  You go, why do they do it? It's a ritual. It's a spirit.
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.960]  They don't have to organize it. It's the mystery the Bible talks about of evil.
[13:25.240 --> 13:31.240]  It's a broadcast. It's a wavelength they're tuned into and they want to crap on this country.
[13:31.240 --> 13:34.920]  They want to crap on you because they know, even though you're beaten down,
[13:34.920 --> 13:37.880]  even though we've been dumbed down, even though we've been scrambled and turned against each
[13:37.880 --> 13:42.840]  other, there is a spirit of liberty there that they must extinguish at all costs.
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.040]  And you want to know why we can stand up against the globalist. It's because we have the spirit.
[13:52.600 --> 13:58.760]  And it's the true Christian spirit. And this is all thanks to people praying what you're witnessing
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.880]  and Trump had better deliver, but they are going to scorch. That's why I'm not here celebrating
[14:03.880 --> 14:10.760]  because we just won a major battle. Now we have to cherish the Republic and God and everything
[14:10.760 --> 14:15.000]  that we have been given that much more. That's why I get tears in my eyes. I used to get them
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.400]  once a year. Now I get them every five minutes because the energy level is so high. The strength
[14:19.400 --> 14:26.200]  is so high. The spirit of good is coming back into the world. They've taken over the churches
[14:26.200 --> 14:32.520]  via the World Council of Churches. We're going to Watson admittedly to teach you. It's the end
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.120]  of the world to teach you. We've got to fail to teach you that everything's going to go bad,
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.280]  that evil runs the show to steal your birthright from you and to make you think you already lost.
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.120]  They didn't teach this in the churches until 100 years ago, folks. That's the defeatism.
[14:48.120 --> 14:49.640]  That's the anti-Christ spirit.
[14:49.640 --> 15:00.360]  We can turn this around any time just like Jonah in Nineveh. We have to submit to the evil for it
[15:00.360 --> 15:06.760]  to win and amazing things are happening. So how are they going to counter strike? What are they
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.120]  going to do in the last two and a half months? How are the Republican Party going to try to sabotage
[15:10.120 --> 15:13.320]  him because he doesn't really have the trifecta yet. He has the House, has the Senate, about to
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.360]  get the Supreme Court, but they're going to sabotage Trump. They're going to try to kill him now.
[15:16.360 --> 15:23.720]  You can guarantee that Donald Trump now has to say, I've got to go govern and get ready and work
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.520]  behind the scenes and have the light on until midnight every night because when he goes out
[15:28.520 --> 15:33.160]  in public, they're going to try to kill him. You can just absolutely guarantee that Trump,
[15:33.160 --> 15:37.560]  he's to get his people in place first before he keeps risking his life with the whole daredevil
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.800]  stunt, which he did because they tried to kill him politically, but they're going to try to kill
[15:41.800 --> 15:46.040]  Trump. They're going to try to further gut the country. They're going to try to torture us like
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.040]  they've done in the UK, threatening everybody. You can't leave the EU or we'll destroy your economy.
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.960]  You saw that in the stock market overnight, then Trump came out and spoke and boosted it back up.
[15:53.960 --> 16:00.280]  This is a total war, people. So we're in the middle of a full out war. If we were in a naval
[16:00.280 --> 16:04.040]  battle, let's use another World War II allegor, I hate to pick on the Germans. I mean, I'm part
[16:04.040 --> 16:07.080]  German myself, great folks. The point is, let's say you got the Bismarck out there and you got the
[16:07.080 --> 16:12.280]  Royal Oak and the rest of them and trying to shoot its rudder off. We have just blown up the Bismarck.
[16:12.280 --> 16:17.960]  But there's eight or nine other battleships over there and we got to get, oh, we just
[16:17.960 --> 16:23.960]  blew the Bismarck up. We're under attack right now. We have to sink every freaking one of their
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.120]  ships. You understand that? This is an information war. We have to press the attack now like we're
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.680]  losing because if you don't have that press attack, you will lose the initiative and inertia.
[16:34.680 --> 16:42.600]  America, it was bleeding to death and on its deathbed, it now has a chance, is pale,
[16:43.240 --> 16:49.160]  but is trying to get to some soup. So we're not even close to out of this, but if you have the
[16:49.160 --> 16:54.040]  desperation and you pray and you take action, you have honor and strength and speak out to others,
[16:54.840 --> 16:59.000]  we're truthful, we're loving, we're good, it's clear. We're not race baiting horrible demons
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.920]  like these people. Then we can defeat them and it's happening now. Now, Paul Watson, I'm going to let
[17:04.920 --> 17:07.640]  you go, I'm going to skip this break. I'm going to let you go in a few minutes. You haven't even
[17:07.640 --> 17:11.480]  got a lot of articles right. A lot's happened. I've kind of thrown that out. I'm going to cover
[17:11.480 --> 17:18.920]  the waterfront here, but we see the sore losers. We see how nasty they are. I understand Trump
[17:18.920 --> 17:22.760]  needed to be conciliatory, so the stock market wouldn't completely plunge, but I really think
[17:22.760 --> 17:26.840]  he needs to just press the point that we're going to have to get rid of Paul Ryan. We're going to
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.200]  have to get rid of all the neocons, the rhinos, all of them, not just because it's the right thing to
[17:32.200 --> 17:38.120]  do and they're part of this power structure, but they're not going to ever make a deal with Trump
[17:38.120 --> 17:44.440]  because they were picked of old, because they were compromised. They're scum. And so do you agree
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.240]  with me on that statement? Yeah, completely, Alex. That's what they're going to try to do. They're
[17:49.240 --> 17:55.000]  going to try to stuff his cabinet with people like Paul Ryan, neocons, never Trump people.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.920]  That's the attack plan that they're going to try and carry forth. And the other angle is,
[17:58.920 --> 18:05.000]  you know, after Brexit, which I said immediately after, yes, enjoy it, celebrate it, but watch out
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.880]  because they're going to try and derail it. They're going to try and dilute it. That's exactly
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.640]  what happened. They took it to the high court. Now they're trying to water it down. Some people
[18:13.640 --> 18:17.720]  are trying to get it not passed altogether. They're going to try and hamstring Trump.
[18:17.720 --> 18:21.960]  These riots are going to happen. They're already happening last night because, you know,
[18:21.960 --> 18:27.080]  tolerant liberals are so peaceful. They're out rioting. Those riots, that unrest is going to
[18:27.080 --> 18:32.280]  be blamed again on Donald Trump. So you're going to have a series of negative things. Every single
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.400]  negative thing that happens between now and January will be blamed on Donald Trump. That's
[18:37.400 --> 18:42.200]  their next next plan of attack. You outlined it in the video, which is on Drudge Report.
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.120]  They're going to say anything that goes wrong in the economy, despite the fact that it was going
[18:46.120 --> 18:51.960]  to happen anyway, is the fault of Donald Trump. So before he even takes office, he's going to have his
[18:51.960 --> 18:55.640]  hands tied behind his back, and that is the battle going forward for us.
[18:58.840 --> 18:59.960]  Please continue watching.
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.400]  Yeah, well, the article's up on Infowars. Basically, there were riots in Portland,
[19:05.400 --> 19:11.240]  there were riots in Oakland, and all over Twitter, the death threats against Donald Trump,
[19:11.240 --> 19:16.520]  as he said, have gone through the roof, they're soaring. Somebody, some crazy person who the
[19:16.520 --> 19:21.160]  DNC pays to start violence at Donald Trump rallies, we know that that was exposed. They're
[19:21.160 --> 19:25.240]  going to try and take a pot shot at Donald Trump. We've warned about this all along.
[19:25.240 --> 19:30.680]  It happened. Somebody tried to assassinate Trump at one of his rallies, and now the intensity of
[19:30.680 --> 19:36.600]  that hatred, while they accuse us of being hateful bigots, the intensity of their hatred has been
[19:36.600 --> 19:42.200]  turned up to 11, you're going to see more shenanigans between now and January, and people need to be
[19:42.200 --> 19:50.360]  aware of that. Continue. The other aspect which I was talking about earlier, Alex, is,
[19:51.080 --> 19:55.560]  you know, the media for months has said, oh, this is about a demagogue. This is about one man.
[19:55.560 --> 20:00.680]  It's never been about one man. You saw with Brexit. Brexit wasn't about Boris Johnson.
[20:00.680 --> 20:06.440]  Brexit wasn't about Nigel Farage. It was about a movement. This is about a movement. It's not
[20:06.440 --> 20:11.320]  about a demagogue. It's not about Donald Trump. If it wasn't for Donald Trump, somebody else would
[20:11.320 --> 20:16.840]  have been there at the right place at the right time, because now is the time when this movement
[20:16.840 --> 20:20.680]  is happening across the West. It's happening in Germany. It's happening in France. It's
[20:20.680 --> 20:25.320]  happening in all these other countries. And again, the thing with Trump is it's not about the
[20:25.320 --> 20:31.000]  Republican Party. It's about a movement. It's about reinvigorating the American dream. It's
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.200]  about ultimately saving Western civilization. That was the red line in the sand. Thankfully,
[20:38.200 --> 20:44.040]  we've been spared for a short time longer. And now they're going to try and throw all hell to
[20:44.040 --> 20:49.080]  hamstring him, to tie his hands behind his back before he even gets into the Oval Office. You
[20:49.080 --> 20:53.800]  saw that Hillary speech earlier. You probably caught the end of it. People are all over Twitter
[20:53.800 --> 21:01.960]  saying, oh, how gracious she was. How kind. She literally had this demon, angry, crazed look etched
[21:01.960 --> 21:08.680]  into her face. Sick Bill Clinton was stood behind her chewing on his tongue again. And she's, you
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.120]  know, praised Donald Trump at the start, said, yes, you've won. Well done. That was it. And as she
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.920]  did her criminal tell, she said, we need to have peaceful transfer of power and not have any violence.
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.800]  That means they're activating it all right now. Oh, yeah, that shows that she's aware of the
[21:21.800 --> 21:25.720]  fact that these riots are already happening within hours. They didn't even get time to
[21:25.720 --> 21:30.440]  properly organize them. They were burning American flags. There were certain dumpsters on fire.
[21:30.440 --> 21:35.560]  People were injured just a few hours after the vote closed before we knew the results. So
[21:36.200 --> 21:41.080]  people are all over Twitter. You can go on search Trump riot all over Twitter right now,
[21:41.080 --> 21:47.640]  organizing these riots. And again, the media will blame Donald Trump for these riots by Hillary
[21:47.640 --> 21:53.720]  Clinton to bedwetting, whining toys out of the pram throwing Hillary Clinton supporters who are
[21:53.720 --> 22:00.360]  planning this civil unrest right now. And again, all over Twitter today. Oh, this is a win for
[22:00.360 --> 22:06.920]  bigotry. This is a win for hatred. The hashtag is trending not my president. When these are the
[22:06.920 --> 22:13.240]  most hateful, intolerant, bigoted people imaginable, they're throwing out death threats, not just
[22:13.240 --> 22:18.760]  against Trump, but against Trump supporters. They've been to his rallies to cause this violence.
[22:18.760 --> 22:24.840]  They're causing it once again. These are the intolerant, regressive bigots. And we're trying
[22:24.840 --> 22:32.040]  to give signs of history. Absolutely. We go out in Austin. And they'll have people run over and
[22:32.040 --> 22:40.120]  scream. Trump hates LGBT. He wants to send blocks back to Africa. And it's mainly white women.
[22:40.120 --> 22:46.920]  And they begin shrieking and crying and freaking out. And they're literally like in this big pity
[22:46.920 --> 22:53.480]  party mental illness that isn't even real. All Donald Trump wants is to secure the borders and
[22:53.480 --> 22:58.680]  get rid of taxes for people that make $40,000 a year or less and turbo charge the economy and
[22:58.680 --> 23:02.600]  just bring back Americana. Instead, we have all these globalist criminals that have hijacked the
[23:02.600 --> 23:07.480]  nation. They control the economy. They've got all these dumbass minions who have no idea that
[23:07.480 --> 23:11.800]  they're basically plantation slaves. I don't care what color they are. It is really something to
[23:11.800 --> 23:18.760]  behold, Paul. And then you've got their mouthpieces in the media like Van Jones. And I played the
[23:18.760 --> 23:23.640]  clip earlier. He got up, he got up on CNN. He said Donald Trump won because there are a lot of
[23:23.640 --> 23:28.600]  racist and bigots who voted for him. He called it a white lash as in a racist backlash. Which
[23:28.600 --> 23:33.560]  again says you can't have guns. You can't have no taxes if you have brown skin. It's literally
[23:33.560 --> 23:37.560]  telling all these people you can't have the American dream. It's a thousand times better
[23:37.560 --> 23:42.680]  than North Korea or Venezuela. And it's so condescending when we know record numbers of blacks
[23:42.680 --> 23:47.640]  voted for Trump, record numbers of Hispanics, record numbers of the Republican primaries as well.
[23:47.640 --> 23:52.280]  And but again, he makes it racial. And here's the good news. People are seeing through it. And
[23:52.280 --> 23:57.720]  that's the number one thing I want to say. I don't care if you're a wealthy black family that owns
[23:57.720 --> 24:01.560]  a business and you end up seeing usually they hire mainly black folks. Okay, I get it. They need jobs.
[24:01.560 --> 24:06.520]  But you need to hire some white folks, especially with all this stuff going on in the world. There's
[24:06.520 --> 24:10.440]  a lot of poor white people, despite what Bernie Sanders says, white people don't know what it's
[24:10.440 --> 24:16.920]  like to be poor, literal quote. But if you are a business person, they've created political
[24:16.920 --> 24:21.400]  correctness to make us all feel uncomfortable around each other. We have to not do the fake PR,
[24:22.120 --> 24:27.880]  PC garbage. We have to really go out and find everybody and be inclusive because there's great
[24:27.880 --> 24:33.320]  folks of every, you know, color, bring them in. And actually, everybody have a real culture
[24:33.320 --> 24:38.600]  and a real society. You go into leftist compounds. It's almost all white people. They're very racist.
[24:38.600 --> 24:44.920]  They're very paranoid. They're scared of everything. They're basically OCD, Latke kids,
[24:44.920 --> 24:49.480]  okay, that are in their own delusional world. And then we have liberal media come here and they go,
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.080]  my God, it's like half the folks here aren't white. It's like, yeah, that's that's that's
[24:53.080 --> 24:58.600]  because we just hire folks that do a good job. And so again, they are everything they say we are.
[24:58.600 --> 25:04.440]  But now, as Trump has said, we have to double down. We have to support not fake affirmative
[25:04.440 --> 25:12.280]  action that's race based. But we have to support Trump and his ideas for tax incentives for
[25:12.280 --> 25:18.280]  inner cities and tax cuts specifically, because that's people's own money. It's not taking somebody
[25:18.280 --> 25:22.920]  else's money and giving it to them. It's letting folks that have been put at a disadvantage
[25:22.920 --> 25:27.480]  have an advantage of keeping more of their own money. We have to be the real liberals.
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.880]  I think Paul Scott cut out. I wanted him to have a final comment to maybe reconnect with him. But
[25:32.680 --> 25:37.240]  there's so many points to go over so many angles. I want to thank the audience though,
[25:37.240 --> 25:41.640]  and we should have some celebration. Just my head spinning was there's so many angles to this. And
[25:41.640 --> 25:48.200]  obviously, I'm exhausted about three hours sleep last night. We are on the cusp of history. We're
[25:48.200 --> 25:52.280]  at the crossroads. We have begun to go down the right road. The enemy is going to try to pull
[25:52.280 --> 25:59.560]  us back with everything they've got. And that's why I'm focused now on the next level of the war
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.360]  completely because right now we've got the giant audience. Right now we've got five times what
[26:04.360 --> 26:12.120]  regularly tune in, okay? Obama now comes out and says we're now all rooting for Trump's success.
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.440]  This is going to be the good cop, bad cop deal. Start the riots, turn up all the race betting,
[26:16.440 --> 26:25.000]  you know, times a thousand, but then have the conciliatory. Trump olive branched that if you
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.240]  do what we say now, Trump, you put a bunch of globalists in your cabinet and you submit to the
[26:29.240 --> 26:34.440]  New World Order and you let the Rhino Republicans, you know, run things, then we might leave you
[26:34.440 --> 26:40.360]  alone. So sell out. And so they're offering that knowing he won't take it. But to look like
[26:40.360 --> 26:48.120]  they tried to give him a chance from one perspective. So Obama's now speaking, good cop, bad cop,
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.520]  saying we should all root for Trump's success, which means they're definitely going to activate
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.600]  black lives mattering groups to kill cops and burn stuff down. So I'm telling you,
[26:56.600 --> 27:00.600]  they have to look like they push for freedom. They're the folks that want everybody to come
[27:00.600 --> 27:03.480]  together. Meanwhile, they're activating their operations right now, Paul.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.200]  No, I mean, that's the point. And going back to the Van Jones thing, he got up and said that
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.840]  basically it was a white lash. It was a racist backlash against Obama because they hate Obama
[27:14.840 --> 27:20.200]  because he's black. These people in Ohio, in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania,
[27:20.200 --> 27:29.240]  they voted for Obama in 2008 and in 2012. How can you claim that Trump support is all racist people
[27:29.240 --> 27:36.120]  who hate Obama because he's black when those very same people in those states voted for Obama?
[27:36.120 --> 27:40.920]  I mean, it's just a completely debunked argument at this point. Then you've got the other angle,
[27:40.920 --> 27:46.520]  which is, of course, Michael Moore. He was the only leftist who had the smarts for a second to
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.960]  look in the mirror and realize that these people in Michigan and Wisconsin were voting on the fact
[27:51.960 --> 27:57.720]  that globalism has destroyed their livelihoods completely. Nothing whatsoever to do with race.
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.560]  It's to do with NAFTA. It's to do with the factories shutting down. It's to do with their
[28:01.560 --> 28:07.720]  jobs being shipped abroad. That's why Donald Trump won those states. It has nothing whatsoever
[28:07.720 --> 28:17.000]  to do with racism. Paul, predictions. Predictions going forward. They're already organizing riots
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.520]  tonight. It's going to be a very unstable time. Again, as I said, right after Brexit, and this
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.200]  still holds, I'm going to have to get back on the Brexit argument next week because they're
[28:26.200 --> 28:32.600]  trying to derail and dilute that. You have to push this forward. Paul Ryan's got no place
[28:32.600 --> 28:37.160]  in the future Trump administration. Again, you have to prevent him from stuffing his cabinet
[28:37.160 --> 28:44.120]  with neocons. Basically, Trump is not a demagogue. He's about a movement. He's a symbol of a movement.
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.680]  We're not investing everything into Trump, but we're going to hold his feet to the fire.
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.160]  Notice the reaction of Trump supporters compared to Obama supporters in 2008.
[28:53.160 --> 28:59.240]  They were all glazed-eyed, cult-like, adoring their new deal leader. Trump supporters are excited.
[28:59.240 --> 29:04.360]  They're happy they're partying, but they know that this is just the beginning of the mission
[29:04.360 --> 29:08.600]  to save America, to save Western civilization. I totally agree. Let me just say this, Paul.
[29:08.600 --> 29:13.160]  You've been working with me for 15-plus years. I guess you were about 18 when you came to
[29:13.160 --> 29:19.960]  InfoWars, and I salute your work, your tireless dedication, and it is a true honor to be associated
[29:19.960 --> 29:25.880]  with you and in this one life we have. And you're a real friend and a brother, and I love you, Paul.
[29:27.240 --> 29:30.680]  I love you too, Alex. And it's been an absolutely crazy journey,
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.760]  and the madman has done it. But again, it's only the beginning. And who knew that the horribly
[29:36.760 --> 29:42.200]  discredited InfoWars as association with Trump, oh, the media CNN said that's inevitably going
[29:42.200 --> 29:45.480]  to drag him down, right? He's going to lose. Well, look what happened.
[29:45.480 --> 29:53.160]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.160 --> 30:02.920]  Well, the dawn has broken through the dark night, and Donald J. Trump is the 45th president-elect of
[30:02.920 --> 30:07.480]  the United States. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that they were at the Hilton last
[30:07.480 --> 30:12.040]  night. She looked down at her phone and the caller ID said, Huma Abedin. Of course, she was calling
[30:12.040 --> 30:16.760]  for Trump. Clinton had conceded the election, refusing to give a concession speech last night,
[30:16.760 --> 30:21.560]  in fact, sending her and world campaign manager, John Podesta, to break the news to supporters of
[30:21.560 --> 30:26.040]  hers as they broke out in tears and sobbed. Now, Trump winning against unbeatable odds,
[30:26.040 --> 30:30.200]  of course, is a true victory for the American people. The New York Times says that Trump's
[30:30.200 --> 30:35.480]  victory is, quote, a stunning repudiation of the establishment. Yeah, no kidding. Nigel Farage
[30:35.480 --> 30:40.040]  congratulated Donald Trump and said he's making his way to the U.S. He also said that he wants to
[30:40.040 --> 30:44.920]  be, quote, the ambassador to Brussels. Farage said that he'd like to work with the president-elect
[30:44.920 --> 30:49.880]  in Brussels to, quote, bring down the EU. It looks like a global referendum is going on
[30:49.880 --> 31:19.800]  around the world. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.
[31:20.200 --> 31:25.320]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[31:56.720 --> 31:58.440]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[31:58.440 --> 32:01.040]  Will you and your family be financially protected
[32:01.040 --> 32:02.720]  if there's another economic meltdown?
[32:02.720 --> 32:03.840]  Like many experts,
[32:03.840 --> 32:06.280]  I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[32:06.280 --> 32:08.360]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[32:08.360 --> 32:09.800]  Don't wait for another crisis
[32:09.800 --> 32:11.240]  that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[32:11.240 --> 32:13.800]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault
[32:13.800 --> 32:16.760]  at 844-541-ALEX.
[32:16.760 --> 32:18.160]  It's a company I trust.
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.760]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs
[32:20.760 --> 32:22.920]  that could help safeguard your money
[32:22.920 --> 32:24.160]  in an economic meltdown.
[32:24.160 --> 32:27.440]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[32:27.440 --> 32:29.480]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth
[32:29.480 --> 32:31.840]  of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[32:31.840 --> 32:34.680]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[32:34.680 --> 32:37.720]  as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[32:37.720 --> 32:40.840]  Don't delay, call 844-541-ALEX now
[32:40.840 --> 32:42.920]  and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag
[32:42.920 --> 32:45.440]  to securely store your coins, absolutely free.
[32:45.440 --> 32:46.960]  These are dangerous times,
[32:46.960 --> 32:50.200]  and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[32:50.200 --> 32:52.920]  I personally own these survival packs, and you should too.
[32:52.920 --> 32:56.400]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX now.
[32:58.680 --> 33:01.280]  Like the ones you work for,
[33:01.280 --> 33:05.600]  get these cheap polls that they can just keep making news on.
[33:05.600 --> 33:08.880]  Donald Trump will never be elected president of the United States.
[33:08.880 --> 33:17.520]  MUSIC
[33:17.520 --> 33:20.960]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[33:20.960 --> 33:24.200]  Sorry to keep you waiting.
[33:24.200 --> 33:26.880]  Complicated business. Complicated.
[33:26.880 --> 33:39.520]  Thank you very much.
[33:39.520 --> 33:44.120]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[33:44.120 --> 33:49.600]  CHEERING
[33:49.600 --> 33:53.600]  He congratulated us. It's about us.
[33:53.600 --> 33:55.840]  On our victory.
[33:55.840 --> 33:59.000]  And I congratulated her and her family
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.200]  on a very, very hard-fought campaign.
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.280]  I mean, she fought very hard.
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.920]  CHEERING
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.360]  Hillary has worked very long and very hard
[34:14.360 --> 34:16.680]  over a long period of time,
[34:16.680 --> 34:20.080]  and we owe her a major debt of gratitude
[34:20.080 --> 34:23.320]  for her service to our country.
[34:23.320 --> 34:23.920]  I mean that.
[34:23.920 --> 34:26.720]  Lay too gracious, so to be honest with you.
[34:26.720 --> 34:31.760]  Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division
[34:31.760 --> 34:32.960]  and have to get together.
[34:32.960 --> 34:33.720]  Go ahead and fade it down.
[34:33.720 --> 34:35.480]  We're going to play more of this come up in a moment.
[34:35.480 --> 34:41.440]  But I wanted to come in with this because right here is key.
[34:41.440 --> 34:43.840]  Trump is so straightforward.
[34:43.840 --> 34:45.880]  That's his secret.
[34:45.880 --> 34:53.800]  That this is him being conciliatory and offering an olive branch.
[34:53.800 --> 34:55.080]  They're not going to back down.
[34:55.080 --> 34:56.360]  They hate you.
[34:56.360 --> 34:58.080]  They've committed crimes.
[34:58.080 --> 35:00.640]  I understand that they're threatening all sorts of stuff
[35:00.640 --> 35:01.360]  behind the scenes.
[35:01.360 --> 35:03.320]  They will wreck the economy even further.
[35:03.320 --> 35:04.280]  They're going to do it anyways.
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.440]  And they're going to kill you, Trump.
[35:07.440 --> 35:09.520]  You must press.
[35:09.520 --> 35:12.320]  You must have them indicted.
[35:12.320 --> 35:13.760]  They must be put in prison.
[35:13.760 --> 35:15.960]  This is not going to hurt the confidence of the country.
[35:15.960 --> 35:17.960]  What's going to hurt the confidence of the country
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.680]  is if they're not prosecuted.
[35:21.680 --> 35:25.480]  And Paul Ryan needs to be investigated.
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.280]  I'm not here risking my life to lose this.
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.280]  And so everybody is in euphoria right now.
[35:33.280 --> 35:34.440]  Paul brought up M4 Wars.
[35:34.440 --> 35:36.600]  I'm not going to sit here and give us credit.
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.560]  Everybody knows that we're at the heart of the resistance.
[35:40.560 --> 35:42.600]  You are the heart of the resistance.
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.480]  My perspective on the world and how it works
[35:45.480 --> 35:48.240]  is as close as you're going to get to reality.
[35:48.240 --> 35:51.320]  We all see through rose-colored dark leaks, as the Bible says.
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.080]  But I can see for miles and miles.
[35:56.080 --> 35:57.760]  And I'm going to just stop right there,
[35:57.760 --> 35:59.320]  because it's not about bragging.
[35:59.320 --> 36:01.120]  People need to know.
[36:01.120 --> 36:02.840]  They need to understand that.
[36:02.840 --> 36:04.480]  The enemy knows.
[36:04.480 --> 36:06.640]  Make no mistake.
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.920]  And Trump is a very smart man, probably smarter than I am.
[36:11.920 --> 36:14.040]  He has great instincts at many levels.
[36:14.040 --> 36:18.840]  But he, the same thing that makes him great,
[36:18.840 --> 36:21.120]  wanting prosperity and wanting people to get ahead
[36:21.120 --> 36:30.480]  and wanting to have a strong nation,
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.040]  the basic hospitality of Trump can be used against him.
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.640]  If his advisors play the same politics that have gotten
[36:39.640 --> 36:42.160]  our country to this point, Trump is where he is,
[36:42.160 --> 36:44.440]  because he broke with the orthodoxy
[36:44.440 --> 36:47.040]  and did the honorable thing and faced the globalists
[36:47.040 --> 36:48.320]  down at High Noon.
[36:48.320 --> 36:50.200]  And we stood with him.
[36:50.200 --> 36:53.480]  There is no choice about this.
[36:53.480 --> 36:56.520]  There's no arguing about this.
[36:56.520 --> 37:07.880]  Trump must begin pushing for the prosecution of Hillary
[37:07.880 --> 37:09.200]  and all the rest of them.
[37:09.200 --> 37:11.880]  He said he would do it.
[37:11.880 --> 37:13.320]  They're never going to forgive him.
[37:13.320 --> 37:15.640]  I understand like sending Napoleon away
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.880]  to the island of Alba or whatever, so he'd stop fighting.
[37:19.880 --> 37:22.880]  But Napoleon Bonaparte was a million times more honorable
[37:22.880 --> 37:24.280]  than Hillary Clinton.
[37:24.280 --> 37:27.080]  And by the way, you notice he came back and broke his pledge.
[37:30.080 --> 37:33.120]  And he had a whole nother giant war and millions of dead.
[37:33.120 --> 37:35.160]  And finally, he was defeated at Waterloo.
[37:40.560 --> 37:49.120]  Lord Nelson had to die in the war,
[37:49.120 --> 37:53.760]  all because they let him out of the cage again.
[37:57.640 --> 38:00.520]  Folks, we can't really put these people in cages.
[38:00.520 --> 38:03.400]  Everybody knows that.
[38:03.400 --> 38:04.120]  It's like cancer.
[38:04.120 --> 38:05.160]  You can't leave it there.
[38:05.160 --> 38:06.160]  It's got to be removed.
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.080]  And I'm saying things here on air
[38:08.080 --> 38:10.600]  that obviously put me in a whole other level of danger.
[38:10.600 --> 38:11.480]  That's fine.
[38:11.480 --> 38:14.120]  It's the Republic that matters, because it's
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.760]  the launch pad for the entire future of the species,
[38:17.760 --> 38:24.120]  as envisioned by our founders, who are so tied into God,
[38:24.120 --> 38:26.440]  it's staggering.
[38:26.440 --> 38:30.480]  Their vision is what's important.
[38:30.480 --> 38:34.520]  If we choose to take that inheritance,
[38:34.520 --> 38:37.960]  Hillary and the people that control her,
[38:37.960 --> 38:41.280]  the truly wicked forces, are not going
[38:41.280 --> 38:44.880]  to let us restore the Republic, create prosperity,
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.960]  heal the racial and religious wounds,
[38:48.960 --> 38:50.680]  and move the Renaissance forward,
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.720]  because it is the Renaissance itself and the Enlightenment
[38:54.720 --> 38:57.720]  that is being targeted by the false teachers that
[38:57.720 --> 38:59.800]  claim they are Enlightenment.
[39:03.360 --> 39:04.840]  It's all inverse.
[39:04.840 --> 39:06.240]  They say they're the Illuminati.
[39:06.240 --> 39:08.800]  They do not bring light.
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.840]  They bring darkness.
[39:10.840 --> 39:12.560]  They bring poverty.
[39:12.560 --> 39:14.440]  They bring pain.
[39:14.440 --> 39:16.400]  They bring betrayal.
[39:22.280 --> 39:28.600]  They come to kill, to steal, and to destroy.
[39:28.600 --> 39:37.360]  They go about like a lion, roaring, seeing who they may
[39:37.360 --> 39:37.960]  devour.
[39:41.080 --> 39:44.160]  You roll over.
[39:44.160 --> 39:47.840]  I'm about as a kid, and all I have is my instincts.
[39:47.840 --> 39:49.400]  I'd be over at some neighbor kid's house.
[39:49.400 --> 39:51.360]  They'd be watching Friday the 13th or something.
[39:51.360 --> 39:53.200]  And I'd see a woman runs through the woods,
[39:53.200 --> 39:55.680]  and they'd fall down and scoot on their button.
[39:55.680 --> 39:56.360]  Or a guy would.
[39:56.360 --> 39:58.760]  I think people don't do that.
[39:58.760 --> 39:59.560]  People fight back.
[39:59.560 --> 40:01.080]  Or they run even faster.
[40:01.080 --> 40:03.720]  When you're in trouble, you can have a lot better balance.
[40:03.720 --> 40:05.640]  They're going to fall over, and then back through the woods
[40:05.640 --> 40:06.280]  all scared.
[40:06.280 --> 40:07.760]  You're going to get away.
[40:07.760 --> 40:09.160]  But then I grew up and actually saw
[40:09.160 --> 40:09.800]  real things in the world.
[40:09.800 --> 40:12.000]  That's what people have actually been trained to do.
[40:12.000 --> 40:12.960]  I know it's the chicken or the egg,
[40:12.960 --> 40:14.000]  but they actually do fall down.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.880]  They just go, ooh, there's a third piss on themselves.
[40:17.880 --> 40:20.160]  Somebody comes with a big knife, and they don't go fight them.
[40:20.160 --> 40:21.800]  They just roll over and start pissing themselves.
[40:21.800 --> 40:24.600]  Men, women, you name it.
[40:24.600 --> 40:27.240]  We can't roll over and show our belly to Hillary
[40:27.240 --> 40:27.880]  now.
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.200]  That little rat and sorrows are coming at us now.
[40:32.200 --> 40:33.800]  People are all celebrating.
[40:33.800 --> 40:38.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the war just begun.
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.040]  Make no mistake.
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.240]  We have the sword of destiny, truth.
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.280]  We have the birthright.
[40:48.280 --> 40:50.640]  Because our ancestors really wanted
[40:50.640 --> 40:53.400]  to create freedom worldwide and really wanted to end slavery
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.480]  and really wanted to empower women.
[40:56.480 --> 40:58.760]  They never attained much of it, but they opened up
[40:58.760 --> 41:00.840]  the whole world to it, and it's now been hijacked
[41:00.840 --> 41:02.440]  by people turning us against each other.
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.680]  They must fail.
[41:03.680 --> 41:04.800]  They must fall.
[41:04.800 --> 41:07.680]  Everyone must recognize that these are inherently
[41:07.680 --> 41:14.560]  conscious evil people that want to hurt you and your family.
[41:14.560 --> 41:16.840]  And they creep around constantly trying
[41:16.840 --> 41:19.240]  to get you into guilt and get you into their paradigm
[41:19.240 --> 41:20.640]  and get you under their control.
[41:20.640 --> 41:24.360]  But if you really saw them spiritually,
[41:24.360 --> 41:28.320]  if you saw them, they are hunchback demons.
[41:28.320 --> 41:31.920]  They basically look like skexies.
[41:31.920 --> 41:35.840]  And we need to understand they're not ever
[41:35.840 --> 41:37.680]  going to stop trying to rip our throats out.
[41:41.200 --> 41:44.000]  Be sober and vigilant because your adversary, the devil,
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.080]  is a roaring lion walking about seeking whom
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.480]  he made of our tier 5A.
[41:50.480 --> 41:51.360]  That's right.
[41:51.360 --> 41:59.360]  Ever vigilant, ever vigilant, devastating victory, huge success.
[41:59.360 --> 42:00.560]  I want to salute the entire crew.
[42:00.560 --> 42:03.160]  I want to salute John Harmon up at GCN
[42:03.160 --> 42:06.160]  and the rest of his folks, Teddy Anderson,
[42:06.160 --> 42:08.680]  for his long work supporting the free speech on this network.
[42:08.680 --> 42:14.040]  I want to thank the patriots in this nation
[42:14.040 --> 42:15.440]  and around the world.
[42:15.440 --> 42:17.920]  We got a lot of support from patriots all over the world
[42:17.920 --> 42:21.080]  from continent of Africa and nations like the UK.
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.040]  You name it, it's just solidarity in the Info War,
[42:24.040 --> 42:25.840]  people spreading links, people battling.
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.040]  Recognizing this election affects the whole world
[42:29.040 --> 42:32.560]  because if the new Atlantis of this republic that
[42:32.560 --> 42:36.760]  had such great opportunities and so many great successes
[42:36.760 --> 42:40.120]  and clearly had God's hand at the helm
[42:40.120 --> 42:43.760]  could be fully captured, the whole world
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.000]  will fall to evil that will make the Soviet scourge look
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.880]  like a joke.
[42:56.520 --> 42:58.080]  It's a big world.
[42:58.080 --> 42:59.960]  It's a big system.
[42:59.960 --> 43:02.120]  There's a lot of people and a lot of hopes and dreams.
[43:02.120 --> 43:06.160]  At least people want to steal your hopes and dreams.
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.360]  They want to be your God and they're every color,
[43:12.360 --> 43:14.280]  they're every race, they're from every region.
[43:14.280 --> 43:16.920]  They're evil people that resonate
[43:16.920 --> 43:19.760]  to this parasitic system of suppressing
[43:19.760 --> 43:23.920]  and they just creep around and slime around with their scams
[43:23.920 --> 43:26.840]  and their crap and their evil inventions
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.400]  as they run to and fro seeing what evil they can
[43:31.400 --> 43:35.000]  fester and invent.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.120]  There's another Bible verse.
[43:37.120 --> 43:45.400]  They run to and fro incessantly, I'm paraphrasing it,
[43:45.400 --> 43:48.880]  seeing what new evils they can invent.
[43:48.880 --> 43:51.000]  I'm butchering the quote, but it's true.
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.560]  They're always inventing new little horrible things
[43:53.560 --> 43:55.520]  and little scams and hurtful things
[43:55.520 --> 43:58.840]  and making good people feel like they've done bad things
[43:58.840 --> 44:01.720]  and just hopping around like little devils on our shelters
[44:01.720 --> 44:03.520]  and trying to get us under their little spell.
[44:03.520 --> 44:06.320]  These people, I mean, look at Cain.
[44:06.320 --> 44:08.080]  His whole life is evil.
[44:08.080 --> 44:09.680]  But then you look at him, he just
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.760]  looks like a scumbag and an evil, little, demented,
[44:14.760 --> 44:17.400]  power-tripping scumbag who can't even
[44:17.400 --> 44:19.160]  hide his demonic energy.
[44:21.920 --> 44:22.920]  I almost don't.
[44:22.920 --> 44:24.640]  I don't want to think about him.
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.200]  I don't want to look at Hillary anymore.
[44:29.200 --> 44:30.880]  So frickin' evil.
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.040]  God, she's the most evil-looking person I've ever seen.
[44:36.040 --> 44:37.800]  My soul.
[44:37.800 --> 44:41.160]  When I look at Hillary on a stage, a little kid,
[44:41.160 --> 44:43.680]  it's like watching a video like an African kid walking
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.800]  by a pond and a frickin' 20-foot crocodile grabs him.
[44:47.800 --> 44:49.480]  And you watch it and you see the little kid.
[44:49.480 --> 44:50.360]  There's footage of that.
[44:50.360 --> 44:53.920]  And it's just, oh my god, it makes your heart go out.
[44:53.920 --> 44:56.360]  And I see her, and I feel worse when I see her by kid.
[44:56.360 --> 45:02.120]  Because spiritually, man, that is a frickin' wrecking machine
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.160]  of evil that wants to suck that innocence out of that kid
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.200]  and wants to use that innocence on stage with her
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.960]  to fell you on believing she's innocent.
[45:11.960 --> 45:15.120]  Because she's this horrible, lonesome, rubber-headed, just
[45:15.120 --> 45:16.640]  pig demon.
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.080]  I mean, she's just an open war machine against life.
[45:20.080 --> 45:22.080]  And she's just dripping over the child.
[45:22.080 --> 45:24.720]  She's just, eh, juxtaposing.
[45:24.720 --> 45:27.520]  You just look at their followers.
[45:27.520 --> 45:29.080]  I mean, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[45:29.080 --> 45:31.440]  They're just such zombies.
[45:31.440 --> 45:33.760]  Her servants are just, they all have the same pose.
[45:33.760 --> 45:35.560]  They're like arms just kind of hanging on.
[45:35.560 --> 45:41.720]  They're just like, eh, like gollums, eh, they're gone, man.
[45:41.720 --> 45:44.360]  They want to suck the spirit out of you.
[45:44.360 --> 45:46.200]  They want to kill this country.
[45:46.200 --> 45:48.840]  They want to mount Thomas Jefferson and George
[45:48.840 --> 45:56.560]  Washington's grand heads in their hall.
[45:56.560 --> 45:58.200]  We don't want to mount your head on the wall.
[45:58.200 --> 46:00.760]  We don't want to look at you.
[46:00.760 --> 46:09.080]  We want to have you out of our plane on your plane.
[46:09.080 --> 46:10.840]  We want you away from us.
[46:10.840 --> 46:13.720]  And that's the greatest punishment for a vampire,
[46:13.720 --> 46:21.680]  isn't it, to be locked in a cold crypt in eternal damnation
[46:21.680 --> 46:29.080]  with your kind, burning with the hate that they can't pull
[46:29.080 --> 46:31.560]  down any more children.
[46:31.560 --> 46:34.280]  They shall run to and fro in the city.
[46:34.280 --> 46:35.800]  They shall run upon the wall.
[46:35.800 --> 46:37.520]  They shall climb upon the houses.
[46:37.520 --> 46:40.720]  They shall enter at the windows like a thief.
[46:40.720 --> 46:41.760]  That's not the quote.
[46:41.760 --> 46:44.360]  It's like they run to and fro inventing new wickedness.
[46:44.360 --> 46:45.040]  I think it's the quote.
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.000]  Inventing new wickedness, I think, is the accurate part.
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.440]  We can find it that way.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.040]  But good job, crew.
[46:52.040 --> 46:52.560]  All right.
[46:52.560 --> 46:53.920]  I'm going to just stop right there.
[46:53.920 --> 46:55.080]  There's so many epic angles.
[46:55.080 --> 46:56.480]  I don't want to just sit around and talk
[46:56.480 --> 47:00.240]  about what happened and play clips and all the rest of this.
[47:00.240 --> 47:03.960]  They're not going to give us quarter.
[47:03.960 --> 47:05.880]  They're not going to back down.
[47:05.880 --> 47:07.240]  They're not going to stop.
[47:07.240 --> 47:09.840]  But you see how weak they are.
[47:09.840 --> 47:12.440]  They want you to stand down.
[47:15.320 --> 47:17.040]  The war has just begun.
[47:17.040 --> 47:20.440]  The dirty tricks are going to go into high gear.
[47:20.440 --> 47:28.280]  But inexorably, if we stay the course,
[47:28.280 --> 47:36.600]  we could enter an entire new era of strength and humanity
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.440]  getting to stop and get a few breaths before we face
[47:40.440 --> 47:44.520]  the ultimate challenge of the globalist and the AI
[47:44.520 --> 47:50.440]  and the positronic systems and the trance that so much
[47:50.440 --> 47:53.800]  the public's going under, this big victory
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.320]  is only a respite to try to bind our wounds
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.680]  so that spiritually in the next few decades,
[48:01.680 --> 48:03.960]  we make the right choices and have
[48:03.960 --> 48:08.480]  enough of a defense force so that even though this phase
[48:08.480 --> 48:11.440]  of humanity will probably fall for a time to AI,
[48:11.440 --> 48:12.520]  billions will probably die.
[48:12.520 --> 48:14.480]  The Bible is going to be made true.
[48:14.480 --> 48:17.920]  But not in the season the enemy tells you.
[48:17.920 --> 48:20.040]  They want you to be weakened and not prepare
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.080]  because in this great singularity that's coming,
[48:24.080 --> 48:26.320]  it will not be their empowerment but our empowerment.
[48:26.320 --> 48:29.920]  But we're going to first have to go through the fire.
[48:29.920 --> 48:31.560]  History repeats.
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.440]  And so we have to bring the spirit of love,
[48:34.440 --> 48:37.040]  the spirit of Christ, the spirit of strength,
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.200]  the spirit of fatherhood back into the world
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.120]  and prepare for the big battle that
[48:46.120 --> 48:52.280]  will be hundreds of times more dangerous and vicious
[48:52.280 --> 48:53.520]  than you're even now seeing.
[48:53.520 --> 48:55.960]  But we'll know the enemy better.
[48:55.960 --> 48:57.680]  We'll have greater understanding.
[48:57.680 --> 49:00.400]  We will be given discernment as the enemy
[49:00.400 --> 49:01.920]  is given great power.
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.360]  You are going to be given great power.
[49:04.360 --> 49:09.600]  But only to those that are doing it for good who love Christ.
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.560]  And I know why so many good men and women don't fight evil
[49:13.560 --> 49:19.280]  because to come into the spirit of God is very humbling.
[49:19.280 --> 49:25.720]  To be in proximity to the spirit that is all creation,
[49:25.720 --> 49:36.720]  that is unfathomably amazing, is transcendent.
[49:36.720 --> 49:39.520]  But to the enemy, that is like nails on a chalkboard.
[49:39.520 --> 49:41.960]  These are people that want to grab kids out of your backyard.
[49:41.960 --> 49:43.280]  I'm going to skip this break.
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.480]  These are people that are totally turned over
[49:47.480 --> 49:53.400]  to the lowest forms of trash you could ever even try to imagine.
[49:53.400 --> 49:56.760]  As God is beautiful and endless and merciful
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.120]  and just beauty heaped upon blessing, heaped upon honor,
[50:01.120 --> 50:03.160]  they are all of those things with the opposite.
[50:06.480 --> 50:10.040]  So when you realize, of course, they put fluoride in the water
[50:10.040 --> 50:13.320]  to brain damage you and dumb you down, that's what they do.
[50:13.320 --> 50:19.120]  That's what occultists always do is poison the people slowly
[50:19.120 --> 50:21.680]  and then offer them remedies.
[50:21.680 --> 50:24.000]  Of course, they're poisoning the food and water.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.360]  Of course, they're putting on GMO,
[50:25.360 --> 50:27.120]  they know that sterilizing us.
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.840]  By the time people finally wake up to how far we've fallen,
[50:32.840 --> 50:34.400]  this will go to a break.
[50:34.400 --> 50:36.440]  It's all right, let's go to a break.
[50:36.440 --> 50:38.120]  I want to come back and reset my mind
[50:38.120 --> 50:40.480]  and really just talk about where we're at right now.
[50:40.480 --> 50:44.320]  But if we want to win, we have to understand,
[50:44.320 --> 50:46.760]  they've given us no quarter.
[50:46.760 --> 50:49.040]  They're never going to stop.
[50:49.040 --> 50:52.280]  And if Donald Trump and people of this nation
[50:52.280 --> 50:54.200]  really want to try to turn this around,
[50:54.200 --> 50:57.280]  they must be brought to justice.
[50:57.280 --> 50:59.560]  Will the government protect your family from Iran
[50:59.560 --> 51:02.120]  and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.600]  We buy guns to protect ourselves, home, health,
[51:04.600 --> 51:06.280]  and car insurance for accidents.
[51:06.280 --> 51:07.960]  Maybe you also have food storage.
[51:07.960 --> 51:09.880]  But how would you keep your refrigerator running
[51:09.880 --> 51:11.920]  in a long-term EMP blackout?
[51:11.920 --> 51:16.040]  Using tested military designs, the Solark EMP-hardened
[51:16.040 --> 51:18.320]  solar generator protects and powers
[51:18.320 --> 51:20.480]  your critical appliances for years
[51:20.480 --> 51:22.240]  without burying items underground
[51:22.240 --> 51:23.960]  or wrapping them in aluminum foil.
[51:23.960 --> 51:26.880]  Unlike other preps, Solark is used every day
[51:26.880 --> 51:29.400]  to help offset your electric bill automatically.

[51:32.160 --> 51:34.320]  how easily expandable the system is.

[51:37.040 --> 51:37.800]  on the market.

[51:40.840 --> 51:42.640]  and can install in less than an hour.

[51:52.560 --> 51:57.600]  why Solark is energy insurance for your family.
[51:57.600 --> 51:59.080]  My name is Lee, and I'm 41.
[51:59.080 --> 52:01.920]  I've been using One World Wave for two and a half years now.
[52:01.920 --> 52:04.120]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc
[52:04.120 --> 52:06.160]  from a car accident three years ago.
[52:06.160 --> 52:09.120]  And since that time, I've been unable to walk long distances,
[52:09.120 --> 52:11.280]  do any minor lifting, or just normal activities
[52:11.280 --> 52:14.080]  with my children without having severe back pain.
[52:14.080 --> 52:15.920]  Since I've started using One World Wave,
[52:15.920 --> 52:18.240]  I've been able to walk more, engage in activities
[52:18.240 --> 52:20.640]  with my children, and have less lower back pain.
[52:20.640 --> 52:23.720]  One World Wave has helped me regain back my strength, confidence,
[52:23.720 --> 52:25.160]  and have a healthier life.
[52:25.160 --> 52:27.400]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds.
[52:27.400 --> 52:30.920]  My A1C dropped two points, and I have more energy now.
[52:30.920 --> 52:33.600]  One World Wave has helped me regain back my life.
[52:33.600 --> 52:35.600]  The results for clients on One World Wave
[52:35.600 --> 52:38.040]  have surpassed the results for most any other supplements,
[52:38.040 --> 52:40.320]  as well as all other weight protein powders.
[52:40.320 --> 52:43.200]  One World Wave is non-denatured and frequency encoded.
[52:43.200 --> 52:45.480]  We believe the frequency encoding increases your body's
[52:45.480 --> 52:47.960]  production of glutathione and energy production.

[53:57.600 --> 54:02.280]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad guy.
[54:02.280 --> 54:04.360]  Barry Diller is going to leave the United States.
[54:04.360 --> 54:05.480]  He's so angry about Trump.
[54:05.480 --> 54:07.720]  He doesn't even live here most of the time anyways.
[54:07.720 --> 54:11.640]  Here's George Soros and that little turd Stephanophilus.
[54:11.640 --> 54:16.640]  You know, we do deserve a celebration.
[54:16.640 --> 54:18.720]  And again, amazing things are happening.
[54:18.720 --> 54:20.400]  And I'm not trying to get negative here,
[54:20.400 --> 54:22.640]  but Trump's a man.
[54:22.640 --> 54:23.680]  Men come, men go.
[54:23.680 --> 54:25.200]  I believe he's a good man.
[54:25.200 --> 54:26.400]  I knew victory was coming.
[54:26.400 --> 54:27.840]  I told my family of thanksgiving last year.
[54:27.840 --> 54:30.720]  I said, I know Trump's going to be elected president.
[54:30.720 --> 54:33.160]  I said he's being divinely protected.
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.680]  Because when I think about Trump and I go with my gut,
[54:37.680 --> 54:39.120]  it's just, I know he's good.
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.320]  And I've seen that born out.
[54:40.320 --> 54:42.080]  Problem is he's not perfect.
[54:42.080 --> 54:44.480]  Now, the enemy was stealing the election yesterday.
[54:44.480 --> 54:45.960]  A bunch of states that went for her
[54:45.960 --> 54:46.800]  was actually a landslide.
[54:46.800 --> 54:49.920]  Trump should have won California, should have won New York.
[54:49.920 --> 54:51.080]  The pollsters have all been proving
[54:51.080 --> 54:53.240]  completely out of their minds, total fraudsters.
[54:53.240 --> 54:54.800]  It's total discrediting for them.
[54:54.800 --> 54:56.760]  The mainstream media's been discredited.
[54:56.760 --> 54:58.960]  This is a tombstone in the system.
[54:58.960 --> 55:01.280]  The problem is they want to take us down with them.
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.280]  They are madder than a fire ant bed you've stirred up
[55:06.280 --> 55:07.240]  and they're not going away.
[55:07.240 --> 55:08.720]  I just keep on announcing that.
[55:08.720 --> 55:09.560]  The war's not over.
[55:09.560 --> 55:10.560]  The war has just begun.
[55:10.560 --> 55:11.600]  Yes, we're winning.
[55:11.600 --> 55:12.800]  But think how bad it's going to be
[55:12.800 --> 55:13.960]  if we have these victories
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.640]  and then it gets taken away from us.
[55:16.640 --> 55:19.920]  We have to win all the way to the end.
[55:19.920 --> 55:21.200]  You understand that?
[55:21.200 --> 55:24.040]  This isn't just about us and today and lower taxes
[55:24.040 --> 55:25.160]  so we have more money.
[55:25.160 --> 55:27.280]  This is about promoting freedom.
[55:28.440 --> 55:30.760]  Because if we don't promote freedom,
[55:30.760 --> 55:33.480]  we're going to be run by a bunch of people that crave power
[55:33.480 --> 55:36.560]  and who fricking grab kids out of backyards, man.
[55:36.560 --> 55:38.680]  I keep telling you, these people literally
[55:38.680 --> 55:39.680]  kill little kids.
[55:39.680 --> 55:41.400]  They've been caught all over the world.
[55:41.400 --> 55:42.720]  They fricking torture them to death.
[55:42.720 --> 55:43.560]  You got that?
[55:44.520 --> 55:45.880]  They launch major wars.
[55:45.880 --> 55:46.920]  They drink blood.
[55:48.000 --> 55:48.920]  Just look at them.
[55:51.560 --> 55:53.000]  We're going to kick their ass.
[55:54.040 --> 55:56.200]  Time to stand up to these people.
[55:56.200 --> 55:59.400]  Take the gloves off and tell them I see you, demon.
[55:59.400 --> 56:00.240]  I see you.
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.040]  They cannot stand when people don't have fear of them.
[56:07.640 --> 56:10.920]  They can feel God's righteous anger rising
[56:10.920 --> 56:12.400]  and flowing through us.
[56:12.400 --> 56:15.240]  Now that said, Trump movements,
[56:15.240 --> 56:17.080]  you've got to get together at your Trump events.
[56:17.080 --> 56:18.880]  You've got to keep taking over the Republican Party
[56:18.880 --> 56:19.960]  and the Democratic Party.
[56:19.960 --> 56:21.840]  I would start saying, liberals for Trump,
[56:21.840 --> 56:23.000]  true liberals for Trump.
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.240]  We should launch t-shirts like that,
[56:24.240 --> 56:27.000]  conservatives for Trump, libertarians for Trump,
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.400]  libertarians for Americanism.
[56:28.400 --> 56:30.400]  In fact, I want to put some shirts out.
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.720]  Info wars, 110% Americanism.
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.440]  The spirit of liberty, the ideas that made us so great,
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.560]  broadcast worldwide, not forced,
[56:43.560 --> 56:46.200]  but a system so good, everyone adopts it.
[56:47.280 --> 56:48.360]  That's the American system.
[56:48.360 --> 56:50.800]  That's what the whole system was so scared of.
[56:50.800 --> 56:52.080]  They said in the British papers,
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.320]  and we can't let the American system take hold.
[56:54.320 --> 56:55.680]  Nothing can compete with it.
[56:55.680 --> 56:57.040]  Germany began to adopt it.
[56:57.040 --> 56:58.400]  It was even doing better than we were
[56:58.400 --> 56:59.640]  by the turn of the last century.
[56:59.640 --> 57:01.000]  They had thousands of news articles
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.840]  saying we've got to stop Germany.
[57:02.840 --> 57:05.440]  They're taking over via free market and innovation.
[57:05.440 --> 57:06.640]  And they did.
[57:06.640 --> 57:08.080]  They started World War I with them.
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.440]  They killed the crown prince of the Austrian and European
[57:11.440 --> 57:12.280]  Empire.
[57:13.920 --> 57:15.240]  They will do a lot of things.
[57:15.240 --> 57:16.080]  Here's the deal.
[57:16.080 --> 57:17.080]  We've identified the global system.
[57:17.080 --> 57:19.960]  I got to say this because I want to thank everybody
[57:19.960 --> 57:22.440]  for their financial support, obviously.
[57:22.440 --> 57:24.880]  We've got specials running with free shipping right now
[57:24.880 --> 57:28.840]  at infowarstore.com, and we have 30% to 40% off
[57:28.840 --> 57:31.160]  across the store on the nutraceuticals,
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.680]  water filtration systems.
[57:32.680 --> 57:33.720]  We've extended the storeable food,
[57:33.720 --> 57:35.960]  and a lot of folks are taking advantage of this.
[57:35.960 --> 57:37.600]  That's great because we need money
[57:37.600 --> 57:39.800]  to hopefully expand, not just stay the same.
[57:39.800 --> 57:41.720]  I mean, I want to go 110%.
[57:41.720 --> 57:43.440]  And if we could hire four or five more reporters
[57:43.440 --> 57:46.360]  and more writers and some more camera people and stuff,
[57:46.360 --> 57:49.080]  we could really not work 18 hours a day
[57:49.080 --> 57:50.280]  and be cross-eyed half the time,
[57:50.280 --> 57:51.680]  which we do some of our best work.
[57:51.680 --> 57:52.920]  We're totally exhausted, let's be honest,
[57:52.920 --> 57:56.080]  but I don't need to kill myself doing this.
[57:56.080 --> 57:57.840]  I neither do the rest of my crew.
[57:57.840 --> 58:00.360]  I've got people sleeping on the floor here last night.
[58:00.360 --> 58:02.960]  So the fight's on, we know it.
[58:02.960 --> 58:04.400]  We're committed to this freedom,
[58:04.400 --> 58:07.800]  and notice, liberty pays off.
[58:07.800 --> 58:12.080]  You support info wars, you notice you get results.
[58:14.080 --> 58:15.800]  And everybody loves a winner,
[58:15.800 --> 58:18.160]  and info wars is the personification of that,
[58:18.160 --> 58:20.200]  and you are the info war, we love you.
[58:20.200 --> 58:23.120]  Infowarsstore.com, thank you all for your support.
[58:23.120 --> 58:25.640]  Got a lot of great items there that everybody needs.
[58:25.640 --> 58:26.840]  Take advantage of free shipping
[58:26.840 --> 58:28.880]  and the biggest specials ever.
[58:28.880 --> 58:32.400]  In celebration of this major victory in the war
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.240]  against the forces of satanic planetary vampirism.
[58:36.240 --> 58:37.640]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[58:38.640 --> 58:39.480]  Thank you for listening.
[58:39.480 --> 58:42.040]  Bunch of big guests coming up.
[58:42.040 --> 58:44.480]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:47.040 --> 58:49.520]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion
[58:49.520 --> 58:51.240]  from infowarslife.com.
[58:51.240 --> 58:53.880]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists
[58:53.880 --> 58:56.160]  to create the most powerful and affordable,
[58:56.160 --> 58:58.680]  great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[58:58.680 --> 59:01.360]  The all new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.320]  at infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month supply
[59:05.320 --> 59:08.080]  of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids
[59:08.080 --> 59:10.080]  that your body absolutely needs.
[59:10.080 --> 59:11.840]  In the history of info wars life,
[59:11.840 --> 59:14.120]  we brought out a lot of amazing products
[59:14.120 --> 59:16.920]  like survival shield X2, super male vitality,
[59:16.920 --> 59:18.000]  and so many others.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.880]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[59:21.880 --> 59:23.520]  with its unique delivery system
[59:23.520 --> 59:25.640]  and proprietary manufacturing process
[59:25.640 --> 59:27.600]  designed for maximize effects.
[59:27.600 --> 59:30.040]  This formula is the platinum standard
[59:30.040 --> 59:32.040]  of multivitamin mineral products.
[59:32.040 --> 59:34.560]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.480]  are either plant derived
[59:36.480 --> 59:39.120]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:39.120 --> 59:41.800]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[59:41.800 --> 59:44.640]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[59:44.640 --> 59:49.080]  Take action now before we sell out.
[59:49.080 --> 59:51.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:05.960]  It's a long way to the top if you want to keep the parasites
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:08.640]  from not conflating you and your family.
[1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:14.880]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:17.240]  They beat our spirit down.
[1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:19.080]  They want us to think we failed one week,
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:20.840]  it's their week.
[1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:27.400]  And now, just like in the epic ode of the Norse,
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:32.320]  Beowulf, Grendel came for dinner.
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:36.040]  But then Grendel finally ran into the champions
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:39.960]  and Grendel tried to get out the door.
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:43.840]  But Beowulf didn't turn Lucifer's arm.
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:46.800]  And then he took the door and started slamming it
[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:49.120]  into his shoulder until he ripped the arm right out
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.440]  of the socket.
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:55.800]  And Grendel crawled home to mama.
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:58.000]  And we've killed Grendel.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.240]  Make no mistake, that's what King kept saying.
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:06.280]  He kept saying, dick killed us, but we're still in the fight.
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.360]  He said, we're dead, but we don't care.
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:09.480]  We are dead.
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:11.160]  Very cryptic what King said.
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:12.560]  We ought to try to find out.
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:15.160]  Everything they say is double meaning.
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:16.600]  He slipped up to it and they said,
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:20.160]  we're going to give you all disabilities.
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.320]  Oh, I tell you, I could see you little beady-eyed rat.
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:31.000]  Now, their little demonic goddess has fallen,
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.320]  but she will strike back.
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:33.320]  Make no mistake.
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:35.320]  They killed us, but they ain't whooped us yet.
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:38.320]  That's right, they killed us.
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:41.320]  You know what?
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:43.320]  You poisoned our culture and sowed your racism
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:44.320]  on all your trash.
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:45.320]  And you know what?
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:46.320]  You're a failure, you little piece of crap.
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:49.320]  You are a dishonorable maggot.
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:53.320]  That's why you hate those of us that aren't vampires.
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.320]  Like you, you little rat.
[1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:57.320]  Matt wanted to pop in.
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:01:58.320]  Anytime the crew wants to pop in,
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:01:59.320]  they're welcome.
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.320]  We've got a bunch of big guests.
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:01.320]  I haven't told you who's coming up yet.
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:03.320]  It's loaded with key folks.
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:04.320]  Obviously, Steve Bacchini's going to pop in.
[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:06.320]  We're going to have Roger Stone back in the studio.
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:07.320]  He just got up.
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:10.320]  We're going to have much other big guests here.
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.320]  It's a 52-hour broadcast.
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:13.320]  I haven't checked since last night.
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:15.320]  We had 20-something million people that had tuned in
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:19.320]  via the streams in the last 30-something hours then.
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:20.320]  So it's huge.
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:21.320]  I said, hey, let's get 100 million,
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.320]  but I'm very happy with it.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:24.320]  It's probably 30-something million now.
[1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:26.320]  It was 26, 27 million last night.
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:29.320]  Just on streams and videos and things we've done the last,
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:31.320]  you know, 36 hours or so then.
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:34.320]  Now it's 40-something, almost 50 hours.
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:38.320]  But Matt, to win this, we've got to, like you said,
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:41.320]  organize the Trump people into just nonpartisan defenders
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:44.320]  of a rediscovery of the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:47.320]  and then run for public office in case the global
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:49.320]  is ever get back in control of the federal government.
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:52.320]  We're going to have to really build the political defenses
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:54.320]  to resist.
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:55.320]  Yeah.
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:57.320]  So this is some advice that, you know,
[1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:01.320]  I spitballed with Richard Reeves when we spent some time
[1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:05.320]  together on the campaign trail early this year for the primaries.
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:07.320]  And, you know, I've got to thank you for that,
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:10.320]  you know, for the ability to work here and the ability
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:14.320]  to go learn firsthand, you know, real politics.
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:16.320]  And this kind of comes on the heels of that.
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  So, you know, right now, we're talking about starting this.
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:23.320]  The war has just begun.
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:26.320]  It's actually, I feel like the war's been going on
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:27.320]  for a little while now.
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:29.320]  There's been, like, this perception war.
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:32.320]  I agree, but it's gone from a cold war to a hot war now.
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:35.320]  We just actually won the battle of the bulge.
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:38.320]  We need to corner Hitler now, you know what I mean?
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:40.320]  If you think about this as a metaphor.
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:43.320]  And the way you do that is you find the people
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.320]  who are wearing Trump gear.
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.320]  They're easier to find now than ever, right?
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:48.320]  The people who are wearing Trump is my present.
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:50.320]  The people who are wearing Hillary's present.
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:51.320]  And you shake them.
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:52.320]  You find people wearing...
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:54.320]  You shake their hands because they're trying to bully us
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:57.320]  and make everybody be scared and say it's racist and all this crap,
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.320]  especially white Trump supporters and others
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.320]  and Hispanic black supporters, you name it.
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:02.320]  We have to all come together.
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:03.320]  We have to start having parties.
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:04.320]  We've got to start having meetup groups.
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:06.320]  We've got to have softball teams.
[1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:08.320]  We've got to, like, go on vacation together and just say,
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:09.320]  hey, yeah, we're racist.
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:11.320]  This is what real love's all about.
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:13.320]  We're all coming together, you little bastards.
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:16.320]  You can't expect to make America great again just by voting.
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:17.320]  You've got to go out.
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:19.320]  You've got to make relationships with the people out there
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:21.320]  who are like-minded individuals.
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:22.320]  And you've got to go out.
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:25.320]  You've got to get in groups and you can become a delegate.
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:26.320]  That's right.
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:28.320]  They're trying to create division and make everybody uncomfortable
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:31.320]  to be with each other because it's classic divide and conquer.
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:35.320]  We have to come together and show them the real thing.
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:36.320]  Of course.
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:38.320]  Yeah, it's time for the people to rule.
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:42.320]  We've seen it with the turnout and the polls for this election.
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:45.320]  Yeah, where your Trump gear, loud and proud.
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:46.320]  Absolutely.
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:48.320]  And hold Trump's feet to the fire.
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:49.320]  He needs our support.
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:52.320]  That means defending from the media when he's right, not when he's wrong.
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:56.320]  And use this movement to expand the defense.
[1:04:56.320 --> 1:04:58.320]  During CNN's election night coverage,
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:02.320]  former Obama adviser Van Jones argued that the 2016 election
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:05.320]  was a white lash against a changing country.
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.320]  It's a white lash against a black president, in part.
[1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:11.320]  He said not shocking CNN is still race-baiting,
[1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:13.320]  even though it's clearly over for them.
[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.320]  The uphill battle Trump will face, however, is just beginning.
[1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:18.320]  Clinton supporters are staging civil unrest.
[1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:21.320]  We've seen this in parts of the country, like Oregon and California.
[1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:24.320]  And more than 100 protesters gathered in Oakland, California this morning,
[1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:26.320]  attempting to block freeways.
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:28.320]  And at least one was hit by a car.
[1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:32.320]  Protesters were also seen in masks outside of Trump's supporters party in San Francisco.
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:35.320]  And Clinton supporters were filmed marching through Portland, Oregon,
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:39.320]  shouting expletive Donald Trump and setting fire to the U.S. flag.
[1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:43.320]  This news comes as death threats against Donald Trump flood social media.
[1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:47.320]  Well, can we count on the liberal media in this country to whine,
[1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:50.320]  refusing to accept Trump's victory as a hashtag?
[1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:51.320]  I'm still with her.
[1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:52.320]  Hey, accept it.

[1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:33.320]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks that tip to deceive you.
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:37.320]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:42.320]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:47.320]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[1:07:52.320 --> 1:08:18.320]  with the mainstream media.
[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:24.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:55.320]  Two different philosophies.
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:03.320]  The parasites don't want you free and empowered because they're scum and don't want to compete.
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:07.320]  But then there's those that want renaissance and want to see everybody flourish
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:10.320]  and who get off on prosperity and success.
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:13.320]  Hey, your wife's super beautiful. Wow, you can play great music.
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:16.320]  Wow, you're amazing. You're a great writer. I don't hate you because of that. I admire you.
[1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.320]  You add to the richness of our humanity.
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:20.320]  That's why they hate Trump.
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.320]  Trump, he's not out to get you.
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:25.320]  Is he going to be perfect? No.
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:28.320]  Will he have to make some deals with Congress to get stuff through?
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:33.320]  Yes, but if he uses his bully pulpit and isn't cowered and isn't put into a corner and moves forward
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:38.320]  and prosecutes, prosecutes these people.
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.320]  I get, normally, you beat a political group, you want to just go away for the betterment of the country.
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:46.320]  Their people are still in place. They're organizing riots nationwide.
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:49.320]  You're not going to stop. So I will tell Trump.
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:54.320]  You're amazing. You'll be George Washington reincarnated here if you can now deliver.
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:57.320]  But they're not going to leave you alone. They're coming after you.
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:00.320]  And I understand it. And I know Trump's smart.
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.320]  Trump's being nice on the surface.
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:09.320]  But now the Clintons must be indicted.
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:12.320]  And the other Republicans don't want that because they're involved too.
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:17.320]  Well, Paul Ryan and others, who we now know as a Democratic Party operative, it all came out,
[1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:22.320]  works with the Clintons, works with Hillary, trying to get deals for his family, jobs and stuff.
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.320]  Supreme Court jobs, Supreme Court justice.
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:29.320]  He needs to be arrested as well.
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:32.320]  Because they want to arrest us. They want to take our free speech.
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:35.320]  They say they want to take over the Internet. They say all this stuff.
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:39.320]  We're going to Gavin McInnes here at the bottom of the hour and we're going to get Beth Harrison to see what happened with election fraud.
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:42.320]  Looks like Hillary stole some major states, but they couldn't stop a landslide.
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.320]  But here's just a compilation a minute and a half of Trump in his victory speech.
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:47.320]  It was all wonderful.
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:49.320]  And I get he was supposed to be in Consulatory.
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:55.320]  Notice Hillary, though, stirred up her race garbage in her speech.
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:11:01.320]  And all her surrogates who get direct orders from them are in hyperdrive right now saying,
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:04.320]  this is a white lash and white people are bad.
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:10.320]  They don't want minorities, though the majority now, to have the birthright of guns and private property.
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:13.320]  And everything that comes with the West.
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:16.320]  I could listen, white people aborted all their kids.
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:18.320]  We don't deserve to have the future.
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:20.320]  I'm just a person. I don't care what color you are.
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:24.320]  Just, just don't be brainwashed and on some frickin' plantation.
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:28.320]  Gavin McInnes is a movie star, founder of Vice.
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.320]  And of course, big TV host, radio host, great guy.
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:36.320]  Everybody from, you know, 60-year-old women to my 14-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter loving.
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.320]  When we talk to him, he'll be popping in a moment from their headquarters in New York.
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:43.320]  But first, here is what I mentioned from the compilation.
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:48.320]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:58.320]  She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory.
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:11:59.320]  That's right.
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:06.320]  And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:09.320]  I mean, she fought very hard.
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:14.320]  Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:21.320]  I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:25.320]  And this is so important to me.
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:33.320]  For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people,
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:39.320]  I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:44.320]  and unify our great country.
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:51.320]  Now Obama says, working together, we will begin the urgent base of rebuilding our nation
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:54.320]  and renewing the American dream.
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:58.320]  It's been what they call a historic event.
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.320]  But to be really historic, we have to do a great job.
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:03.320]  That's right.
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:07.320]  And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job.
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:10.320]  Well, you kept your promises to me, both public and private.
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:18.320]  And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:33.320]  That's right. We've won a major battle, but now they're going to strike back.
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:36.320]  Gavin, so much happening. What's your first approximation of this?
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:40.320]  My gut tells me, you know, stabilize your rear deflectors, watch for enemy fighters.
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:43.320]  This war just started.
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:46.320]  Alex, you've got to learn to indulge yourself.
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:50.320]  This is party mode, at least for 24 hours.
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:55.320]  Right now, we here at Compound Media are focused on the first two Motley Crue albums,
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:59.320]  Too Fast for Love, Shout at the Devil, We've Been Drinking All Night.
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:02.320]  I feel like I just won the NBA.
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:05.320]  I mean, I got in the NBA and all my friends are going,
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:07.320]  Hey man, can you help me with this car wash idea?
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:10.320]  And I'm going, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get to that. We'll get to that.
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:14.320]  Right now, we just won the lottery.
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:18.320]  We just stole America back from the established.
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:22.320]  This is a devastating repudiation of the mainstream media of all the fake polls,
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:26.320]  and they tried to hang info wars around Trump's neck, which he was smart
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:30.320]  and actually, you know, took our whole operation and made his blueprint.
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:34.320]  I mean, quite frankly, he's told me that personally and it blew up in their face
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:37.320]  and it shows how synthetic it is. Suddenly, they're all just silent.
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:39.320]  They don't know what to do. They're crapping themselves.
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:45.320]  I agree. Celebration for everybody. You in New York wearing Trump gear. Them, you know, absolutely groveling in fear.
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:49.320]  It's now time for the return of men. Go ahead.
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:53.320]  You know, my favorite word I'm hearing from the media today is inexplicable.
[1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:56.320]  Trump's inexplicable victory.
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:01.320]  And to me, that says so much that one word because one, your job as a journalist is to explain things.
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:06.320]  You can't. So you're admitting in that one word that you don't know how to do your job.
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:11.320]  They're running other speech polls,
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:15.320]  racism, dads, well, the polls, they keep on with the polls.
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:18.320]  What happened with the polls? Yeah, mom's picked up the phone.
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:24.320]  Dad's went and voted. And the other great thing about it, and explicable is it shows what we all have known,
[1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:27.320]  and you and I have been streaming this for decades.
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:30.320]  The media is totally separating themselves from America.
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:34.720]  America they have no idea they've never met a plumber. They've never met a flyover
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:41.560]  Blue-collar dude, and so when these guys admit that hey, I'm actually America when you think of America
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:46.360]  It's not New York, and it's not LA. It's everywhere else and journalists are going. What do you mean?
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:52.660]  It's not New York in LA I googled it and you go. Yeah, dude. You never left your desk. You don't know your own country
[1:15:52.660 --> 1:16:01.620]  Oh, wow, I'm sure we should be celebrating but I do I mean I want to be ready when they you know try the next assault
[1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:08.940]  They're going they're doubling down all the race garbage the riot garbage. I mean, this is just crazy. What are you expecting next? I
[1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:15.260]  Feel like we're in the driver's seat though. Don't you I mean I haven't even you know what's funny about this whole thing
[1:16:15.260 --> 1:16:20.380]  I feel like a knight and I've been handed my sword back as a patriarch as a father and
[1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:26.300]  My first instinct with this sword is not to go the way Hillary would and start getting revenge
[1:16:26.300 --> 1:16:33.580]  Like I haven't even looked up all these videos of Democrats crying because we are good at power
[1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:36.260]  And now that we have it back. We're not vindict. No, no
[1:16:36.260 --> 1:16:40.380]  I agree. I agree that that if it was a normal enemy that that you know
[1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:42.740]  We can just kind of let them like a fart in the wind you know blow out of the car
[1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:47.780]  The problem is they will come back and justice has to be served, but but I'm open to your idea
[1:16:47.780 --> 1:16:49.540]  I
[1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:54.640]  Mean take the high road and just kind of forget them and move forward and and just hope they just blow away
[1:16:55.860 --> 1:16:59.460]  Well, that's the ultimate question, but at least we're in the driver's seat
[1:16:59.460 --> 1:17:03.620]  So the question I think is you're in the plane as a gremlin on the wing
[1:17:03.620 --> 1:17:08.620]  And he's attacking the plane as he always has been before we didn't know the pilot
[1:17:08.620 --> 1:17:13.420]  We didn't have a pilot that we could trust now. We have a pilot we can trust. There's still gremlins on the wing
[1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:15.300]  We still have to fight at all
[1:17:15.300 --> 1:17:18.060]  That's the best analogy from the twilight zone. We got William shatter on the plane
[1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:24.700]  He keeps saying it. No one's listening to us. Finally. Everybody on the plane sees the gremlin. So now we can deal with a little sucker
[1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:30.980]  Yes, if we have to do a dry landing, we can do that the pilots on board everyone believes us about the gremlin
[1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:33.260]  This election said I know you're right
[1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:36.460]  There is a gremlin on the wing and now we're wondering where we're gonna land
[1:17:36.460 --> 1:17:42.820]  We're gonna bring this country back America was really reborn today because if Hillary won I'll tell you what I was
[1:17:42.820 --> 1:17:46.740]  Going to give up and just it's sort of I went to Paris after the battle clan attacks
[1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:50.740]  And I talked to Parisians there about their Muslim problem and they were in total denial
[1:17:50.740 --> 1:17:54.260]  And I just sort of after five days there. I just sort of went or of war
[1:17:54.740 --> 1:18:02.020]  France you're done. You are a rock of the irrevocably lost and I was gonna feel that way if Hillary won and now the Trump is back
[1:18:02.020 --> 1:18:06.020]  Of course, we got tons of work to do. Of course, we got to keep sticking it to the social justice warriors
[1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:09.540]  But we're doing it from the driver's seat. Finally, I
[1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:15.380]  I totally agree with you and once you finally see the gremlin you can't ever put or the goblin
[1:18:16.020 --> 1:18:21.700]  Once you've been in a goblin's nest. I mean, there's no putting that gene back in the bottle people now understand what's going on
[1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:28.860]  Yes, doesn't it feel good? I mean, I've got all these texts on my phone. Just congratulations. We got it back
[1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:33.500]  I mean hundreds of texts of people going we did it. I can't believe it. Someone got you see now
[1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:40.940]  We know friend Wisconsin to exclamation point question mark. Yes, the whole country said, you know what?
[1:18:41.100 --> 1:18:46.540]  We tried it your way. We gave you the steering wheel and you crashed. So give me the steering wheel back
[1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:53.100]  I'm driving from now on. I'm going to do what America was built on which is I'm going to be an entrepreneur
[1:18:53.100 --> 1:18:58.220]  I'm going to take risks and I'm going to leave people alone. That really is what America is all about
[1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:03.580]  Is it so show it's not about who are winners or losers. We don't want just the dopamine to say we're winners
[1:19:03.900 --> 1:19:07.420]  That's why I'm not even a big sports thing is I don't want to go watch somebody else have a victory
[1:19:07.420 --> 1:19:11.820]  And I somehow live through it, but I get sports. I played sports with this. This is real blood sport
[1:19:11.820 --> 1:19:17.020]  This is for the whole world for all the marbles with a bunch of really creepy weird people when you read their emails
[1:19:17.020 --> 1:19:24.300]  We want to make people poor and dumb. We want to control them. These are really nasty uncool people that no one would want to associate with
[1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:29.180]  In the real world all of Hillary's people really hate her. They've all been bullied
[1:19:29.340 --> 1:19:32.300]  They've all been paid by the big multinationals to say this
[1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:39.260]  I think a lot of the people in the media and the system now are kind of glad this happened because they were closet Trump supporters
[1:19:39.260 --> 1:19:43.260]  So we can't forget about that that this is about coming up for air
[1:19:44.300 --> 1:19:49.660]  Not being bullied anymore. And that's why it's so important for everybody to wear their Trump gear everywhere and then to organize
[1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:55.900]  Again, it's just like I said have fun people should of all race colors creeds come together and say you're full of it
[1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:57.580]  We're not racist. We want freedom
[1:19:57.580 --> 1:20:03.660]  We're gonna go out and watch a ball game a bunch of people of different colors and be together and be real not sit there and watch
[1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:09.260]  Fake simulated liberal shows where there's these made-up neighborhoods where everybody's just living together in happiness
[1:20:09.260 --> 1:20:15.020]  We should actually go out and do it to repudiate them because they are obsessed with dividing and conquering us
[1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:17.020]  It's their only hope Gavin McKinnon
[1:20:17.020 --> 1:20:22.540]  This is vindication. I mean, this is what America is all about and Alexis de Tocqueville talked about this in
[1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:29.820]  Democracy in America where he came here a camera when it was 1800s and he was just blown away by the way America works
[1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:34.220]  He said that democracy is slow and sluggish and inefficient
[1:20:34.380 --> 1:20:39.100]  But once the people set their mind to something nothing can stand in its way
[1:20:39.420 --> 1:20:42.540]  And I was getting scared like when Assange said that
[1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:49.340]  Uh, Trump can't win because the big powers the big banks pharma, uh, the middle military industrial complex
[1:20:49.980 --> 1:20:52.620]  Everyone he's not in any of their pockets
[1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:56.140]  So they won't let him win the powers that be won't let him win and I gotta admit
[1:20:56.140 --> 1:20:59.020]  I was talking to Ezra Levante about this. We were both petrified by that
[1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:04.300]  No, I was too but but but notice clearly there were some states where the the polls in line up
[1:21:04.300 --> 1:21:09.740]  He should have won they tried they did steal but all the experts say Bev Harris and others agree
[1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:13.420]  You cannot block a landslide with a decentralized election
[1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:19.580]  Yeah, you can bust in all the illegals you want you can mess with the polls and what we just learned last night was
[1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:25.420]  With all its flaws with all its its saboteurs with all the gremlins on the wing
[1:21:26.140 --> 1:21:31.900]  America can still win the founding fathers are watching us right now and going. I knew you had it in you
[1:21:32.060 --> 1:21:36.860]  I knew you could win the people just beat the establishment. That's huge
[1:21:36.860 --> 1:21:40.780]  I went to two polling places yesterday and a lot of it was on a live feed and
[1:21:41.820 --> 1:21:44.940]  It was Hispanic males with their sons and daughters
[1:21:45.260 --> 1:21:50.620]  Mainly good-looking strong hard-working guys pulling up in nice trucks. They want America. They are America
[1:21:50.940 --> 1:21:56.460]  They were the folks actually coming over. I mean like 15 people and I was like they're like 20 minutes because they the poll
[1:21:56.460 --> 1:22:00.380]  They ran me off and you know, I wasn't breaking the laws at 100 feet back
[1:22:00.780 --> 1:22:04.860]  And she was nice me whatever other point is is that uh, this is a joke after out
[1:22:04.860 --> 1:22:09.660]  She said yes, but you know, we didn't anyways the point is is that all this is going on and
[1:22:10.140 --> 1:22:13.740]  And it was just so good that I guarantee you it was a bigger landslide people even know
[1:22:14.060 --> 1:22:17.420]  But I did see white women who look totally upset alone
[1:22:17.980 --> 1:22:22.860]  They don't know why life's not happy. They don't know the the government and the media is their husband
[1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:28.380]  And they were looking at me and just totally freaked out and just like they thought the end of the world was happening
[1:22:28.940 --> 1:22:34.220]  Well, that's the problem with their narratives is it's not a good America to live in is based on fear
[1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:38.220]  It says that America is a racist hellhole where no one has a chance
[1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:45.340]  And you need welfare and you need social security. You need all these government programs to help you thrive because you live in hell
[1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:50.220]  And it's bad for them. That's the irony of all this our version of events
[1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:53.820]  Which is based on reality is best not just for the white male patriarchs
[1:22:54.060 --> 1:22:59.740]  It's best for every they're like, oh no, Donald Trump's gonna get rid of taxes for people making 40 000 less. Oh
[1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:02.380]  It's horrible
[1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:04.380]  You know, what really happened also is
[1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:09.900]  The word bigot has been such a successful way to permanently
[1:23:10.380 --> 1:23:15.580]  Brand someone as a witch in Salem and now you have to be burned at the stake once you get that marker on you
[1:23:15.820 --> 1:23:17.820]  you're doomed for life and
[1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:22.380]  What trump did is he's went? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not interested in that word. You can call me that all you want and you know
[1:23:22.380 --> 1:23:28.620]  What else america's sick of the stigma. We're sick of the shame. We want to make well gavin. Let's do this. I mean
[1:23:29.980 --> 1:23:31.980]  We played the club we should play it again
[1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:37.260]  Van Jones goes on tv and says this is a white lash. This is the white people. There's a bad white people
[1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:43.500]  It's so kkk grand dragon and it wasn't record numbers of blacks fighting for Trump hispanics all of it
[1:23:44.060 --> 1:23:48.220]  Despite all their lies and it's just the savage injection of race
[1:23:48.620 --> 1:23:53.820]  To control people and to make sure this plantation owner keeps you on the little reservation
[1:23:54.620 --> 1:24:00.780]  It's so boring too. I mean ultimately people are too lazy to be racist. We're too
[1:24:00.780 --> 1:24:05.180]  Self-indulgent if I meet a black guy who likes the same sports teams
[1:24:05.260 --> 1:24:08.620]  I like and he's sitting next to me tomorrow. What am I gonna do say? No?
[1:24:08.620 --> 1:24:11.980]  I'm not gonna enjoy your company because it's something made up bias. I have
[1:24:12.780 --> 1:24:16.300]  I mean, I mean if I like some black artists like jimmy hindricks
[1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:21.100]  I'm not even thinking he's a black guy. It's if I think a black woman looks good. I don't think she's even black
[1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:23.260]  That's a woman. I think looks good. Yeah, exactly
[1:24:24.380 --> 1:24:28.380]  Remember when the black lady was driving around and saw the checkpoint got scared and ran from the cops and they killed her
[1:24:28.380 --> 1:24:32.700]  Uh, uh, you know indecisive land. Yeah, it was terrible
[1:24:33.020 --> 1:24:36.300]  But I was on there saying it's horrible that they killed this woman in the black lives matter
[1:24:37.020 --> 1:24:40.940]  Uh type where it was like, I don't know. You only hit her. She's white. So when it came out, she was black
[1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:45.820]  People going oh, Alex. Thank you for caring about a black lady. I'm just sad an unarmed woman got killed
[1:24:45.820 --> 1:24:49.980]  I don't I'm not the one thinking what color somebody's skin is it really gets to me
[1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:57.820]  Well, that's the irony of their narrative in this fear-based culture blacks end up getting so scared becoming so scared of cops
[1:24:57.820 --> 1:25:02.220]  That they go, oh, I saw on msnbc that you guys just shoot me for sport
[1:25:02.380 --> 1:25:05.020]  I mean when there was a black woman during the Dallas riots who said
[1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:09.100]  I have to worry when I go to the grocery store that it could be shot by a cop and you go
[1:25:09.660 --> 1:25:15.500]  So in this world that they've created for you cops sit in grocery stores and peg you off
[1:25:15.820 --> 1:25:20.460]  Like they're deer hunting or something. That's insane and that's a horrible place to live
[1:25:20.620 --> 1:25:24.700]  So not only do they make up a mythical universe, but they made a horrible
[1:25:24.700 --> 1:25:29.580]  mythical universe if you're going to make up a lie put unicorns in it or something make it nice
[1:25:29.740 --> 1:25:33.740]  Why did you make such a terrible horrible scary fake place?
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:36.300]  and again you talk to folks
[1:25:36.300 --> 1:25:37.740]  because
[1:25:37.740 --> 1:25:41.500]  We shot to the female age freelicks a video the other day out live in austin
[1:25:41.740 --> 1:25:46.540]  Oh, it's where his latest video you got to see this and again. I'm not singling out white women
[1:25:46.620 --> 1:25:51.580]  It's just that tends to be the group that's the most insane and they're just they're going he's a homophobe
[1:25:51.580 --> 1:25:57.580]  Oh, they're just freaking out. I mean 10 times what I'm doing right now in here. I don't even want to expend the energy just
[1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:06.780]  And it's just like what the hell these people are in a freaking cult man
[1:26:07.260 --> 1:26:12.140]  Uh, just totally made up and then you tell people the police only shoot
[1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:17.420]  A couple hundred people that are questionable year. Yes, there's some bad cops, but that's a very rare form of death
[1:26:17.420 --> 1:26:23.900]  There's 340 million of us being struck by lightning kills like 50 times with the cops and they just go shut up you racist white pig
[1:26:24.460 --> 1:26:30.060]  You have no right. You're white and you're going you are a white guy telling me this right now with zits all over your face
[1:26:30.060 --> 1:26:34.060]  You look like you know, I'm not trying to be mean. It's just like you're like some dumbass that lives in their mother's basement
[1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:39.580]  And you're screaming at me that I'm an effing white male. So I have no right to exist when you're an effing white male
[1:26:40.700 --> 1:26:43.660]  You know, it's really sad what we've done to women. I'm looking at these women right now
[1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:49.260]  We reached into their bodies. We grabbed their ovaries. We ripped them out and we threw them in the garbage
[1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:53.660]  Now they've evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to basically be busy bodies
[1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:59.980]  I mean, they're good at dealing with hunting and gathering in the local cave and dealing with four kids five kids six kids
[1:27:00.140 --> 1:27:07.100]  We ripped that away from them and now they have all this extra energy and they expend it on the mythical universe and telling you
[1:27:07.100 --> 1:27:11.420]  You're racist and screaming about the patriarchy and all this dumb crap where you just go
[1:27:11.420 --> 1:27:17.820]  What are you doing? What are you talking about? Your life is miserable. By the way, if they just come back to the patriarchy
[1:27:17.820 --> 1:27:19.100]  they'd be
[1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:23.980]  Happier than a pig and you know what and the statistics show that it's not like I want to run some patriarchy
[1:27:24.140 --> 1:27:27.340]  It's not that men kill themselves in wars. They explore
[1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:32.940]  We are the slaves of the women. We are the worker bees dumbasses. You're sitting back at the palace
[1:27:33.180 --> 1:27:36.140]  You are the queen if you only take the throne
[1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:42.700]  Exactly. Yeah, that's the funny thing is they want to be part of our world our world. Do you take the coolest job?
[1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:45.580]  I mean, we both have pretty cool jobs. You take the coolest job in the world
[1:27:45.740 --> 1:27:53.260]  Oh, 90% of it is an excel spreadsheet going over costs and dealing with the minutiae of these cables aren't working
[1:27:53.260 --> 1:27:56.860]  And we need to try to get an adapter and these women bust out of the kitchen and they go
[1:27:56.940 --> 1:28:00.460]  I want to be part of your world and you go. Okay. It's mostly number crunching
[1:28:00.460 --> 1:28:06.460]  But lord or it's pouring concrete all day in 110 degree heat and having some god-bitch at you. That's
[1:28:06.940 --> 1:28:12.540]  That's our world. We built you a palace as you say we set you up with a pretty good deal because
[1:28:13.020 --> 1:28:19.580]  We are in awe of the miracle of birth that you can make a human being so we go. Jesus. You're a wizard
[1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:25.260]  Uh, here with in every culture the women were actually worshiped as a goddess. So, you know, they're like, this is what we protect
[1:28:25.260 --> 1:28:29.580]  Yeah, I mean, that's I don't know. I feel like that's most of church. You're sitting there
[1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:33.180]  You're thinking about the miracle of birth and you're just going wow. Thank you
[1:28:33.740 --> 1:28:35.980]  Thank you for this gift and when we see women
[1:28:36.060 --> 1:28:38.620]  It's almost like they're closer to god because they're magic
[1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:41.580]  So we build them a house and we'll work 24 hours
[1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:46.460]  We'll truck we'll deliver a package across the country drive for three days straight on amphetamines
[1:28:46.780 --> 1:28:50.300]  Just to make sure she's okay. And then she goes. No, I hate this thing
[1:28:50.460 --> 1:28:54.540]  I want to do what you're doing and I want to scream and everyone and I want to take over and everyone's a bigot
[1:28:54.540 --> 1:28:59.100]  And you go, why are you adding a computer virus into our perfect system?
[1:28:59.420 --> 1:29:02.540]  And if you're going to replace it by the way, you should be replacing it with something better
[1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:07.420]  They were trying to destroy us and replace our whole system with something way worse
[1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:13.660]  Well, that's because they want to end the human species to create a manufactured system like the terminator seeds where the plants don't produce more
[1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:17.100]  Seeds they're just turning us into a total commodity and as hitler said
[1:29:17.580 --> 1:29:22.140]  First you get the women then you've got the children so follow the men they are targeting women
[1:29:22.140 --> 1:29:29.020]  And and then they're just totally desperate and sad and it's but men have to be men again to turn this around compoundmedia.com
[1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:34.060]  Gavin McKenness, you're a great guy. I got your big new movie out. Congratulations on everything you're doing. We appreciate your work
[1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:39.420]  Thanks for having me Alex and thank you for getting trump elected other listeners. They did it. God bless you
[1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:43.900]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with black box voting expert bev Harris
[1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:49.260]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:49.260 --> 1:29:52.940]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:57.180 --> 1:30:00.940]  There's an article up on our website info wars.com written by rob dune
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:06.780]  It talks about the mainstream media and how they're in total meltdown mode as the trump presidency is a reality
[1:30:07.100 --> 1:30:13.180]  Leftist mainstream pundits like james carbill are having a hard time believing that trump could have won in the first place
[1:30:13.340 --> 1:30:17.580]  Of course, he did and we saw the media elites in this country watch in shock and horror
[1:30:17.580 --> 1:30:19.820]  As their queen did not assume the throne
[1:30:19.900 --> 1:30:26.780]  Well, this news comes amid speculation that hillary and her army of trolls could be in severe trouble legally speaking as trump alluded to
[1:30:26.780 --> 1:30:28.940]  In the second debate saying on october 10th
[1:30:29.100 --> 1:30:36.460]  If I win i'm going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there's never been so
[1:30:36.460 --> 1:30:44.620]  Many lies so much deception well trumps campaign manager kelly and conway says that they're not ruling out a special prosecutor for hillary clinton
[1:30:44.620 --> 1:30:48.540]  It's just all in due time right now. The focus is on the country's unity
[1:30:48.780 --> 1:30:53.260]  When we're all waiting patiently to see hillary clinton receive justice for her endless corruption
[1:30:53.420 --> 1:30:56.140]  I'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com

[1:31:16.780 --> 1:31:20.700]  I got my bottle of brain force right there and pop two of them and about 20 minutes later

[1:31:36.300 --> 1:31:37.820]  I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while
[1:31:37.820 --> 1:31:42.220]  But I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this morning

[1:33:21.820 --> 1:33:27.660]  These old boys were raised on shotguns because we say grace we say amen
[1:33:28.460 --> 1:33:31.340]  And if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn
[1:33:36.540 --> 1:33:38.540]  You know, it's crazy
[1:33:39.900 --> 1:33:41.420]  I
[1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:46.780]  Look at the incompatibility of what the globals are trying to build and how disconnected they are and how really delusional they were
[1:33:46.780 --> 1:33:50.780]  That they could steal this election when history was on our side
[1:33:51.020 --> 1:33:56.220]  If they stole it, it would have blown up with their face even bigger. So we've had a moral victory here
[1:33:57.020 --> 1:33:58.220]  but
[1:33:58.220 --> 1:34:00.220]  They're now trying to take the Senate back
[1:34:00.780 --> 1:34:05.340]  From the republicans that supposedly want it. They're claiming in new hampshire. They're going to try more of this now
[1:34:05.340 --> 1:34:09.180]  Okay, they're going to try to go back now. They're not going to announce their challenge in the election
[1:34:09.180 --> 1:34:13.660]  That's why hillary waited till three in the morning. I mean we're up here at three in the morning waiting
[1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:17.820]  For her to finally come out and then she just didn't they sent
[1:34:18.860 --> 1:34:21.420]  Scurrying rat out there John Podesta
[1:34:22.380 --> 1:34:30.860]  And you know, and he's not it's satanic rituals. He's doing hotdog parties and he's he's often doing whatever else he does and
[1:34:32.220 --> 1:34:37.020]  I'm telling you I felt it last week. I saw it too. There's a number one story on the internet because drugs linked to him
[1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:39.500]  That spirit cooking article blew
[1:34:40.220 --> 1:34:41.900]  A giant
[1:34:41.900 --> 1:34:48.460]  Bloody hole on their side. They kind of crawled off to die over in the bushes politically, but
[1:34:49.340 --> 1:34:53.260]  They're still not completely dead and they got a bow and arrow over there and they'll shoot us in the back
[1:34:53.740 --> 1:34:56.780]  So we got to pull back stay out of range while they bleed to death and
[1:34:57.500 --> 1:35:01.420]  They're going to try to now go in and and steal some house seats. They're gonna do some other stuff
[1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:06.140]  Bev Harris has a lot of integrity. She's been a democrat a liberal
[1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:12.780]  She exposed what Bush did and I was bipartisan, but there was more evidence of republican fraud than the democrat both parties do it
[1:35:13.020 --> 1:35:15.980]  And she said last week what Assange said they're not going to let Trump have it the fix is in
[1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:19.020]  I'm no rocket scientist, but I've said this I saw places where
[1:35:19.580 --> 1:35:22.380]  She won by such margins. Even their fake polls didn't say that
[1:35:23.740 --> 1:35:27.980]  But they weren't in full control. You can't stop a landslide. I don't know Bev Harris's view on this yet
[1:35:28.460 --> 1:35:31.500]  I want to find out but I respect it. She is the expert
[1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:37.180]  Globally, I'm not bragging. It's just a fact for us people need to know how accomplished and on target. She is
[1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:42.540]  She's had more exposure of election fraud than everybody else combined and that's not poo pooing all those great folks
[1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:45.500]  She is so effective and when she was on a week and a half ago
[1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:49.900]  It made national news she released the information here on the on the fraction magic these programs
[1:35:49.900 --> 1:35:53.740]  They found around the country that have no reason to be there but for fraud to pre-program
[1:35:53.900 --> 1:35:58.300]  What's going to happen at the central system and of course Soros is involved and she just said it
[1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:02.380]  You know most the evidence. This is the Democrats. It's Soros. It's that looks like they're trying to do this
[1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:07.820]  Well, just a lay looking at this being a poll night covering it having the polls for each state in front of me
[1:36:07.900 --> 1:36:13.340]  It looks like they weren't in control of some areas and that's why Trump won because it's a landslide
[1:36:13.420 --> 1:36:17.100]  but it should have been an even bigger victory and so it looks like that
[1:36:18.540 --> 1:36:24.140]  That that again Bev Harris has always said on the show for 15 years. You can't steal a landslide now
[1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:29.580]  I'm going to find out if I'm wrong or I'm right here from her, but of course, we're pretty close to this right now
[1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:31.580]  We'll know more as it unfolds
[1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:35.900]  But Bev Harris, I mean, is that a basically accurate what I said or is it wrong?
[1:36:37.340 --> 1:36:39.820]  Uh, yeah, basically accurate did pretty good Alex
[1:36:40.460 --> 1:36:44.220]  You know as I was watching you today a few things the observations
[1:36:45.020 --> 1:36:51.420]  One one thing struck me very early in the morning yesterday is they had been planning fireworks
[1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:57.740]  And then they suddenly the Clinton campaign suddenly canceled their fireworks. They did this early in the morning, which
[1:36:58.940 --> 1:37:06.300]  Makes me curious as to whether, you know, their intel they already knew they were in trouble at that point because it didn't make sense otherwise
[1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:10.460]  They may have still thought they could pull it off another thing that struck me though
[1:37:11.020 --> 1:37:13.980]  I have seen particularly with the democrats
[1:37:14.860 --> 1:37:16.460]  a tactic where
[1:37:16.460 --> 1:37:24.060]  They'll take a concentrated blue area and hold back the results for hours and hours and hours that's it for example
[1:37:24.540 --> 1:37:28.380]  When hillary ran against obama in the primary in indiana
[1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:31.660]  Lake county, which is east chicago and gary
[1:37:32.140 --> 1:37:38.140]  I knew it, you know, I came in like ridiculous hours later and then when and suddenly turned the state to her right
[1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:41.100]  What they're doing when they hold back these
[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:49.260]  Uh dense areas that is they're basically figuring out watching the results come in and seeing how much they need in order to
[1:37:49.980 --> 1:37:55.100]  Uh to tip the thing and then they'll you know send in those results once they've got the amount that they they need to
[1:37:55.420 --> 1:37:57.180]  Beated into the system
[1:37:57.180 --> 1:37:58.620]  Last night
[1:37:58.620 --> 1:38:03.900]  They were holding back and it was ridiculous. They were holding back detroit in michigan
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:06.620]  melwaukee in wisconsin
[1:38:07.580 --> 1:38:09.580]  Pittsburgh in pennsylvania
[1:38:09.580 --> 1:38:11.580]  And nashua in new hampshire
[1:38:12.380 --> 1:38:18.620]  And nashua had for nine wards. What the heck they can't and they were putting the shoes
[1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:24.620]  They can't count nine wards in six hours. I mean no, they were holding it back because it's seven percent
[1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:33.260]  But I think as you continue to watch, uh, trump was absolutely rolling through mowing it down in the rural areas
[1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:35.260]  And they didn't have enough
[1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:41.180]  They couldn't you know, they could hold them back if they want they couldn't come up with enough to overtake that because you can't have
[1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:47.020]  You know 150 percent of the population voting in those right so so it doesn't matter you can fraction magic
[1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:51.660]  It means you can only fraction magic it to a hundred percent. You can't do anything more than that and um
[1:38:51.820 --> 1:38:56.220]  So so I mean as a top expert on this and I want you to roll through the evidence you saw
[1:38:56.460 --> 1:39:01.100]  But but I mean give us a boil down then it's pretty clear then to see they tried to steal it
[1:39:01.260 --> 1:39:03.500]  But the tsunami was so big it broke their back
[1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:11.100]  Yeah, and and the remember fraction magic is done by a local fixer or a regional fixer who has inside access
[1:39:11.500 --> 1:39:15.740]  You're not going to do that in every single county and if you're only going to choose certain counties
[1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:19.820]  You're going to pick the big urban counties. You're not going to pick those small little rural areas
[1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:23.660]  And what I was watching happen last night is
[1:39:24.300 --> 1:39:26.700]  He was taking it in the rural areas
[1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:31.180]  And he was taking all the small counties to this tremendous
[1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:33.180]  Uh margin. She also wasn't
[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:40.780]  Performing as you know, she the other thing if she simply was not she's not obama. She wasn't pulling obama voters, but um
[1:39:41.420 --> 1:39:42.380]  but
[1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:46.860]  In other words, if you're going to fraction magic it you're you're going to be selective about what you do
[1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:50.940]  And you're going to pick where that you know, you have the greatest opportunity to do something with the leech
[1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:54.860]  Well, I agree with you that it was seismic that I had before when they cancelled the fireworks display
[1:39:55.820 --> 1:39:57.820]  What he had was dispersed
[1:39:57.820 --> 1:39:59.820]  Really tough to deal with that
[1:39:59.820 --> 1:40:05.100]  You know, it's really tough to deal with that. So I don't know but I I do tend to
[1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:11.980]  My this is just a gut skill and really is not based on facts at this point. Okay, but I think that it
[1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:15.500]  He probably may have gotten more even
[1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:18.460]  You know then that was reported
[1:40:19.020 --> 1:40:21.820]  I mean, well, that's exactly what I've been saying is that
[1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:26.300]  Because I mean I was the polling place and and I mean and there were all these Hispanic folks
[1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:30.300]  May men coming over telling me they were voting for Trump and I was just like wow
[1:40:30.460 --> 1:40:34.140]  There was not a lot of white guys. It was a bunch of you know, women and Hispanic men
[1:40:34.780 --> 1:40:39.500]  Voting and and and just seeing that and what I see on the street in a democrat city
[1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:42.860]  I don't see any Hillary stickers. There were obama stickers everywhere
[1:40:43.900 --> 1:40:47.980]  Well, I'm very sort of part of the country. I haven't been in California right now. And you know, uh
[1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:52.780]  What I'm seeing here is folks are just mystified as to how it could happen
[1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:58.460]  It has to do with what you're surrounded with and um, you know, that's the big country is
[1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:00.860]  different in different demographics
[1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:02.380]  but
[1:41:02.380 --> 1:41:04.380]  You know, it was it was
[1:41:04.940 --> 1:41:12.380]  Particularly telling to me. I can't tell you how weird it was to see that they had already canceled their celebratory fireworks early in the morning
[1:41:13.100 --> 1:41:14.060]  um
[1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:18.780]  It's like that could happen if they had their people on the ground
[1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:24.620]  Telling them, you know, you have lines and lines and lines of people voting and they ain't voting for you
[1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:29.100]  I mean, if that's the problem, they may have said, okay, let's at least make it a little bit subtle
[1:41:29.820 --> 1:41:32.540]  You know, this was an interesting election
[1:41:32.620 --> 1:41:36.940]  And it's going to continue to be interesting because you know, the next thing has to be that
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:43.180]  We haven't solved any of these problems. By the way, you know, we still have to get the ballot images released
[1:41:43.180 --> 1:41:47.900]  We now have another state, Virginia that has refused to give up the evidence of the election
[1:41:47.900 --> 1:41:49.900]  We have now got
[1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:51.740]  Virginia
[1:41:51.740 --> 1:41:52.860]  Washington state
[1:41:52.860 --> 1:41:54.860]  Utah, Kansas
[1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:56.940]  Nevada
[1:41:56.940 --> 1:42:02.620]  And uh, Indiana all saying that they're going to refuse to give over any evidence of what the election actually was
[1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:09.500]  And so we haven't solved the problem. It is true. You can't necessarily tamper a landslide
[1:42:10.220 --> 1:42:12.620]  but you can do a whole lot of the uh,
[1:42:12.620 --> 1:42:18.620]  The uh, state and uh, and local races and you can certainly do any of the uh, congressional races, so
[1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:25.260]  Until they make the elections transparent and let us have what we had a right to have which already exists
[1:42:25.340 --> 1:42:27.340]  Which is the records in the machines
[1:42:27.980 --> 1:42:33.020]  Um, we're still not out of the woods on this and it's just going to happen again or there's something
[1:42:33.740 --> 1:42:36.940]  I think the problem there was she couldn't really plausibly win
[1:42:36.940 --> 1:42:45.740]  Uh, now bev Harris that is exactly my analysis and our crew's analysis watching this. Uh, hillary
[1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:50.940]  Absolutely, uh, looked really freaked out the night before the election when she was campaigning
[1:42:51.580 --> 1:42:57.580]  A bill looked really uh defeated all day yesterday. You could see it and I think it's clear they canceled the fireworks
[1:42:57.980 --> 1:43:04.380]  Because they knew they knew yeah, they knew and they were hoping maybe they could pull it off by holding back these bigger
[1:43:04.380 --> 1:43:11.260]  Urban areas as you know strange. This is I mean really strange. They're like well, Detroit, which is Wayne County, Michigan
[1:43:11.820 --> 1:43:13.820]  We're at 80 percent. This is it like
[1:43:14.620 --> 1:43:20.220]  Every two or three o'clock in the morning their time come on. That is not how it happens
[1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:23.740]  The whole I mean it is there's no reason whatsoever
[1:43:24.060 --> 1:43:27.660]  That you can't have your road total by three o'clock in the morning unless you're holding it back
[1:43:27.900 --> 1:43:33.500]  So and and now all over the country you just mentioned we can go over these roger stone has now joined us former trump campaign head
[1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:38.380]  And obviously the media finally figured out one of the main actual brains involved long steven bannon
[1:43:38.940 --> 1:43:40.940]  Bev Harris is here with us. He's here with us in studio
[1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:46.540]  Uh, I mean, I think it's important even though trump has won for the integrity of the election
[1:43:46.700 --> 1:43:48.860]  I got a significant suspicion. You're already pointing towards it
[1:43:49.500 --> 1:43:55.100]  That this is this is fraud against against uh trump. In fact, that's where the evidence is pointing. Bev Harris is a liberal
[1:43:55.180 --> 1:44:00.060]  She is a democrat. She has total credibility. She's here telling you that but still we should just investigate
[1:44:00.060 --> 1:44:03.740]  Because this is you know justice be done. May the heavens fall. We're not going to test the election
[1:44:03.740 --> 1:44:10.620]  It was a tsunami a huge realignment for populism a takeover of the republican party a repudiation of their horrible
[1:44:11.180 --> 1:44:16.300]  Uh blue blood behavior and let's just say it racist behavior in many cases. This is beautiful
[1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:23.740]  But but looking at this, uh, I mean can you recap that or expand on it about where we should look for the fraud and uh
[1:44:24.220 --> 1:44:26.220]  Why that's important
[1:44:26.220 --> 1:44:32.860]  Well, you know, you the bottom line that the the takeaway on this is we still need to get the systems transparent
[1:44:32.860 --> 1:44:35.420]  So that we can verify the vote. I mean, you can't do that then
[1:44:36.380 --> 1:44:40.220]  It's just um waiting for some other disaster in the future
[1:44:40.620 --> 1:44:45.180]  Um, there is one other thing that struck me that I'd like to mention. I mean, it really struck me as odd
[1:44:45.580 --> 1:44:50.300]  There was a point in time in which new hampshire was separated by only 96 votes
[1:44:50.300 --> 1:44:56.940]  And yet you did not and by the way, and I think Tasmania at one point was separated by only 2400 votes
[1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:01.660]  In a lot of states this triggers this can actually trigger even a mandatory recap
[1:45:01.900 --> 1:45:03.900]  We did not see a peep
[1:45:04.220 --> 1:45:11.500]  Even in the closest closest states that there was even the possibility even a discussion of any recount anywhere
[1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:18.060]  And we would we should have probably seen that I mean it's abnormal that we didn't with some of the very
[1:45:18.060 --> 1:45:23.260]  At the stages where it was very close, you know, because the pundits have to have something to talk about and that
[1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:25.420]  can signal
[1:45:25.420 --> 1:45:29.100]  Of course, what happens at a recount is great scrutiny of the vote count
[1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:33.100]  It can signal. Hey, we don't really want
[1:45:33.820 --> 1:45:36.940]  Any scrutiny of this at we being democrats, um
[1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:41.980]  Any scrutiny of this count any further scrutiny? We're not even going to discuss the idea
[1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:47.340]  Further scrutiny. Um, so that also kind of makes you think, hmm, you know
[1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:54.380]  I mean if you really are hard spot and you're separated by 94 votes, my goodness, why wouldn't you, you know?
[1:45:54.940 --> 1:45:56.940]  um, so it makes you wonder but
[1:45:57.820 --> 1:45:59.180]  um
[1:45:59.180 --> 1:46:03.980]  Yeah, it's it doesn't it doesn't give me any more confidence in the process
[1:46:04.620 --> 1:46:08.700]  It's you know, it just doesn't we basically until we can verify the count
[1:46:09.580 --> 1:46:11.580]  uh, which the
[1:46:11.580 --> 1:46:15.100]  records are already in the system to do that. They're just simply refusing
[1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:20.940]  To let anybody in the public see them even though under freedom of age of information law. It's our right
[1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:24.860]  So, you know until they do that it seems like they're hiding something
[1:46:27.580 --> 1:46:33.500]  Bev I'm just I'm just I'm just stunned here listening to you. It's it's so amazing and and again you're maximum
[1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:35.820]  You can't steal a landslide roger stone
[1:46:36.220 --> 1:46:40.860]  I also want to ask Bev Harris is just a political question for the lady that heads up black box voting dot org
[1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:46.940]  Hacking democracy top hbo film the leading election fraud expert in the world who's just exposed
[1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:53.020]  The big kahuna with her engineers and software folks that discovered it the fraction magic clearly in play here against trump
[1:46:53.340 --> 1:46:58.540]  But it all blew up in their face because it was such a tsunami. Um, roger. I want to ask you this question then Bev
[1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:01.180]  I'm not a vindictive person
[1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:06.380]  Napoleon the first time he was defeated was sent to what was at alba and then he came back later and and millions were killed
[1:47:06.380 --> 1:47:08.380]  He started a whole new war
[1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:12.620]  And Napoleon was a nice guy compared to these globalist. I mean George Soros and all these people
[1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:17.100]  It's not vindiction. We have to give them no quarter
[1:47:18.060 --> 1:47:20.060]  They've got to be brought to justice
[1:47:20.140 --> 1:47:24.540]  For the crimes they've committed. I'm really concerned and I hope it was just conciliatory
[1:47:25.580 --> 1:47:29.500]  He promised to lock lock her up special prosecutor. I mean the evidence is overwhelming
[1:47:30.220 --> 1:47:33.820]  Don't we need to immediately or I guess as soon as he gets in in two months
[1:47:33.820 --> 1:47:39.100]  We have to bring them to justice. It's not political vindictiveness. These people are legendary criminals roger
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:42.300]  We're either a nation of laws or we're a nation of men
[1:47:42.860 --> 1:47:49.980]  Either there are consequences on what the Clintons have done at long last or they are able to continue to dodge justice
[1:47:50.780 --> 1:47:56.060]  This is something a prosecutor in a court has to decide but right the real problem has been
[1:47:56.700 --> 1:48:02.060]  Ability to bring the charges to get a a fair indictment and trial first of all Bev
[1:48:02.060 --> 1:48:05.660]  I want to salute you for the amazing work that you are doing
[1:48:06.300 --> 1:48:08.540]  You know, as you know, we tried to track some of the
[1:48:09.900 --> 1:48:11.900]  Some of the exit polling to
[1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:14.780]  Be compared to machine totals
[1:48:15.420 --> 1:48:20.940]  And therefore we've taken a hard look at all the work you've done and I salute you you are an amazing person
[1:48:21.340 --> 1:48:28.220]  And you have done amazing work. So, uh, my hats off to my hats off to you. Bev. What's your view on that question?
[1:48:28.220 --> 1:48:32.860]  I mean, you're all about justice. I mean, it came out the problem was cheating on cover it. Yeah, you know
[1:48:33.740 --> 1:48:41.260]  My next book the title of my next book is black box america and it is dealing with the underlying corruption issues
[1:48:41.820 --> 1:48:46.620]  I started studying money laundering, which is sort of by net by definition complicated
[1:48:46.620 --> 1:48:50.140]  Just like collecting is like, oh my goodness. You go through this open
[1:48:50.620 --> 1:48:53.980]  I've been doing that for about four years and I've been studying it off of indictments, you know
[1:48:53.980 --> 1:49:01.660]  Where they unravel it in the indictments and you know, uh, it it looked pretty darn clear to me from for what quite a while now that the
[1:49:02.300 --> 1:49:04.780]  Foundation is actually a money laundering operation
[1:49:05.340 --> 1:49:08.860]  Uh, it does need to be investigated and it does need to be investigated
[1:49:09.020 --> 1:49:12.940]  I'm not going to say that there is guilt before it's been ascertained in the court of law
[1:49:12.940 --> 1:49:15.740]  but it definitely needs to be investigated because
[1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:18.380]  Uh, it just it just
[1:49:18.460 --> 1:49:20.460]  Looks that way
[1:49:20.460 --> 1:49:25.180]  You know, that may not be the president's role. It may be the congress's role
[1:49:25.740 --> 1:49:32.060]  But there has to be a uh an an actual bona fide investigation. Well, we need an honest
[1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:39.260]  Attorney general. We need a non political attorney general one who will row on the basis of the law
[1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:44.140]  I can think of a half dozen people men and women who would be an exemplary
[1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:46.860]  Attorney general, but we've had
[1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:52.300]  Eric Holder, we've had Loretta Lynch. We've had a succession. It better not be Giuliani
[1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:57.740]  I don't think it will be Giuliani. Uh, he'll be too busy as director of homeland security
[1:49:58.380 --> 1:50:02.700]  Uh, actually, I don't think I don't think the mayor will join the government. I don't think he has an interest
[1:50:03.180 --> 1:50:06.540]  Uh, in joining the government. I'm not trying to get on some bandwagon against him, but let me tell you
[1:50:07.820 --> 1:50:13.340]  The patriots in the intelligence community and everybody they know about Giuliani and stuff and it's just just he just needs to go
[1:50:13.340 --> 1:50:19.100]  Uh, I understand your your views on him. Anyway, you slice it though. He played an important. In fact, I don't know
[1:50:19.740 --> 1:50:21.500]  I'm not here attacking Giuliani. I'm just
[1:50:21.500 --> 1:50:26.860]  Exactly. Let's go to break final segment with Bev Harris. You're gonna continue on riding shotgun co-hosting Bev Harris blackbox floating.org

[1:51:02.300 --> 1:51:06.300]  I suffered a bulged l4 and l5 disc from a car accident three years ago
[1:51:06.300 --> 1:51:12.460]  And since that time I've been unable to walk long distances do any minor lifting or just normal activities with my children
[1:51:12.620 --> 1:51:16.220]  Without having severe back pain since I've started using one world way

[1:53:05.580 --> 1:53:09.580]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[1:53:59.580 --> 1:54:05.580]  Final second with Beth Harris. We've got Roger Stone writing a shot that let us write through 3 o'clock today and then he's on an airplane.
[1:54:05.580 --> 1:54:12.580]  He's telling me I should celebrate. He was big buddies with Nixon. They reported one of his best friends after he was out of office.
[1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:24.580]  Nixon could never savor anything or ever appreciate a victory. Look, I do, I love everybody, but it makes me love the country and you that much more.
[1:54:24.580 --> 1:54:33.580]  And it makes me so frustrated because I see them all this race-baiting crap and just the division and making stuff up and I really want people to come together.
[1:54:33.580 --> 1:54:40.580]  And so I just get mad. Van Jones saying this is a white backlash and all this crap. This was a backlash against NAFTA and GATT.
[1:54:40.580 --> 1:54:48.580]  It was a backlash against the mainstream media. I mean, the truth is, Trump is not even conservative, okay? He's a populist.
[1:54:48.580 --> 1:54:57.580]  And thank God, I can't stand Paul Ryan. I can't stand the horrible Republican filthy establishment. They're just as bad as the Democrats.
[1:54:57.580 --> 1:55:02.580]  And here's an article in FullWars.com, Kingmaker Drudge defeats establishment media with Trump win.
[1:55:02.580 --> 1:55:08.580]  We've all done it, but this is a repudiation of the polls. We told you they were fraudulent. This is a repudiation of the MSM.
[1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:15.580]  Now, before I go back to Bev Harris with final comments, they're telling me, plug, plug, plug, we need to find this operation great.
[1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:21.580]  We're dominating. We got the numbers. We left last night. It was 27 million people that had just tuned into video streams that we could try.
[1:55:21.580 --> 1:55:29.580]  Okay? All our videos for the 30-something hours before that, 27, 28 million. We haven't tabulated it yet.
[1:55:29.580 --> 1:55:36.580]  Again, that's not bragging. It's saying these people aren't a joke. They need to know they're a joke. MSM calls me. I don't do the interviews.
[1:55:36.580 --> 1:55:42.580]  They don't have real people watching. They have a bunch of zombie idiots watching. Anyone with a brain isn't watching them.
[1:55:42.580 --> 1:55:45.580]  And it's not that we're even that good. They're that bad.
[1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:52.580]  So we've got free shipping going right now on storewideinfullwars.com, on non-GMO seeds, on supplements, on water filters, on everything you need.

[1:56:32.580 --> 1:56:37.580]  Bev, thank you for everything you've done. Other little, I mean, I know you'll know more in the days and weeks to come,
[1:56:37.580 --> 1:56:40.580]  but other little factoids or tidbits we should know.
[1:56:40.580 --> 1:56:50.580]  Oh, listen. Anybody who is upset, any Democrat who is upset that Trump is the winner has the DNC to blame.
[1:56:50.580 --> 1:57:00.580]  WikiVicks email number 1120. Look at the attachment to that. It is a DNC strategy session where they are working to elevate Trump as the frontrunner
[1:57:00.580 --> 1:57:06.580]  because they feel he will be easier to beat. They care for what you wish for, folks.
[1:57:06.580 --> 1:57:14.580]  Then they ended up, you know, completely screwing Bernie Sanders and doing all kinds of tampering with that.
[1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:20.580]  They pushed down the candidate that people wanted. They gave the people a candidate they didn't want,
[1:57:20.580 --> 1:57:24.580]  and then they elevated a different candidate artificially.
[1:57:24.580 --> 1:57:33.580]  If you want to point a finger at somebody because you're a Democrat and you're upset about this, look to the DNC because...
[1:57:33.580 --> 1:57:35.580]  That's right. And well, it shows their disconnect.
[1:57:35.580 --> 1:57:38.580]  That's the responsibility, right there.
[1:57:38.580 --> 1:57:46.580]  Bev, I agree. I mean, it shows the disconnect that, A, they thought someone brazen and brash and Americana would be negative.
[1:57:46.580 --> 1:57:51.580]  They're in their own echo chamber. They have the opposite of the Midas touch.
[1:57:51.580 --> 1:57:58.580]  I guess that email has been reported as well, but I happen to find it kind of by accident.
[1:57:58.580 --> 1:58:07.580]  I just went, oh, my goodness. I think it's April 2015, and they're all having a strategy session as to how to elevate Trump.
[1:58:07.580 --> 1:58:13.580]  And they're saying, because we're worried about Bush, and we're worried about Cruz, or worried about Rubio.
[1:58:13.580 --> 1:58:16.580]  No, no. I mean, that is the real one. You're right. We've covered it. Saunders talked about it.
[1:58:16.580 --> 1:58:26.580]  Yeah. So, okay. And now, let's talk about a judgment problem. People have a judgment problem.
[1:58:26.580 --> 1:58:33.580]  Bev Harris, you're amazing. Can't wait to have you back up. Can't wait to have you back up soon to give us more post-mortem analysis.
[1:58:33.580 --> 1:58:37.580]  Thank you so much. We'll be right back with Roger Stone, Steve Pachennick, Larry Nichols.
[1:58:37.580 --> 1:58:40.580]  I'm going to take your phone calls. Roger Stone in the studio, stay with us.
[1:58:40.580 --> 1:58:46.580]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:46.580 --> 1:58:51.580]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[1:58:51.580 --> 1:58:56.580]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:58:56.580 --> 1:59:01.580]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[1:59:01.580 --> 1:59:09.580]  but right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:59:09.580 --> 1:59:17.580]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[1:59:17.580 --> 1:59:20.580]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[1:59:20.580 --> 1:59:24.580]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:59:24.580 --> 1:59:27.580]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:59:27.580 --> 1:59:31.580]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:59:31.580 --> 1:59:33.580]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:33.580 --> 1:59:37.580]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:59:37.580 --> 1:59:40.580]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:40.580 --> 1:59:42.580]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:59:42.580 --> 1:59:57.580]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:20.580]  It's worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:20.580 --> 2:00:28.580]  Well, the former spy chief and head of psychological warfare and co-founder of Delta Force, Dr. Steve Pacenek, is joining us coming up.
[2:00:28.580 --> 2:00:30.580]  And there has been a rebellion in the intelligence community.
[2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:32.580]  The media tries to misrepresent that claim.
[2:00:32.580 --> 2:00:35.580]  You know, well, Pacenek isn't running the movement. He never said he was.
[2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:38.580]  The point is, it's just people everywhere. We're the movement. You're the movement.
[2:00:38.580 --> 2:00:45.580]  Citizens are everybody. Human. We're just citizens here fighting a globalist takeover, like the French resistance or something.
[2:00:45.580 --> 2:00:48.580]  This is real. Roger Stone's here. Pacenek's coming up the next segment.
[2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:50.580]  He's riding the shot down with us for the next two hours.
[2:00:50.580 --> 2:00:54.580]  Take a little break for some lunch in a little while. We're getting Roger some lunch.
[2:00:54.580 --> 2:01:00.580]  But, Roger, wow, do you agree we need to go after them? They need to be punished.
[2:01:00.580 --> 2:01:05.580]  They need to go to jail. Not out of vindictiveness. Justice must be served.
[2:01:05.580 --> 2:01:10.580]  Plus, this is the day of the dead. These zombies are going to keep coming back at us until their brains have been removed.
[2:01:10.580 --> 2:01:15.580]  Well, first let me address something Bev said, because I think it's crucially important, because we've seen this before.
[2:01:15.580 --> 2:01:23.580]  If you read Hamilton Jordan's biography, there's a whole section on how Jimmy Carter wanted to run against Ronald Reagan.
[2:01:23.580 --> 2:01:26.580]  Thought he was a simpleton. Oh, you said this a few months ago.
[2:01:26.580 --> 2:01:34.580]  Thought he was imminently beatable. We saw the same thing here, where if you look at the returns in Detroit, in Milwaukee,
[2:01:34.580 --> 2:01:38.580]  in Pittsburgh, for example. Replay of Reagan.
[2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:45.580]  No other Republican could have won this. Had we nominated a conventional establishment Republican,
[2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:50.580]  you would have gotten the traditional Republican vote in those places, and we would have lost.
[2:01:50.580 --> 2:01:55.580]  Only Trump could have won this. So, again, Bev's right. Be careful what you wish for.
[2:01:55.580 --> 2:01:59.580]  Why are they so incompetent? I knew Trump was the strongest from the beginning.
[2:01:59.580 --> 2:02:06.580]  Because they're elitists. They don't understand working people. They don't understand how average people think, and they don't understand their values.
[2:02:06.580 --> 2:02:11.580]  And they never understood Trump's appeal to working people. He speaks the language.
[2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:18.580]  We want to go eat a hamburger and drink a beer. They want to go devil worship and drink blood. They're just disconnected.
[2:02:18.580 --> 2:02:25.580]  Exactly. Now, the other thing to go to your point is, Trump is a man who means what he says and says what he means.
[2:02:25.580 --> 2:02:29.580]  You watch the debates. You can run them back down and rewatch them.
[2:02:29.580 --> 2:02:32.580]  He is going to seek justice for those who have broken the law.
[2:02:32.580 --> 2:02:37.580]  Now, he doesn't think that he unilaterally can wave a wand and say, Hillary should be sent to jail.
[2:02:37.580 --> 2:02:45.580]  There's a process. But they have avoided the process for 40 years, and now it is time for it all to catch up with them.
[2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:50.580]  They need to be put through the judicial process. The Clinton Foundation is not a charity.
[2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:51.580]  It's money laundering.
[2:02:51.580 --> 2:02:53.580]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[2:02:53.580 --> 2:02:57.580]  But don't we have the total proof with the WikiLeaks from three weeks ago where we got to cover this up?
[2:02:57.580 --> 2:03:00.580]  There's like 15 of them that I saw. We got to cover it up for POTUS.
[2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:02.580]  He's in secret communication with this illegal thing.
[2:03:02.580 --> 2:03:05.580]  This is like, God, we're all screwed. Drawing a quarter of a river. This is totally illegal.
[2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:07.580]  We have them running around admitting they're committing crime.
[2:03:07.580 --> 2:03:12.580]  So dumb on emails that admitting they want to cover it up. I mean, it's open and shut.
[2:03:12.580 --> 2:03:19.580]  We've always had the evidence. What we haven't had is an honest prosecutor who will take it to a grand jury so that justice can be done.
[2:03:19.580 --> 2:03:28.580]  Now I think you will finally have that. We're now going to what I think is a crucial period because personnel is policy.
[2:03:28.580 --> 2:03:36.580]  And the president-elect needs to choose people who reflect his worldview, who reflect his mindset.
[2:03:36.580 --> 2:03:41.580]  No more old guard. He needs to get patriots, new people, folks from the outside.
[2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:46.580]  He needs to get business people, doctors. He needs to get a wide spectrum.
[2:03:46.580 --> 2:03:53.580]  And he needs to avoid globalists. He needs to avoid neocons. He needs to avoid those who are tied to the mistakes of the past.
[2:03:53.580 --> 2:03:55.580]  He needs a fresh team.
[2:03:55.580 --> 2:03:57.580]  Tell folks how pathetic the mainstream media is.
[2:03:57.580 --> 2:04:01.580]  Famous people, because it's on your phone, are calling, calling, calling Democrats who've been attacking.
[2:04:01.580 --> 2:04:03.580]  Now they suddenly are kissing your ass, asking for jobs.
[2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:08.580]  The job seekers now come out of the woodwork. First, there's the Republican job seekers.
[2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:13.580]  Those who were never for Trump. They're the ones calling to say, I was with you the whole time.
[2:04:13.580 --> 2:04:16.580]  Can you send my resume? Can you send my resume?
[2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:23.580]  Then you've got the reporters who wouldn't give you the time of day, who misrepresented what you said, who attacked you.
[2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:26.580]  Now they want to know if they can get an interview with Donald Trump.
[2:04:26.580 --> 2:04:31.580]  This is the way the world works. This is why I left Washington when I did.
[2:04:31.580 --> 2:04:34.580]  Washington is the phoniest place on the planet.
[2:04:34.580 --> 2:04:37.580]  If you want to meet real people, you've got a better chance in Hollywood.
[2:04:37.580 --> 2:04:40.580]  Well, exactly. And I want to just say this.
[2:04:40.580 --> 2:04:45.580]  What am I asking for from Trump? Just be true. Restore the Republic. Cut taxes. Cut the debt.
[2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:51.580]  Unify the nation. I'm not asking for anything. Just do what you said you'd do.
[2:04:51.580 --> 2:05:14.580]  Please, for my children, we'll be back. Stay with us.
[2:05:21.580 --> 2:05:24.580]  More than 100 protesters gathered in Oakland, California this morning,
[2:05:24.580 --> 2:05:28.580]  attempting to block freeways, and at least one was hit by a car.
[2:05:28.580 --> 2:05:30.580]  Protesters were also seen in masks.
[2:05:30.580 --> 2:05:32.580]  Outside a Trump supporters' party in San Francisco,
[2:05:32.580 --> 2:05:35.580]  and Clinton supporters were filmed marching through Portland, Oregon,
[2:05:35.580 --> 2:05:39.580]  shouting expletive Donald Trump and setting fire to the U.S. flag.
[2:05:39.580 --> 2:05:43.580]  This news comes as death threats against Donald Trump flood social media.
[2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:47.580]  Well, can we count on the liberal media in this country to whine,
[2:05:47.580 --> 2:05:51.580]  refusing to accept Trump's victory as a hashtag, I'm still with her.
[2:05:51.580 --> 2:05:53.580]  Hey, accept it in the spirit of tolerance.
[2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:56.580]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:05:56.580 --> 2:05:59.580]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[2:05:59.580 --> 2:06:03.580]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[2:06:03.580 --> 2:06:06.580]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[2:06:06.580 --> 2:06:09.580]  I'm Charity Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:15.580]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[2:06:15.580 --> 2:06:21.580]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[2:06:21.580 --> 2:06:27.580]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[2:06:27.580 --> 2:06:30.580]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:06:30.580 --> 2:06:34.580]  Where the solution, Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:39.580]  Starring Alex Jones, Charity Daniels, and Special Office General Jerry Boykin,
[2:06:39.580 --> 2:06:43.580]  theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[2:06:43.580 --> 2:06:46.580]  brochets and tears over the red, white, and blue.
[2:06:46.580 --> 2:06:49.580]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:52.580]  Americans needn't see this film.
[2:06:52.580 --> 2:06:55.580]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[2:06:55.580 --> 2:07:21.580]  Let's fix it.
[2:07:21.580 --> 2:07:26.580]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:56.580]  Call 888-253-3139.
[2:08:21.580 --> 2:08:25.580]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and history is now being made.
[2:08:25.580 --> 2:08:33.580]  Never underestimate the arrogance of the Washington bureaucrat and banker class.
[2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:36.580]  They created this con that they were invincible.
[2:08:36.580 --> 2:08:42.580]  Now that America has tasted victory again, the spirit of the republic is rising.
[2:08:42.580 --> 2:08:46.580]  Dr. C. Pacinic is with us for the next 40 minutes or so,
[2:08:46.580 --> 2:08:50.580]  then Larry Nichols, who is just proven to be so dead on, is going to be joining us.
[2:08:50.580 --> 2:08:52.580]  David Nye continues on.
[2:08:52.580 --> 2:08:54.580]  And we've decided, whatever crew wants to stay, there's no pressure.
[2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:56.580]  We're going to just continue, not 52 hours.
[2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.580]  We're going to continue broadcasting right through tonight,
[2:08:58.580 --> 2:09:00.580]  till as long as we can stay here.
[2:09:00.580 --> 2:09:02.580]  Because that's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:09:02.580 --> 2:09:04.580]  And you're here by the tens of millions.
[2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:06.580]  I haven't checked the numbers in the first 30-something hours.
[2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:10.580]  We had 27 million people just on Facebook and YouTube,
[2:09:10.580 --> 2:09:12.580]  and on our own streams.
[2:09:12.580 --> 2:09:16.580]  Just on Facebook before, it was like 10 million or more.
[2:09:16.580 --> 2:09:19.580]  Again, that's not even our main platforms.
[2:09:19.580 --> 2:09:22.580]  I had to kind of pistol whip around here, folks,
[2:09:22.580 --> 2:09:25.580]  to make people start putting our videos on Facebook six months ago.
[2:09:25.580 --> 2:09:28.580]  I'm joking on a say that, that they actually buggy whip people.
[2:09:28.580 --> 2:09:31.580]  But the point is, is that very exciting things are happening.
[2:09:31.580 --> 2:09:34.580]  We are ace of spades every time, royal flush,
[2:09:34.580 --> 2:09:36.580]  blowing the living daylights out of them.
[2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:40.580]  But we have to prosecute them.
[2:09:40.580 --> 2:09:44.580]  These rats are not ever going to back off now.
[2:09:44.580 --> 2:09:48.580]  They are, they've always hated us because they know we're colossals compared to them.
[2:09:48.580 --> 2:09:50.580]  We're not here to screw people over.
[2:09:50.580 --> 2:09:52.580]  They're mentally ill and want to pull everything down
[2:09:52.580 --> 2:09:54.580]  because they're so spiritually ugly.
[2:09:54.580 --> 2:09:57.580]  Now, Roger shows right a shot done with us throughout the broadcast days,
[2:09:57.580 --> 2:09:59.580]  flying back out later this afternoon.
[2:09:59.580 --> 2:10:01.580]  I want to just end up talks with him,
[2:10:01.580 --> 2:10:03.580]  but this is all kind of co-hosting here just briefly because they keep telling me this.
[2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:06.580]  Yeah, I just want to hire four or five more reporters and crew members
[2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:08.580]  and pay the bills around here.
[2:10:08.580 --> 2:10:10.580]  You need to plug, which I haven't done in days, our sponsors.
[2:10:10.580 --> 2:10:12.580]  And you need to stop skipping breaks.
[2:10:12.580 --> 2:10:15.580]  And you need to, you know, I got Ted Anderson telling me this from Minnesota.
[2:10:15.580 --> 2:10:17.580]  I got them telling me, and I'm not bitching.
[2:10:17.580 --> 2:10:19.580]  I'm just saying, refuel us.
[2:10:19.580 --> 2:10:23.580]  There isn't anywhere where you can buy products that are better.
[2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:25.580]  We go out to the top producers and say,
[2:10:25.580 --> 2:10:27.580]  we want the most ridiculously high quality,
[2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:29.580]  and we're going to have it at a low price.
[2:10:29.580 --> 2:10:30.580]  And they just go, no one does this.
[2:10:30.580 --> 2:10:31.580]  Well, we did.
[2:10:31.580 --> 2:10:34.580]  Okay, whether it's X2, whether it's DNA4, whatever it is,
[2:10:34.580 --> 2:10:36.580]  free shipping store wide, free shipping store wide,
[2:10:36.580 --> 2:10:39.580]  infowarslive.com, infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site
[2:10:39.580 --> 2:10:44.580]  on non-GMO seeds of high quality, durable food, everything there.
[2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:48.580]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:10:48.580 --> 2:10:51.580]  And Donald Trump has said it, and the media tried to hang it
[2:10:51.580 --> 2:10:52.580]  like an albatross around his neck.
[2:10:52.580 --> 2:10:53.580]  I'm not bragging.
[2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:54.580]  It really is true.
[2:10:54.580 --> 2:11:00.580]  Infowars is at the absolute core of the rediscovery of America
[2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:02.580]  and the American system in 1776.
[2:11:02.580 --> 2:11:04.580]  Not because I invented any of this,
[2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:07.580]  but because I rediscovered what America was in life
[2:11:07.580 --> 2:11:09.580]  and in the history books and more.
[2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:11.580]  And then for 20-plus years I've been in the trenches
[2:11:11.580 --> 2:11:13.580]  learning this from every angle.
[2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:16.580]  And developing a knowledge base that no one else really has.
[2:11:16.580 --> 2:11:18.580]  Other people have knowledge bases that I don't have.
[2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:19.580]  I'm not saying I'm some grandpa.
[2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:20.580]  Let's just say this.
[2:11:20.580 --> 2:11:22.580]  This brain trust is being given to everybody,
[2:11:22.580 --> 2:11:29.580]  and you're adding to it like an electrochemical supercomputer
[2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:32.580]  that's interfaced with the silicon world.
[2:11:32.580 --> 2:11:34.580]  This is the new true AI system.
[2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:37.580]  It is we the people interfaced in the new media
[2:11:37.580 --> 2:11:39.580]  and overthrowing the entire technocracy.
[2:11:39.580 --> 2:11:41.580]  They believe it would be our enslavement.
[2:11:41.580 --> 2:11:43.580]  It will now be the delivery system to Valhalla,
[2:11:43.580 --> 2:11:45.580]  but we have to take it in our hands.
[2:11:45.580 --> 2:11:47.580]  And that's not utopia I'm promising.
[2:11:47.580 --> 2:11:48.580]  That's reality.
[2:11:48.580 --> 2:11:50.580]  But it's an animating contest.
[2:11:50.580 --> 2:11:52.580]  Now, we will not be teleported there on a bed of roses,
[2:11:52.580 --> 2:11:54.580]  as Thomas Jefferson said.
[2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:58.580]  Infowars, store.com, is the energy on cubes we need.
[2:11:58.580 --> 2:11:59.580]  It's the fuel.
[2:11:59.580 --> 2:12:01.580]  You get high quality products.
[2:12:01.580 --> 2:12:02.580]  It's symbiotic.
[2:12:02.580 --> 2:12:04.580]  There are things you need to reuse and have again,
[2:12:04.580 --> 2:12:06.580]  just like we need to continue on.
[2:12:06.580 --> 2:12:10.580]  Breathing as the seasons pass as the planet orbits.
[2:12:10.580 --> 2:12:11.580]  Infowars, live.com.
[2:12:11.580 --> 2:12:12.580]  Infowars, store.com.
[2:12:12.580 --> 2:12:14.580]  Steve Pacenek.com is his great website.
[2:12:14.580 --> 2:12:16.580]  He's joining us right now, popping in.
[2:12:16.580 --> 2:12:19.580]  And of course, we have Roger Stone here jumping anytime, Roger.
[2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:20.580]  But what an incredible time.
[2:12:20.580 --> 2:12:21.580]  Now, Pacenek, we're co-hosting.
[2:12:21.580 --> 2:12:25.580]  Just give us little nuggets of where you see this going,
[2:12:25.580 --> 2:12:26.580]  what's unfolded.
[2:12:26.580 --> 2:12:28.580]  We talked this weekend and I said,
[2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:29.580]  I thought Trump was going to win.
[2:12:29.580 --> 2:12:31.580]  I knew they were going to try to steal it,
[2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:32.580]  and I had a bad feeling.
[2:12:32.580 --> 2:12:33.580]  And Beth Harris was on.
[2:12:33.580 --> 2:12:34.580]  She's a liberal.
[2:12:34.580 --> 2:12:35.580]  She said clearly they tried to steal it,
[2:12:35.580 --> 2:12:39.580]  but the tsunami was so big that they defeated him.
[2:12:39.580 --> 2:12:41.580]  So I think now asking you, what do we do next?
[2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:42.580]  I want your view.
[2:12:42.580 --> 2:12:46.580]  Clearly, do you think we should just let Hillary sail off into the sunset?
[2:12:46.580 --> 2:12:47.580]  Clearly not.
[2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:52.580]  First of all, I want to congratulate you, Alex and Roger,
[2:12:52.580 --> 2:12:56.580]  for really initiating this American Revolution.
[2:12:56.580 --> 2:12:57.580]  It was not easy.
[2:12:57.580 --> 2:13:02.580]  It's an important idea that people have to understand
[2:13:02.580 --> 2:13:06.580]  that this was initiated by what we call the alternative media.
[2:13:06.580 --> 2:13:09.580]  Roger and I had worked under Reagan.
[2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:12.580]  We had worked under other presidents, Nixon.
[2:13:12.580 --> 2:13:14.580]  But this is really a revolution.
[2:13:14.580 --> 2:13:17.580]  And this was a revolution that people should understand,
[2:13:17.580 --> 2:13:20.580]  initiated through your auspices.
[2:13:20.580 --> 2:13:22.580]  Bless Roger, interceding.
[2:13:22.580 --> 2:13:27.580]  My coming in, but it also belongs to the men and women
[2:13:27.580 --> 2:13:30.580]  who are in our intelligence service,
[2:13:30.580 --> 2:13:34.580]  our military intelligence, our civilian intelligence.
[2:13:34.580 --> 2:13:38.580]  Had they not performed, we would not have been at this position.
[2:13:38.580 --> 2:13:44.580]  And I can't tell you how important they have been to the integrity of the Republic.
[2:13:44.580 --> 2:13:48.580]  It's not just the men and women who carry guns and fight our wars,
[2:13:48.580 --> 2:13:49.580]  the kinetic wars.
[2:13:49.580 --> 2:13:52.580]  This is a new kind of war.
[2:13:52.580 --> 2:13:58.580]  And let me tell you, in 1973, I was fortunate enough under the GI Bill
[2:13:58.580 --> 2:14:01.580]  to not only attend Harvard, but MIT.
[2:14:01.580 --> 2:14:05.580]  Not because I was so smart, but because I understood that at MIT
[2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:08.580]  they were going to teach me something that had never been taught before.
[2:14:08.580 --> 2:14:11.580]  And that was the Internet and social media.
[2:14:11.580 --> 2:14:13.580]  1973.
[2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:17.580]  My dad was at UT in the 60s, and they were talking about CD-ROM
[2:14:17.580 --> 2:14:20.580]  and social media then as well in the Plan 2 program
[2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:21.580]  when he was in high school.
[2:14:21.580 --> 2:14:24.580]  And of course, you know that was a secret DARPA program.
[2:14:24.580 --> 2:14:25.580]  That's exactly it.
[2:14:25.580 --> 2:14:30.580]  So we have to thank DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
[2:14:30.580 --> 2:14:35.580]  and even the CIA for having initiated this type of modality
[2:14:35.580 --> 2:14:37.580]  that nobody could conceive.
[2:14:37.580 --> 2:14:43.580]  50 years later, we have been able to utilize that using you, Roger, many others,
[2:14:43.580 --> 2:14:50.580]  and the Internet to literally have a coup, which the Clintons did and attempted it.
[2:14:50.580 --> 2:14:52.580]  And there was a counter coup.
[2:14:52.580 --> 2:14:53.580]  There's no question about it.
[2:14:53.580 --> 2:14:57.580]  Without soldiers, without tanks, as Roger said,
[2:14:57.580 --> 2:15:00.580]  the old line Republicans were useless.
[2:15:00.580 --> 2:15:02.580]  We were able to kick them out.
[2:15:02.580 --> 2:15:08.580]  And in turn, what happened was the Republic answered in a way that we'd never seen before.
[2:15:08.580 --> 2:15:11.580]  The voices that came through you, through the protests,
[2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:14.580]  through the meetings that they went to with Donald Trump,
[2:15:14.580 --> 2:15:19.580]  and the fact that Donald could articulate our discontent and maintain it
[2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:22.580]  at a phenomenal rate that even I was done.
[2:15:22.580 --> 2:15:27.580]  I got to tell you, as a doctor, psychiatrist, I've never seen anybody like Donald Trump.
[2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:29.580]  He was tireless.
[2:15:29.580 --> 2:15:32.580]  I mean, I had to go to bed at midnight one in the morning,
[2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:35.580]  because I figured, oh, you know, this will keep on going.
[2:15:35.580 --> 2:15:41.580]  But truthfully, we owe a great gratitude to the family, the Trump family,
[2:15:41.580 --> 2:15:43.580]  to all the people around him.
[2:15:43.580 --> 2:15:45.580]  They're warriors. They're warriors.
[2:15:45.580 --> 2:15:48.580]  And Roger Stone here with us, former Trump campaign, had he's got...
[2:15:48.580 --> 2:15:50.580]  Well, Roger's an old line warrior.
[2:15:50.580 --> 2:15:52.580]  He and I worked for Nixon.
[2:15:52.580 --> 2:15:54.580]  I had a great, great respect for Nixon.
[2:15:54.580 --> 2:15:58.580]  And as I said to a friend of mine who's not meeting with Ron Svelte,
[2:15:58.580 --> 2:16:01.580]  I said, the spirit of Nixon, and I came in later on,
[2:16:01.580 --> 2:16:04.580]  Roger was far more involved with Nixon than I did.
[2:16:04.580 --> 2:16:07.580]  I really came in towards the end, and then the Ford administration.
[2:16:07.580 --> 2:16:11.580]  But Nixon communicated with me, and that man was a genius.
[2:16:11.580 --> 2:16:15.580]  I mean, people really only understand Watergate,
[2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:18.580]  but they don't understand how brilliant he was.
[2:16:18.580 --> 2:16:20.580]  And he was a poor man.
[2:16:20.580 --> 2:16:22.580]  He grew up as a Quaker.
[2:16:22.580 --> 2:16:25.580]  He watched his brother get killed.
[2:16:25.580 --> 2:16:29.580]  He grew up with all kinds of problems that he was able to...
[2:16:29.580 --> 2:16:32.580]  Reportedly, Stone was like best friends with Nixon after he got out of the office.
[2:16:32.580 --> 2:16:34.580]  That's what the New York Times says.
[2:16:34.580 --> 2:16:36.580]  I admire him, and I understand that.
[2:16:36.580 --> 2:16:38.580]  He never lined his pockets.
[2:16:38.580 --> 2:16:41.580]  He never used his position in government to enrich himself.
[2:16:41.580 --> 2:16:43.580]  They tried to say that in Watergate.
[2:16:43.580 --> 2:16:46.580]  It was false. He was, above all, a patriot.
[2:16:46.580 --> 2:16:49.580]  He was for a strong America. He was for peace.
[2:16:49.580 --> 2:16:52.580]  And he paid the ultimate price for it.
[2:16:52.580 --> 2:16:55.580]  And he made mistakes. There's no question.
[2:16:55.580 --> 2:16:57.580]  Closing the gold window. Enormous mistake.
[2:16:57.580 --> 2:16:59.580]  The war on drugs. Enormous...
[2:16:59.580 --> 2:17:01.580]  But he wasn't a demon state. You had a question for me.
[2:17:01.580 --> 2:17:04.580]  Roger's correct. He was a patriot.
[2:17:04.580 --> 2:17:07.580]  Ironically, the liberals come up to me and say,
[2:17:07.580 --> 2:17:11.580]  Oh my God, I didn't know that Nixon had created the Environmental Protection Agency.
[2:17:11.580 --> 2:17:15.580]  I didn't know Nixon had initiated NIDA, National Institute for Drug Abuse.
[2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:19.580]  I said, Yeah, it doesn't mean we're all right-winged.
[2:17:19.580 --> 2:17:21.580]  Neocons.
[2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:30.580]  See, one thing interests me, and that was the buy play of last Friday and Monday.
[2:17:30.580 --> 2:17:36.580]  Like you, I have very good sources in the New York Police Department.
[2:17:36.580 --> 2:17:48.580]  They assured me that the treasure trove of 650,000 documents that were found on the Huma Abedin Anthony Wiener server
[2:17:48.580 --> 2:17:52.580]  were political and legal dynamite.
[2:17:52.580 --> 2:17:56.580]  I mean, just evidence of treason, evidence of corruption, evidence of crime.
[2:17:56.580 --> 2:17:57.580]  Sex compromising.
[2:17:57.580 --> 2:18:02.580]  Evidence of pay for play, evidence of sexual blackmail, and so on.
[2:18:02.580 --> 2:18:09.580]  So how is it that the FBI director, who took months to go through 33,000 emails,
[2:18:09.580 --> 2:18:12.580]  could say, Oh, we've been through all this and there's nothing-
[2:18:12.580 --> 2:18:15.580]  Well, that's my next question for both of you. I was told by sources-
[2:18:15.580 --> 2:18:16.580]  And why did no one-
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:21.580]  That they told Hillary, you better not try to steal it, because we're going to bring all this out.
[2:18:21.580 --> 2:18:24.580]  Roger has a key point that I will answer.
[2:18:24.580 --> 2:18:34.580]  Roger understands this because we've been in several administrations. Fear and collusion are one of the greatest dynamics that you have in politics.
[2:18:34.580 --> 2:18:40.580]  And the Clintons were able to collude with Loretta Lynch and James Comey.
[2:18:40.580 --> 2:18:48.580]  The reason why Roger, he had to come out is because thanks to our military people, our people in the intelligence community,
[2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:52.580]  who were sick and tired of his acquiescence, of Comey's acquiescence,
[2:18:52.580 --> 2:18:56.580]  they allowed a lot of the emails to go literally right through WikiLeaks,
[2:18:56.580 --> 2:19:00.580]  and we have to give a kudo to Julian Assange, who really-
[2:19:00.580 --> 2:19:04.580]  Who is the MVP? I mean, is Julian Assange even more key? I mean, Trump's the MVP.
[2:19:04.580 --> 2:19:05.580]  Who is the MVP?
[2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:07.580]  Roger's an MVP. How do you-
[2:19:07.580 --> 2:19:16.580]  I mean, if I were Trump, I would give him a part and ask him to come to the United States and give him American citizenship.
[2:19:16.580 --> 2:19:18.580]  Isn't it time to bring Snowden back?
[2:19:18.580 --> 2:19:20.580]  That's a different issue.
[2:19:20.580 --> 2:19:25.580]  I agree. That's a different issue, but I agree with you on Assange. I would offer him a pardon.
[2:19:25.580 --> 2:19:29.580]  Look, they threatened to kill this guy. They threatened to drone him.
[2:19:29.580 --> 2:19:35.580]  They put pressure on the British government to actually withdraw the diplomatic recognition of Ecuador
[2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:39.580]  so they could rush the embassy and arrest him because he was the man with the-
[2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:43.580]  All right, guys. Stay there. We're going to come back. I want to ask you guys quick questions, quick answers.
[2:19:43.580 --> 2:19:47.580]  How do they strike back? This nest of globalists, George Soros and others.
[2:19:47.580 --> 2:19:52.580]  I know we're all celebrating here, but I mean, we just won a big battle, but we're still, you know, got more attack ships coming.
[2:19:52.580 --> 2:20:18.580]  And so I want to win. I want to win it all. Stay with us.

[2:22:54.580 --> 2:23:23.580]  Let's fiction.
[2:23:25.580 --> 2:23:28.580]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[2:23:28.580 --> 2:23:34.580]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[2:23:34.580 --> 2:23:38.580]  But now, one planet nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.
[2:23:38.580 --> 2:23:44.580]  Nanocurcumin, a nanoparticle curcumin which absorbs over 40 times better into your bloodstream.

[2:24:20.580 --> 2:24:25.580]  Obviously, Julian Assange breaks it and Nigel Farage and that breaking away.
[2:24:25.580 --> 2:24:27.580]  It's like planets aligning.
[2:24:27.580 --> 2:24:31.580]  Stuff Roger Stone did behind the scenes is epic, the intelligence community, the patriots.
[2:24:31.580 --> 2:24:41.580]  But I gotta say, Julian Assange, I think hands down, Julian Assange, just the WikiLeaks and that ties in the intelligence community and patriots, and whistleblowing.
[2:24:41.580 --> 2:24:45.580]  I think whistleblowers are the MVPs.
[2:24:45.580 --> 2:24:48.580]  And so when I say Assange, he's the arc type of that.
[2:24:48.580 --> 2:24:52.580]  But really, it is those whistleblowers are the MVPs.
[2:24:52.580 --> 2:24:56.580]  Giving us a window into these nasty, globalist activities.
[2:24:56.580 --> 2:24:58.580]  Bringing salt to the earth.
[2:24:58.580 --> 2:25:01.580]  You know, absolutely bringing the truth out.
[2:25:01.580 --> 2:25:03.580]  Dr. Steve Pacinic, you think that's an accurate statement.
[2:25:03.580 --> 2:25:07.580]  The MVPs and this revolution against tyranny are the whistleblowers.
[2:25:07.580 --> 2:25:09.580]  Well, let me be frank.
[2:25:09.580 --> 2:25:13.580]  I think all of you are the MVPs.
[2:25:13.580 --> 2:25:20.580]  That Julian is part and parcel of a revolution that started way before Julian even knew this revolution was there.
[2:25:20.580 --> 2:25:29.580]  And quite frankly, it's you and others who sat there in the alternative media, which was called the alternative media,
[2:25:29.580 --> 2:25:34.580]  which will now become the mainstream media because the mainstream media is finished.
[2:25:34.580 --> 2:25:37.580]  What happened in this revolution are several things.
[2:25:37.580 --> 2:25:39.580]  Number one, the mainstream media is finished.
[2:25:39.580 --> 2:25:42.580]  The Clinton Foundation will be disbanded.
[2:25:42.580 --> 2:25:44.580]  Stop it. We're not just saying this.
[2:25:44.580 --> 2:25:46.580]  We now have to really up our game.
[2:25:46.580 --> 2:25:49.580]  They're gone. This is really happening.
[2:25:49.580 --> 2:25:53.580]  It's happening, but nobody's gone until they're gone.
[2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:57.580]  And remember, even in the French Revolution, it got out of control.
[2:25:57.580 --> 2:26:04.580]  And one of the reasons that I have to be very careful about what we say and do is that we need to put in place
[2:26:04.580 --> 2:26:08.580]  what Reagan had in place and what Nixon had in place.
[2:26:08.580 --> 2:26:15.580]  Trump has a very effective team of very bright individuals who are not just loyalists, but who can implement.
[2:26:15.580 --> 2:26:18.580]  Now, Trump has a very effective team.
[2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:20.580]  That's right. Everybody wants to celebrate.
[2:26:20.580 --> 2:26:22.580]  OK, let's celebrate by winning.
[2:26:22.580 --> 2:26:24.580]  Roger, real quick, and then you get to ride shotgun with us.
[2:26:24.580 --> 2:26:26.580]  I mean, just real fast. It's 60 seconds each.
[2:26:26.580 --> 2:26:30.580]  What does Trump do next exactly to make sure they don't undermine him?
[2:26:30.580 --> 2:26:33.580]  I think you should stop all these dangerous public events for a while.
[2:26:33.580 --> 2:26:36.580]  We need to get in first because I think they're going to try to kill him.
[2:26:36.580 --> 2:26:39.580]  I have a concern about his personal security.
[2:26:39.580 --> 2:26:42.580]  I pray for his safety, as does my family.
[2:26:42.580 --> 2:26:48.580]  But above all, he needs to be careful to choose people who reflect his views.
[2:26:48.580 --> 2:26:54.580]  This is the section, Steve, you've seen this, where they come out of the woodwork, the job seekers,
[2:26:54.580 --> 2:27:00.580]  the courtiers, the brown nosers, the bootleckers, and they explain to you how helpful they were to you
[2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:03.580]  when, in fact, they did nothing to help you get elected.
[2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:06.580]  You're going to get infiltrated. It's not just, I suck.
[2:27:06.580 --> 2:27:10.580]  Roger is absolutely correct. And he mentioned the one particular group, the Neil Conservatives,
[2:27:10.580 --> 2:27:15.580]  the ones who came out, like Steve Hadley, Richard Perle, Wolfowitz, Sandy Berger,
[2:27:15.580 --> 2:27:19.580]  a whole group of them who were exceedingly dangerous under Bush.
[2:27:19.580 --> 2:27:23.580]  Junior, who came out and said, we want to make America number one.
[2:27:23.580 --> 2:27:26.580]  They're the folks working with the Islamists that blew up the talks.
[2:27:26.580 --> 2:27:30.580]  Now they are very dangerous. They cannot be in this administration.
[2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:35.580]  And that's kind of a warning to everyone that there will be no neocons involved,
[2:27:35.580 --> 2:27:41.580]  including ancillary individuals, particularly in the Defense Department and the National Security Area.
[2:27:41.580 --> 2:27:45.580]  It cannot happen. And Roger understands this, and I understand it.
[2:27:45.580 --> 2:27:52.580]  This revolution really came out as a revolution against the neocons and what happened in 9-11.
[2:27:52.580 --> 2:27:56.580]  Let me ask you this. I do want to go to the MVP question because it's important.
[2:27:56.580 --> 2:28:01.580]  There's somebody who isn't on our list so far, because I agree with you, Alex,
[2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:04.580]  that Drudge, a crucial player here in what happened.
[2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:05.580]  Breitbart.
[2:28:05.580 --> 2:28:06.580]  Breitbart.
[2:28:06.580 --> 2:28:07.580]  Bannon.
[2:28:07.580 --> 2:28:12.580]  But Steve Bannon, more than anyone else, who had an acute understanding of the new media,
[2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:19.580]  something the campaign lacked until he joined, I and I have missed communications with him this morning.
[2:28:19.580 --> 2:28:22.580]  But I think he should be the chief of staff.
[2:28:22.580 --> 2:28:26.580]  When I reach him, I'm going to urge him to seek that job.
[2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:32.580]  I think he has the big picture viewpoint that Trump needs.
[2:28:32.580 --> 2:28:35.580]  He knows exactly who the bad guys are.
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:41.580]  He knows exactly who those who really helped win this victory are.
[2:28:41.580 --> 2:28:43.580]  He should run the henhouse.
[2:28:43.580 --> 2:28:49.580]  And he understands the value of Infowars.com and the fact that Alex has been the tip of the spear.
[2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:52.580]  Alex has been resistance central.
[2:28:52.580 --> 2:28:56.580]  He is deeply appreciative of everything that's happened here.
[2:28:56.580 --> 2:29:02.580]  He is the right man to be the gatekeeper, because the gatekeeper, as Steve knows, is crucial.
[2:29:02.580 --> 2:29:07.580]  Who gets in to see the president, whose paper gets on the president's desk, is now crucial.
[2:29:07.580 --> 2:29:09.580]  And that's why they're crapping their drawers.
[2:29:09.580 --> 2:29:11.580]  We'll come back with Pachett and give him the floor and then let him go.
[2:29:11.580 --> 2:29:15.580]  That's why they're crapping their drawers, because Steve Bannon is a patriot.
[2:29:15.580 --> 2:29:17.580]  He knows cutting taxes will help people.
[2:29:17.580 --> 2:29:19.580]  He knows he's an American.
[2:29:19.580 --> 2:29:22.580]  I mean, that's all we want is just somebody, and so they're crapping their pants.
[2:29:22.580 --> 2:29:26.580]  We'll see what Pachett thinks is most important straight ahead and what the next chapter of this is,
[2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:28.580]  because everybody wants to celebrate and that's great.
[2:29:28.580 --> 2:29:32.580]  But, you know, if you're celebrating this win, we're going to lose the next war.
[2:29:32.580 --> 2:29:34.580]  Everybody can celebrate. That's wonderful.
[2:29:34.580 --> 2:29:37.580]  But I love this so much, we have to win the next 10 battles.
[2:29:37.580 --> 2:29:41.580]  And it gets easier as we tap in the 1776 power.
[2:29:41.580 --> 2:29:42.580]  Stay with us.
[2:29:42.580 --> 2:29:45.580]  It's got problems. You've got to kneel to it.
[2:29:45.580 --> 2:29:49.580]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:49.580 --> 2:30:18.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:19.580 --> 2:30:25.580]  Well, this news comes amid speculation that Hillary and her army of trolls could be in severe trouble legally speaking,
[2:30:25.580 --> 2:30:28.580]  as Trump alluded to in the second debate, saying on October 10th,
[2:30:28.580 --> 2:30:34.580]  if I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,
[2:30:34.580 --> 2:30:38.580]  because there's never been so many lies, so much deception.
[2:30:38.580 --> 2:30:44.580]  Well, Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, says that they're not ruling out a special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton.
[2:30:44.580 --> 2:30:48.580]  It's just all in due time. Right now, the focus is on the country's unity.
[2:30:48.580 --> 2:30:53.580]  Well, we're all waiting patiently to see Hillary Clinton receive justice for her endless corruption.
[2:30:53.580 --> 2:31:18.580]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:31:23.580 --> 2:31:47.580]  I'm Robert Hell reporting for Infowars.com.

[2:33:59.580 --> 2:34:03.580]  Well, I tell you, a lot of great things are happening right now.
[2:34:03.580 --> 2:34:07.580]  We have the Albion Sword.
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:13.580]  I mean, this is the Republic. This is the New Atlantis. That's what our founders tried to create.
[2:34:13.580 --> 2:34:16.580]  It was a system to be based on liberty and freedom.
[2:34:16.580 --> 2:34:19.580]  The West is where the liberty came from.
[2:34:19.580 --> 2:34:26.580]  And now we have the social justice warriors and the social engineers trying to shut that down because they can't compete with real liberalism.
[2:34:26.580 --> 2:34:29.580]  And they've changed all the terms and scrambled it all.
[2:34:29.580 --> 2:34:33.580]  But this is a really last chance, I think.
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:36.580]  Trump has to deliver. I want to ask Dr. Pachennick this and then you, Roger.
[2:34:36.580 --> 2:34:38.580]  And then we're going to get Larry Nichols on.
[2:34:38.580 --> 2:34:40.580]  Trump has to deliver.
[2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:42.580]  But what is delivering?
[2:34:42.580 --> 2:34:45.580]  And what else does he do to surround himself? You're absolutely right.
[2:34:45.580 --> 2:34:53.580]  With the generals, not the PR BSers and not the folks who want to be on red carpets and fly around with a bunch of jackasses and rock stars.
[2:34:53.580 --> 2:34:58.580]  We need real men and women that are dedicated to the return of America.
[2:34:58.580 --> 2:35:01.580]  Dr. Pachennick.
[2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:07.580]  What he needs to do is to first appoint those people who can clean out the system.
[2:35:07.580 --> 2:35:12.580]  In particular, you have to go into the FBI again. You have to go into the Justice Department.
[2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:23.580]  If Giuliani comes in, I remember him under the Reagan administration, he did a formidable job against all the banking elites, Drexel Burnham and others.
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:29.580]  If he comes in, then the IRS has to be re-evaluated and reconfigured.
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:38.580]  And then if the sheriff comes in to do Homeland Security, that would be important to clean it out and reconstitute it.
[2:35:38.580 --> 2:35:45.580]  So you're going to have to decrease the size of our government. You have to have people, what I used to do and still do is a sweeper.
[2:35:45.580 --> 2:35:51.580]  You come in and you clean out every institution and not give that individual a particular job.
[2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:55.580]  He comes in, he sweeps it out and basically reconstitutes it very quickly.
[2:35:55.580 --> 2:35:59.580]  I did it under Reagan administration, I did it under the other administrations.
[2:35:59.580 --> 2:36:03.580]  But you need that kind of fixer or sweeper that Roger knows about.
[2:36:03.580 --> 2:36:07.580]  And we go in there and we tighten it from the White House.
[2:36:07.580 --> 2:36:16.580]  Nixon had a very effective team in the White House so that when they came in and they overran the bureaucracy, he knew exactly what was happening.
[2:36:16.580 --> 2:36:18.580]  And is that why the elite hated Nixon?
[2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:20.580]  I think Steve has put his finger on it.
[2:36:20.580 --> 2:36:33.580]  Immediately after the 1972 election, Nixon went to Camp David, took his top aides with him and they just hunkered down for a week and wrote a plan to completely clean out the federal bureaucracy.
[2:36:33.580 --> 2:36:39.580]  Top to bottom, CIA, FBI, Justice Department, particularly all the social agencies.
[2:36:39.580 --> 2:36:42.580]  This is what scared the Washington establishment.
[2:36:42.580 --> 2:36:45.580]  This is a major factor in the takedown of Nixon.
[2:36:45.580 --> 2:36:48.580]  He threatened the bureaucracy like he was actually acting like a president.
[2:36:48.580 --> 2:36:49.580]  Never before.
[2:36:49.580 --> 2:36:56.580]  He didn't feel he had the mandate to do it in the first term where he had been very narrowly elected with less than 50% of the vote.
[2:36:56.580 --> 2:37:00.580]  After the great sweep of 72, he was ready to make his move.
[2:37:00.580 --> 2:37:11.580]  I know I went to the Office of Economic Opportunity to help close down the legal services operation, which had really become a lobbying operation against Nixon.
[2:37:11.580 --> 2:37:12.580]  We're almost out of time.
[2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:16.580]  And here, Roger Shotgun, and we'll have Dr. Pachennick back obviously very, very soon if he wants to join us.
[2:37:16.580 --> 2:37:17.580]  See Pachennick.com.
[2:37:17.580 --> 2:37:19.580]  We've been asking a lot of the questions here.
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:21.580]  What's the big takeaway from this?
[2:37:21.580 --> 2:37:24.580]  What's the next threat, Dr. Pachennick, and any other points?
[2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:27.580]  The next threat is really what do we do next?
[2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:30.580]  It's what Roger said.
[2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:42.580]  Roger and I should go back into the administration and do what we've done in past administrations, which is to sit down, figure out who needs what, who's got to do what, what institutions have to be taken down or downsized.
[2:37:42.580 --> 2:37:44.580]  And it has to be systematic.
[2:37:44.580 --> 2:37:46.580]  It's very much the Trump system.
[2:37:46.580 --> 2:37:47.580]  He has to evaluate.
[2:37:47.580 --> 2:37:48.580]  He has to decide.
[2:37:48.580 --> 2:37:50.580]  And then he has to implement.
[2:37:50.580 --> 2:37:51.580]  It's like building and building.
[2:37:51.580 --> 2:38:00.580]  You have to know what you really need, who you really need, and who can implement it, and it has to be done very quickly so that there's no backlash.
[2:38:00.580 --> 2:38:05.580]  Victory is not declared until you really have a republic that's functioning along the line.
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:06.580]  That's right.
[2:38:06.580 --> 2:38:07.580]  Until it happens, it's just fantasy.
[2:38:07.580 --> 2:38:09.580]  So here's my question.
[2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:13.580]  Look, if I'm the Clintons or I'm Obama, these are nasty, entitled, delusional people.
[2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:16.580]  It's what makes them so dangerous is they're lazy.
[2:38:16.580 --> 2:38:17.580]  They vacation constantly now.
[2:38:17.580 --> 2:38:20.580]  Hillary didn't used to be, but the point is they're bad news.
[2:38:20.580 --> 2:38:21.580]  They're pissed.
[2:38:21.580 --> 2:38:22.580]  They are.
[2:38:22.580 --> 2:38:23.580]  Steven Mad.
[2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:24.580]  Soros is running around.
[2:38:24.580 --> 2:38:26.580]  He's emboldened by all the crimes he's committed, getting away with them.
[2:38:26.580 --> 2:38:37.580]  I mean, how does the, the, the bleeding and wounded Gremlin of the New World Order, Neocons, globalist, how do they strike back at Trump?
[2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:42.580]  I mean, this is like the March on, on, on the Soviet Union.
[2:38:42.580 --> 2:38:46.580]  When, when I helped take it down, there was no rebound.
[2:38:46.580 --> 2:38:51.580]  The rebound came 20, 30 years later under Putin, but we wanted a strong leader.
[2:38:51.580 --> 2:38:57.580]  What we have to worry about is not the rebound that's going to come back from these wounded individuals.
[2:38:57.580 --> 2:38:58.580]  They've been humiliated.
[2:38:58.580 --> 2:39:00.580]  It's not just that they've been knocked out.
[2:39:00.580 --> 2:39:02.580]  They've been totally humiliated.
[2:39:02.580 --> 2:39:08.580]  And as Roger points out, there's really a criminal, strong criminal element to it, which Giuliani can handle.
[2:39:08.580 --> 2:39:10.580]  The real issue now is to look upwards.
[2:39:10.580 --> 2:39:12.580]  Who is Trump going to appoint?
[2:39:12.580 --> 2:39:15.580]  What are the, who are the people that are going to do the cleaning?
[2:39:15.580 --> 2:39:25.580]  Who are the people who are going to run the Republic and how, how much more are we going to decrease the entire bureaucracy so that it functions in effective way?
[2:39:25.580 --> 2:39:27.580]  That's the key element for us right now.
[2:39:27.580 --> 2:39:30.580]  They can come back any way they want, but they're scattered.
[2:39:30.580 --> 2:39:31.580]  They're fearful.
[2:39:31.580 --> 2:39:32.580]  They're bleeding.
[2:39:32.580 --> 2:39:34.580]  You don't glow at this point.
[2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:42.580]  What you do is reconcil date, you reconstitute and then move on and then move on to the system and start to take it apart.
[2:39:42.580 --> 2:39:47.580]  Mike, I mean, isn't it more dangerous to leave the Clintons with all their blackmail data and everything in place?
[2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:49.580]  I'll leave it up to Giuliani.
[2:39:49.580 --> 2:39:50.580]  He was a great prosecutor.
[2:39:50.580 --> 2:39:51.580]  You found a Reagan.
[2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:53.580]  I used to say the Drexel Burnham.
[2:39:53.580 --> 2:40:03.580]  You have Mike Milken for 600 million on the cover of Time magazine, but I got a young man who's making 60,000 named Giuliani and then Drexel.
[2:40:03.580 --> 2:40:06.580]  The head of Drexel said to me, oh, no, we've got great lawyers.
[2:40:06.580 --> 2:40:08.580]  I said, you're not going to be around.
[2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:11.580]  And I said the $60,000 lawyer Giuliani is going to take down.
[2:40:11.580 --> 2:40:13.580]  You're $600 million Milken.
[2:40:13.580 --> 2:40:14.580]  And he did it.
[2:40:14.580 --> 2:40:16.580]  I'm not worried about that.
[2:40:16.580 --> 2:40:21.580]  The criminal prosecution will go along the lines of what Giuliani needs to do and Trump wants to do.
[2:40:21.580 --> 2:40:25.580]  What really has to be done, 90% of this is not about vindictiveness.
[2:40:25.580 --> 2:40:26.580]  Roger knows that.
[2:40:26.580 --> 2:40:30.580]  I know that even Nixon wasn't as vindictive as people claim.
[2:40:30.580 --> 2:40:33.580]  He instead implemented the foreign policy.
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:34.580]  Well, here's the deal.
[2:40:34.580 --> 2:40:40.580]  I'm not going to leave a bunch of traders that have sold us out seven ways to Sunday that are my personal enemy in place.
[2:40:40.580 --> 2:40:41.580]  I can't sleep at night.
[2:40:41.580 --> 2:40:45.580]  There would be a moron and Trump would be an idiot if we don't go for the jugular.
[2:40:45.580 --> 2:40:48.580]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not a question.
[2:40:48.580 --> 2:40:50.580]  What I'm saying is you put them in prison.
[2:40:50.580 --> 2:40:57.580]  You put in place all the necessary legal consequences of their behavior.
[2:40:57.580 --> 2:41:00.580]  That's not the key issue now is to move on.
[2:41:00.580 --> 2:41:01.580]  No, I agree.
[2:41:01.580 --> 2:41:03.580]  Throw their ass in prison when they get a jury trial and move on.
[2:41:03.580 --> 2:41:04.580]  We'll talk soon.
[2:41:04.580 --> 2:41:06.580]  I think this should be, you know, it up to Giuliani.
[2:41:06.580 --> 2:41:07.580]  He knows prosecution.
[2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:09.580]  He understands what it means to prosecute.
[2:41:09.580 --> 2:41:11.580]  He knows what it would.
[2:41:11.580 --> 2:41:12.580]  I'll say this.
[2:41:12.580 --> 2:41:14.580]  I've had issues with Giuliani, but he has called her a crook.
[2:41:14.580 --> 2:41:15.580]  He has said she has to be.
[2:41:15.580 --> 2:41:19.580]  I mean, I'm not worried about it because he has already stated publicly what he would do.
[2:41:19.580 --> 2:41:22.580]  Trump has stated publicly what he's going to do.
[2:41:22.580 --> 2:41:30.580]  What we need to do is to maintain, to make sure that the Department of Defense has a salient capability to do what it needs to do.
[2:41:30.580 --> 2:41:32.580]  That our intelligence community is effective.
[2:41:32.580 --> 2:41:35.580]  Do we really need 16 units in the intelligence unit?
[2:41:35.580 --> 2:41:37.580]  I don't think so.
[2:41:37.580 --> 2:41:39.580]  All right, Dr. Pachennick, we're out of time.
[2:41:39.580 --> 2:41:40.580]  StevePachennick.com.
[2:41:40.580 --> 2:41:41.580]  Thank you so much.
[2:41:41.580 --> 2:41:42.580]  Thank you.
[2:41:42.580 --> 2:41:43.580]  History has happened.
[2:41:43.580 --> 2:41:48.580]  Now, Stone is going to get some lunch and then he's going to be back with us co-hosting.
[2:41:48.580 --> 2:41:50.580]  We've decided to not do 52 hours.
[2:41:50.580 --> 2:41:54.580]  We've decided to just go right through as late as the crew wants to.
[2:41:54.580 --> 2:41:57.580]  And let me tell you, they're all getting bonuses.
[2:41:57.580 --> 2:42:00.580]  Talk about MVPs, the American people taking action.
[2:42:00.580 --> 2:42:08.580]  Speaking out, Hispanic Trump supporters who have been demonized and attacked, black Trump supporters, people have gone through hell.
[2:42:08.580 --> 2:42:11.580]  And I'll tell you what has happened now.
[2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:15.580]  I always just hire whoever does the best job.
[2:42:15.580 --> 2:42:20.580]  And I found of every color, there's great people.
[2:42:20.580 --> 2:42:26.580]  But I say when liberal media comes here, they go, half people here aren't white.
[2:42:26.580 --> 2:42:27.580]  What's going on?
[2:42:27.580 --> 2:42:32.580]  I'm like, yeah, and I know over at NPR, it's all white people.
[2:42:32.580 --> 2:42:38.580]  We hire off what somebody's able to do with their credentials and then how they operate.
[2:42:38.580 --> 2:42:40.580]  I don't look at what color their skin is.
[2:42:40.580 --> 2:42:42.580]  That's why I've been called racist.
[2:42:42.580 --> 2:42:45.580]  It's not that they're guilting me and have power over me.
[2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:50.580]  It pisses me off because I'm not racist.
[2:42:50.580 --> 2:42:53.580]  Now, are there stereotypes of groups of people?
[2:42:53.580 --> 2:42:56.580]  Yeah, if you're a Dairy Queen in East Texas and you're with a good-looking woman,
[2:42:56.580 --> 2:42:59.580]  and guys brawl in with a rebel flag, one of them is probably, you know,
[2:42:59.580 --> 2:43:02.580]  and the rebel flag is not a bad flag, but a bunch of guys act tough.
[2:43:02.580 --> 2:43:05.580]  They might smart off to you because they're much thugs.
[2:43:05.580 --> 2:43:06.580]  They're white guys.
[2:43:06.580 --> 2:43:07.580]  They're thugs.
[2:43:07.580 --> 2:43:08.580]  They're gang members.
[2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:11.580]  Don't you black guys pull up all acting thug dialysis to music?
[2:43:11.580 --> 2:43:12.580]  You're the hot girl?
[2:43:12.580 --> 2:43:13.580]  They're going to say something.
[2:43:13.580 --> 2:43:15.580]  Those black thugs or they white thugs?
[2:43:15.580 --> 2:43:17.580]  They're just thugs, folks.
[2:43:17.580 --> 2:43:19.580]  You see a thug a mile away.
[2:43:19.580 --> 2:43:21.580]  And that's, I'm like Martin Luther King.
[2:43:21.580 --> 2:43:25.580]  When I say that, I don't mean I'm like him being this big hero who got killed and all the rest of it.
[2:43:25.580 --> 2:43:27.580]  I mean, I go off what you do.
[2:43:27.580 --> 2:43:30.580]  I mean, if you've got a restaurant and black people on it,
[2:43:30.580 --> 2:43:37.580]  and it's got the best, you know, southern cooking in town, which is in East Austin,
[2:43:37.580 --> 2:43:38.580]  I'm in there.
[2:43:38.580 --> 2:43:40.580]  I care less what color they are.
[2:43:40.580 --> 2:43:43.580]  Hell, I've even gone to restaurants I know are owned by racist black people
[2:43:43.580 --> 2:43:45.580]  because I got the best damn barbecue.
[2:43:45.580 --> 2:43:50.580]  I mean, you know, I'm here for the music.
[2:43:50.580 --> 2:43:51.580]  I'm here for the food.
[2:43:51.580 --> 2:43:52.580]  I'm here for the camaraderie.
[2:43:52.580 --> 2:43:56.580]  I'm here to hang a go fishing with somebody no matter what color they are, if they're cool.
[2:43:56.580 --> 2:44:00.580]  And this whole leftist thing is about making us all hate each other
[2:44:00.580 --> 2:44:07.580]  instead of being based on basic ideas as they rob our entire birthright and everything we are.
[2:44:07.580 --> 2:44:10.580]  And that's what makes me so mad.
[2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:13.580]  You know, how they try to make everybody uncomfortable,
[2:44:13.580 --> 2:44:15.580]  how they try to make people not get along with each other.
[2:44:15.580 --> 2:44:17.580]  They're the race baiters.
[2:44:17.580 --> 2:44:18.580]  They're not even racist.
[2:44:18.580 --> 2:44:22.580]  They're scientifically using this to control us and it pisses me off.
[2:44:22.580 --> 2:44:27.580]  Listen, the future of this country is Hispanics.
[2:44:27.580 --> 2:44:33.580]  Half the kids in what, I think it's ninth grade and below now are Hispanic in this country.
[2:44:33.580 --> 2:44:36.580]  In 10 years, it'll be 75%.
[2:44:36.580 --> 2:44:38.580]  I don't, that's fine with me.
[2:44:38.580 --> 2:44:41.580]  White people killed all their kids, as I said earlier.
[2:44:41.580 --> 2:44:49.580]  I just want the Hispanics to adopt the Second Amendment, private property, wealth and success and freedom.
[2:44:49.580 --> 2:44:58.580]  And not be spoon-fed up by a bunch of weird, evil, hunchback pieces of crap in, you know, New York and D.C. that think you're idiots.
[2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:02.580]  I mean, it pisses me off when people I know do a Nigerian scam.
[2:45:02.580 --> 2:45:05.580]  They think they're really getting money from somebody.
[2:45:05.580 --> 2:45:07.580]  And I tell them, that's a Nigerian scam.
[2:45:07.580 --> 2:45:09.580]  And they go, no, you're just jealous.
[2:45:09.580 --> 2:45:11.580]  I know Prince Boo Boo.
[2:45:11.580 --> 2:45:12.580]  And it's the same thing.
[2:45:12.580 --> 2:45:15.580]  No, you're going to get more money and then you're going to get ripped off.
[2:45:15.580 --> 2:45:17.580]  They don't want to believe they're being conned.
[2:45:17.580 --> 2:45:22.580]  And the folks I know that have done, you know, been ripped off by Nigerian scams are white people.
[2:45:22.580 --> 2:45:28.580]  The point is, I told the story that I'm going to our guest, I'll hold it in the next hour if need be,
[2:45:28.580 --> 2:45:32.580]  because I don't want to cut Larry Nichols' story, because he's been so central part of this.
[2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:36.580]  And we got Roger Stone coming back in after he eats Texas barbecue.
[2:45:36.580 --> 2:45:42.580]  But what I'm getting at here is, these are people who are black, white, Hispanic,
[2:45:42.580 --> 2:45:53.580]  German, Jewish, Chinese, Japanese, you know, Nigerian, who are just bad people.
[2:45:53.580 --> 2:45:54.580]  They'll say I'm bashing Nigerians.
[2:45:54.580 --> 2:45:55.580]  No, that's just a well-known scam.
[2:45:55.580 --> 2:45:56.580]  It's an example.
[2:45:56.580 --> 2:45:57.580]  I've told the story.
[2:45:57.580 --> 2:46:01.580]  I'm out listening to rockabilly music with my judge, not name dropping.
[2:46:01.580 --> 2:46:02.580]  That's who I was out with.
[2:46:02.580 --> 2:46:04.580]  And everybody goes, oh my God, the princes are here.
[2:46:04.580 --> 2:46:06.580]  And then these guys pull up this whole Cadillac.
[2:46:06.580 --> 2:46:09.580]  And it's this rockabilly place where all the trainees go to.
[2:46:09.580 --> 2:46:10.580]  It's a former black bar.
[2:46:10.580 --> 2:46:11.580]  It's still about half black.
[2:46:11.580 --> 2:46:12.580]  We're out there about 2 a.m.
[2:46:12.580 --> 2:46:14.580]  This is years ago.
[2:46:14.580 --> 2:46:16.580]  And listen to this music.
[2:46:16.580 --> 2:46:19.580]  And these guys walk in on these outfits, and everybody's just kissing their ass,
[2:46:19.580 --> 2:46:20.580]  giving them free drinks and everything.
[2:46:20.580 --> 2:46:22.580]  And they're like, that's royalty.
[2:46:22.580 --> 2:46:23.580]  And I said, no, that's not.
[2:46:23.580 --> 2:46:24.580]  That's a freaking scam.
[2:46:24.580 --> 2:46:30.580]  And I had to go over and say to them, I said, you guys go around all day like you're royalty.
[2:46:30.580 --> 2:46:33.580]  And I said, that's basically what government does, or Queen Elizabeth does.
[2:46:33.580 --> 2:46:35.580]  Kim Jong-un is royalty.
[2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:36.580]  He's third generation dictator.
[2:46:36.580 --> 2:46:38.580]  It's all as disgusting.
[2:46:38.580 --> 2:46:40.580]  And that's why I don't want people to put on fronts.
[2:46:40.580 --> 2:46:43.580]  And I'm here to tell you, the Democratic Party is a Nigerian scam.
[2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:46.580]  I mean, the whole, I don't mean literally Nigerian scam.
[2:46:46.580 --> 2:46:49.580]  It's all a big joke.
[2:46:49.580 --> 2:46:51.580]  And it's time for it to come down.
[2:46:51.580 --> 2:46:52.580]  It's time for it to fail.
[2:46:52.580 --> 2:46:54.580]  It's time for it to fall apart.
[2:46:54.580 --> 2:47:01.580]  And it's time for all of us to deliver on prosecuting the Clintons, deliver on tax cuts,
[2:47:01.580 --> 2:47:05.580]  deliver on spending cuts, deliver on detain.
[2:47:05.580 --> 2:47:06.580]  This is beautiful.
[2:47:06.580 --> 2:47:08.580]  Trump means no forced inoculations.
[2:47:08.580 --> 2:47:10.580]  Trump means cities pulling flour out of the water.
[2:47:10.580 --> 2:47:11.580]  Oh yeah, he's on board.
[2:47:11.580 --> 2:47:15.580]  Trump means we've got somebody, they're going to try to block, but he's going to try with
[2:47:15.580 --> 2:47:20.580]  his bully pulpit to deliver everything we want that's constitutional.
[2:47:20.580 --> 2:47:22.580]  That's a big deal.
[2:47:22.580 --> 2:47:23.580]  Don't want war with Russia.
[2:47:23.580 --> 2:47:24.580]  Don't want to fund jihadis.
[2:47:24.580 --> 2:47:30.580]  Don't want to bring in unvetted people with syphilis or TB or fricking cholera or leprosy.
[2:47:30.580 --> 2:47:33.580]  You want Trump.
[2:47:33.580 --> 2:47:36.580]  Trump doesn't want to blow our brains out.
[2:47:36.580 --> 2:47:41.580]  Trump isn't at satanic meetings with weird old women drinking blood.
[2:47:41.580 --> 2:47:44.580]  You know, I mean, I'm with a guy that doesn't drink blood.
[2:47:44.580 --> 2:47:45.580]  You know what I mean?
[2:47:45.580 --> 2:47:49.580]  He's not perfect, but he has the courage to take action.
[2:47:49.580 --> 2:47:51.580]  We're going to Larry Nichols and skip this break before I go any further.
[2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:54.580]  I have to tell you about people that make this broadcast spot possible.

[2:48:54.580 --> 2:48:58.580]  Solutions from Science is one of my oldest sponsors and they are selling some
[2:48:58.580 --> 2:49:00.580]  of their perfect power solar generators below cost.
[2:49:00.580 --> 2:49:03.580]  This is their top of the line model, the one I use at my house.
[2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:05.580]  It's expandable so you can make it as powerful as you want to.
[2:49:05.580 --> 2:49:09.580]  Normally around 6,000, they're letting them go for less than 1,500.
[2:49:09.580 --> 2:49:11.580]  I paid 4,000 years ago and I got the discount.
[2:49:11.580 --> 2:49:12.580]  It's a big deal.

[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:22.580]  I'm in the movie, bunch of other great folks.
[2:49:22.580 --> 2:49:24.580]  It exposes everything.
[2:49:24.580 --> 2:49:25.580]  The war goes on.
[2:49:25.580 --> 2:49:26.580]  The fight goes on.
[2:49:26.580 --> 2:49:28.580]  He's in the film Charlie Daniels.
[2:49:28.580 --> 2:49:29.580]  It's powerful.
[2:49:29.580 --> 2:49:31.580]  Cuck Undersea and Army Colonel, great patriot.
[2:49:31.580 --> 2:49:34.580]  He spent his life's fortune, his wife's savings to put this out.
[2:49:34.580 --> 2:49:36.580]  Five years of the making.
[2:49:36.580 --> 2:49:38.580]  This is a powerful film.
[2:49:38.580 --> 2:49:39.580]  It needs to be seen.
[2:49:39.580 --> 2:49:41.580]  Schedule showings in your area.
[2:49:41.580 --> 2:49:42.580]  Get the DVD.
[2:49:42.580 --> 2:49:43.580]  You name it.

[2:49:58.580 --> 2:50:00.580]  All right.
[2:50:00.580 --> 2:50:01.580]  We're going to continue.
[2:50:01.580 --> 2:50:03.580]  Not 50 hours now, but 60 hours.
[2:50:03.580 --> 2:50:04.580]  We're just continuing.
[2:50:04.580 --> 2:50:06.580]  I don't care if it's just one person.
[2:50:06.580 --> 2:50:07.580]  Whoever wants to stay can.
[2:50:07.580 --> 2:50:09.580]  They're getting hazard pay right now.
[2:50:09.580 --> 2:50:11.580]  We're going to continue on today.
[2:50:11.580 --> 2:50:13.580]  Continue on because people are tuned in.
[2:50:13.580 --> 2:50:14.580]  They want to know what's going on.
[2:50:14.580 --> 2:50:15.580]  They're excited.
[2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:17.580]  History's happening.
[2:50:17.580 --> 2:50:23.580]  Again, I am so thankful right now because this is a repudiation of all the fake polling companies.
[2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:27.580]  This is a repudiation of the mainstream media.
[2:50:27.580 --> 2:50:28.580]  Beth Harris comes on.
[2:50:28.580 --> 2:50:29.580]  Big liberal.
[2:50:29.580 --> 2:50:30.580]  They try to steal it from Trump last night.
[2:50:30.580 --> 2:50:32.580]  The tsunami win was so big they failed.
[2:50:32.580 --> 2:50:35.580]  The tsunami win was so big they failed.
[2:50:35.580 --> 2:50:37.580]  But they're going to strike back.
[2:50:37.580 --> 2:50:41.580]  Larry Nichols, we have seen the fall of the Clintons at least so far.
[2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:44.580]  Let's talk about how they may counter strike.
[2:50:44.580 --> 2:50:46.580]  You predicted that they would no bill them.
[2:50:46.580 --> 2:50:51.580]  You predicted they would come out the day before the election or two days before and say that they'd done nothing wrong.
[2:50:51.580 --> 2:50:54.580]  But despite all that, they failed.
[2:50:54.580 --> 2:50:57.580]  I think it's very telling that former Clinton Insider.
[2:50:57.580 --> 2:51:06.580]  I think it's very telling Larry Nichols that they would not concede that night in a press conference.
[2:51:06.580 --> 2:51:08.580]  You're probably too sick to.
[2:51:08.580 --> 2:51:12.580]  That they did it the next day and that they weren't as conciliatory as Trump.
[2:51:12.580 --> 2:51:18.580]  Do you talk about that A and then B, whoever's on your plate, do you agree with me that they're insane?
[2:51:18.580 --> 2:51:31.580]  Trump isn't, well, she's not, and his entire crew, they are leaving a rattlesnake in their bed if they do not route the Clintons and their entire crime syndicate, including the Neocons, immediately.
[2:51:31.580 --> 2:51:38.580]  You know, Alex, if Donald Trump doesn't go all the way, he's a fool.
[2:51:38.580 --> 2:51:40.580]  He's an absolute fool.
[2:51:40.580 --> 2:51:43.580]  These people like the plague.
[2:51:43.580 --> 2:51:49.580]  You may get a case solved, but unless you kill the plague, it's not going to go away.
[2:51:49.580 --> 2:51:51.580]  It's not going to go away.
[2:51:51.580 --> 2:52:02.580]  But what they're working on, I will bet you $100 to biscuit what they did last night that delayed their announcement or concession.
[2:52:02.580 --> 2:52:18.580]  And she was checking with Obama, checking to make sure that everything was in place since they were having to face defeat, making sure that he had her covered with the pardon, making sure that the Clinton Foundation was covered with the pardon.
[2:52:18.580 --> 2:52:21.580]  And then they're making their plans today.
[2:52:21.580 --> 2:52:24.580]  They're not making their plans to ride off.
[2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:28.580]  They're not planning to go away and disappear.
[2:52:28.580 --> 2:52:39.580]  You've got to remember they made large promises, large promises to people that have put billions of dollars into that foundation.
[2:52:39.580 --> 2:52:42.580]  They can't walk away from that.
[2:52:42.580 --> 2:52:44.580]  So no, it's not over.
[2:52:44.580 --> 2:52:53.580]  Now, what Donald Trump's got to do, and I wish everybody in this audience would do it, send him a letter.
[2:52:53.580 --> 2:53:01.580]  Send Donald Trump a letter and remind him of all the things that he promised that he would do if he became president.
[2:53:01.580 --> 2:53:03.580]  I'm talking about build the wall.
[2:53:03.580 --> 2:53:11.580]  I'm talking about stopping this madness of these unvetted Syrians coming in by the thousands.
[2:53:11.580 --> 2:53:13.580]  He's got to hold to that promise.
[2:53:13.580 --> 2:53:16.580]  You know, he's been elected.
[2:53:16.580 --> 2:53:19.580]  But there's a couple of things I've seen that I don't like.
[2:53:19.580 --> 2:53:27.580]  I'm number one, Paul Ryan, you know, him and Paul Ryan making up, him and Hillary making up all this.
[2:53:27.580 --> 2:53:28.580]  No, I agree.
[2:53:28.580 --> 2:53:30.580]  Paul Ryan has stabbed him in the back three times.
[2:53:30.580 --> 2:53:32.580]  Let me tell you, Trump's smart.
[2:53:32.580 --> 2:53:34.580]  He needs to get in.
[2:53:34.580 --> 2:53:36.580]  I'm not going to give him, he needs to get in.
[2:53:36.580 --> 2:53:38.580]  And they already know it.
[2:53:38.580 --> 2:53:40.580]  So how will they attack him in the next two and a half months, though?
[2:53:40.580 --> 2:53:42.580]  I mean, they're not going to go away quietly.
[2:53:42.580 --> 2:53:52.580]  They've got, Donald Trump is going to run into a Congress that is going to, everything he tries to do, they're going to shut him down.
[2:53:52.580 --> 2:53:54.580]  And he has to go on TV and name the people that are involved.
[2:53:54.580 --> 2:53:57.580]  That's why he has to remove Paul Ryan.
[2:53:57.580 --> 2:54:03.580]  Paul Ryan's head politically should be on a freaking spike in front of the White House.
[2:54:03.580 --> 2:54:13.580]  Paul Ryan has already said that if Donald Trump tries to build that wall, he has a lawsuit waiting.
[2:54:13.580 --> 2:54:16.580]  Already got it prepared, a lawsuit to stop him.
[2:54:16.580 --> 2:54:19.580]  Oh, big freaking deal.
[2:54:19.580 --> 2:54:20.580]  Exactly.
[2:54:20.580 --> 2:54:22.580]  We're allowed to have a damn wall.
[2:54:22.580 --> 2:54:23.580]  Right.
[2:54:23.580 --> 2:54:28.580]  And then Donald Trump's saying that he's going to get rid of all these presidential special orders.
[2:54:28.580 --> 2:54:30.580]  He's going to do special orders to get rid of them.
[2:54:30.580 --> 2:54:32.580]  But let me tell you the problem.
[2:54:32.580 --> 2:54:41.580]  You know this, Alex, when Obama issued every one of those presidential special orders, Congress had 30 days to rescind every damn one of them.
[2:54:41.580 --> 2:54:42.580]  And they didn't.
[2:54:42.580 --> 2:54:45.580]  And they set up funding bureaucracies for each one of the little things.
[2:54:45.580 --> 2:54:46.580]  That's right.
[2:54:46.580 --> 2:54:52.580]  They could have shut every one of them down, but I'll bet you this, when Donald Trump signs a presidential special order,
[2:54:52.580 --> 2:54:56.580]  you bet there's a recension order signed immediately.
[2:54:56.580 --> 2:55:05.580]  No, he's going to fight a Congress that is going to be vicious unless he stands up as he has done and tell the American people.
[2:55:05.580 --> 2:55:06.580]  That's right.
[2:55:06.580 --> 2:55:12.580]  If he is conciliatory, if he plays bold, as you notice, Obama came out today and said, all right, we should all root for Trump.
[2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:13.580]  That's a quote.
[2:55:13.580 --> 2:55:14.580]  We should get behind him.
[2:55:14.580 --> 2:55:16.580]  They're openly now saying, OK, you beat us.
[2:55:16.580 --> 2:55:17.580]  You took over.
[2:55:17.580 --> 2:55:19.580]  We'll leave you alone if you sell out.
[2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:20.580]  No.
[2:55:20.580 --> 2:55:22.580]  Now we're going to find out.
[2:55:22.580 --> 2:55:27.580]  Is Trump did Trump really just want to take over the kingdom or do you want to change the world?
[2:55:27.580 --> 2:55:29.580]  This is where we and I think he's for real.
[2:55:29.580 --> 2:55:30.580]  We're about to find out.
[2:55:30.580 --> 2:55:34.580]  I think he's for real, but we got to make him prove it.
[2:55:34.580 --> 2:55:35.580]  He's got to prove it again.
[2:55:35.580 --> 2:55:36.580]  Just say it.
[2:55:36.580 --> 2:55:46.580]  You know, Alex, listen, you've never seen a time when a moral Christian conservative and a liberal or a communist have negotiated.
[2:55:46.580 --> 2:55:47.580]  You've never seen it.
[2:55:47.580 --> 2:55:52.580]  Whenever negotiations take place, we're just going to shorten it by saying a liberal and a conservative.
[2:55:52.580 --> 2:55:53.580]  It's one-sided.
[2:55:53.580 --> 2:55:56.580]  One-sided every time.
[2:55:56.580 --> 2:56:02.580]  So Trump's got to bring to that White House his business acumen.
[2:56:02.580 --> 2:56:05.580]  He knows what it's like to get into a deal.
[2:56:05.580 --> 2:56:07.580]  He knows what it's like to negotiate.
[2:56:07.580 --> 2:56:17.580]  And I hold him to what he has said he knows how to win in negotiations and he damn well better do it.
[2:56:17.580 --> 2:56:19.580]  Or this whole ride will be short lived.
[2:56:19.580 --> 2:56:27.580]  Alex, it will be the shortest lived trip we've ever seen because they will cut him up in a million pieces.
[2:56:27.580 --> 2:56:28.580]  That's right.
[2:56:28.580 --> 2:56:29.580]  Let's stop right there.
[2:56:29.580 --> 2:56:30.580]  Talk about this though.
[2:56:30.580 --> 2:56:33.580]  Celebration-wise, the mainstream media is dead.
[2:56:33.580 --> 2:56:34.580]  They've destroyed themselves.
[2:56:34.580 --> 2:56:35.580]  They're a joke.
[2:56:35.580 --> 2:56:38.580]  We're going to stop it up because it's an even bigger collapse if they admit it's gone.
[2:56:38.580 --> 2:56:41.580]  Because then it'll just be, oh, we're actually the real media.
[2:56:41.580 --> 2:56:42.580]  Oh my God, these people were fake.
[2:56:42.580 --> 2:56:43.580]  It's all in the WikiLeaks.
[2:56:43.580 --> 2:56:48.580]  But this is a repudiation of the pollsters, the political class, the elites.
[2:56:48.580 --> 2:56:58.580]  This vote, this overriding of the fraud is a indicator, a major blue ribbon victory gauging the level of awakening.
[2:56:58.580 --> 2:57:02.580]  I mean, is it not spectacular Trump aside?
[2:57:02.580 --> 2:57:12.580]  You know, Alex, this is the greatest day for programs networks like yours.
[2:57:12.580 --> 2:57:25.580]  You proved through this network, through Matt Drudge and his internet site, you proved that the truth is out there if somebody's got the courage to cover it.
[2:57:25.580 --> 2:57:32.580]  And I believe that the mainstream media now has humiliated itself.
[2:57:32.580 --> 2:57:35.580]  I don't know who they're going to go to to convince anymore.
[2:57:35.580 --> 2:57:37.580]  Who's going to believe them anymore?
[2:57:37.580 --> 2:57:39.580]  Who's going to believe the polls?
[2:57:39.580 --> 2:57:40.580]  That's right, that's right.
[2:57:40.580 --> 2:57:44.580]  They were already totally discredited at 6% in major studies, AP.
[2:57:44.580 --> 2:57:47.580]  Now they acted like we were crazy that Trump would win.
[2:57:47.580 --> 2:57:49.580]  They are in negative numbers.
[2:57:49.580 --> 2:57:54.580]  They are the discredited joke of the world.
[2:57:54.580 --> 2:58:02.580]  The only way they come back is to lie and to try to put on this facade that they're changing, that they're changing.
[2:58:02.580 --> 2:58:09.580]  And they're going to be more conservative, more fair, that they're going to deal with the news straight up.
[2:58:09.580 --> 2:58:13.580]  But everything I've seen thus far this morning doesn't show me.
[2:58:13.580 --> 2:58:16.580]  Hey, let me tell you, here's an analogy.
[2:58:16.580 --> 2:58:18.580]  We're going to come back, 70 seconds from Larry Nichols.
[2:58:18.580 --> 2:58:24.580]  If I get food poisoning in a restaurant that I've been to for years and I love, I'm never going back there again.
[2:58:24.580 --> 2:58:27.580]  Everything they serve, we get food poisoning from.
[2:58:27.580 --> 2:58:30.580]  So I don't care what they say or what they do.
[2:58:30.580 --> 2:58:33.580]  CNN, Megan Kelly, all of them, you're done.
[2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:34.580]  You're done.
[2:58:34.580 --> 2:58:35.580]  We hate you.
[2:58:35.580 --> 2:58:36.580]  You're pathetic.
[2:58:36.580 --> 2:58:38.580]  We know you're a scumbag, Megan Kelly.
[2:58:38.580 --> 2:58:40.580]  You're done, you little tart.
[2:58:40.580 --> 2:58:42.580]  You are a traitor against this country.
[2:58:42.580 --> 2:58:49.580]  You sack of crap.
[2:59:12.580 --> 2:59:14.580]  Your money in an economic meltdown.
[2:59:14.580 --> 2:59:17.580]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[2:59:17.580 --> 2:59:21.580]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:27.580]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[2:59:27.580 --> 2:59:28.580]  Don't delay.
[2:59:28.580 --> 2:59:35.580]  Call 844-541-ALAX now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins, absolutely free.
[2:59:35.580 --> 2:59:40.580]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[2:59:40.580 --> 2:59:43.580]  You can personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[2:59:43.580 --> 2:59:49.580]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALAX now.
[2:59:49.580 --> 3:00:00.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:00.580 --> 3:00:10.580]  Through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:30.580 --> 3:00:40.580]  What do you expect from the meeting with President Obama on Thursday?
[3:00:40.580 --> 3:00:43.580]  Is there any message that Donald Trump will give to him?
[3:00:43.580 --> 3:00:49.580]  I'll let those two world leaders decide that, Allison.
[3:00:49.580 --> 3:00:53.580]  I think that they will talk about the things they can maybe work on together in the future
[3:00:53.580 --> 3:00:56.580]  and how to build on what success that President Obama has
[3:00:56.580 --> 3:01:00.580]  and frankly how to tackle the infinite to do this that he will leave behind.
[3:01:00.580 --> 3:01:04.580]  I mean, that has to be a priority.
[3:01:04.580 --> 3:01:11.580]  I would note that yesterday's election brought together Republicans in the House, the Senate and the presidency
[3:01:11.580 --> 3:01:15.580]  for all the talk about how Donald Trump is going to drag down the House and Senate.
[3:01:15.580 --> 3:01:19.580]  I mean, good God, how many people sat in your network and said with a straight face,
[3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:24.580]  he was going to cost the Republicans everything not nailed to the ground and said they want everything.
[3:01:24.580 --> 3:01:27.580]  That tells you something about where America wants to go, though.
[3:01:27.580 --> 3:01:33.580]  He's being given a mandate and that mandate is going to be somewhat different than what we've had.
[3:01:33.580 --> 3:01:35.580]  It is a repudiation of some of the things we've had.
[3:01:35.580 --> 3:01:38.580]  That's right. Again, it's total upside down bizarro world.
[3:01:38.580 --> 3:01:42.580]  Larry Nichols, other points that need to be imparted to folks.
[3:01:42.580 --> 3:01:47.580]  Well, Alex, it's actually up to this.
[3:01:47.580 --> 3:01:52.580]  Folks, I'm going to tell you all this is probably the last time you'll need to have me on, Alex.
[3:01:52.580 --> 3:01:59.580]  I guess I'm done. 28 years I have tried to make restitution for something I did.
[3:01:59.580 --> 3:02:01.580]  But I'll leave you with this.
[3:02:01.580 --> 3:02:03.580]  State's rights.
[3:02:03.580 --> 3:02:08.580]  When Donald Trump talks about draining the swamp, there's only one way to drain the swamp,
[3:02:08.580 --> 3:02:13.580]  and it's not to put term limits on Congressmen because they'll never pass it.
[3:02:13.580 --> 3:02:17.580]  What you have to do is you'll have to go to your state and you have to say to your governor,
[3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:23.580]  why don't we pass laws? Why don't we have a legislature when we're going to go into the federal court
[3:02:23.580 --> 3:02:25.580]  and let the federal judge tell you?
[3:02:25.580 --> 3:02:29.580]  You're talking about de-evolution. We've got to transfer power back to the balance, back to the state.
[3:02:29.580 --> 3:02:32.580]  So let's talk about that, but then we will obviously have you back up.
[3:02:32.580 --> 3:02:35.580]  And I also want to say, I know you're battling lung cancer right now,
[3:02:35.580 --> 3:02:39.580]  and you've had some ups and downs, and you've been, all sorts of stuff's happened.
[3:02:39.580 --> 3:02:42.580]  I'm not going to get into it on air, but some idiots are going, oh, that's not real.
[3:02:42.580 --> 3:02:45.580]  We've been there. We've seen the medication. He's sick.
[3:02:45.580 --> 3:02:50.580]  But the whole point is, you also wanted to give a message to the Clintons.
[3:02:50.580 --> 3:02:53.580]  He talks about under that, you know, and let's just get it out there now,
[3:02:53.580 --> 3:02:56.580]  and I'll hold you over if you need to, and then Roger Stone's coming back in, we're going to take calls.
[3:02:56.580 --> 3:03:01.580]  What, I mean, what is it you did 20-something years ago that you're having to do all this to try to make restitution for?
[3:03:01.580 --> 3:03:06.580]  I have to create this system. I have designed all of the tricks,
[3:03:06.580 --> 3:03:13.580]  most all of the tricks in this entire system that they call their game plan.
[3:03:13.580 --> 3:03:17.580]  I helped build it, and we destroyed a lot of lives.
[3:03:17.580 --> 3:03:21.580]  We learned how to destroy lives. We learned how to use blackmail,
[3:03:21.580 --> 3:03:25.580]  how to use extortion, how to get control of everything,
[3:03:25.580 --> 3:03:29.580]  how you first get control of the Justice Department in that day of the court,
[3:03:29.580 --> 3:03:33.580]  how you get in control of the FBI in that day.
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:37.580]  It was all of the law enforcement then how to get in control of the media.
[3:03:37.580 --> 3:03:41.580]  Once you got that, you could do anything you wanted, and we did.
[3:03:41.580 --> 3:03:46.580]  And so that's what they've carried through. That's what they got within an inch
[3:03:46.580 --> 3:03:50.580]  of perfecting at a global level, not just a national level.
[3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:55.580]  I'm talking a global level, and I have tried to expose it.
[3:03:55.580 --> 3:03:59.580]  You know, Alex, it's funny through this entire campaign.
[3:03:59.580 --> 3:04:03.580]  Through this entire campaign, did you ever see me on Fox?
[3:04:03.580 --> 3:04:07.580]  You wasn't going to see me on CNN or NBC or any of those people.
[3:04:07.580 --> 3:04:10.580]  Did you ever even see me on Fox?
[3:04:10.580 --> 3:04:14.580]  I mean, the one guy that Clinton wrote about in his memoirs,
[3:04:14.580 --> 3:04:19.580]  the one guy that caused the majority of the scandals that got him impeached,
[3:04:19.580 --> 3:04:24.580]  you were the only one good enough to let me come on and just tell
[3:04:24.580 --> 3:04:28.580]  the things that I know. And yes, you made me prove it,
[3:04:28.580 --> 3:04:31.580]  but I think I held my end of the bar.
[3:04:31.580 --> 3:04:35.580]  You've done a great job of posting to support you. Let's put your PayPal out here. Larry Nichols,
[3:04:35.580 --> 3:04:38.580]  here needs your support. We'll be back with Roger Stone. Let's put that on screen.
[3:04:38.580 --> 3:04:41.580]  We can't so I can give it to NicholsLiveatAL.com folks.
[3:04:41.580 --> 3:04:44.580]  Amazing intel we've gotten. NicholsLiveatAL.com.
[3:04:44.580 --> 3:04:46.580]  Larry, this is the last time you're on, buddy.
[3:04:46.580 --> 3:04:50.580]  We're going to have your ass on to your six feet under, and that might be me before you.
[3:04:50.580 --> 3:04:53.580]  Not that I'm going to commit suicide. I love life, but each day is a miracle.
[3:04:53.580 --> 3:04:56.580]  We'll be back. Stay with us, folks.
[3:04:56.580 --> 3:04:59.580]  While the dawn has broken through the dark night,
[3:04:59.580 --> 3:05:03.580]  and Donald J. Trump is the 45th president-elect of the United States,
[3:05:03.580 --> 3:05:07.580]  his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that they were at the Hilton last night.
[3:05:07.580 --> 3:05:09.580]  She looked down at her phone, and the caller ID said,
[3:05:09.580 --> 3:05:12.580]  Huma Abedin. Of course, she was calling for Trump.
[3:05:12.580 --> 3:05:16.580]  Clinton had conceded the election, refusing to give a concession speech last night,
[3:05:16.580 --> 3:05:19.580]  in fact, sending her and world campaign manager, John Podesta,
[3:05:19.580 --> 3:05:23.580]  to break the news to supporters of hers as they broke out in tears and sobbed.
[3:05:23.580 --> 3:05:28.580]  Now, Trump winning against unbeatable odds, of course, is a true victory for the American people.
[3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:30.580]  The New York Times says that Trump's victory is, quote,
[3:05:30.580 --> 3:05:34.580]  a stunning repudiation of the establishment. Yeah, no kidding.
[3:05:34.580 --> 3:05:38.580]  Nigel Farage congratulated Donald Trump and said he's making his way to the U.S.
[3:05:38.580 --> 3:05:41.580]  He also said that he wants to be, quote, the ambassador to Brussels.
[3:05:41.580 --> 3:05:45.580]  Farage said that he'd like to work with the president-elect in Brussels to, quote,
[3:05:45.580 --> 3:05:50.580]  bring down the EU. It looks like a global referendum is going on around the world.
[3:05:50.580 --> 3:06:05.580]  I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for Infowars.com.
[3:06:20.580 --> 3:06:25.580]  I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.

[3:07:56.580 --> 3:08:04.580]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[3:08:04.580 --> 3:08:12.580]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[3:08:12.580 --> 3:08:20.580]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[3:08:20.580 --> 3:08:26.580]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[3:08:26.580 --> 3:08:32.580]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:37.580]  We came, we saw, we died.
[3:08:37.580 --> 3:08:39.580]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[3:08:39.580 --> 3:08:43.580]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[3:08:43.580 --> 3:08:52.580]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[3:08:52.580 --> 3:08:57.580]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[3:08:57.580 --> 3:09:05.580]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[3:09:05.580 --> 3:09:08.580]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[3:09:08.580 --> 3:09:10.580]  Of course not, because she's...
[3:09:14.580 --> 3:09:17.580]  Alright, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[3:09:17.580 --> 3:09:20.580]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[3:09:20.580 --> 3:09:43.580]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[3:09:43.580 --> 3:09:52.580]  Now we go from history into legend.
[3:09:52.580 --> 3:09:54.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're bringing Roger Stone back in a few minutes.
[3:09:54.580 --> 3:09:59.580]  I wanted to finish with Larry Nichols's message to the Clintons, but that's probably the last time you'll see us air that ad.
[3:09:59.580 --> 3:10:06.580]  It's just as important as the disinfo ad they put out in 1963 against Murray Goldwater, 64.
[3:10:06.580 --> 3:10:08.580]  But this one is fact-based.
[3:10:08.580 --> 3:10:15.580]  And I was kind of pissed off because it only had three and a half million views on Facebook and a million or so on my YouTube.
[3:10:15.580 --> 3:10:20.580]  But then I was just surfing around the other day and I found somebody else's channel with five million views.
[3:10:20.580 --> 3:10:22.580]  So I decided to just saw it.
[3:10:22.580 --> 3:10:23.580]  Oh, five million.
[3:10:23.580 --> 3:10:26.580]  So I just Googled the headline and I found a bunch of others.
[3:10:26.580 --> 3:10:30.580]  And I didn't have all day because my kids were running around in my office.
[3:10:30.580 --> 3:10:34.580]  But I think it got about 11 million, 12 million views.
[3:10:34.580 --> 3:10:39.580]  So do you think that affected the election, that ad you just saw?
[3:10:39.580 --> 3:10:42.580]  And again, it's not about, oh, I'm the big shot or something.
[3:10:42.580 --> 3:10:44.580]  No, McBreen put that together with Liam McAddy.
[3:10:44.580 --> 3:10:45.580]  What great folks.
[3:10:45.580 --> 3:10:47.580]  The talent, the power, the truth.
[3:10:47.580 --> 3:10:53.580]  And so I'm so honored by the great crew we've got and the listeners that support us.
[3:10:53.580 --> 3:10:54.580]  No one thing, folks.
[3:10:54.580 --> 3:10:56.580]  You have supported and prayed for us and everything.
[3:10:56.580 --> 3:10:57.580]  And we are the tip of the spear.
[3:10:57.580 --> 3:10:58.580]  You are the tip of the spear.
[3:10:58.580 --> 3:11:00.580]  And it's quite a responsibility.
[3:11:00.580 --> 3:11:03.580]  Larry Nichols, you talked about under and underpass.
[3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:06.580]  You broke, you get into this and I'm going to, I'm going to let you go.
[3:11:06.580 --> 3:11:08.580]  But, but why did you break up with the Clintons?
[3:11:08.580 --> 3:11:09.580]  What was the final deal?
[3:11:09.580 --> 3:11:11.580]  And was it them killing kids?
[3:11:11.580 --> 3:11:14.580]  Or I mean, when did you finally stop working with them?
[3:11:14.580 --> 3:11:20.580]  Well, when I found out that they were laundering $100 million a month of cocaine through the
[3:11:20.580 --> 3:11:25.580]  small airport in Meena, Arkansas, I went to Bill and told him I couldn't go that far.
[3:11:25.580 --> 3:11:28.580]  I'd done a lot of stuff, but that was one I couldn't go.
[3:11:28.580 --> 3:11:30.580]  And I gave him two weeks to tell the truth.
[3:11:30.580 --> 3:11:33.580]  I would, and that started the war.
[3:11:33.580 --> 3:11:38.580]  Now, the purpose of what I want to tell them is because of the meeting I had under a bridge
[3:11:38.580 --> 3:11:40.580]  about a block away from the state capital.
[3:11:40.580 --> 3:11:44.580]  Right before he left to go to Washington, he wanted to meet with me.
[3:11:44.580 --> 3:11:48.580]  It was he but a young chief secured in me so nobody could hear.
[3:11:48.580 --> 3:11:54.580]  And I told him that day, he told me that he was fixing to be president, that the war was over.
[3:11:54.580 --> 3:11:56.580]  And I said, Bill, I don't care.
[3:11:56.580 --> 3:11:58.580]  I don't care if you become Pope.
[3:11:58.580 --> 3:12:04.580]  One day we're going to meet at High Noon and one of us are getting out of town because one of us is lying.
[3:12:04.580 --> 3:12:06.580]  And you know which one it is.
[3:12:06.580 --> 3:12:13.580]  And Alex, with your permission, Bill, Hillary, it's High Noon finally.
[3:12:13.580 --> 3:12:16.580]  Some 20 years later, it's High Noon.
[3:12:16.580 --> 3:12:19.580]  Let me tell you what you've done.
[3:12:19.580 --> 3:12:21.580]  You've heard too many people.
[3:12:21.580 --> 3:12:24.580]  You've destroyed too many lives.
[3:12:24.580 --> 3:12:28.580]  And now you get to leave.
[3:12:28.580 --> 3:12:31.580]  Just remember this, your foundation is finished.
[3:12:31.580 --> 3:12:34.580]  You've got nothing left to sell.
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:40.580]  There's no one going to buy power from you because you have none to give away or to sell.
[3:12:40.580 --> 3:12:48.580]  So finally, you know you've met one person, one at least.
[3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:55.580]  In your sick way, in your sick life, with all the sick people you were running with, there's one person at least that told you the truth.
[3:12:55.580 --> 3:12:57.580]  It is High Noon.
[3:12:57.580 --> 3:13:01.580]  And you're finally leaving town.
[3:13:01.580 --> 3:13:03.580]  Alex, thank you, brother.
[3:13:03.580 --> 3:13:05.580]  Thank you for the time you've given me.
[3:13:05.580 --> 3:13:06.580]  You bet.
[3:13:06.580 --> 3:13:12.580]  Well, Larry, you've just given us valuable info in the 20 plus years we've been talking and it's just turned out to be really accurate.
[3:13:12.580 --> 3:13:19.580]  I tell you, it's crazy to watch and to know how much your own staff hated her.
[3:13:19.580 --> 3:13:30.580]  And to know that they're such monsters, what are they going to do now that they're sick, they're old, and they're just demons, and they have lost their power.
[3:13:30.580 --> 3:13:33.580]  And now they are a negative commodity.
[3:13:33.580 --> 3:13:36.580]  I mean, this is garbage that has to be taken out of this street corner.
[3:13:36.580 --> 3:13:38.580]  I mean, they understand that now, right?
[3:13:38.580 --> 3:13:40.580]  Yeah, they know they're done.
[3:13:40.580 --> 3:13:42.580]  They know they're done. They've got no power.
[3:13:42.580 --> 3:13:51.580]  If they can't extort blackmail, if they can't, if they can't sell positions, et cetera, they know they're finished.
[3:13:51.580 --> 3:13:54.580]  It's going to be a tough road for them.
[3:13:54.580 --> 3:13:56.580]  And I hate that for them.
[3:13:56.580 --> 3:13:58.580]  I've been facetious.
[3:13:58.580 --> 3:14:00.580]  Now, tell us about this dog.
[3:14:00.580 --> 3:14:01.580]  Show us your dog behind you.
[3:14:01.580 --> 3:14:03.580]  Who is this beautiful creature?
[3:14:03.580 --> 3:14:04.580]  That is Pluto.
[3:14:04.580 --> 3:14:05.580]  That's my buddy.
[3:14:05.580 --> 3:14:07.580]  He's with me every step of the way.
[3:14:07.580 --> 3:14:10.580]  He keeps me, he's right by my side.
[3:14:10.580 --> 3:14:13.580]  Well, you have the camera down so I can see that.
[3:14:13.580 --> 3:14:14.580]  Is that a bulldog?
[3:14:14.580 --> 3:14:16.580]  No, he's a Labrador retriever.
[3:14:16.580 --> 3:14:17.580]  I've got the same.
[3:14:17.580 --> 3:14:18.580]  This is really fat.
[3:14:18.580 --> 3:14:20.580]  No, you're underfeeding that dog.
[3:14:20.580 --> 3:14:24.580]  Yeah, well, I can't tell him no.
[3:14:24.580 --> 3:14:26.580]  Do I have to call animal patrol?
[3:14:26.580 --> 3:14:27.580]  You're starving that animal?
[3:14:27.580 --> 3:14:29.580]  Yeah, you're going to have to.
[3:14:29.580 --> 3:14:31.580]  Thank you, my brother.
[3:14:31.580 --> 3:14:37.580]  You truly have been a friend and keep this network going.
[3:14:37.580 --> 3:14:39.580]  It's needed more now than ever.
[3:14:39.580 --> 3:14:41.580]  It's not so much the Clintons.
[3:14:41.580 --> 3:14:44.580]  What they're going to do to retaliate, it's all the networks.
[3:14:44.580 --> 3:14:46.580]  It's all the mainstream media.
[3:14:46.580 --> 3:14:49.580]  What they're going to do to try to revitalize their lives.
[3:14:49.580 --> 3:14:51.580]  They're going to fight ugly.
[3:14:51.580 --> 3:14:54.580]  And remember, they still have the power to do it.
[3:14:54.580 --> 3:14:55.580]  Well, that's what's incredible.
[3:14:55.580 --> 3:14:57.580]  Boy, didn't they sign up to the wrong wagon?
[3:14:57.580 --> 3:14:58.580]  They're so delusional.
[3:14:58.580 --> 3:15:00.580]  They were believed with their own BS.
[3:15:00.580 --> 3:15:01.580]  Get the camera down.
[3:15:01.580 --> 3:15:03.580]  Let me see this dog.
[3:15:03.580 --> 3:15:05.580]  Oh, Lord.
[3:15:05.580 --> 3:15:07.580]  Look at this spoiled creature.
[3:15:07.580 --> 3:15:08.580]  Let me see it.
[3:15:08.580 --> 3:15:09.580]  Let me see the face.
[3:15:09.580 --> 3:15:10.580]  Oh, that dog.
[3:15:10.580 --> 3:15:12.580]  Look up, buddy.
[3:15:12.580 --> 3:15:14.580]  We just lost this guy.
[3:15:14.580 --> 3:15:17.580]  Anyway, all right, Alex.
[3:15:17.580 --> 3:15:18.580]  Thank you, my friend.
[3:15:18.580 --> 3:15:21.580]  You need to start a show called the,
[3:15:21.580 --> 3:15:26.580]  called the Pluto and Nichols program.
[3:15:26.580 --> 3:15:27.580]  That's right.
[3:15:27.580 --> 3:15:28.580]  We'll see you, buddy.
[3:15:28.580 --> 3:15:30.580]  God bless you.
[3:15:30.580 --> 3:15:31.580]  Thank you.
[3:15:31.580 --> 3:15:33.580]  All right, we're going to bring Roger Stone back in here in a moment.
[3:15:33.580 --> 3:15:35.580]  Before we do that, he's finishing up his lunch.
[3:15:35.580 --> 3:15:38.580]  I want to open the phones up to you, the people, we the people.
[3:15:38.580 --> 3:15:40.580]  800-25-99-231.
[3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:42.580]  800-25-99-231.
[3:15:42.580 --> 3:15:44.580]  I just want to stay up here all day.
[3:15:44.580 --> 3:15:45.580]  We're going to be up here all night.
[3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:46.580]  I'm quite frankly, I can't leave.
[3:15:46.580 --> 3:15:47.580]  This is just too historical.
[3:15:47.580 --> 3:15:48.580]  It's too exciting.
[3:15:48.580 --> 3:15:51.580]  I was so pent up when I first got on here, you know, I was exhausted.
[3:15:51.580 --> 3:15:53.580]  I didn't really get into the celebration.
[3:15:53.580 --> 3:15:54.580]  We should.
[3:15:54.580 --> 3:15:57.580]  I mean, this is a repudiation of the entire system.
[3:15:57.580 --> 3:15:58.580]  This is so beautiful.
[3:15:58.580 --> 3:16:01.580]  But I've got a few clips here I do want to play.
[3:16:01.580 --> 3:16:03.580]  Here's one from CNN.
[3:16:03.580 --> 3:16:04.580]  Will Trump prosecute Clinton?
[3:16:04.580 --> 3:16:06.580]  We keep going back to that.
[3:16:06.580 --> 3:16:08.580]  But even more important, we played it earlier.
[3:16:08.580 --> 3:16:13.580]  When that clip ends, I want to play Conway, a communications director, saying,
[3:16:13.580 --> 3:16:16.580]  where should we, you know, you know, you're a joke.
[3:16:16.580 --> 3:16:20.580]  You said Trump would lose the House and Senate for the Republicans with no evidence.
[3:16:20.580 --> 3:16:23.580]  It was all just, just, just made up garbage.
[3:16:23.580 --> 3:16:26.580]  We knew he had more votes than anybody in history in the primary.
[3:16:26.580 --> 3:16:32.580]  We knew he was trending popular with Hispanics, blacks, you name it, who want a prosperity message.
[3:16:32.580 --> 3:16:34.580]  And America is the name of prosperity.
[3:16:34.580 --> 3:16:38.580]  It's not like we're selling, you know, snow cones or something here on, you know,
[3:16:38.580 --> 3:16:39.580]  mountaintop.
[3:16:39.580 --> 3:16:41.580]  We're doing real things we know work.
[3:16:41.580 --> 3:16:48.580]  And so it is a total collapse of a bunch of delusionals that called us deplorables,
[3:16:48.580 --> 3:16:53.580]  who hijacked our republic and then convinced themselves they built it, they did it,
[3:16:53.580 --> 3:16:54.580]  and they were infallible.
[3:16:54.580 --> 3:16:55.580]  Let me tell you something.
[3:16:55.580 --> 3:16:59.580]  When you're really a winner and you've got real success in life, you're not arrogant.
[3:16:59.580 --> 3:17:01.580]  As you get more power, you get less arrogant.
[3:17:01.580 --> 3:17:04.580]  You realize you have responsibilities to other people.
[3:17:04.580 --> 3:17:09.580]  But people that live within a delusional echo chamber, they get more and more arrogant.
[3:17:09.580 --> 3:17:11.580]  Criminology speaks to this and so much more.
[3:17:11.580 --> 3:17:13.580]  So here is that clip.
[3:17:13.580 --> 3:17:15.580]  And we're going to have Roger Stone come here and take your phone calls,
[3:17:15.580 --> 3:17:18.580]  800-25-99-231.
[3:17:18.580 --> 3:17:19.580]  This is the info war.
[3:17:19.580 --> 3:17:20.580]  This is the future.
[3:17:20.580 --> 3:17:26.580]  This is the real media that filled the vacuum when we cease to have real journalists in
[3:17:26.580 --> 3:17:31.580]  this country and you are powering the info war.
[3:17:31.580 --> 3:17:35.580]  What do you expect from the meeting with President Obama on Thursday?
[3:17:35.580 --> 3:17:39.580]  Is there any message that Donald Trump will give to him?
[3:17:39.580 --> 3:17:43.580]  I'll let those two world leaders decide that, Allison.
[3:17:43.580 --> 3:17:48.580]  I think that they will talk about the things they can maybe work on together in the future
[3:17:48.580 --> 3:17:53.580]  and how to build on what success President Obama has and frankly how to tackle the
[3:17:53.580 --> 3:17:56.580]  infinite to do this that he will leave behind.
[3:17:56.580 --> 3:17:59.580]  That has to be a priority.
[3:17:59.580 --> 3:18:05.580]  I would note that yesterday's election brought together Republicans in the House,
[3:18:05.580 --> 3:18:09.580]  the Senate and the presidency for all the talk about how Donald Trump is going to drag down
[3:18:09.580 --> 3:18:10.580]  the House and send him in.
[3:18:10.580 --> 3:18:14.580]  Good God, how many people sat in your network and said with a straight face,
[3:18:14.580 --> 3:18:19.580]  he was going to cost the Republicans everything not nailed to the ground and said they want
[3:18:19.580 --> 3:18:20.580]  everything.
[3:18:20.580 --> 3:18:22.580]  That tells you something about where America wants to go though.
[3:18:22.580 --> 3:18:27.580]  He's being given a mandate and that mandate is going to be somewhat different than what
[3:18:27.580 --> 3:18:28.580]  we've had.
[3:18:28.580 --> 3:18:31.580]  It is a repudiation of some of the things we've had.
[3:18:31.580 --> 3:18:35.580]  Let's talk about Secretary Clinton and let's talk about some of Donald Trump's campaign
[3:18:35.580 --> 3:18:36.580]  promises.
[3:18:36.580 --> 3:18:41.580]  One of them was to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton.
[3:18:41.580 --> 3:18:43.580]  Is that going to happen?
[3:18:43.580 --> 3:18:48.580]  We didn't discuss that last night and he did not discuss that with Hillary Clinton on
[3:18:48.580 --> 3:18:49.580]  the phone.
[3:18:49.580 --> 3:18:53.580]  But I mean for voters who want to know whether or not they'll still be division or whether
[3:18:53.580 --> 3:18:59.580]  they'll be unity, that was one that was a real rallying cry for some of his supporters
[3:18:59.580 --> 3:19:04.580]  and a battle cry for him and I think that this morning Democrats obviously are waking
[3:19:04.580 --> 3:19:07.580]  up somewhat despondent and they want to know what to expect.
[3:19:07.580 --> 3:19:13.580]  Do you expect that those sorts of investigations from Donald Trump will continue?
[3:19:13.580 --> 3:19:15.580]  On your point, we need unity.
[3:19:15.580 --> 3:19:20.580]  That was precisely the theme of Trump's victory speech last night, Allison.
[3:19:20.580 --> 3:19:25.580]  He went way out to make sure everybody heard him loudly and clearly that he will be the
[3:19:25.580 --> 3:19:30.580]  president for all Americans and that includes many that did not vote for him and did not
[3:19:30.580 --> 3:19:32.580]  expect him to be their president.
[3:19:32.580 --> 3:19:33.580]  He also went a little bit farther.
[3:19:33.580 --> 3:19:36.580]  He said we need to heal and bind the wounds of a nation.
[3:19:36.580 --> 3:19:38.580]  Obviously, you spoke into President Obama.
[3:19:38.580 --> 3:19:40.580]  Obviously, you spoke into Secretary Clinton.
[3:19:40.580 --> 3:19:44.580]  They are two leaders that we would like to lean upon to help us do that.
[3:19:44.580 --> 3:19:45.580]  We certainly hope we can do that.
[3:19:45.580 --> 3:19:50.580]  We certainly hope that a number of Democrats today feel the same way and even the non-voters,
[3:19:50.580 --> 3:19:53.580]  people who don't really bother with the system.
[3:19:53.580 --> 3:19:55.580]  Now, Rodgers comes back with us.
[3:19:55.580 --> 3:19:58.580]  We're skipping this break because, hell, I'm doing 10, 15 hours of broadcast.
[3:19:58.580 --> 3:19:59.580]  I'm skipping breaks.
[3:19:59.580 --> 3:20:01.580]  I want to go like, you're skipping breaks, but I've added hours to the show.
[3:20:01.580 --> 3:20:03.580]  You're getting more breaks to sell network.
[3:20:03.580 --> 3:20:06.580]  Duh, leave me alone.
[3:20:06.580 --> 3:20:09.580]  But anyways, that had 24 hours a day, they bitch.
[3:20:09.580 --> 3:20:10.580]  I'm sorry.
[3:20:10.580 --> 3:20:13.580]  The point is, look at this, 2016 elections summed up.
[3:20:13.580 --> 3:20:14.580]  Leigh Ann just sent me this.
[3:20:14.580 --> 3:20:15.580]  I don't know if she made the meme.
[3:20:15.580 --> 3:20:17.580]  She makes some great memes, but she just sent it to me seconds ago.
[3:20:17.580 --> 3:20:19.580]  So we need to tweak this out at Real Alex Jones.
[3:20:19.580 --> 3:20:23.580]  There's the young turds that say Republicans tried to stop women's suffrage.
[3:20:23.580 --> 3:20:25.580]  Well, they're the ones that did it.
[3:20:25.580 --> 3:20:27.580]  I'm not even a Republican file.
[3:20:27.580 --> 3:20:31.580]  It's just a damn line because they know their audience are these pseudo-intellectual people
[3:20:31.580 --> 3:20:33.580]  that can't find their ass with both hands.
[3:20:33.580 --> 3:20:34.580]  They're collapsing.
[3:20:34.580 --> 3:20:35.580]  They're nothing.
[3:20:35.580 --> 3:20:36.580]  Funded by Qatar, all the rest of it.
[3:20:36.580 --> 3:20:37.580]  What a joke.
[3:20:37.580 --> 3:20:41.580]  You know, she's all for Islam, but you know, she's in a freaking tart outfit.
[3:20:41.580 --> 3:20:42.580]  Hey, baby, wear a tart outfit.
[3:20:42.580 --> 3:20:45.580]  Just, you know, don't put other women in, you know, burkas.
[3:20:45.580 --> 3:20:49.580]  And then you've got Buckley serving Roger and I there, champagne with Donald Trump
[3:20:49.580 --> 3:20:52.580]  smiling in the background, 2016 election.
[3:20:52.580 --> 3:20:55.580]  You've got them crapping their britches while we celebrate.
[3:20:55.580 --> 3:20:56.580]  Roger, this is delicious.
[3:20:56.580 --> 3:21:02.580]  It is indeed, and I want to send our very best regards out to Sankh.
[3:21:02.580 --> 3:21:05.580]  Haven't seen you since the Republican National Convention.
[3:21:05.580 --> 3:21:09.580]  When you're walking by 20 feet away and he goes, don't try to crash my show, Stone.
[3:21:09.580 --> 3:21:11.580]  And they invited me up in a setup.
[3:21:11.580 --> 3:21:12.580]  These are dirtbags.
[3:21:12.580 --> 3:21:13.580]  Yeah.
[3:21:13.580 --> 3:21:14.580]  Well, I hope they're having a nice day.
[3:21:14.580 --> 3:21:18.580]  Maybe you guys can get together for dinner with, I don't know, David Brock or something.
[3:21:18.580 --> 3:21:22.580]  No, but I mean, I don't hate them because I'm in competition with them.
[3:21:22.580 --> 3:21:23.580]  I'm not.
[3:21:23.580 --> 3:21:24.580]  These are disreputable.
[3:21:24.580 --> 3:21:28.580]  It's like you hate the villain in a movie that's, you know, robbing kids or whatever.
[3:21:28.580 --> 3:21:33.580]  It's like, and they sit up there all arrogant and just everything's scripted and they
[3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:35.580]  Sanctimonious is the real thing.
[3:21:35.580 --> 3:21:36.580]  Sanctimonious.
[3:21:36.580 --> 3:21:38.580]  Look, everybody knows this story.
[3:21:38.580 --> 3:21:39.580]  They jackpot at us.
[3:21:39.580 --> 3:21:41.580]  They invite us to come up.
[3:21:41.580 --> 3:21:44.580]  You go up graciously trying to boost their ratings.
[3:21:44.580 --> 3:21:45.580]  Let's face it.
[3:21:45.580 --> 3:21:46.580]  You go up.
[3:21:46.580 --> 3:21:47.580]  You're smiling.
[3:21:47.580 --> 3:21:48.580]  You're friendly.
[3:21:48.580 --> 3:21:49.580]  They had hundreds of women.
[3:21:49.580 --> 3:21:50.580]  Stop crashing our set.
[3:21:50.580 --> 3:21:51.580]  We didn't crash anything.
[3:21:51.580 --> 3:21:52.580]  You were invited.
[3:21:52.580 --> 3:21:53.580]  They begged you.
[3:21:53.580 --> 3:21:54.580]  They begged you to come on.
[3:21:54.580 --> 3:21:56.580]  And then you wouldn't come on.
[3:21:56.580 --> 3:21:57.580]  I guess you knew it was a setup next.
[3:21:57.580 --> 3:21:58.580]  I didn't smell it.
[3:21:58.580 --> 3:21:59.580]  And then they said, you crashed it.
[3:21:59.580 --> 3:22:00.580]  Yeah.
[3:22:00.580 --> 3:22:01.580]  No.
[3:22:01.580 --> 3:22:02.580]  I was standing on it.
[3:22:02.580 --> 3:22:03.580]  Because people think we're like on some set at some lot.
[3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:07.580]  You're in a, you're in an air conditioned, closed in garage, which I love.
[3:22:07.580 --> 3:22:08.580]  Like 60 degrees on there.
[3:22:08.580 --> 3:22:09.580]  I just love cold rooms.
[3:22:09.580 --> 3:22:10.580]  It's probably like a meat locker.
[3:22:10.580 --> 3:22:14.580]  And there's just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of studios crammed in.
[3:22:14.580 --> 3:22:15.580]  Everyone's just broadcasting.
[3:22:15.580 --> 3:22:19.580]  They went, we were here in our private studio and Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[3:22:19.580 --> 3:22:20.580]  They're like, hey, Alex, come on.
[3:22:20.580 --> 3:22:21.580]  Okay.
[3:22:21.580 --> 3:22:22.580]  You're like, yeah, I want to go on there.
[3:22:22.580 --> 3:22:23.580]  You've got an instinct.
[3:22:23.580 --> 3:22:24.580]  I'm like, hey.
[3:22:24.580 --> 3:22:25.580]  I could smell it was a set.
[3:22:25.580 --> 3:22:27.580]  They're like, oh, Alex Jones attacked us.
[3:22:27.580 --> 3:22:28.580]  It's just the dirty tricks, man.
[3:22:28.580 --> 3:22:33.580]  No, the best part was the woman who invited you, the woman in the red dress, she's the
[3:22:33.580 --> 3:22:35.580]  one who starts screaming at the top of her lungs.
[3:22:35.580 --> 3:22:36.580]  Why are you crashing our set?
[3:22:36.580 --> 3:22:38.580]  It was a total setup.
[3:22:38.580 --> 3:22:39.580]  Okay.
[3:22:39.580 --> 3:22:40.580]  I know they need the ratings boost.
[3:22:40.580 --> 3:22:43.580]  They're not getting anywhere near the viewers of info wars.com.
[3:22:43.580 --> 3:22:45.580]  Hopefully we were helpful to them.
[3:22:45.580 --> 3:22:48.580]  But the guy is emblematic of the rigging.
[3:22:48.580 --> 3:22:51.580]  Well, the guy starts yelling at me, Stone, you're a liar.
[3:22:51.580 --> 3:22:52.580]  I said, what have I lied about?
[3:22:52.580 --> 3:22:54.580]  And he says, this is hard to believe.
[3:22:54.580 --> 3:22:55.580]  You're 20 feet away.
[3:22:55.580 --> 3:22:57.580]  Ellie at Spitzer of all things.
[3:22:57.580 --> 3:22:59.580]  This is a big open area.
[3:22:59.580 --> 3:23:01.580]  They're right in the middle of a hallway.
[3:23:01.580 --> 3:23:02.580]  We're walking by.
[3:23:02.580 --> 3:23:03.580]  They, you know, they wave us over earlier.
[3:23:03.580 --> 3:23:04.580]  More interviews.
[3:23:04.580 --> 3:23:07.580]  It's like a dog in a butcher shop with 85,000 pounds of meat.
[3:23:07.580 --> 3:23:08.580]  You're a 20 pound dog.
[3:23:08.580 --> 3:23:09.580]  You can't even eat two pounds.
[3:23:09.580 --> 3:23:11.580]  We're just showing up to show it.
[3:23:11.580 --> 3:23:12.580]  I'm like, God, no more Rogers.
[3:23:12.580 --> 3:23:13.580]  We just go, we've already done 50 interviews.
[3:23:13.580 --> 3:23:15.580]  You're like, come on a few more.
[3:23:15.580 --> 3:23:17.580]  And so we're like, and then they're like waving us over.
[3:23:17.580 --> 3:23:20.580]  And I'm like, oh, I want to go laugh at them.
[3:23:20.580 --> 3:23:21.580]  We're walking back by.
[3:23:21.580 --> 3:23:22.580]  They'd already invited it.
[3:23:22.580 --> 3:23:24.580]  Then that time I did go jump on.
[3:23:24.580 --> 3:23:25.580]  But so what?
[3:23:25.580 --> 3:23:27.580]  They'd already invited us.
[3:23:27.580 --> 3:23:30.580]  Then they, again, it's emblematic of the fraud.
[3:23:30.580 --> 3:23:35.580]  Well, look, we had just done a show with Jonathan Alter, who's a real liberal and articulate.
[3:23:35.580 --> 3:23:37.580]  It was great radio.
[3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:42.580]  We disagreed sharply, and it was very quick and hot and back and forth.
[3:23:42.580 --> 3:23:43.580]  Great radio.
[3:23:43.580 --> 3:23:46.580]  And then this, this is not journalism.
[3:23:46.580 --> 3:23:47.580]  This isn't even entertainment.
[3:23:47.580 --> 3:23:49.580]  It was just, it was...
[3:23:49.580 --> 3:23:55.860]  But it's emblematic. I know with Glenn Beck or any other liberal fake liberal. The true mark is it's all scripted everything's top down
[3:23:55.860 --> 3:24:01.580]  They're always nervous. It's always fake. He scripts hours. What he's gonna do. He's destroyed himself. It's not about payback
[3:24:01.580 --> 3:24:06.300]  It's just recognized this guy's Benedict Arnold this guy's Judy is scary it same thing with them
[3:24:07.100 --> 3:24:10.100]  They love setting people up and then they accuse us
[3:24:10.700 --> 3:24:12.700]  None of this is scripted. This is just
[3:24:13.300 --> 3:24:16.980]  Seating your pants Americana brass knuckles in the frickin ring
[3:24:16.980 --> 3:24:19.820]  And then the irony of course is that after this whole thing
[3:24:19.820 --> 3:24:21.820]  I don't know how he got my number
[3:24:21.860 --> 3:24:27.660]  Sink leaves a half dozen messages on my cell phone, you know voicemail asking me to come on
[3:24:28.060 --> 3:24:34.100]  It's it's just it's extraordinary. They these liberals can't see themselves. They just they're incapable of seeing themselves
[3:24:34.100 --> 3:24:37.340]  Yeah, there's no guilt because I feel good about myself. I'm a good guy
[3:24:37.340 --> 3:24:41.740]  But I get guilty when I just war game bad stuff in my mind. I'm not even agreeing with it
[3:24:41.740 --> 3:24:45.700]  But I think about it. I go, God, that's a horrible thing. You just thought of I'm not endorsing in my mind
[3:24:45.700 --> 3:24:46.980]  But I feel dirty
[3:24:46.980 --> 3:24:50.900]  They don't seem to have any conscience and I think conscience is a mark of intellect
[3:24:50.900 --> 3:24:56.940]  Don't you think without any question that they've no ability to see themselves and see how ridiculous they look see how
[3:24:57.500 --> 3:24:59.500]  Contrived the whole thing looks
[3:24:59.980 --> 3:25:04.420]  And it's why no one's watching it's precisely. That's my next question. We're gonna go to break and take calls
[3:25:04.820 --> 3:25:08.580]  Let me ask you this question Roger Stone former head of the Trump campaign. We keep talking about victory
[3:25:08.580 --> 3:25:11.020]  I mean, this is so big. I can't even believe it. I'm pinching myself
[3:25:11.860 --> 3:25:13.860]  What does that then signify?
[3:25:13.860 --> 3:25:21.260]  For them, I mean again, what do they do next? I mean already mainstream media is a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
[3:25:21.260 --> 3:25:27.100]  They I mean, we don't just say that they are a literal joke. I sit here and I look at us with I didn't check since last night
[3:25:27.780 --> 3:25:33.740]  2728 million. I forget what it was. It was like 27 and a half million views that we were just we got too tired of tabulating and quit
[3:25:33.740 --> 3:25:36.620]  All these videos and this one's got six million this one's got two million
[3:25:36.620 --> 3:25:40.260]  I've got four million. You know all these live feeds we've been doing we have to cut off every four hours
[3:25:40.260 --> 3:25:45.220]  And I'm like, that's not even our terrestrial audience. This is ridiculous. How big our audience is
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:49.940]  It's not a power trip. It actually finally I get butterflies. It finally freaks me out Roger
[3:25:49.940 --> 3:25:51.020]  But then I think
[3:25:51.020 --> 3:25:56.020]  What is it like at studios that spend a billion dollars a year like CNN in studios?
[3:25:56.020 --> 3:25:59.140]  This one cost a half million. There's cost five ten million apiece
[3:25:59.380 --> 3:26:03.820]  What is it like for these people to know now that they are jokes?
[3:26:03.820 --> 3:26:11.060]  They are nothing's they bet on the wrong wars their frauds their mercenaries and their losers and and they have
[3:26:11.700 --> 3:26:16.800]  Invested hundreds of millions of dollars into an infrastructure that is outdated
[3:26:16.860 --> 3:26:20.580]  They're spending all this money for a cable system for delivery
[3:26:21.540 --> 3:26:25.860]  Info wars stone cold truth. We go right to the internet. We don't have this giant
[3:26:25.860 --> 3:26:33.140]  Infrastructure and content is what goes viral. The content is the delivery. They really don't understand how many people
[3:26:33.620 --> 3:26:37.500]  We're reaching they really don't understand the reach of
[3:26:38.180 --> 3:26:42.900]  Conservative alternative media, which is the new it's the new mainstream. We are the mainstream
[3:26:43.300 --> 3:26:45.620]  They're the extremists. They're the fringe
[3:26:45.900 --> 3:26:51.940]  They're the ones who don't represent anybody except for a small group on the on the edge and this is the final illusion to fall
[3:26:51.940 --> 3:26:57.140]  People always say well, don't you want to stay the French? I want to retake the country bring people together
[3:26:57.140 --> 3:26:58.540]  Nothing will ever be perfect
[3:26:58.540 --> 3:27:04.420]  Reform things go back to what made us great and start helping other countries build up and truly do that because that's how I want to be
[3:27:04.420 --> 3:27:08.980]  Treated that's that's the great, you know vision and that's what we're we're now taking back
[3:27:09.340 --> 3:27:14.940]  Excalibur that was given to us by our founders and really realizing America always had the ten foot long
[3:27:14.940 --> 3:27:20.780]  You know what we're just retaking it now these little assholes hijacked the country took it over
[3:27:20.780 --> 3:27:25.500]  They can't believe we're taking it back and their confidence came is over. They're crapping themselves
[3:27:26.340 --> 3:27:32.140]  It's just an incredible time to be alive. What's amazing, of course is that they accuse us of being the ones who have
[3:27:32.740 --> 3:27:39.620]  Removed civility from politics yet checking with my office this morning checking with my the death of my wife
[3:27:39.860 --> 3:27:45.140]  The death threats are just I mean they're just for me death threats are like birds chirping in the morning
[3:27:45.140 --> 3:27:47.420]  But yeah, well their testimony to your effectiveness
[3:27:47.420 --> 3:27:52.260]  I mean there it lets you know that you must be accomplishing something because nobody would bother but
[3:27:52.580 --> 3:27:56.820]  Where's the civility? Where's the civility? Well, they also don't get I'm not a coward like you
[3:27:56.820 --> 3:28:03.060]  I've already been threatened and physically attacked and sued and gone after and lied about and stuff you couldn't believe I mean
[3:28:03.060 --> 3:28:05.060]  I'm talking intelligence agency
[3:28:05.340 --> 3:28:09.620]  Infiltrations and you you so you kill people gee. I didn't know that
[3:28:10.420 --> 3:28:14.260]  They don't understand. We don't care. We're committed. We're alive
[3:28:14.260 --> 3:28:21.220]  Well, look the the the IRS harassment the the death threat hacking the hacking
[3:28:21.540 --> 3:28:25.440]  You know, it took me a month to get all of my computer systems back up
[3:28:25.460 --> 3:28:30.540]  They went into my bank accounts. They went into my websites. They went into the feed for social media
[3:28:30.940 --> 3:28:33.380]  And they destroyed all my contacts
[3:28:33.380 --> 3:28:36.700]  You know happens when somebody follows you around in a black car off and on for a year
[3:28:36.700 --> 3:28:39.900]  And then once they they make the decision to bump into you in a grocery store
[3:28:39.900 --> 3:28:45.300]  And you break their nose and one punch and they can't say anything or do anything because they're casing you at that point
[3:28:45.300 --> 3:28:49.580]  They all back off. They completely freak out like I just broke your nose, dude one punch
[3:28:49.580 --> 3:28:54.100]  You think I'm a coward. You don't know what you're dealing with. I'm a badass. I'm just a man
[3:28:54.100 --> 3:28:58.620]  We're kicking your ass in the info war. Do you really think physically you can kick my ass?
[3:28:59.060 --> 3:29:03.020]  Well, those are the heavy-handed, you know tactics of the Clintons
[3:29:03.020 --> 3:29:06.580]  They're the ones who use the heavy-handed private detectives to threaten people. Yeah
[3:29:06.580 --> 3:29:09.860]  If you bump into me like Michael Moore's bodyguard anybody I'm gonna punch you right back
[3:29:09.860 --> 3:29:13.620]  That wasn't Michael Moore the nose thing, but I've been eating on tape. I fricking hit the guy couldn't believe it
[3:29:13.620 --> 3:29:16.620]  Yeah, you hit me. I just elbowed you buddy, and it's not like I'm mr.
[3:29:16.620 --> 3:29:21.540]  Badass you hit me. I hit back Roger that that's how that's how red-blooded Americans are
[3:29:22.260 --> 3:29:27.580]  Look, we're not afraid. That's the point here. We're not afraid and this is the new American revolution
[3:29:27.580 --> 3:29:30.020]  Let's be honest. We're afraid of ourselves if we get pushed as far
[3:29:30.500 --> 3:29:33.700]  Well, this is the new American Revolution. We're ready for the fight
[3:29:33.700 --> 3:29:38.340]  Stoke cold truth comm devastating victory call straight ahead and more analysis of Roger stone
[3:29:38.340 --> 3:29:42.140]  It's so good that you decided to come down there with us. I know I didn't think of it. It's so good to have you here
[3:29:42.140 --> 3:29:44.140]  We'll be back stay with us
[3:29:46.180 --> 3:29:53.100]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:53.100 --> 3:30:03.580]  During CNN's election night coverage former Obama advisor ban Jones argued that the 2016 election was a white lash
[3:30:03.740 --> 3:30:08.180]  Against a change in country. It's a white lash against a black president in part
[3:30:08.180 --> 3:30:12.860]  He said not shocking to CNN is still race fading even though it's clearly over for them
[3:30:12.860 --> 3:30:18.140]  The uphill battle Trump will face however is just beginning Clinton supporters are staging civil unrest
[3:30:18.140 --> 3:30:24.140]  We've seen this in parts of the country like Oregon in California and more than a hundred protesters gathered in Oakland, California
[3:30:24.140 --> 3:30:29.900]  This morning attempting to block freeways and at least one was hit by a car protesters were also seen in masks
[3:30:30.020 --> 3:30:36.180]  Outside of Trump supporters party in San Francisco and Clinton supporters were filmed marching through Portland, Oregon shouting
[3:30:36.420 --> 3:30:43.660]  Expletive Donald Trump and setting fire to the US flag this news comes as death threats against Donald Trump blood social media
[3:30:43.660 --> 3:30:49.900]  Well, can we count on the liberal media in this country to whine refusing to accept Trump's victory as they hashtag?

[3:35:54.460 --> 3:35:57.920]  Do not have functioned here in the last week of this election without brain force

[3:36:21.480 --> 3:36:23.080]  across the country

[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:58.080]  We just go out to industry and say what would be the ultimate game changer part of three top formulators
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:37:03.400]  When they say listen, everybody else just does marketing and packaging. They put a glass bottle
[3:37:03.640 --> 3:37:08.440]  I go no, we're gonna do a plastic bottle and then you're not charging them a dollar for the bottle because this is 10 cents
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:09.960]  You know, it's it's BPA free

[3:37:20.840 --> 3:37:27.440]  I could see victory in reach and I started coming down with a cold. I took your
[3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:29.520]  colloidal
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:33.400]  Product you're gonna have to help me here with the name. I just went to the website. I read the description
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:39.040]  Silver bullet. Yes, I picked the one that sounded like what I needed. I sent for it. I got it immediately
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:46.920]  The cold was gone in 48 hours. I was back to full energy. So these products work. They don't pay me anything to say this
[3:37:46.920 --> 3:37:49.680]  I'm not in on the joke. I'm just a believer
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:55.960]  I've you know, I love how mainstream media MSNBC see it and go Alex Jones sells vitamins and supplements
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:59.400]  He's so evil. We buy bio PQQ the only true
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:07.680]  Organic base. I'm honestly organic. It's genetically engineered bacteria that produce it the stuff are normally found in comets and in deep space asteroids
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:12.080]  I'm not kidding folks. It's like the fountain of youth. They admit you can actually say that because
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:17.280]  There's hundreds of studies on it. The Japanese are obsessed with it. What is bio PQQ?
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:23.020]  Just what's in the bottle is like 50 bucks. That's why it's a hundred bucks right now normally 130
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:26.880]  But but I don't know where I'm going with all this. The point is is that we just bring people the most
[3:38:27.280 --> 3:38:33.040]  Fantastical awesome stuff that's already there. We've got 995 colloidal silver. We got free shipping. We got stuff
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:37.200]  It's inexpensive. We got something expensive. If you want to understand this, I'm gonna go to the calls. This is how I work. I
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:41.760]  Never had trouble sleeping the last few years. I worked so much. I get so upset
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:45.200]  Sometimes at midnight, I can't go to bed and I've got to get up at 6 a.m
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:49.120]  Make the kids breakfast school all that work out get ready go to work
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:54.160]  And I just get so wound up so pissed off and my doctor says hey, you gotta have blood pressure
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:56.960]  It's gone down since I've been doing more exercise and being healthy
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:02.560]  Then I started getting a little melatonin pill. It was like 19 bucks for the same dose. We've not come out with
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:05.280]  And then I would that didn't work sometimes. So I take
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:10.320]  L tryptophan or I'd take valerian root because you can't use something over and over again or it stops working is good
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:12.800]  and then I said
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:17.040]  How much does it cost to get organic melatonin? And they said we can we can do that for
[3:39:17.840 --> 3:39:20.080]  basically $5 a bottle with the packaging and I said
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:26.000]  But everybody else sells it for 1995 the same dose. I mean it should be 10 bucks and I said what I want
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:27.680]  is
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:32.320]  We're going to put everything that's safe that works together talking to doctors and people
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:34.800]  L tryptophan
[3:39:34.800 --> 3:39:39.280]  Valerian root melatonin the same dosages that you'd have to buy nine bottles to do this
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:41.840]  We're going to sell it for 1995
[3:39:42.160 --> 3:39:48.080]  That's the info or folks knockout is nine ingredients. They'd probably cost you a hundred dollars
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:50.880]  To try to get the same thing which is a total ripoff
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:57.280]  The the melatonin stuff is the most expensive thing in it. I get all this organic stuff because that's a cheap formula
[3:39:57.280 --> 3:40:03.440]  And so we sell it for cheap for 1995 and it cost us like eight bucks. We put a hundred twenty percent markup on it
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:05.760]  We make money. It's a great deal
[3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:12.400]  Everybody loves it, but then you got dna force where there's 50 bucks of bio pqq. It varies every month in there
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  That's what i'm getting to is that
[3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:19.040]  You had all the other stuff in there. It's 94 dollars
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:22.160]  Folks, they sell similar formulas at medical facilities
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:28.000]  For 300 to 500 dollars. I'm gonna stop talking about the products, but that's what funds. Sorry roger other
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:33.200]  Look, the reason I like to talk about this stuff is because the elitist panty wastes that media
[3:40:33.520 --> 3:40:35.840]  Shmatters for america make light of us
[3:40:36.400 --> 3:40:39.840]  Because we take herbal supplements something the chinese had been doing for
[3:40:40.480 --> 3:40:45.920]  Centuries because it works. So in fact, I forgot the problem. I'm sorry. I'd always been erupting on that's my
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:47.920]  I
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:49.360]  That's what i'm
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:55.360]  There's no scripting. I forgot to make that point. They they literally we played this they would have how dare him sell
[3:40:56.160 --> 3:41:00.000]  Iodine that's the pure clean type that nobody else thought to do that actually is real
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:01.520]  Iodine not some bound crap
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:05.600]  Which is the good halogen that most people aren't efficient and you can google iq reduction
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:08.160]  We would just slight reductions in what you need
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:14.880]  And then they would MSHBC went to break and i'm not kidding you they had a zoloft commercial
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:20.960]  So they're selling something that literally kills a lot of people poison poison poison, but i'm bad
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:26.640]  Because i'm selling el tryptophan. It's it's elitism. Is it all it is
[3:41:27.120 --> 3:41:34.560]  Look, I am I hope I mean we know turkey makes us want to sleep. It's el tryptophan. Yeah, it's it's it's just elitism
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:38.480]  But yeah, yeah, exactly. We're not allowed to sell a book
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:42.240]  We're not allowed to sell a supplement whole foods is fine when they're making
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:46.640]  A 50 billion a year doing as long as you're wearing your Birkenstocks when you head down there
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:49.520]  If you wear Birkenstocks and you're driving a Volvo
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:55.120]  Or or or listening to classical nothing against lesbians, but a lesbian limousine a what do you call them a uh
[3:41:55.840 --> 3:41:57.840]  Subaru yes, there you go
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:02.960]  Poor rachel maddo. I just feel so badly for her this morning. I want to go to calls
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:08.800]  But you you're here and i've been taking over today because i'm so excited give us the prime stone stones rules
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:12.560]  What has happened like a three minute briefing to america? What has just transpired?
[3:42:13.440 --> 3:42:19.200]  This is a rejection of elitism. This is a rejection of the of the of the globalist
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:23.280]  two-party duopoly that has run the country into the ditch
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  So the agenda of endless war
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:32.160]  an erosion of our civil liberties and massive debt and bailouts for the guys on wall street, let me tell you something
[3:42:32.800 --> 3:42:37.360]  Under president trump the crooks on wall street who rip people off and make millions
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:39.360]  They're going to prison
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:45.440]  We're finally going to have a nation of laws not men trump stands for equality
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:50.320]  He feels strongly about these things alex keeps asking me because he hasn't known donald as long as i have
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:54.960]  Will trump really do these things will he really stick to his guns? He don't understand
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:01.440]  How stubborn he is he's going to build the wall. He's going to secure our borders
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:05.760]  He is going to cancel nafta. He's going to kill tpp
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:13.120]  He's going to get us trade deals that bring us jobs and prosperity. Can you see him knowing? I know he's for real
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:19.360]  I just see him saying let's be nice to hillary. She's a great lady. Well, that's bs. No, that's not that's not okay
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:21.840]  Well, what was the calculus would you have advised him to do that? Yes?
[3:43:21.840 --> 3:43:26.560]  I would have because it's a message for the people because the stock market. He wants to bring her people in and make them
[3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:30.320]  Okay, i get it. We don't want to start market to plunge. We do. I mean that's the point cj made
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:33.760]  I was like i'm pissed at trump this morning goes you want to start market plunge and i'm kind of like
[3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:40.320]  I guess it is presidential. We do want to we do want to be one country on the other hand the question of what happens to hillary
[3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:45.280]  Should be left to prosecutors. Let them look at the evidence and make a decision
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:51.120]  All trump is doing is allowing that process to happen because it hasn't happened so far
[3:43:51.440 --> 3:43:58.400]  They've been protected. This is elite deviance where there are some people so powerful so connected so wired
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:04.480]  So wealthy that the rules don't apply for them that will end under donald trump
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:10.480]  We will be going back to be a nation of laws and the clintons will finally get the prosecution
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:15.840]  This is my opinion that they have long deserved and averted and it's not about
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:21.840]  I'm not a vindictive person. I mean i literally when i was a kid at the ranch a rabid dog was out there running around
[3:44:22.400 --> 3:44:24.240]  And you know my grandma wasn't excited about it
[3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:29.200]  But she walked out with a 243 and shot it. I never even seen her shoot a gun and boy. She's about 100 yards
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:31.440]  She blew that dog away right in the head and
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:36.400]  There wasn't enjoyment about it. I'm not saying calling violence until we clinton god forbid
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:40.160]  I'm just saying they you can't let rabid dogs just run around
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:45.680]  But this is finally a time for reckoning. Uh, this has been long long coming
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:53.520]  They have flouted their nose at the system. They've gotten away literally with murder with corruption with treason bill clinton
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:44:55.360]  sold
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:57.360]  The missile technology
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:06.320]  Targeting technology for this country to the red chinese the boost the reentry in separation the merv the targeting in return for what?
[3:45:06.960 --> 3:45:12.720]  $300,000 in chinese funny money campaign contributions. You should have gone down for that rather than monica louis
[3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:16.640]  That's what I wanted to say. They they they they sold out so cheap
[3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:21.280]  They sold the whole country out for a couple hundred million. Well, because why didn't our government?
[3:45:21.520 --> 3:45:24.640]  You know here's 200 million. Don't sell us out, you know
[3:45:26.320 --> 3:45:30.400]  It is time there will be a time of of reckoning at this point, however
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:35.760]  I think it's important that we let the new president focus on forming an administration
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:38.560]  of like-minded individuals
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:43.680]  I don't want to see a lot of Yale and Harvard graduates in the cabinet
[3:45:43.920 --> 3:45:49.600]  I want to sorry Harvard's been around in the country for 30 years. You people are all in a delusion. You have a Harvard degree
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:54.880]  I'm sorry. Everybody I know that has a Harvard degree is an asshole and it's a dumbass. Well, they're no wait a minute
[3:45:54.880 --> 3:46:01.760]  They're trained to govern. They're educated to govern. How have they done exactly? How well is that going that you ran the most beautiful?
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:04.640]  glistening republic into the ground
[3:46:05.280 --> 3:46:07.280]  So, uh, it's a new day
[3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:11.360]  Uh, it is a we're now going to have a government of the people
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:14.640]  You're going to have a non elitist view
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:18.720]  Of our problems. You're going to have a taking of stock
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:20.800]  but trump knows what he's about and
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:25.680]  He is tough as nails. I've known him 40 years
[3:46:25.840 --> 3:46:29.520]  The man is he's as tough as they come you come out of the world
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:36.320]  Of manhattan real estate. Believe me. Putin is a pushover compared to the people. He's had to deal with
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:40.400]  But then explain me the calculus because the russians aren't perfect and they've got not all in our team
[3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:46.080]  They still have those systems. Putin is trying to promote family lower taxes than we have. I mean, I think overall
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:49.280]  He's a good guy. There's a lot of propaganda against him
[3:46:49.280 --> 3:46:53.200]  But the fact that quite frankly they were doing their job. You're supposed to infiltrate other governments
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:57.440]  They bought hillary that she was doing the stuff for you know selling out america to russia
[3:46:57.520 --> 3:47:00.560]  So russia was doing some espionage with her with trump though
[3:47:00.560 --> 3:47:06.880]  They said the leaders hardliners are like in love with him. They never met him. Is it just the fact that he's such a man
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:10.320]  I think it's because they believe alex that he'll keep his word
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:16.400]  That when he if he reaches agreement on behalf of the united states of america, his word is good
[3:47:16.640 --> 3:47:22.160]  They know he doesn't have a big heart on for them any look. He doesn't want war. I don't think they want war either
[3:47:22.240 --> 3:47:29.760]  That's really the subtext here, which is hillary and the obama policies were hurtling us towards war with russia
[3:47:29.760 --> 3:47:32.880]  I think poot. So i'm gonna ask you again. They weren't involved in any way
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:40.400]  He's an poot like trump. I think would prefer a period of detain. He would prefer a period of negotiation
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:43.600]  But how pissed are the russia's gonna get obviously? He knows they're not even a big economy
[3:47:44.160 --> 3:47:46.160]  Russia's in trouble. He wants to build them up
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:50.080]  But but at the same time what's russia gonna do when trump does deals that are better for us
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:54.320]  I mean they have to know he's gonna I think they know he's a hard-nosed leader if they can get a deal
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:48:00.240]  It's good for both of us. Isn't that better than thermonuclear war, which is what hillary has in mind
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:04.720]  I think the russians particularly the russian people would rather live in peace
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:08.640]  They have their own deep economic problems as do we
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:12.960]  We have a common enemy in isis created by barack obama
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:18.880]  Uh, well, let's bring up by george w bush and barack obama and hillary by hillary armed by hillary. That's right
[3:48:18.880 --> 3:48:21.920]  She's super powered. I'm she care about him. We're gonna break him back take calls for a while
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:25.760]  You'll be gone about 15 minutes and we'll do no facebook mentions on your channel and you're gonna get on the plane
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:30.400]  Uh, but we're about to go to break. What about china people say because this is what the left works
[3:48:31.280 --> 3:48:34.640]  I remember back when clinton got caught selling the missile secrets letting lord alan hughes do it
[3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:35.600]  They went
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:38.720]  I remember having seen and actually called me the first time I was ever seen in and they go
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:40.880]  Was on there they go
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:44.240]  No, I was like 26 years old. They go. Are you anti-asian?
[3:48:44.800 --> 3:48:47.760]  And I didn't play the race card that my sister's korean adopted
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:52.160]  And I said I said no, I mean china suppresses the people of china
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:54.480]  I'm against the communist regime
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:59.760]  But they now say oh people are anti china. Well, I don't want a centralized government taking over all six
[3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:04.000]  Will china let us take over their media all six hollywood studios now happening
[3:49:04.480 --> 3:49:07.840]  The the left is so panicking. They're like just spread their legs and went china
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:13.680]  We're merging with you help us beat the patriots. This is sedition. So here's the deal
[3:49:13.680 --> 3:49:19.040]  I don't care if you were russian german, whoever you are the russians aren't around here trying to take over
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:22.000]  The communist chinese are and let me explain something
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:25.280]  I think communist chinese spies other people need to
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:29.680]  Get dealt with real fast. We need to roll them up. The big threat is china
[3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:32.320]  Assange has said this
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:35.840]  When it comes to hacking in the international community
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:40.000]  They're the ones you need to be concerned about look the chinese
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:46.160]  Chinese like the russians. They oppress christians. They oppress gays. They oppress women
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:48.560]  This is an oppressive society
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:53.040]  We don't buy into putin's totalitarianism any more than we do the red chinese
[3:49:53.520 --> 3:49:59.120]  But in donald frump, they have a tough customer. They have a guy who understands their let's be fair russia's
[3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:03.920]  Reinsurgent christian right wing stuff is like not the same universe as china with mobile execution fans
[3:50:03.920 --> 3:50:10.640]  No, look china. China is the great satan there. That's the real evil on the planet and that's who we ought to be concerned of it
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:17.680]  And that's who the clintons were dealing with so trump understands who the bad exactly like like like like let's say hillary's a prostitute
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:22.720]  Hard power china's having sex with her 25 times a day. Sorry. Maybe what two or three times?

[3:50:26.560 --> 3:50:31.280]  Uh, oh, that's a good little little bit. It's a good analogy. It's a great analogy. I think it's exactly right
[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:36.560]  Trump knows who who the evil ones are. He knows who the enemy is. That's why I think he's going to be a great president

[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:40.480]  30 something thousand phone calls in like an hour once on our digital system?
[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:45.360]  I'm not kidding. People can't get in so I don't want to get the number out before we're given our internal number
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:50.160]  So they can call in but I'm in the studio and don't have the sunday number. What's our local number here?

[3:54:57.680 --> 3:54:59.680]  That was on there right or two five three nine
[3:54:59.680 --> 3:55:06.320]  All right, so the number again eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine

[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:21.840]  I'm gonna go find out soon to how many millions. It was 27 million plus just on video streams as of 30 something hours
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:24.320]  36 hours on the broadcast. We've already passed
[3:55:24.320 --> 3:55:29.840]  Um, we're about to pass 52 right now Roger stones here with us for at least another hour or so
[3:55:30.160 --> 3:55:33.200]  But I want to go to your phone calls once we come back here in just a moment
[3:55:33.760 --> 3:55:36.000]  But so much is unfolding so much is happening
[3:55:36.000 --> 3:55:37.520]  We're going to go ahead and be in this at a moment
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:41.840]  And then if your stations aren't carrying us info wars.com forward slash show, but roger
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:45.120]  What does it say that with no marketing money?
[3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:52.160]  Info wars. I'm not tuning our horn. It's like this is crazy that we had 27 million people
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:56.640]  Tune in on video streams in 30 something hours separate from the fact
[3:55:56.640 --> 3:55:59.680]  We're on terrestrial radio and the mainstream media's response is
[3:56:00.160 --> 3:56:03.680]  Alex Jones is an internet show. Well, I actually want that
[3:56:04.240 --> 3:56:09.680]  Name it's like saying drudge is internet. It's like saying Alex Jones is a rocket ship show or Alex Jones is a you know
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:16.400]  A mom and apple pie show. This is the future without their big corporate system. I beat their ass. That's even better
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:22.240]  No, exactly right. So but again, it's a lead ism. I don't think there's a recognition of how many people
[3:56:22.640 --> 3:56:29.680]  How many patriots are tuning in they don't understand the power that is being amassed here
[3:56:30.400 --> 3:56:31.760]  for reform
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:36.080]  Uh, and frankly, it's kind of good that you're under the radar for as long as it's kind of good
[3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:37.040]  They're so delusional
[3:56:37.040 --> 3:56:43.600]  Well, because they will try to close us down when they figure out that we are reaching the foot soldiers of the new american revolution
[3:56:43.600 --> 3:56:48.800]  They will close us down. Uh, and look, they're sorry. They ever let the internet happen
[3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:54.480]  But there's no governor Rockefeller said that there's no letting the center face back into the tube
[3:56:55.040 --> 3:57:00.000]  It's not going to happen. This is why the idea of turning over the internet to the un
[3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:04.880]  To the un is obama out of his mind. By the way guys, where'd my phone go?
[3:57:06.160 --> 3:57:07.360]  Well, here it is
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:10.240]  I don't get an inside baseball, but i'm waiting a certain phone call here
[3:57:10.240 --> 3:57:14.640]  Uh, I was totally ready for but but you you're over there. Have you had a chance to talk to the candidate yet?
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:19.360]  I have the president. I'm sorry. I have president elect. I have not spoken to the president elect
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:26.320]  I am heading to new york, and I'm hopeful that that will happen. I also understand that he's got to be extraordinarily busy
[3:57:26.800 --> 3:57:29.920]  Uh, plus he needs to breathe. I mean, I've never seen the kind of
[3:57:30.800 --> 3:57:38.720]  Herculean physical effort on a candidate as he expended in these last everyone's it was the total opposite of hillary 70 years old
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:45.280]  Uh, and just thriving on the energy of the crowds. I worked for reagan. I worked for nixon
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:50.640]  I worked for dole all great men. This is nothing all right, and they worked hard don't get me wrong
[3:57:50.720 --> 3:57:55.600]  But i've never seen a physical effort like donald trump. And by the way, I don't want to give us an inside baseball
[3:57:55.680 --> 3:57:58.240]  My conversation with trump, but when you talk to trump
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:04.080]  It's all about energy and he says that he says i love america. Did you feel yes?
[3:58:04.080 --> 3:58:09.280]  I felt and we're just like give these conversations about it about you know, he he's really into the remember he goes about
[3:58:09.680 --> 3:58:14.960]  Black people. I love their energy. It's not a kind of sincere inner. So we need to maybe these people are powerful
[3:58:14.960 --> 3:58:19.280]  We turn them loose. Yeah, it's true. No, look, I remember when he said to me
[3:58:19.920 --> 3:58:24.240]  You can't believe how many hillary for prison t-shirts there are in my crowds
[3:58:24.560 --> 3:58:29.440]  There's hundreds of them. You've got to see it. There's hundreds of them. No, he gets it. He totally gets it
[3:58:29.440 --> 3:58:33.760]  He loves the energy of liberty. We'll be back stay where this we're live worldwide spread the link be part of the revolution
[3:58:33.760 --> 3:58:36.320]  Spread the link they hate it. We're killing the mainstream media right now
