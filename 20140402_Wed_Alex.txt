[00:41.240 --> 00:46.040]  be throwing out the news is so insane so over the top it's very clear what the
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.480]  establishment's trying to do they're trying to overthrow reality right now
[00:49.480 --> 00:55.420]  the system is trying to absolutely put out so much propaganda so much
[00:55.420 --> 01:03.800]  disinformation so much ridiculous lies that people basically shut down and go
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.840]  into a catatonic state that is undoubtedly what is being attempted
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.800]  with Obamacare and a host of other issues Nancy Pelosi came out we're gonna
[01:14.800 --> 01:19.160]  play the clip coming up later and last night and said that videos up on
[01:19.160 --> 01:22.680]  info wars calm and Nancy Pelosi came out and so we've got to stop these
[01:22.680 --> 01:25.280]  anti-government people that don't like Obamacare that they're basically
[01:25.280 --> 01:30.320]  terrorist and that the founding fathers would want Obamacare yes the founding
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.040]  fathers would want a foreign consortium of banks that own and control the major
[01:35.040 --> 01:41.120]  insurance companies to lobby to have a private tax passed to transfer money
[01:41.120 --> 01:48.120]  directly to them that is exactly what the founding fathers were fighting
[01:48.120 --> 01:54.600]  against ladies and gentlemen and it it is otherworldly the level of baloney
[01:54.600 --> 01:58.320]  that we're facing here we're gonna be breaking that down obama says the
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.760]  debate is over repealing the law is over of course the laws but never been

[09:41.720 --> 09:49.520]  intend to open the phones up and get your take on the issues that we're going
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.640]  to be throwing out there first-time callers yet again for the first few
[09:52.640 --> 09:56.360]  rounds of calls that I'll probably go to very quickly at the end of the next
[09:56.360 --> 10:00.200]  hour I'm not really being sarcastic I'll try to go to them early this hour
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.200]  because I want to cycle through a bunch of your calls and talk about planet
[10:04.200 --> 10:07.600]  hoax that we were discussing yesterday what are the biggest hoaxes in our
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.640]  society how do we pull down these hoaxes because the bigger the hoax as
[10:11.640 --> 10:17.080]  Hitler said the more you can get away with the bigger the lie if the system
[10:17.080 --> 10:20.600]  parrots it people have cognitive dissidents and don't want to admit
[10:20.600 --> 10:24.080]  they're being lied to or their individuals and don't know how to
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.200]  communicate to each other that they're in on being awake to the fact that it's
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.400]  a hoax the last domino to fall is that the majority of us don't like Obamacare
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.520]  the majority of us don't like turning our guns in the majority of us don't
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.320]  like world government the majority of us don't like the banker bailouts the
[10:41.320 --> 10:45.560]  majority of us don't like GMO in the food supply the majority of us don't
[10:45.560 --> 10:52.960]  like tyranny the majority of us like liberty and justice and freedom and we
[10:52.960 --> 10:55.760]  have to start communicating with each other the system wants us watching
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.840]  television all day not talking to our neighbors not having softball games not
[10:59.840 --> 11:04.240]  having barbecues they want us fighting with each other they they want women
[11:04.240 --> 11:07.680]  believing they're not successful because of men they want men believing
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.360]  they're not successful because of women we've got articles up on info wars calm
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.840]  and I knew this was coming because this is what they push in the nanny state that
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.200]  if you laugh at your kids when they do something funny which is what kids love
[11:20.200 --> 11:25.600]  that that's abuse and they'll be taken or that if you drink in front of your
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.040]  children your children will be taken in the UK they're openly announcing if
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.560]  you're basically in the UK the fastest growing party that's like Ron Paul light
[11:34.560 --> 11:40.280]  basically they're not even as hardcore or more like Rand Paul led by Nigel
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.400]  Farage a frequent guest on the show that many members of the party on that
[11:44.400 --> 11:48.880]  they'll come take your kids the mayor of London has said take the children of
[11:48.880 --> 11:57.760]  nationalist that is flaming dangerous tyranny folks if anybody should be
[11:57.760 --> 12:03.080]  investigated if anybody should be arrested it's people who say arrest
[12:03.080 --> 12:08.560]  people for free speech see because you've got free speech until you call for
[12:08.560 --> 12:11.720]  taking someone else's free speech then you're trying to violate somebody's
[12:11.720 --> 12:16.600]  civil rights then you're trying to enslave someone then you're trying to
[12:16.600 --> 12:23.440]  usurp someone then you are a criminal get that straight you got free speech
[12:23.440 --> 12:26.880]  until you try to take somebody's rights you got free speech until you say go out
[12:26.880 --> 12:33.720]  and kill somebody that's why people call into this show about the videos of
[12:33.720 --> 12:37.400]  police shooting homeless people and beating homeless people to death and
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.960]  people get angry and they say I'm taking names of locals and I'm gonna start
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.280]  shooting cops I don't want to hear that on my show we're not gonna act like some
[12:46.280 --> 12:50.400]  of the bad police departments do we're going to be the highest standards like
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.120]  George Washington and if the system wants a civil war and starts one and
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.840]  comes after us then we're going to win it but we're not going to commit war
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.560]  crimes if this goes into a civil war believe me they're gonna do those and
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.280]  pin them on us so the last thing we want to do is commit war crimes we've got
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.320]  the moral high ground folks we're going to keep it the enemy is gonna try to
[13:13.320 --> 13:17.280]  take it away from us I'd rather wake everybody up in the system on average
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.960]  you hunger for freedom almost everybody hungers for freedom folks almost
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.320]  everybody hungers for justice they just don't know what justice is because
[13:24.320 --> 13:29.040]  there are criminal systems within the system and a police officer called in
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.920]  yesterday he didn't say it was one I could tell he was and he said that's the
[13:32.920 --> 13:37.200]  problem is you've got to differentiate the fraudulent projected globalist model
[13:37.200 --> 13:41.800]  that is over our republic not that our republic was ever perfect but the idea
[13:41.800 --> 13:47.600]  of it is near perfect and has never been realized but is the idea that grew into
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.360]  so many of the liberties we have enjoyed now there's a counter revolution
[13:51.360 --> 13:58.520]  against those basic freedoms and every one of us is a guardian of freedom
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.480]  every one of us is being robbed when they try to take our second amendment or
[14:03.480 --> 14:06.840]  our first amendment or our property rights or our parental rights number one
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.880]  or our religious rights and a religious freedom is under attack in this
[14:10.880 --> 14:15.440]  country parental freedom and family freedom is under attack in this country
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.720]  property rights is under mega attack in this country free speech is under attack
[14:20.720 --> 14:23.840]  in this country the right to self-defense is under attack the right
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.000]  to be a straight male is under attack in this country the right to be a
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.320]  traditional female is under attack in this country the system is not trying to
[14:33.320 --> 14:38.280]  bring in tolerance it's trying to bring in an overwrite of the genetic code of
[14:38.280 --> 14:44.840]  humanity and the rest of the species on this planet in a psychological warfare
[14:44.840 --> 14:53.840]  technotronic genetic engineering revolution system ladies and gentlemen I
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.680]  want to explain to everybody before I get into Obamacare and all the news where
[14:57.680 --> 15:07.600]  I stand because some people will tune in and say he criticizes black leaders but
[15:07.600 --> 15:12.880]  then says he's against aborting half the black people and some people send me
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.320]  emails and say I don't understand the paradox why don't you like Obama and
[15:17.320 --> 15:23.360]  why do you attack the the the mainline black culture that's sold by Hollywood
[15:23.360 --> 15:29.560]  as an overwrite I'm not just black culture but that was the test case but
[15:29.560 --> 15:34.240]  the entire culture system well I mean isn't it clear I'm for justice I'm
[15:34.240 --> 15:40.080]  against killing 52% of black people before they're born does that mean then I
[15:40.080 --> 15:43.400]  like black people from birth being taught I'm an evil devil and that I'm
[15:43.400 --> 15:46.760]  the cause of all the problems and that and that and that being white is
[15:46.760 --> 15:51.520]  inherently bad no I don't like that see I want justice see I sit there and I
[15:51.520 --> 15:56.880]  look at each issue and I decide what is justice and then I think how would I
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.280]  want to be treated and I think what what makes my soul feel good what makes me
[16:01.280 --> 16:07.080]  feel like I'm doing the right thing what makes my conscience feel good see see
[16:07.080 --> 16:12.320]  I'm against forcibly injecting every Mexican girl at the age of 11 with
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.560]  Gardasil that will reduce their fertility and will give them autoimmune
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.000]  problems and will sterilize and kill some of them two years ago they began the
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.560]  forced inoculation of every Mexican girl in Mexico and people will say Alex
[16:25.560 --> 16:28.720]  good look you don't like all the illegals porn across taking the jobs
[16:28.720 --> 16:34.760]  vote to take your guns hey shut up about it kill the Mexicans see see right
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.800]  there folks no I don't like every Mexican radio TV channel being anti-gun
[16:40.800 --> 16:46.720]  anti-freedom anti-gringo anti-black funded by the Ford Foundation to create
[16:46.720 --> 16:50.240]  Balkanization and division I want those people to be prosperous I want them to
[16:50.240 --> 16:53.960]  live I want them to discover freedom I want them to have a future they're

[25:34.120 --> 25:39.400]  finishing up with all the racial and religious other forms of division the
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.160]  globalist employee it doesn't mean that there aren't real issues in there and
[25:43.160 --> 25:47.680]  real beefs and and real vendetta's on all different sides and different
[25:47.680 --> 25:53.520]  perspectives but what I'm saying is the globalist are like an alien species from
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.640]  deep space I'm not saying literally but using the allegory who are here to
[25:58.640 --> 26:04.280]  overwrite everything with a computer robot takeover in their own words to
[26:04.280 --> 26:08.280]  replace humans human life has always been cheap since the time of the Pharaohs
[26:08.280 --> 26:15.400]  and Babylon now it's garbage to be carried out and thrown away at the curb
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.760]  and we're being taught collectively to get into this and to see survival of
[26:20.760 --> 26:24.720]  the species as death that doesn't mean there aren't problems in our
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.600]  civilization it doesn't mean there isn't overpopulation in some areas it
[26:28.600 --> 26:31.320]  doesn't mean there aren't some dirty technologies it doesn't mean that we
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.320]  don't need to work together globally to fix these problems the issue is the
[26:36.320 --> 26:41.640]  globalist running it are super bad people who even target the smartest and
[26:41.640 --> 26:48.080]  most virtuous to control them because they want death and destruction they're
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.440]  not trying to save the planet they believe they're gonna become God and
[26:51.440 --> 26:55.920]  merge with the machines in their own words look it up I'd say this 15 years
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.440]  ago people thought it was crazy now it's all over the news it's in every movie you
[26:59.440 --> 27:03.000]  see it on CNN telling you how great it is oh your kids are all gonna have
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.280]  brain chips oh the military is getting them see how it's all just being announced
[27:08.280 --> 27:13.680]  and then the system uses political correctness to go turn your guns in or
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.240]  your racist support obama carry your racist and I will not sit here and
[27:18.240 --> 27:21.640]  apologize when somebody comes up to me on the street and says you know I like
[27:21.640 --> 27:28.200]  your show but I heard your racist it's usually white yuppies that do it or a
[27:28.200 --> 27:31.680]  Hispanic person walks over because I really like your show but this doesn't
[27:31.680 --> 27:35.120]  happen very often but happens as though you know I'm pro second amendment you
[27:35.120 --> 27:39.320]  know are you against Hispanics cuz you you don't want amnesty I'm like can I
[27:39.320 --> 27:42.840]  have amnesty down to Mexico can I go down there and have everything free the
[27:42.840 --> 27:50.080]  systems corrupt why does it want it why does both parties want it because it's
[27:50.080 --> 27:54.560]  game over folks when the globalists get enough people in here who will vote to
[27:54.560 --> 27:58.640]  take the liberties away because we're now a democracy not a republic they
[27:58.640 --> 28:02.200]  brought us into a democracy where people believe that what the public votes
[28:02.200 --> 28:08.360]  for you get if they vote to bring slavery back slavery comes back in no
[28:08.360 --> 28:11.800]  that in the republic that's illegal you go well then why was it legal because
[28:11.800 --> 28:16.040]  they never fully realized it they almost outlawed it in 1798 did you know
[28:16.040 --> 28:19.520]  that did you know Thomas Jefferson tried to do that when he was president as
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.080]  well while was being outlawed around the rest of the world was an outlawed until
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.000]  the 1880s in some areas of the Austrian and Hungarian Empire white slaves but
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.880]  see that's never taught in schools because it because then people wouldn't
[28:32.880 --> 28:37.480]  have a inferiority complex that only slaves are black and the only people
[28:37.480 --> 28:40.080]  that have ever you know people what are you trying to do cover up the plot of
[28:40.080 --> 28:43.920]  black people as if a black person's whole future and identity was that some
[28:43.920 --> 28:46.880]  of their ancestors were oppressed when everybody's ancestors were oppressed
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.080]  sure that's part of your strength that you now survive and you're here that's
[28:50.080 --> 28:57.520]  part of your will that's not some weak thing but your identity goes forward and
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.000]  it's certainly not the new world order with its new slavery coming in its total
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  slavery over the human species and over the human process see that is the real
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.480]  enemy that is the total enslavement the theft of the will the theft of the
[29:12.480 --> 29:17.200]  spirit the trafficking and men's souls that revelations talks about that's the
[29:17.200 --> 29:21.080]  big threat and that's what we should come together around if the globalist are
[29:21.080 --> 29:24.920]  for gun control we're against it if they're for open borders we're against it
[29:24.920 --> 29:28.040]  if they're for world government we're against it because they're the authors
[29:28.040 --> 29:35.480]  of it and everything they do is done to undermine and enslave they tell America
[29:35.480 --> 29:39.120]  don't be nationalistic except world government they tell England the same
[29:39.120 --> 29:43.160]  thing they tell Germany the same thing as they flood all those countries with

[33:40.920 --> 33:49.080]  silent green is in short supply remember Tuesday is silent green day the supply of
[33:49.080 --> 33:53.920]  green has been exhausted you must evacuate the area
[33:53.920 --> 34:00.920]  that the shareholders of PepsiCo Big Builder Bird Group company are not
[34:00.920 --> 34:06.040]  allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.880]  already know so enjoy the flavor we're going to get the real solution which is
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.640]  going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes I'm consistently
[34:14.640 --> 34:19.560]  pro-death I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular zoocent I'm for whatever
[34:19.560 --> 34:23.320]  gets the freeway moment is spending a million dollars on that last three months
[34:23.320 --> 34:28.520]  of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the those 10
[34:28.520 --> 34:33.080]  teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs but that's called the
[34:33.080 --> 34:38.120]  death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion they told me to to
[34:38.120 --> 34:51.960]  say that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable is this the kind of
[34:51.960 --> 34:55.640]  society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its
[34:55.640 --> 35:00.440]  children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.680]  that kind of society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on
[35:05.680 --> 35:09.880]  its prison guards on the quiz lings and the collaborators who make that possible
[35:09.880 --> 35:16.600]  this is nothing but a suicide call the scoops are on their way the scoops are
[35:16.600 --> 35:22.760]  on their way I repeat the scoops are on their way you will find out why
[35:22.760 --> 35:47.600]  soylent green means life you will find out why soylent green means that you've
[35:47.600 --> 35:54.320]  got to tell them you've got to tell them out there very powerful piece it'll be
[35:54.320 --> 35:59.240]  going up on info wars calm in the next 20 minutes also tweeted at real Alex
[35:59.240 --> 36:04.400]  Jones and posted top of the page Facebook great job Darren McBreen putting
[36:04.400 --> 36:12.320]  that piece together and it says it all and when I come in and see a piece like
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.640]  that he didn't last three or four days that I collaborated with him on and it
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.560]  just absolutely is like when in a Super Bowl for me because I just a dream of
[36:23.560 --> 36:27.600]  trying to illustrate to people how much trouble we're in because we can then fix
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.520]  it you got to tell them soon they'll be breeding it's like cattle
[36:32.520 --> 36:37.280]  soylent green it's made out of people the new world order is made out of people
[36:37.280 --> 36:45.080]  it's making us ugly it's making culture bad so we will accept being killed it's
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.320]  a very dark wicked logic the globalist have but they have to dehumanize us
[36:49.320 --> 36:55.280]  first and have us accept them killing us and believe we're ugly and believe
[36:55.280 --> 37:00.120]  we're bad and believe we're crud before they can do it the vampire has to get
[37:00.120 --> 37:08.040]  permission to come in it needs you to invite it in it needs you to give it
[37:08.040 --> 37:13.680]  sucker it needs you to give it truck it needs you to give it countenance
[37:13.680 --> 37:23.200]  table to be aided to be abetted and America has let it in haven't we were
[37:23.200 --> 37:29.120]  we not the castle on the hill great evil abided here but also a great spirit
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.440]  of exploration a great spirit of building a great spirit of liberty a
[37:35.440 --> 37:41.480]  great spirit of renaissance and where the flower of liberty as there is the
[37:41.480 --> 37:48.280]  spirit of God the enemy will have its battle here in North America the fight
[37:48.280 --> 37:52.960]  for the future of the planet is taking place here now the rest of the world's
[37:52.960 --> 38:00.280]  incredibly important but the elite see the United States is the new Atlantis
[38:00.280 --> 38:07.400]  they believe the future is set the destiny of what we do it's so important
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.560]  we don't just fight for our republic we don't just fight for our children we
[38:11.560 --> 38:18.600]  don't just fight for ourselves we fight against a spirit of anti-human garbage
[38:18.600 --> 38:25.920]  I don't want to be part of that spirit I don't want to see others as something
[38:25.920 --> 38:30.400]  that's making me weak I want to see others as something that are built up to
[38:30.400 --> 38:39.080]  make me stronger it's the feeling of honor the feeling of kinship the feeling
[38:39.080 --> 38:43.360]  of everything our ancestors did before us
[38:43.360 --> 38:51.640]  the establishment is attacking the human genome on record to destroy the
[38:51.640 --> 38:57.120]  encoded race memories the epigenetics that are 100% documented from every
[38:57.120 --> 39:02.400]  angle they're attempting to savage the incredible honor that is the human
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.720]  species the incredible struggle and the survival and everything we carry with us
[39:07.720 --> 39:13.320]  we are our ancestors I do not believe in reincarnation in the classical Hindu or
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.000]  Buddhist sense I believe in the scientific fact but what I've also
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.680]  physically experienced that I am one man set and destined to live but once
[39:26.800 --> 39:33.120]  but I am the genetic code of all of my ancestors and their experiences and
[39:33.120 --> 39:40.480]  their key memories crystallized physically in that 98% of the DNA that
[39:40.480 --> 39:46.960]  the scientists told us was garbage they now know it is encoded memories and
[39:46.960 --> 39:53.440]  genetics carrying the emergency lifeboats of our species into the future
[39:53.440 --> 40:03.360]  into space and that's what I want is a victory for the species a victory the
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.880]  churches keep this secret from you that is their job the preachers don't know
[40:06.880 --> 40:10.400]  ladies and gentlemen the eye has not seen the air is not heard what God has
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.440]  in store for us but these preachers in their limited view give you some 17th
[40:14.440 --> 40:20.640]  century or 15th century skewed human view of something that can only be
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.480]  experienced and known in the spirit and integrating that with the mysteries and
[40:25.480 --> 40:30.280]  the science that the eye is not seen here is not heard imagine someone 2000
[40:30.280 --> 40:37.640]  years ago seeing what's going on today it would be a fantastic vision unrivaled
[40:37.640 --> 40:44.400]  it would be John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos
[40:47.360 --> 40:59.280]  think about it made in the image of the universal creator that's heavy and they
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.200]  would say the establishment oh your crud humans are nothing but done animals
[41:03.200 --> 41:08.000]  yeah right that creates spaceships and atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs and
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.760]  poetry you know I want to play child role into the dark tower came and if you
[41:14.760 --> 41:17.800]  type that into YouTube I'll show you the version I want I want to play it later
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.560]  after I take calls let me just show you the version I keep meaning to play this
[41:21.560 --> 41:40.360]  and to the dark tower came it's the military cultural
[41:40.360 --> 41:48.280]  chivalry experience of the French bail off is to the Vikings in the English
[41:48.280 --> 41:55.680]  they'll said to the Spanish my first thought was he lied in every word that
[41:55.680 --> 42:01.160]  horny crippled malicious eye a scans to watch the working of his lie upon mine
[42:01.160 --> 42:09.280]  and mouth scare able to afford suppression of glee that burst and score
[42:09.280 --> 42:14.520]  its edge as one more victim gained thereby that's what people think when
[42:14.520 --> 42:18.600]  they first hear me the young man starting out on his journey to become a
[42:18.600 --> 42:24.120]  man to become a knight sees the old man pointing the way the old man is him the
[42:24.120 --> 42:28.960]  old man tells him the challenge of life and tells him the fraud of the common
[42:28.960 --> 42:41.920]  world and the man tells the truth but the youth thinks he lies and he was an
[42:41.920 --> 42:52.680]  old cripple with bloody eyes through the storms of life to the dark tower came
[42:52.680 --> 42:58.640]  and Dauntless lifted the slug horn to his lips in blue child Rowland the dark
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.560]  tower came says everything in that poem it's a long poem I can read the whole
[43:03.560 --> 43:06.960]  thing on there but I'll play it later by the time
[43:06.960 --> 43:14.000]  Dauntless lifted the slug horn to his lips in blue
[43:15.320 --> 43:20.080]  all right let me get back to the news here the whole point is I celebrate life
[43:20.080 --> 43:25.240]  I celebrate honor I celebrate being true and that's why the whole enemy and the
[43:25.240 --> 43:29.800]  whole system does everything they can and edits my voice and does everything to
[43:29.800 --> 43:34.840]  say I am dishonorable but I will tell you I am as honorable as they come and
[43:34.840 --> 43:40.920]  still I am dishonorable and I am ashamed of my dishonor and I expect to go
[43:40.920 --> 43:46.960]  through the test to prove my honor as my ancestors did and pass on my genetics
[43:46.960 --> 43:55.720]  forward into the future and it is in the rediscovery of being honorable that we
[43:55.720 --> 44:02.280]  will be fulfilled and that is our future if we take our destiny in our hands
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.960]  instead of letting the establishment tell us our destiny in every dystopic
[44:06.960 --> 44:12.160]  sci-fi film and every cultural weapon formed against us to tell us we are
[44:12.160 --> 44:19.120]  ugly and broken and gone and have no future that is a giant fraud
[44:23.680 --> 44:32.120]  now let's go to the scientific working of the lie in manifest pure evil that the
[44:32.120 --> 44:35.960]  Democratic Party has now engaged him I watch other governments and the only
[44:35.960 --> 44:40.720]  governments I see that lie at this level are the North Koreans people say well
[44:40.720 --> 44:45.840]  why are the lies so over the top it's so ridiculous that is a tool employed in
[44:45.840 --> 44:49.960]  Soviet mind control not saying this conspiracy Soviet Soviet was a
[44:49.960 --> 44:54.160]  technology developed in the West visited as a plague upon the poor Russians
[44:54.160 --> 44:57.680]  and then their victims after their country was used in the exploitation phase
[44:57.680 --> 45:09.360]  to take down the next domino but I look at the social engineering and saying we
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.120]  you can keep your doctor it cuts the price it covers pre-existing conditions
[45:14.120 --> 45:19.520]  none of it true and the victims for six months thinking that they've signed up
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.440]  I told you that most of them had signed up it turns out it's all the fraud I
[45:23.440 --> 45:27.080]  told you the website wouldn't work to make it about the website not about the
[45:27.080 --> 45:32.160]  law and to confuse the whole thing and to confound people in a in a in a
[45:32.160 --> 45:39.120]  squids ink in a in a fog of war in a in a system to confound and confuse
[45:39.120 --> 45:51.440]  waging war on reality and now I've never seen anyone lie in a scientific way
[45:51.440 --> 45:56.520]  like this except North Korea and folks I'm seeing North Koreans type statements
[45:56.520 --> 46:03.080]  all over TV that everyone loves it everything is wonderful everyone loves
[46:03.080 --> 46:09.240]  Obama he gave us everything and that we should just cry and beg and thank you
[46:09.240 --> 46:12.720]  moldy this is what Obama supporters look like at his rallies crying and
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.760]  collapsing and shwooning as they spiritually climb into Ted Bundy's
[46:17.760 --> 46:23.800]  yellow Volkswagen it is so sickening to see this going on and here is Obama
[46:23.800 --> 46:30.240]  saying it's too late it's all over everyone must accept it everyone loves
[46:30.240 --> 46:36.120]  Obamacare it's helping people see the shining sea there's no way to repeal it
[46:36.120 --> 46:41.960]  the debate is over because we could easily repeal it it's incredibly unpopular
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.760]  upwards of 80% or higher it's totally criminal it's totally unfair the way
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.760]  it's a portion and when the way major corporations are exempt it's a tax to
[46:50.760 --> 46:54.680]  foreign banks but they're giving cover to the Republican leadership to not kill
[46:54.680 --> 47:01.680]  it and to go everybody loves it it's a giant confidence game here is Obama this
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.440]  law is doing what it's supposed to do destroy America it's working right in
[47:06.440 --> 47:11.360]  the country's back people from coast to coast go to part-time all of which makes
[47:11.360 --> 47:16.560]  the links increase it's have gone to scare people oh increase payroll under
[47:16.560 --> 47:21.720]  mine the law or try to repeal the law without offering any plausible alternative
[47:21.720 --> 47:28.640]  really hard to understand offer total I gotta admit I don't get it why are
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.920]  folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance oh yeah that's
[47:32.920 --> 47:38.200]  what we're doing why are they so mad about the idea of folks having health
[47:38.200 --> 47:46.400]  insurance many of the tall tales that have been told about this law have been
[47:46.400 --> 47:52.880]  debunked tall tales there are still no death panels no you don't call them
[47:52.880 --> 47:59.400]  those it's so fun again has not arrived all right that's enough and he goes on
[47:59.400 --> 48:02.440]  to talk about people talk claiming tyranny we may go back to more of it
[48:02.440 --> 48:05.880]  it's hard to listen to ladies and gentlemen but ladies and gentlemen it
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.760]  raised the payroll tax it is increasing the prices it does shut up these
[48:10.760 --> 48:15.640]  health boards that decide what type of care to give and I have Bill Gates and I
[48:15.640 --> 48:21.320]  played it earlier today and we have Zeco Emanuel saying there's death panels
[48:21.320 --> 48:30.680]  and we have all the other pundits saying it Bill Maher it's in there and he
[48:30.680 --> 48:35.920]  got he calls it tall tales this this is the guy telling us that he never said
[48:35.920 --> 48:44.000]  you could keep your doctor now Nancy Pelosi is doesn't want to be outdone by
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.120]  Obama so she had this to say yes they they're not gonna campaign on it oh no
[48:48.120 --> 48:51.520]  they're gonna move on now to open borders and shutting down more of your
[48:51.520 --> 48:58.880]  jobs of course what does she care I mean you know she's a total narcissistic
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.360]  megalomaniac parasite we don't think we needed any vindication we just had it
[49:03.360 --> 49:10.400]  protected from those ideological anti-government people who who didn't
[49:10.400 --> 49:15.040]  want to see it succeed for ideological or political or whatever their reasons
[49:15.040 --> 49:20.480]  are but the fact is oh the fact is let's hear the rest I'm sorry get something
[49:20.480 --> 49:25.680]  done for people so taking the heat on something like that well that's what
[49:25.680 --> 49:29.720]  that's enough yes see it's targeted at totally dumb down people we got to do
[49:29.720 --> 49:33.840]  something for the people does that mean throwing them into incinerators I mean
[49:33.840 --> 49:39.200]  it's a we got to reform things you know if you put a car in a giant car
[49:39.200 --> 49:45.200]  compactor it's reformed you could call that progress but it's not you call a
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.080]  dead body eaten up by cancer five minutes dead you could call it progress
[49:49.080 --> 49:54.080]  it's not anything could be progress progress of cancer anything could be
[49:54.080 --> 49:58.520]  reform they play these word games you know this is the process in 50 years
[49:58.520 --> 50:00.840]  getting government involved in health care and ruining the best health care
[50:00.840 --> 50:04.160]  in the world now people don't know how to get health care it's way overpriced
[50:04.160 --> 50:07.440]  because the corporations are in there screwing everybody and the same
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.760]  corporations that have screwed everybody wrote Obamacare what is it you
[50:11.760 --> 50:17.040]  idiot Democrats do not get about that and by the way you moron Republicans
[50:17.040 --> 50:20.760]  this is not socialism straight-up socialism would be bad because it allows
[50:20.760 --> 50:26.440]  social engineering and the globalist are you Genesis but socialism would be
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.960]  better than this plan this is the greatest most over-the-top ridiculous
[50:30.960 --> 50:36.600]  screw job I could even think of it is over the top and his response is
[50:36.600 --> 50:40.560]  people are telling tall tales buddy everybody who's got a room temperature
[50:40.560 --> 50:44.720]  IQ knows you're the front man telling tall tales you and that you in that
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.120]  scumbag Joe bite you in that bobblehead con artists up there laughing and
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.360]  giggling all day like he's trying to trick a bunch of little kids I'm not a
[50:52.360 --> 51:01.440]  little kid and I see through your lies I see you and your soul is dead how can
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.040]  you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies by having your own in-home

[51:37.200 --> 51:41.120]  interest forcing taxes to serve us debt this capitalism or was Jefferson correct
[51:41.120 --> 51:44.360]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[51:44.360 --> 51:46.240]  the liberties of the people than a standing army

[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.320]  level I mean there's two things one not only the politicians doing everything

[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.600]  what the thing is when you try to battle things locally and I know this from you
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.120]  know being on a school board the schools are so limited on having any sort of
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.840]  local decision-making because basically what the I'll give you per example just
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.200]  a few weeks ago in the state of Ohio they wanted to make sure that every school
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.520]  board are here to this polling policy which basically is from a it's a great

[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.680]  trespassers punching and shoving people we're not turning our guns in and we're

[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.440]  which side we're on and what we're going to do I know many of you've already
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.920]  made that decision they've been battling against the tyrants for years and we're
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.760]  holding back much of their programs much of their progress we're taking your
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:35.080]  phone calls right now but I want to play one more clip of Nancy Pelosi saying the
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:44.400]  founding fathers would absolutely support Obamacare they're those who are
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.200]  critics and they've been bumps in the road but they've only been turbulence
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.760]  they have not been an obstacle to the American people having a healthier
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:01.240]  life but our founders wanted for them life healthier life liberty the freedom
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:07.360]  to pursue their happiness not job-locked but having benefits that
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:13.240]  healthcare policies that they can that are portable they could be self-employed
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.160]  be a photographer they could start their own business they could change jobs they
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.360]  could reach their aspirations and isn't that a wonderful thing for society and
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:30.160]  for an economy any questions yep and that's from the Daily Caller grab that
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:38.600]  clip so let's give you something free let's increase healthcare prices let's
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.480]  con the youth and to have any go get it let's bring in death panels and remember
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.520]  Obama came out of play the clip last hour and said quote the debate is over
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.400]  repealing this law is over of course it's more unpopular than ever upwards of
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.320]  80% or higher and falling apart totally criminal and selectively enforced
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.760]  discriminatory just absolute nightmare and him and Joe Biden said around say
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  there are no death panels you're right they don't call them death panels you're
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.880]  right there's no chemtrails because that's a parochial countryside term it's
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:16.280]  geo-engineering you're right there's no FEMA camps that's a hayseed name a
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.960]  a populist name they're called emergency centers they're called
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:29.120]  emergency establishment act the civilian inmate labor camp program rec

[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:41.240]  looking up they play those lawyer games with you oh this is in a police state

[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:55.280]  emergency a state of emergency this is in a checkpoint it's a safety a safety
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:03.800]  stop playing games this isn't cultural cancer this is this is the new age of
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:11.920]  big government it's all a bunch of mind games all a bunch of fraud in your face
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:18.560]  and it's extremely frustrating up on info wars.com establishment media
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:24.200]  sanitizing Ukraine fascist another article by Curt Nemo on that subject
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.560]  just went live special report women reject banning bossy land that could be
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.120]  went out and asked women if they should ban the word bossy because the stamping
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.080]  turtle Michelle Obama says so border patrol terrorizes mom and kids with a
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.760]  knife I'm gonna play the audio and video that meanwhile the board patrols
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.040]  being attacked shot beaten I mean the board patrol average has one of the
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.520]  roughest jobs out there and the same time they're only used basically more and
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.120]  more on citizens that's no place they're authorized to basically act as right
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.360]  tickets to citizens drinking beer you know in places like Big Ben National Park
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.360]  I witnessed that again last weekend so and they don't like it either and it's
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:10.680]  a pretty horrible video but we've also got horrible videos and photos of the
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.840]  border patrol being attacked with rocks and having eyes put out you name it being
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.320]  told they're not allowed to fight back basically so the political correctness
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.480]  has just gone into overdrive ladies and gentlemen I mean Mexico's got border
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.120]  patrol why are they allowed to have I mean you try to sneak into Mexico and
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.120]  get caught by the federales you're gonna get beat up number one might get
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.920]  killed you're gonna get taken to a jail and you're gonna get shaken down your
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.800]  family's gonna have their credit run you're gonna pay depending on how much
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:45.240]  money you got 10 20% of your income or you're not gonna leave that facility is
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:51.400]  that racist no it's a predatory club credit country so our border patrol is a
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.720]  hundred times better than the Mexican border patrol the Mexican border patrol
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:03.840]  is on record one of the most vicious in the world oh but that doesn't count it
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.040]  doesn't count you have US citizens black white Hispanic you name it or being
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.280]  murdered all over the border in fact since I said it let's just go to this
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.280]  this video the article if you want to see it of your radio listeners up on
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.680]  info wars.com Paul Joseph Watson an article on this board patrol terrorizes
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:28.520]  a mom and kids with knife and taser and you know I've got to say when I drive
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.120]  through these checkpoints the one in Alpine when you go down to Big Bend
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.440]  beautiful area down there very romantic I mean if I lived in the desert that's
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.160]  where I live would be down there right people almost everybody that lives down
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.400]  there's a listener it was insane I mean I go in a restaurant and like everyone
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.920]  was a listener and then another day I go in another restaurant everyone was a
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:57.000]  listener it was it was wild I'd see firefighters with the with the National
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.440]  Park Service listeners I'd see the I'm not bragging who I got a lot of listeners
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:08.760]  I'm saying Liberty is popular I ran into most of the park rangers were very nice
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.320]  some were listeners it was wild totally different experience the last time I was
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.920]  down there because they had a marathon and a bike thing going on so they had a
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.840]  whole bunch of extra federal cops down there that were being total jerks and
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.120]  bugging their eyes out at people and wouldn't say hi to you and we're just
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.720]  riding people tickets for drinking beer I guess they're just we're told you know
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.120]  keep control of everything but the point is totally different experience when a
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.120]  bad experience last time it was just like man I'm looking at police state none of
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:40.160]  that this time but this woman again speaks English clear English blonde-haired
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.520]  blue eyes and my point is can you imagine what they do to Hispanic
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.240]  Americans and I and you come you show them your license and I've been through
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.640]  there and it's not enough they go pull over here we're gonna search a vehicle I
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.480]  get out of things they're getting mad I'm like oh listen you're 80 miles off the
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.040]  border you got all this license plate reading equipment here you got nuclear
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.280]  spectrometers you know I don't have a bomb in the car you got illegal x-ray
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.680]  systems out here that are frying people you're all gonna get cancer you see you
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.960]  see the videos I go leave me alone well this time I pull up and the guy
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:16.880]  literally goes oh Alex and I just go go go pretty funny so that the guy was
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.160]  like okay US citizens yeah okay Alex just come on but the whole point is is
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.400]  that this is what these things up to a hundred miles in the country are every
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.400]  coastline in the border a hundred miles that's most the population I think 73
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.160]  percent last time the ACLU to report on this live within a hundred miles of a
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:40.000]  border of the coastline 70 plus percent live on the borders above 100 miles or
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.120]  on coastlines think about it west coast east coast in the borders let let's go
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.160]  to this incredible video here it is we'll come back to the calls he told his
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:54.840]  other guys this one's being difficult to get the taser and he opens up my door
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.000]  and he says ma'am do I need to tase you to get you out of your vehicle and I
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.800]  was like no you don't need to do that you're acting ridiculous why did you
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:08.920]  even pull me over then he comes up to my seatbelt pulls out a knife and says ma'am
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:13.960]  do I need to cut you out of your seatbelt and I was like no you don't
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.240]  need to do anything like that I was like all you need to do is tell me why you
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:26.560]  pulled me over you know this is ridiculous then he took my keys for my
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:33.040]  ignition and I was forced to get out of my vehicle if I didn't get out of the
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.640]  vehicle I felt like this man that was threatening to tase me and cut me out of
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:45.600]  my seatbelt was going to hurt me I told my kids to stay where they were because
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.920]  they were like mommy what's going on where are you going and I was like you

[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.760]  question to ask that's a good question to ask callers what would you ask him
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:48.080]  well would I ask him mm-hmm I would ask him why he signed the NDA and why he's
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:53.680]  setting up basically at least state yeah I mean he would he asked canned answers
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:27:01.360]  for everything so so so so a I wouldn't get to ask that question be I mean I
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.600]  would I would say to him if it was on TV it's it's more about him being there the
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.400]  whole world to stage I know you're a puppet and an empty man who was totally
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.800]  blackmailed and controlled and you're selling out humanity and you are a
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.560]  narcissist and you were ashamed and you will go down the history books as a total
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:27.280]  fraud unless you repent now and turn from your anti-human ways and tell the truth
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.240]  about what's happening and it is it is a war crime what you're doing trying to
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:39.840]  push GMO on Africa and Asia and the forced inoculations and the polio
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.720]  shots they're sterilizing people in mass you are a party to mass murder and how
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:49.280]  dare you fund Al Qaeda to attack the people of Syria and how dare you try to
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.440]  overthrow Egypt turn it over to Al Qaeda and how dare you commit mass murder in
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:59.000]  Libya you are a disgrace and a fraud and an enemy of humanity and I just see
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.960]  you for the scum you are just like I did Pierce Morgan you are a redcoat enemy

[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.000]  declare I'm free and you're an enemy it's more important to declare them the
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.760]  enemy not to even ask them questions we know the truth you are a usurping enemy
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.760]  and the declaration of them being an enemy is the end of their fraud I would
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.320]  I would ask him why why it's such an hypocrisy that he wanted to go into
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:39.200]  Syria and then now they're doing the exact same thing in Ukraine well I would
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.240]  just tell Obama I could tell you're a weak slave scared I could see you're
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.560]  shook up the narcissism isn't working anymore salvation isn't being a man

[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.600]  of his work that's one of the reasons I hired him now continuing ladies and
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:28.000]  gentlemen we have the new magazine since the last caller mentioned what's
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.040]  happening to women they're attacking the whole species to turning us against
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:36.360]  each other they're assaulting everything and they're saying you should just be

[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:08.840]  was very successful but I decided to end it because it's more cost-effective to

[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.840]  want in groups of 10 up to a hundred and give them to friends and family big

[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:26.520]  doing to you big color glossy magazines it's the equivalent of a book that you
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.200]  can then give friends and family and give women you know so they understand to
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.240]  hopefully deprogram them or wake them up and women are panicking right now on
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.440]  average statistically higher mental illness levels higher breakdown in

[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:46.520]  briefly as I want to go to child role in dark tower came by browning but but you
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.640]  were making the point yes I've read the guy's book very interesting you know
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.320]  perspective on raising them and to be honorable to be men this is what the
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.040]  system is trying to eradicate and I'm not saying this guy's book is the end all
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:02.760]  be all compendium on this it's his perspective on what a night is but
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:07.640]  it's basic chivalry and chivalry and being honorable is being stinking your
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.680]  comment on that sir yes in addition to the chivalry approach he takes a
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.040]  biblical definition of what it means to be a man and I think that's what's
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:20.280]  sorely missing just by could a real man rejects passivity a real man leads
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.960]  courageously a real man accepts responsibility and a real man accepts
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.600]  or expects the greater reward and it's remarkable way to raise a young boy in
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.960]  this troubled time so let's use it as another tool against the social
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:39.240]  destroyers absolutely God bless you now folks a very powerful piece of poetry
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:50.920]  Robert Browning child Roland to the dark tower came one my first thought was he
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:57.480]  lied in every word that hoary cripple with malicious eye a scans to watch the
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:02.720]  workings of his lie on mine and mouth scarce able to afford suppression of
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:11.360]  the glee that pursed and scored its edge at one more victim gained thereby to what
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.240]  else should he be set for with his staff what save to way lay with his lies
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:23.000]  and snare all travelers who might find him posted there and ask the road I
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.360]  guessed what skull like laugh would break what crutch in right my epitaph for
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:36.960]  pastime in the dusty thoroughfare three if at his council I should turn aside
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:43.280]  into that ominous tract which all agree hides the dark tower yet acquiescingly
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.360]  I did turn as a pointed neither pride now hope rekindling at the end described
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:57.920]  so much as gladness that some end might be for for what with my whole world wide
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:03.760]  wandering what with my search drawn out through years my hope dwindled into a
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.480]  ghost not fit to cope with that obstreperous joy success would bring I
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:15.880]  hardly tried now to rebuke the spring my heart made finding failure in its scope
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:24.400]  five as when a sick man very near to death seems dead indeed and feels begin
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.520]  and end the tears and takes the farewell of each friend and here's one bid the
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:35.720]  other go draw breath freelier outside since all is or he saith and the blow
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:43.960]  fallen no grieving can amend six when some discuss if near the other graves be
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.640]  room enough for this and when a day suits best for carrying the corpse away
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:54.400]  with care about the banners scarves and staves and still the man hears all and
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:04.200]  only craves he may not shame such tender love and stay seven thus I had so long
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:10.120]  suffered in this quest heard failure prophesied so often then writ so many
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.520]  times among the band to wit the knights who to the dark towers search addressed
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:20.600]  their steps that just to fail as they seemed best and all the doubt was now
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:30.440]  should I be fit eight so quiet as despair I turned from him that hateful
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:35.800]  cripple out of his highway into the path he pointed all the day had been a dreary
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:41.680]  one at best and dim was settling to its close yet shot one grim red lear to see
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:51.400]  the plane catch its astray nine for mark no sooner was I fairly found pledged to
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:56.280]  the plane after a pace or two then pausing to throw backwards a last view
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:02.600]  or the safe road was gone gray plane all round nothing but playing to the
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:12.880]  horizon's bound I might go on not else remained to do 10 so on I went I think I
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:19.340]  never saw such starved ignoble nature nothing throw for flowers as well
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:24.600]  expect to cedar Grove but cockle spurge according to their law might propagate
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:33.160]  their kind with none to awe you'd think a burr had been a treasure trove 11 no
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:40.280]  penury inertness and grimace in some strange sort with a lance portion see
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:46.120]  or shut your eyes said nature peevishly it nothing skills I cannot help my case
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:52.240]  tis the last judgments fire must cure this place cal sign its claws and set my
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:42:00.800]  prisoners free 12 if they're pushed any ragged thistle stalk above its mates the
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:06.880]  head was chopped the vents were jealous else what made those holes and rents in
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.880]  the docks harsh swath leaves bruised as to balk all hope of greenness tis a
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:20.720]  brute must walk passing their life out with a brute's intense 13 as for the
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:27.840]  grass it grew as scant as hair in leprosy thin dry blades pricked the mud
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:34.120]  which underneath looked needed up with blood one stiff blind horse his every
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:40.720]  bone a stair stood stupefied however he came there thrust out past service from
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:50.400]  the devil's stud 14 alive he might be dead for all I know with that red gaunt
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:56.120]  and colloped neck a strain and shut eyes underneath the rusty mane seldom went
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.880]  such grotesqueness with such woe I never saw a brute I hate it so he must be
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:10.840]  wicked to deserve such pain 15 I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart as a
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:16.080]  man calls for wine before he fights I asked one draft of earlier happier
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:22.440]  sights air fitly I could hope to play my part think first fight afterwards the
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:33.120]  soldiers art one taste of the old time sets all to rights 16 not it I fancied
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.760]  cuthbert's reddening face beneath its garniture of curly gold dear fellow till
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.160]  I almost felt him fold and armed to mine to fix me to the place the way he
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:50.880]  used alas one night's disgrace out went my heart's new fire and left it cold
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:59.200]  17 Giles then the soul of honor there he stands Frank as 10 years ago when
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:05.400]  knighted first what honest man should dare he said he durst good but the scene
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:09.240]  shifts for what hangman hands pinned to his breast
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:18.600]  department his own bands read it poor traitor spit upon and cursed 18 better
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:25.160]  this present than a past like that back therefore to my darkening path again no
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.640]  sound no sight as far as I could strain will the night send a howl at or a bat
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.400]  I asked when something on the dismal flat came to arrest my thoughts and
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:44.280]  change their train 19 a sudden little river crossed my path as unexpected as
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:50.280]  a serpent comes no sluggish tide congenial to the glooms this as it
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:55.240]  frothed by might have been a bath for the fiends glowing hoof to see the wrath
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:04.320]  of its black eddy the spate with flakes and spumes 20 so petty yet so spiteful
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:10.840]  all along low scrubby alders kneeled down over it drenched willows flung them
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:16.080]  headlong in a fit of mute despair a suicidal throng the river which had
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:24.960]  done them all the wrong what at that was rolled by deterred no wit 21 which while
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.680]  I forwarded good saints how I feared to set my foot upon a dead man's cheek
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.840]  each step or feel the spear I thrust to seek for hollows tangled in his hair or
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.840]  beard it may have been a water rat I speared but
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:45.560]  ug it sounded like a baby's shriek 22 glad was I when I reached the other
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:51.520]  bank now for a better country vain crusade who were the
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.920]  struggleers what war did they wage whose savage trample thus could pad the
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:03.680]  dank soil to a plash toads in a poisoned tank or wild cats in a red hot iron
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:10.240]  cage 23 the fight must so have seemed in that fell
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:14.680]  cirque what penned them there with all the playing to choose no footprint
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.680]  leading to that horrid muse none out of it mad bruise set to work their brains
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:24.400]  no doubt like galley slaves the Turk pits for his pastime Christians against
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:34.000]  Jews 24 and more than that a furlong on why there what bad use was that engine
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.200]  for that wheel or break not wheel that harrow fit to real men's bodies out like
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.440]  silk with all the air of tough its tool on earth left unaware or brought to
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:53.080]  sharpen its rusty teeth of steel 25 then came a bit of stubbed ground once a
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:58.760]  wood next a marsh it would seem and now mere earth desperate and done with so a
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:03.640]  fool finds mirth makes a thing and then mars it till his mood changes and off
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:13.280]  he goes within a rude bog clay and rubble sand and stock black dirt 26 now
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:19.400]  blotches rankling colored gay and grim now patches were some leanness of the
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.480]  soils broke into moss or substances like boils then came some palsy dope a
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.400]  cleft in him like a distorted mouth that splits its rim gaping at death and
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:39.280]  dies while it recoils 27 and just as far as ever from the end not in the
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:44.320]  distance but the evening not to point my footstep further at the thought a great
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:50.400]  black bird a pollyons bosom friend sailed past not best his wide-winged dragon
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:58.960]  penned that brushed my cap perchance the guide I sought 28 for looking up aware I
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:03.720]  somehow grew spite of the dusk the plane had given place all round to
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.800]  mountains with such name to grace mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:15.320]  view how thus they had surprised me saw that you how to get from them was no
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:23.880]  clear a case 29 yet half I seemed to recognize some trick of mischief happened
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:30.000]  to me God knows when in a bad dream perhaps here ended then progress this
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.600]  way when in the very nick of giving up one time more came a click as when a
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:41.960]  trap shuts you're inside the den 30 burningly it came on me all at once
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:48.280]  this was the place those two hills on the right crouched like two bulls locked
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:54.520]  horn in horn in fight while to the left a tall scalped mountain dunce doted a
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:49:02.080]  dozing at the very nonce after a life spent training for the site 31 what
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:08.400]  in the midst lay but the tower itself the round squat turret blind as the
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.880]  fool's heart built of brown stone without a counterpart in the whole world
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.560]  the tempest's mocking elf points to the shipment thus the unseen shelf he
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:28.240]  strikes on only when the timbers start 32 not see because of night perhaps why
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:33.480]  day came back again for that before it left the dying sunset kindled through a
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.520]  cleft the hills like giants at a hunting lay chin upon hand to see the game at
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:48.960]  bay now stab and end the creature to the heft 33 not here when noise was
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:55.000]  everywhere it told increasing like a bell names in my ears of all the lost
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:01.240]  adventurers my peers how such a one was strong and such was bold and such was
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:12.160]  fortunate yet each of old lost lost one moment knelt the woe of years 34 there
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:19.640]  they stood ranged along the hillsides met to view the last of me a living frame
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:25.640]  for one more picture and a sheet of flame I saw them and I knew them all and
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:34.640]  yet Dauntless the slug horn to my lips I set and blue child Roland to the dark

[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.600]  drudge report.com is linked to our article dealing with the border patrol
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:41.400]  terrorizing a woman with a knife and taser in a highway pullover miles from
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:45.720]  the border just shows the bizarre behavior again I'm not even demonizing
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.960]  the board patrol this is just a mess but that story and video is up on info
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.880]  wars.com let's go back to your calls I appreciate David holding then we'll go
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:55:00.600]  to Alex, James, Al, Anya and Anya's in France so you skip ahead and get to Anya
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:04.040]  soon as some of those folks calling their own dime David and Oklahoma you're on
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:16.400]  the air thanks for calling. I just wanted to talk to you about what you think about
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:22.720]  the medical establishment pushing their agendas for things that people don't
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:27.200]  really need. Well I mean it's a mix you've got a lot of good doctors a lot of
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:32.240]  great nurses they got a really hard job but the drugs aren't working anymore the
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.040]  the the bugs are becoming hyper-resistant and now the government and the
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:42.800]  bioethicist boards the death panels are programming the hospitals and
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.240]  programming the system to to take medicine out of the hands of the doctors
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.880]  and even make it worse so that's my view on it most doctors are really good
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:58.120]  people it's just that they are in a cult basically of doing things one way and
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:02.400]  I mean they're great when your legs broken you got a gunshot wound or when
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.240]  you have you know your a-order explode. Miracle medicine it's just that pharma
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:12.800]  itself has become very predatory what's your view on it? Well I grew up in a
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:18.640]  chiropractic background and I was always told not to take anything that I don't
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:26.440]  need so I think that do you have any back pain or anything like I don't know
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.560]  anything other than you know you don't need to go to the doctor for a normal
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.400]  regular call. Well I know there's I know a lot of people they say have knee
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.280]  surgery and they just go and take yoga or stretch and they don't need and take
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:43.480]  you know the proper type of joint support they we have an InfoWarsHealth.com
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:47.760]  I mean it's just miraculous what the Alex Pack does you know that has the
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.280]  different things and including the FX support and the things it does for the
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:54.400]  joints I mean they're just not telling you that a lot of times there are things
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.720]  other than surgery and that's being proven and so MD medicine run by the
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:03.640]  system is wanting to shut down its competition great points. Anya in France
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:12.720]  where the story of Roland comes from go ahead you're on the air. Hi I'm calling
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.840]  you just basically because I really feel for you I'm living here in France and
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:22.120]  we're not quite where we where you are at the moment I've been watching your
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:27.600]  programs and trying to sort of like update myself on all the information

[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.720]  how you get these people to move I really don't I can see they're moving but I
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:41.520]  think it's a bit too late and I actually think that elsewhere in the world
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:47.880]  they're as asleep as they are in the states only you're much further on
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:53.480]  than we are I actually think that this new world order is is is on our doorstep
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:58:00.680]  and nobody nobody is actually aware of it or they are aware of it but you talk
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.240]  to people I can hear people talking on your on your show and and and they're
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:09.960]  sort of okay they're aware but there are so many people out there you can
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:14.560]  actually alienate people talking about these things. I agree stay there I'm

[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:21.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:28.080]  going back to onion in France the first-time caller she was getting into
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:31.240]  alienating people bring up his info no no it's true I mean we've been
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.080]  incrementally brought up in all this and some countries are ahead more than
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.400]  others in different areas I would say France is further ahead in some respects
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:47.240]  but the US is more ahead in other ways GMO police state a lot of it it's a
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:51.920]  complex issue but I mean where do you see the world going how do you see we you
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.120]  the people being able to get folks out of their trance well I don't that's a
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:01.440]  problem I mean I've literally turned my whole family against me like I say we're
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.880]  not where you are but if you go on to GMO's okay France is sort of on the front
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.600]  but I think that the lobbying in Brussels is it's gonna be a big problem you
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.680]  talk about chemtrails I've got that up in my sky nobody seems to want to know
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:19.760]  about it it's absolutely frightening it's it's really frightening I've been
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:25.200]  looking at I've been watching Cristina Lagarde on her sort of like readjusting
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.200]  me the whole the whole finance I really don't think people realize what's going
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:34.160]  on I mean I don't know what I don't know where they're living I sort of like I've
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:38.640]  just come out from underneath a rock and you actually don't think you're
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:42.760]  living anymore it's it's really frightening because you talk to people
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:48.880]  and they just don't want to know nobody wants to know you that you actually
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:55.360]  become a bit like an alien well I agree with you but that's because they're a
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.800]  sleep you're trying to wake them up they want to keep sleeping it's because
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:04.640]  they're in a technotronically induced in Brzezinski's own words trance like
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:09.520]  state and so I mean it's like living in a body snatcher movie when they finally
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:19.000]  start to wake up though it's going to be explosive I mean I literally I I literally
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.080]  you know I'm sort of thinking well what the hell's going on here I mean you know
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:27.840]  where are these people I'm listening to you and I can see that you've got people
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:31.720]  over there but then you watch videos I mean I watched a video today as a guy
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:35.440]  and you were talking about these these these Americans behind their screens
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.640]  playing gaming well I saw something on arty television which was which was
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.120]  about the computers going being shipped out to Ghana and you see this bloody
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.240]  American guy sitting behind and his wife is being interviewed on on on a setty
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.160]  with a with a daughter and he's saying oh yeah it's great because I'm like I'm
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:58.360]  I'm bonding with my son I'm thinking fucking hell this is this is what it's
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:02.840]  about this is what it's about this is where all these people are I mean they're
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:07.040]  just they're just living in another world well literally you're right you're
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:10.760]  watching people being sucked into the matrix you're watching other people get
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:16.720]  even deeper into it and you're watching the societal takeover happen and the
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.120]  global I really appreciate you Alex because to be quite honest with you I
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:24.160]  mean I just I'm been listening to you every evening now I mean you're my
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.400]  lifeline you're my lifeline because once you once you once you have this
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.760]  veil pulled off you you don't know where you are you sort of think well Jesus
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.680]  Christ you know where have I been all these years where have I been let's see
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:38.680]  it's gonna be the same way for other people that weren't awake it's a process
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:41.880]  it and all of us aren't totally awake we're always learning more we all see
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:46.160]  through rose-colored dark lease but I mean look you woke up when did you start
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:53.560]  waking up only a few weeks ago well see them but I mean that's good see but
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:57.800]  just like you think they're laughing at you now or they're getting angry at you
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:04.520]  now down the road you're planting seeds that will sprout because this new world
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:09.880]  real that this dehumanization is real this is really happening and so the fact
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:16.040]  that you're warning people they will wake up down the road well I hope so but
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:20.480]  you know it's it I spoke to my father about it and he thinks I'm a lunatic he
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.760]  really thinks I'm a lunatic that's because he judges the world off of how
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.600]  he is and he's reasonable and nice I'm surmising and so he he just can't
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.120]  believe that people would act like this it's like neighbors when they get told
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:35.480]  we just dug up 25 bodies in your next-door neighbor's backyard
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.480]  well I actually think it's a bit like it's a you know my first my first thought
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:43.480]  was I'm I feel a bit like and I don't know how people don't proceed this I
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:48.320]  actually feel like a Jew in sort of like just just before I go to a gas chamber
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:53.520]  it well I mean that's a normal feeling now this is a predatory system and it is
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:57.480]  authoritarian and it is it is predatory so we've got to admit that thank you

[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:56.520]  And its main mission is to give the elites life extension technologies and control over the
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.520]  rest of humanity for forced population reduction in a designed controlled
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:09.520]  technocratic future and the different plans all sit together like Russian dolls
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:15.520]  and run from bad to worse and it tends to be the most vicious most predatory that are
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:20.520]  captaining the different globalist programs that work in concert together on record.
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:30.520]  Their religion is social Darwinism that the elite are allowed to kill and do whatever they want because they're in charge because they are the fittest.
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:39.520]  I of course have given the analogy of cancer. Cancer is not elite because it's able to run through the body and destroy what is its host
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:46.520]  finally extincting its own habitat. That does not mean that every other system out there operating is good either.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:56.520]  Humans in general have our own problems and it is a human manifestation of our weaknesses that have allowed this ultimately selfish and wicked
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:04.520]  group to be in control. There is no honor amongst these people. The globalist are a den of devils.
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:11.520]  There is no other way to describe it. If you don't believe in a physical Satan, it doesn't matter because the New World Order is an archetypal
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:15.520]  manifestation that is more satanic than anything you could ever imagine.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.520]  Now my friends David Knight here with us for this segment and more calls and news in the next.
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:28.520]  I'll host the nightly news with Leanne McAdoo and of course Jakari Jackson and when I was first looking at hiring him about a year and a half ago
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:35.520]  David Knight up in North Carolina I knew and part of his resume had worked in some libertarian think tanks.
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  And of course owned different video production companies and things so as a journalist.
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:50.520]  And I was really excited in the work he'd done and covered with us for even moved here dealing with groups that were investigating inside colleges
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:58.520]  secret testing of stuff 50 to 100 times sometimes higher what is safe and allowable in a test.
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:06.520]  And they did this to skew the numbers to take super high numbers and then apply it to small numbers of particular to ban fireplaces.
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:12.520]  We were first telling you about this years ago people didn't believe it now it's in the news they want to ban fireplaces or tax you for having them
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.520]  or wood burning stoves it's a tool of control.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:24.520]  Here it is in the daily caller today from the government documents and testimony in Congress we have a clip coming up as well but report EPA tested
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:33.520]  deadly pollutants on humans to push Obama administration's agenda because they're not just going to list carbon dioxide as deadly pollutant that plants breathe to tax it.
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:42.520]  They're going to tax all particular while not worrying about serious particular coming in from China and the jet stream or GMO or pesticides or fluoride in the water.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:51.520]  No it's all about saying any particular including hay dust is illegal your children doing chores on the farm illegal is all being announced.
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:12:00.520]  We push back they back off they come back so this is a total takeover that makes feudalism in ancient England look like a heavenly dream.
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:07.520]  This is neo feudalism in their own words David Knight break down the history of this and give folks the rest of the story.
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  Exactly right Alex this is coming back in the news because they're trying to push this would smoke regulation this is something that's been going around for quite some time with the EPA.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.520]  Actually going back to September of 2011 we have a clip that I want to play in just a second here.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:34.520]  This is EPA administrator Lisa Jackson and she goes before Congress and it was already set up with representative Markey that she's going to tell everybody just how dangerous these fine particular matter is.
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:40.520]  What are the benefits of cleaning up particular matter.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:46.520]  Does that help or hurt our efforts to battle cancer how to battle the.
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:52.520]  He says cancer it has upon the health of people in our country particular matter or suit causes premature deaths.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:57.520]  It doesn't make you sick it's directly causal to dying sooner than you should.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:05.520]  So the impacts of delaying efforts cost effective efforts I might add to address particular matter or more people dying sooner than they should.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.520]  How would you compare it to the fight against cancer losing particular matter.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:18.520]  Yeah I was brief not long ago if we could reduce particulate matter to healthy levels it would have the same impact as finding a cure for cancer in our country.
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.520]  Can you say that sentence one more time.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  Yes sir if we could reduce particulate matter to levels that are healthy we would have an identical.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  Talk to us like we're to find your talking points about cancer pretty good.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:34.520]  They're putting cancer viruses in all the major vaccines on record.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:44.520]  You know he starts this he's already got her talking point set up where she's going to tell everybody that particular matter is killing as many people as cancer and he even mentioned that at the very beginning he says cancer.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:52.520]  And so then she repeats that claim now at the same time she's giving this congressional testimony the EPA in North Carolina at the University of North Carolina.
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:14:04.520]  Is hooking people up to diesel exhaust fumes out of a diesel truck they got a pipe running in they put them in a little closed room and they put a mask over their face and they're feeding them diesel fuel.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:06.520]  And they lie to him and tell him it's safe.
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:07.520]  Exactly.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:19.520]  Now so that happened now in September 2012 so that congressional testimony was 2011 at the time they're exposing people to levels that the EPA has already said were fatal.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  They're 50 to 70 times in some cases higher than that levels of exposure to this that they've already determined were fatal.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:35.520]  Now in September 2012 the American Tradition Institute and this is based on some detective work by Steve Malloy with junk science.com.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:41.520]  He looked at he's constantly monitoring the EPA and he saw where this lady was sent to the hospital.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:45.520]  So he started investigating and he found exactly what they were doing.
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:48.520]  They started a restraint temporary restraining order they sued.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  And you told me about this before it broke as you've worked with these groups.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.520]  That's right.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:15:00.520]  That was about a month before I started you had the you had David Schneer who is the attorney on he talked to you about what was going on and they filed for temporary restraining order.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  In February following that about what is that about six months five months.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.520]  It was turned down by a judge.
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:08.520]  He said no problem.
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  Now actually there was a lot of problem.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:19.520]  He said in the lawsuit scientific assessments by the EPA conducted in 2004 and 2009 determined that there was no safe level exposure.
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  That's just what she was telling the congressman.
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:31.520]  Nevertheless they pumped it directly into the lungs of humans including an obese volunteer and a volunteer with chronic asthma see they were looking for volunteers that even already had heart and respiratory.
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:41.520]  And then you guys found out in the lawsuit and with your going back to the articles that again they were skewing it then claiming it was a lower level that did it.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  Yes.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:43.520]  I mean this is incredible fraud.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:51.520]  The story isn't just the secret deadly testing Nazi level it is the fact that there are cult that would do this and then lie with the information.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:16:00.520]  This is a group of sniveling criminals and that same woman had to resign because she had fake secret emails operating to keep her criminal activity secret.
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.520]  This is a conspiracy of bloated demonic pigs.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:05.520]  That's right.
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.520]  Now what happened the reason the Daily Caller picked us up is not just a wood smoke thing.
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:19.520]  But on March 31st a year after the judge said there's no problem they released guidelines to say these are how this is how we can enhance protection of humans study subjects.
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:28.520]  This is a year afterwards and what they're saying is while the consent forms met the requirements we found that exposure risk were not always consistently represented.
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:34.520]  Furthermore the EPA did not include information on long term cancer risks in its diesel exhaust studies consent form.
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:42.520]  Yeah that's exactly right. When you look at their consent forms and I've got it reproduced here from a Don's article back in September 26 2012.
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:45.520]  He says this is the consent form they were giving them.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:51.520]  They said if you have any tendency to become uncomfortable in small closed spaces it's possible you may become uncomfortable during this study.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:53.520]  He says it's just claustrophobia.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:58.520]  Then this is the closest that they get to warning people about the health consequences of this.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:05.520]  They say you may experience some minor degree of airway irritation, cough, and shortness of breath or wheezing.
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:12.520]  These symptoms typically disappear two to four hours after exposure but may last longer for particularly sensitive people.
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:20.520]  This is the same EPA where the head of the EPA Lisa Jackson has just told people that they're gone that's the cause of death.
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:23.520]  It's one of the leading causes of death that kills as many people as cancer.
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:34.520]  They're consciously doing something they admit is at fatal levels and sending people to the hospital to fraudulently claim it was the type of particular you'd get on the highway in the documents.
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:35.520]  Yes.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:37.520]  So total criminal fraud at every level.
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.520]  And so the question is they really were caught between a rock and a hard place.
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:45.520]  The question was do you really believe your own regulations?
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:53.520]  If you do, you're trying to send its people to death, okay, you're not see war criminals or are these regulations faked?
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:54.520]  Are they hyped?
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:18:04.520]  Well, the reality is I think in both cases they've hyped the regulations but we've seen over and over again that the government has no qualms about exposing people.
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:13.520]  Whether you're talking about Tuskegee Institute or so many times just look at what happened with the USS Reagan at Fukushima where they send the sailors in to Fukushima.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:15.520]  Yeah, people say you can't keep this stuff secret.
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:21.520]  44 years, they kept it secret, tens of thousands of black people injected with syphilis.
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:23.520]  And then the media always spends it just like that's it.
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  No, it was designed to spread it in the community.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:29.520]  There's been many, many cases of this.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.520]  So in this particular case.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:33.520]  They didn't tell them they were giving them syphilis.
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:34.520]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:42.520]  In this particular case, if the EPA believe their regulations, they're exposing people to lethal dosages of this particular matter.
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:44.520]  By the way, I'm sorry, somebody injects my family with syphilis.
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:46.520]  I'm going to kill them.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:50.520]  We just put up with basically anything in this country and I'm sick of it.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  People say that's radical.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:56.520]  No, we've gotten in the position where the government just murders people and it's not the government.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:00.520]  It is a group of criminal, eugenicists, scum.
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:03.520]  And I'm sick of them putting fluoride in the water.
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.520]  I'm sick of them doing all this stuff.
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.520]  They're a bunch of sick freaks.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:09.520]  Quit murdering us.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:18.520]  And so two days ago, they come out with this release from an inspector general at the EPA, basically covering themselves and say, well, we really didn't do anything wrong.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.520]  But here's how we could do it right next time.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:22.520]  I mean, they speak out of both sides.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:27.520]  Well, look at U.S. Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.520]  It says we've outlawed secret testing unless for research or law enforcement purposes.
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:33.520]  Yes.
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:35.520]  Let's do one more segment on this bottom of the hour.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:40.520]  We're going to get to all of you and more.
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:41.520]  And I'm sorry.
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:45.520]  If some crazy person's running around with a needle on the street trying to inject me with syphilis, I'm going to defend myself.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:47.520]  So I don't care who it is.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:49.520]  This is out of control.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:54.520]  At MIT, we have a scientific group of mad scientists jacking with everything, laughing at us.
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.520]  And all of you that work for the system, you're being targeted, too.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:05.520]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions, silverlungs.com.
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:11.520]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience, just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:15.520]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own, so stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:21.520]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:28.520]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.520]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:39.520]  Jessica Armand here, creator of My Magic Mud, the all-natural teeth whitener and strengthening remedy that's getting rave reviews from GCN listeners.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:42.520]  Here's what Austin Dentist Dr. Griffin Cole has to say about it.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.520]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:50.520]  Because charcoal is so absorbent, it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:51.520]  I recommend My Magic Mud.

[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:24.520]  Well, it's just seven herbs that are approved for helping keep my heart healthy.
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:25.520]  That's great, Dad.
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:26.520]  I was getting worried about you.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:28.520]  I am so glad it's helping.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:29.520]  So am I, son.
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.520]  I'm very glad your sister got it for me.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:34.520]  I wish I had a known about it before my heart attack.
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.520]  Yeah, but would you have taken it though?
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:38.520]  You know, I'm not sure if I would have.
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:41.520]  But I'm awful glad I'm taking it now.

[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:38.520]  and then letting the dog chew on his dead body with pleasure.
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:44.520]  Now federal marshals, federal Gestapo, shoot an unarmed man in Albuquerque
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:47.520]  and then confiscate the cell phones but it didn't work.
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:52.520]  I mean it just gets crazier and crazier by the day.
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:55.520]  New Mexico is basically federalized as the reason this is happening.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:58.520]  It's been a territory forever and never really became a state in my view.
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:01.520]  Day to night we're going to go to calls the next segment finishing up though.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.520]  This is a big deal because this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.520]  We know there's lethal testing on troops going on.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:12.520]  All of this and no one gets in trouble because this is part of the scientific dictatorship.
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:14.520]  It is their sacrament.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:16.520]  It is part of the religion of these people.
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:17.520]  Yes.
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:20.520]  Like taking communion or something to secretly test on people.
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:26.520]  It is the raw exercise of power with the GMOs, with the food, the water, the geoengineering
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.520]  and they go, yeah, we're spending billions on secret programs to change the atmosphere.
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:32.520]  We're not going to tell you what we're doing.
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:33.520]  Shut up.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:34.520]  Yeah, we're funding Al Qaeda.
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:36.520]  We're not going to tell you what we're doing with that.
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:40.520]  It's just, they just do whatever they want in the shadow state
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:45.520]  and it's a bunch of eugenicists, professors running it.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:51.520]  They tried to recruit my dad when he was in state testing in high school and was salutatorian
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.520]  or whatever and that was in the top six in the state scores across the board.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.520]  They called him in at UT like a 1967 or whatever before he was getting out of high school
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:03.520]  and said, you know, we want you to join the eugenics cult.
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  He didn't even tell me this till I made in game.
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:06.520]  But it's the standard deal.
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:09.520]  I've had other historians on who got the same speech.
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:11.520]  You're the top of your class.
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:12.520]  You're in science.
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:13.520]  They come to you.
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:14.520]  This is a cult.
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:15.520]  David Knight.
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:16.520]  Yeah.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:20.520]  And they went after the top of the class as far as the Nazi war criminals who were experimenting
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:21.520]  on people.
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:24.520]  Oh, they wanted them like they were like, it was like a sports team trying to get the
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:25.520]  top, you know, top people.
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:26.520]  Absolutely.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.520]  They had the Nuremberg trials where they did a show trial of some of the people, but they
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.520]  brought over a huge number of scientists and operation paperclip.
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:38.520]  If you want to read a very compelling book about that and about the what was happening
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:43.520]  in the 1950s and the aftermath of that chemical biological testing on humans with Japanese and
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:46.520]  German war criminal scientists.
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:50.520]  Look at the book, a horrible mistake by, and it's about Dr. Frank Olson.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:55.520]  He was a scientist that committed suicide by jumping out of a window.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:56.520]  Okay.
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:57.520]  They had given him LSD.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.520]  It's real.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:26:59.520]  Exactly.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.520]  Exactly.
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:02.520]  They, his, his sons have investigated this.
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.520]  It's a very interesting story, but one of the most interesting things about it is not
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.520]  even necessarily his personal story.
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:11.520]  It shows how they come after the people that work with them eventually, right?
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:13.520]  They eventually turn on the quizlings.
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.520]  They eventually turn on the minions or whatever.
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.520]  If they, if they wake up and see what's going on, if they have a conscience about it, as
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.520]  he did, they kill you.
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:21.520]  Okay.
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.520]  Or maybe they just are competing with you.
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:24.520]  Yeah.
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:25.520]  There's a lot of that.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.520]  This is dishonorable.
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.520]  Well, getting back to this particular thing, a lot of people will look at that and they'll
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:31.520]  say, even the person who wrote this book, he wrote a meticulous chronology of what happened
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:33.520]  in this story about Dr. Frank Olson.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.520]  But it's like, yeah, that was then, it's a good thing that that doesn't happen anymore.
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:38.520]  Bologna, it does.
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:39.520]  Look at this.
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.520]  We've got a federal law that prohibits medical experiments on humans imposing risks that
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:46.520]  are not reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits.
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:48.520]  This is from Dr. David Schneer.
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:51.520]  He was an EPA scientist for 34 years.
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:52.520]  He was retired.
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.520]  He took the lead on this temporary restraining order where they're trying to stop the EPA
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:00.520]  from feeding diesel fumes to human subjects that they've already pre-screened to try to
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.520]  find people that have heart conditions and respiratory conditions so they can exaggerate
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:08.520]  and extend the reach, the regulatory reach of the EPA.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:09.520]  They're trying to hurt people.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:10.520]  Exactly.
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:14.520]  And then there's another doctor who looked at the consent forms, a Dr. Dunn.
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:17.520]  And he is a policy advisor to the American Council on Science and Health.
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.520]  And what he said was, the human experimentation was scandalously unethical and immoral.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:25.520]  There can be no further tolerance of this misconduct.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:29.520]  And yet the judge said, that's fine, no problem.
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:30.520]  And that was in February.
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:31.520]  That was a year ago.
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.520]  Why not go back to injecting black people with syphilis?
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:34.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:37.520]  And now a year later, they come out and they say, oh, well, you know, let's change our,
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.520]  let's enhance our guidelines a little bit to make sure this doesn't happen again.
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.520]  Well, evidently, there wasn't a problem a year ago, but now there is a problem.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:48.520]  But it all points to what they're trying to do with the particulate matter.
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:51.520]  And if you look at, I think it might still be there.
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.520]  I didn't look to see if the EPA page has changed or not.
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:59.520]  But if you look at the EPA page on fine particulate matter, they've had for the longest time a year ago
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:02.520]  when I started here and I did the report, they had a picture of the Smoky Mountains.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:03.520]  Remember that report?
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:05.520]  And they said they're smoky from particulate.
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:07.520]  That's an Indian name, Smoky Mountains.
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:09.520]  It's cold air hitting hot air.
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:10.520]  It's clouds.
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:11.520]  It's fog.
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:12.520]  That's right.
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:13.520]  It's been that way since before.
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:14.520]  And they know that.
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:15.520]  Yeah.
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:16.520]  It's always been that way.
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:20.520]  And yet they use the Smoky Mountains as a poster child for their phony regulations.
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:28.520]  At the same time, they're exposing people to 50 to 70 to 100 times what they say are lethal limits of exposure particulate matter.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:29.520]  They do it themselves.
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:30.520]  They break their own rules.
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:31.520]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:33.520]  David Knight, thank you so much.
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:35.520]  That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:37.520]  It'll be more than 90 news tonight at 7 o'clock Central.
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:39.520]  In fact, I'm going to air the Soilet Green piece.
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:40.520]  I never air something twice the same day.
[02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:41.520]  It's so powerful.
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:42.520]  I'm going to air this when we come back.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:44.520]  I'm going to write to your phone calls.

[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:06.520]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:10.520]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers
[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:13.520]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:15.520]  that the body needs.

[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:08.520]  runs from bad to worse.
[02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:11.520]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:15.520]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:20.520]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:23.520]  in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:28.520]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:33.520]  What is the secret of silent green?

[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.520]  silent green is in short supply.
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:46.520]  Remember Tuesday is silent green day.
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:50.520]  The supply of silent green has been exhausted.
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:52.520]  You must evacuate the area.
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:55.520]  Okay, it's silent green.
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.520]  The rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:00.520]  Big Builder Bird Group Company
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:03.520]  are not allowed to know
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:05.520]  what they're using the baby parts for
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:07.520]  and the flavoring, but we already know.
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:09.520]  So enjoy the flavor.
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.520]  We're going to get the real solution
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:12.520]  which is going to be a combination of death panels
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:13.520]  and sales taxes.
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:15.520]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:17.520]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:18.520]  I'm for regular suicide.
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:20.520]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:21.520]  Is spending a million dollars
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:24.520]  on that last three months of life for that patient
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:28.520]  would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:31.520]  and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:33.520]  But that's called the death panel.
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:36.520]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:39.520]  They told me to say that they were sorry
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.520]  but that you had become unreliable.
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:52.520]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:55.520]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:57.520]  will do it to its senior citizens.
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:00.520]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:03.520]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:05.520]  on its army, on its prison guards,
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:07.520]  on the quizlings and the collaborators
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.520]  who make that possible.
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:12.520]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:14.520]  The scoops are on their way.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:17.520]  The scoops are on their way.
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:20.520]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:22.520]  You will find out why
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:24.520]  Soylent Green means life.
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:27.520]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:29.520]  We've got to stop them.
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:30.520]  Come on.
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.520]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:37.520]  Soylent Green is people.
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:43.520]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food.
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:45.520]  You've got to tell them.
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:51.520]  The New World Order is based on the destruction of humans.
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:55.520]  An inverted satanic system.
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:57.520]  You sign on to this.
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.520]  You sign on to your own death warrant.
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:01.520]  That's what's so ridiculous about it all.
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:03.520]  Why would anyone want to be part of this?
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:05.520]  And they're building a world that's unsustainable
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:08.520]  to make the self-fulfilling prophecy come true
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:12.520]  and make us fail in their hatred of humanity.
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:15.520]  Letting the worst of us run things
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:21.520]  instead of trying to build unlimited civilization,
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.520]  unlimited art, unlimited beauty.
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:26.520]  But with that comes virtue and freedom
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:37.520]  and they don't want that free will.
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.520]  Break with the New World Order.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:45.520]  Break down and give in to the goodness.
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:48.520]  Start your journey in your heart to loving freedom
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:51.520]  and to deciding you're going to research the world
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:52.520]  and how it really works.
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:55.520]  And you will discover the truth.
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:58.520]  But it's a journey you've got to consciously decide
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:01.520]  you're going to make and facing this evil
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:04.520]  if you don't believe in God, folks, you should.
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:06.520]  I'm not saying you're going to find God
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:07.520]  in most of these churches.
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:09.520]  These things are establishment.
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.520]  They have been infiltrated by the world.
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:13.520]  They have been taken over across the board.
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:14.520]  They're very bad.
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  Even good churches still are afraid of the system
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:19.520]  and won't warn the people.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:25.520]  They're very rare.
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.520]  Somebody like Chuck Baldwin, who's a pastor
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:32.520]  and is attacked by the ADLs in the Paralympic Law Center
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:37.520]  a hundred years ago would be a moderate.
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:39.520]  All he's doing is preaching the Constitution
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:44.520]  Bellarites in a biblical perspective.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:50.520]  Watch his sermons. They're just a standard preacher.
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:54.520]  But in a world of universal deceit
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:56.520]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:00.520]  and it scares the system.
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:02.520]  It scares the system when we talk about
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:04.520]  everything our forebears did.
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:06.520]  The good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful,
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:08.520]  the strong, the pure of heart, the wicked,
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:12.520]  all of it in this quest to decide the world we've built.
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:15.520]  We've lived that long folks' lives like that.
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:18.520]  But the sum aggregate of human development
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:22.520]  and literature and ideas and all of it
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:26.520]  is the quest.
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:28.520]  That's a hundred percent.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.520]  You can debate religion. You can debate God.
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:31.520]  You can debate it all.
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:37.520]  But we're together in this human experience.
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.520]  Because I am a lover, I am a fighter.
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.520]  I am a lover, not a fighter.
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.520]  The greatest fighters are the greatest lovers.
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.520]  All the cowards that try to kneel
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:51.520]  at the black altars of hate and evil
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:54.520]  seeking power are weak.
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.520]  They only have power in this world
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:58.520]  because we give it to them.
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:00.520]  We don't realize our own innate strength
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:06.520]  and how powerful God is shining through us.
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:08.520]  The enemy fears you.
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.520]  That's why they've poisoned your mind
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.520]  and your body from birth.
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:14.520]  That's why you've been under attack
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:16.520]  from the time you were conceived
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:19.520]  into this dimension.
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.520]  From the foundations of our species,
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:24.520]  wickedness has been waging war
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:27.520]  on the potential that is God's creation.
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:32.520]  God's masterwork.
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.520]  Are we going to let the new old order
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:37.520]  continue to mutilate and defile
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:45.520]  and desecrate and engage in galactic vandalism?
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:48.520]  Or are we going to take up the birthright
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:55.520]  that we've been given?
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:58.520]  These churches are all there to make you feel guilty
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:01.520]  and bad all day so you'll feel like you're evil
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:04.520]  so that really evil people can run things.
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:06.520]  The devil is the accuser,
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:08.520]  constantly telling you how sinful you are,
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:11.520]  how bad you are, how you're not fit to be a parent,
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:13.520]  how you're not fit to be a leader,
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:15.520]  how you're not fit so you'll sit in the ditch
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:17.520]  while the evil people take over the road
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:23.520]  and take control of the society.
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:24.520]  What matters is your heart.
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:25.520]  You choose good.
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:26.520]  You love good.
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:27.520]  You love justice.
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:29.520]  You feel bad when you do wrong.
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:31.520]  You repent and then you go out
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:35.520]  and you do good because it's in your heart.
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:36.520]  This is the secret to life.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:41.520]  This is what we must do.
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:45.520]  Satan is the adversary,
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:50.520]  the accuser,
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:52.520]  the serpent,
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.520]  the devil.
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:55.520]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:56.520]  Alex in Missouri, thanks for holding.
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:40:57.520]  I appreciate it.
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.520]  You're on the air.
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:40:59.520]  Welcome.
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:02.520]  You were on George Nore last night, right?
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:03.520]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:05.520]  And you said you wanted to find out
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:07.520]  what made you and your father sick,
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:09.520]  what possibly killed your uncle
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:12.520]  and your other relative and your three friends, right?
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:13.520]  Yes.
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.520]  All right.
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:18.520]  I think I have something for you here.
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:21.520]  Have you ever heard of scupified?
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:22.520]  I know there are a lot of really bad
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.520]  funguses out there and the doctors say
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:25.520]  that's contributing.
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:27.520]  No, scupified is a,
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:31.520]  it's a catalog magazine type thing.
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:32.520]  I haven't heard of scupicide.
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:33.520]  I'm just guessing.
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:34.520]  Scupified.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:35.520]  No, scupified.
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:36.520]  Scupified.
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:37.520]  That's the OOP.
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:38.520]  Okay.
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:39.520]  What is it?
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:40.520]  Tell me.
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:41.520]  FIED.
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:42.520]  All right.
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:43.520]  What they've got is,
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:45.520]  in their December 2013 issue,
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:48.520]  says, based on classified documents,
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:50.520]  leaked, this will only take a minute.
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.520]  Leaked by a source currently serving
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:54.520]  in a very high position with the Department of Defense.
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:56.520]  The following has been revealed.
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:58.520]  Nano devices have been dispersed
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:00.520]  through the public water supply,
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:03.520]  through bottled water, and through the food supply.
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:05.520]  The leaked documents indicate that an estimated
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:09.520]  87% of the population are currently infected
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:11.520]  with at least one of these nano devices.
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:14.520]  The government's goal is 98%.
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.520]  They expect this to be achieved possibly
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:21.520]  by January 2014.
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:24.520]  The sociopathic forces within the U.S.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:26.520]  government plan to use this system in conjunction
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:29.520]  with a planned economic collapse
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:32.520]  and the institution of martial law.
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:34.520]  The nano device itself will not hurt you
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:37.520]  until they activate it with a radio signal.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:40.520]  The plan is not to kill the entire population,
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:42.520]  but to use it as a form of crowd control
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:44.520]  to put down uprisings or riots
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:46.520]  when the collapse happens.
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:49.520]  Once everyone has this nano device in them,
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:52.520]  they can use drones to fly over trouble areas,
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:55.520]  activate the nano device, and cause a flu outbreak
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:58.520]  with a 98% fatality rate.
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:01.520]  That is why the use of drones over the U.S.
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:03.520]  is being so heavily pushed.
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:07.520]  We are already seeing strange, isolated flu outbreaks
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:09.520]  killing hundreds of people.
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:13.520]  For details, visit www.cosmicawareness.org
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:16.520]  attention-urgent.
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:19.520]  And there's also one other one that you can check.
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.520]  It's for a grand expose on the federal government's
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:24.520]  overreach and unconstitutional behavior.
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:28.520]  Visit www.youtube.com slash watch
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:31.520]  question mark v equals nxg.
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:32.520]  No, no, that's fine.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:34.520]  It's generally better just to get the name of the video.
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:36.520]  There's nobody's able to get to us.
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:37.520]  But listen, I really appreciate your call.
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:38.520]  God bless you, sir.
[02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:39.520]  What I know is this.
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:41.520]  I know the sites you're talking about.
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:46.520]  The problem is whether that's science fiction or real.
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:48.520]  And I've actually read that before.
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.520]  I remember that last year.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:52.520]  It doesn't matter because the Sunshine Project
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:56.520]  15 years ago based in Austin, like WikiLeaks,
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:43:58.520]  got declassified Marine Corps documents
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:00.520]  that the Marine Corps freaked out on how to reclassify.
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.520]  This ended up being in the newspaper.
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:04.520]  The Marine Corps actually went to their headquarters
[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:06.520]  and threatened them.
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:08.520]  The professors at UT, I had them on.
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:10.520]  It was UT professors running it.
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:13.520]  And it's a plan with helicopters,
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:15.520]  including remote-controlled drone helicopters,
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:19.520]  waiting with nerve gas on board
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:22.520]  over every major city to launch and kill everybody.
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:26.520]  Now, the declassified documents dealt with opiate knockout gases
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:29.520]  that they estimate would still kill more than 10% of the population
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:31.520]  with fires, car wrecks, explosions.
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:33.520]  Like in the movie Close Encounters, the third kind
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:36.520]  where the helicopter flies over and sprays the knockout gas
[02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:41.520]  on all the people and the farm animals.
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:44.520]  That's really, this is how out of control the government is.
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:46.520]  I mean, they're not just going to radiate troops
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:47.520]  and give them nerve gas.
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:49.520]  They're not just going to inject people with syphilis
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:50.520]  for 45 years.
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:52.520]  They're not just taking blood from their baby at birth.
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:54.520]  They're doing it all.
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:57.520]  And yes, all nanotech is,
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:00.520]  search biological nanotech.
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:01.520]  They've already rolled it out.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:03.520]  They've got a lot of new vaccines that they call
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:05.520]  biological nanotech.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:07.520]  And it's in the literature that you're already being injected
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:08.520]  with nanotech.
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:14.520]  The H1N1 vaccine was a engineered nanotech virus
[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:17.520]  and was put out in the population the year before.
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:19.520]  That was declassified.
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:23.520]  They called it a tracker viral simulant
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:29.520]  that it turned out was a real autoimmune suppressing weapon.
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:30.520]  It didn't even really give you the flu.
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:32.520]  And that even came out in the Canadian news
[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:34.520]  because so many scientists and government people are not bad.
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:36.520]  The other uncompartimentalized side,
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:41.520]  that's why they want total control to shut that down,
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:45.520]  they would then go to the research at one university
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:47.520]  or at the federal government in Canada in that case
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:50.520]  and go, oh my gosh, this is giving you the regular flu.
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:52.520]  Oh my gosh, this is a nanotech.
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:53.520]  Oh look, literature.
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:58.520]  Last year this was put in the vaccine as a virus tracker,
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:45:59.520]  a quote, harmless flu,
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.520]  but they could test the spread of it.
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:03.520]  It wasn't.
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:08.520]  They literally put a nanotech bio weapon.
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:10.520]  This came out in the news.
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:13.520]  Not in speculative websites.
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:16.520]  Just claiming classified documents without linking to them.
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:18.520]  When we give you classified documents, folks, we link to it.
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:20.520]  We have the FBI show up here.
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:22.520]  We have the Secret Service show up here.
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:24.520]  We have the Federal Marshal show up here.
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:27.520]  I get to get beaten up in parking lots.
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:32.520]  I mean, this is real.
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:34.520]  So the whole issue here is that,
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:35.520]  I just don't like this thing.
[02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:39.520]  I got a document or this document or that without a document.
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:41.520]  Our documents will have phone numbers.
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:43.520]  You can call up angry feds on them and they will threaten you
[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:46.520]  and say you shouldn't have this.
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:51.520]  Our documents become national news stories because they're real.
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:53.520]  They're rolling out everything, folks.
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:55.520]  So yes, it's the end of free will.
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:01.520]  And the establishment is insane and needs to stop it.
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.520]  You are the threat to the planet.
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:06.520]  You are the people that detonated over 100 high powered hydrogen bombs
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:10.520]  in North American airspace to try to blow holes in the ozone layer
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:13.520]  and destroy the Van Allen radiation belt and ignite the atmosphere
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:23.520]  and cause a electromagnetic event to test blowing out transistors.
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:25.520]  And that's declassified.
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:27.520]  It's just the stuff that's declassified.
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:30.520]  Like I told you, one of Rick Perry's top people came to the end game
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:32.520]  when it premiered because he knew Rick Perry was in it.
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:34.520]  And he said, no, the governor sent me down there.
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:36.520]  He didn't say it was off record.
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.520]  He said, I wanted to see the movie because he knows he's in it
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:40.520]  and he likes you and he's not really a bad guy.
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:44.520]  And by the way, I worked in the Army at Fort San Houston.
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:46.520]  And they brought in a group of special forces
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:48.520]  and we were told to give them inoculations
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:50.520]  and they died three days later, all of them.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:52.520]  And then we went in in spacesuits basically
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:54.520]  and sprayed the whole place off of disinfectant
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:57.520]  and they threw the furniture away.
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:01.520]  And he goes, so I know your movie's real.
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:03.520]  I mean, that's what goes on.
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:05.520]  And they're compartmentalized.
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:07.520]  What is this? We're just told to give the guys shots.
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:10.520]  You kill them.
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:13.520]  It's just, I mean, this is what we deal with,
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:24.520]  the cult of letting these globalists do whatever they want.
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:26.520]  And you know, people say, oh, that's that crazy Alex Jones.
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:28.520]  They don't even say that anymore.
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:30.520]  It's like, what are you going to do about it?
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:32.520]  They're coming out with vaccines quote where you're not upset anymore.
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:34.520]  They're going to give troops when they're,
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:36.520]  get out of the military.
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:38.520]  They're going to give it to all of them.
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:40.520]  They're trying to push them on quote the depressants right now.
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:42.520]  And folks, it literally each area of your brain
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:45.520]  associated with spiritual experiences, euphoria.
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.520]  It's also associated with depression.
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:49.520]  And your husband comes home.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:51.520]  He's going to be a robot and do whatever he says
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:54.520]  like a human forklift.
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:56.520]  They're already giving troops shots
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:00.520]  that literally destroy their minds.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:02.520]  I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that.
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:04.520]  People say, well, what do we do?
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:06.520]  I don't know. Listen.
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:08.520]  Talk about it.
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:10.520]  Warn people.
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:12.520]  You got to tell them.
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:16.520]  Farland Green's man of people.
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:22.520]  James in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:26.520]  There's one issue that you haven't covered that I've watched.
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:31.520]  Some of your episodes on YouTube and PlayStation 3.
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.520]  Okay.
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:35.520]  I'm not quite making that out.
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:37.520]  PlayStation 3, go ahead.
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:40.520]  It's based on bits.
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:42.520]  Yeah, I'm not making that out either.
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:43.520]  Just start over.
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:45.520]  Start over and tell me exactly what you're saying.
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:46.520]  Okay.
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:49.520]  I'm a veteran military.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:50.520]  Okay.
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:53.520]  And I like how America treats their vets.
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.520]  Well, they treat you like a cannon that's got to be spiked.
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:58.520]  Right.
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:02.520]  And I've actually heard a lot of vets that say,
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:06.520]  oh, well, I can't get the medical treatment that I need.
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:12.520]  Or I can't get the funding that I need to survive.
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:14.520]  Well, yeah, they only use you for propaganda purposes
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:16.520]  at the ballgame to get the kids to sign up.
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:17.520]  They hate your gut.
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:19.520]  You're the number one enemy of the New World Order.
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:20.520]  Oh, yeah.
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:22.520]  That's public.
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:24.520]  The criminals that run our government say you are the enemy.
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:28.520]  That's why they're open enemies of America.
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:33.520]  And I agree with your opinion on guns.
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:34.520]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:35.520]  Thank you.
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:36.520]  Your phone was breaking up a bit.
[02:50:36.520 --> 02:50:37.520]  Sorry, I missed the first part.
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:38.520]  God bless you, James.
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:41.520]  I'm sorry they're really doing horrible things to veterans.
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:43.520]  But they love you.
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:46.520]  Just like when they put HIV in the hepatitis shots
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:49.520]  and gave it to the gay population in New York in 1977
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:51.520]  as a vector to spread it.
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:53.520]  They killed all those people because they loved them.
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:55.520]  Just like they gave the hemophiliacs AIDS,
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:56.520]  they are dead on purpose.
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:58.520]  They didn't get in trouble because they love you.
[02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:27.520]  They're going to go on love you.
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:30.520]  Be prepared or beprepared.com.
[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:00.520]  Just won't quit.
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:31.520]  They even offer a gluten free option.

[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:21.520]  infowarslife.com.
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:23.520]  It makes it all possible.
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:25.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:29.520]  let's go ahead now and go back to the calls.
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:31.520]  We'll do some overdrive to finish the board of calls.
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:34.520]  Allen, New Jersey, then Laura, David, and Ironhead.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:36.520]  Go ahead, Allen, you're on the air.
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:38.520]  Hi, Alex. It's good to talk to you.
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:43.520]  What a difference an hour makes.
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:45.520]  When I first got on hold,
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:49.520]  my whole body was practically vibrating with a...
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:51.520]  I was just jacked up.
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:54.520]  And now I'm totally relaxed,
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:55:56.520]  and I don't even know what to say.
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:55:58.520]  Well, I hear you, buddy.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:00.520]  What did you originally want to call in about?
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:02.520]  I wrote a bunch of stuff down,
[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:07.520]  but I'm glad you introduced me to Steve Quail from your show.
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:10.520]  You had Steve Quail on your show a couple of times.
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:12.520]  Yeah, I want to get Steve Quail back on.
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:15.520]  And did you ever have Stan Dayo on?
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.520]  Did you get him on?
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:20.520]  Yeah, he was good.
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.520]  So I know the truth sets us free,
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:29.520]  and being free is a really bizarre experience
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:32.520]  for someone who's been in bondage your whole life.
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:35.520]  It's like waking up, isn't it?
[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:37.520]  Yeah, and it's scary.
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:41.520]  I mean, physically and mental experiences
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:43.520]  like I've never had before.
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:46.520]  I just started listening to you a few months ago,
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:49.520]  and then those other guys, Steve Quail and...
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:52.520]  I don't know, have you ever heard of Hagman and Hagman Radio?
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:54.520]  Yeah, I'm going to get them back on. They're good guys.
[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:57.520]  Yeah, so I'm into all this now,
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:00.520]  and I don't know, you think Obama could be the Antichrist?
[02:57:00.520 --> 02:57:02.520]  He is an Antichrist.
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:04.520]  The Bible says there are many Antichrists.
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:06.520]  He's the Antichrist spirit.
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:09.520]  Anyone that serves evil and wants to hurt little children
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.520]  and wants to steal consciousness and steal free will
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:15.520]  is of the Antichrist.
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:17.520]  They are the opposite of Christ.
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:22.520]  Antichrist means opposite of Christ, but a counterfeit.
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:24.520]  That's right.
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:26.520]  One other thing I wrote down,
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:28.520]  an experience I had.
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:30.520]  If somebody ever pulls a gun on us
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:34.520]  or a knife, the first thing to do is just charge.
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:36.520]  Absolutely.
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:38.520]  There it is out of 1 John 2.18.
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:40.520]  Even now, many Antichrists have come.
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:43.520]  This is how we know it is the last hour.
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:45.520]  Many Antichrists.
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:47.520]  God bless you, sir.
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:49.520]  They're like Agent Smith and the Matrix.
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:51.520]  It's all the same thing.
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:54.520]  It's all the same spirit, all the same enemy over and over again.
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:57:58.520]  The man in black fled into the desert,
[02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:00.520]  followed by the gunslinger.
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:02.520]  Let's go to Ironhead in Washington.
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:04.520]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:06.520]  Still there?
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:08.520]  Yes, sir. I'm going to take you to the next segment, but go ahead.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:10.520]  Yeah.
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:13.520]  I also caught you last night with George Norrie
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:17.520]  and plenty of fellow before just mentioned Steve Quayle.
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:20.520]  Exemplary of one next beautiful thing about Stevie,
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:24.520]  he combines the spiritual essence with the 3D commentary.
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:27.520]  The one thing I wanted to speak to also the gentleman
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:31.520]  who spoke just before, in terms of problem, reaction, solution.
[02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:33.520]  Stay there. We're coming back in overdrive Internet only.
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:36.520]  infowars.com forward slash show for the free feeds.
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:38.520]  Stay there. I'll have you finish up Ironhead.
[02:58:38.520 --> 02:58:40.520]  Then Laura and David, then we're going to end it.
[02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:42.520]  You are listening to...
[02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:44.520]  Until tonight, 7 o'clock with the news.

[02:59:54.520 --> 02:59:59.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:00.520]  Network.
[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:06.520]  Big Brother.
[03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:08.520]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:10.520]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:11.520]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.520 --> 03:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:22.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:29.520]  All right, Ironhead.
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:30.520]  Go ahead and make the point, sir.
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:32.520]  Talk about the mystery illnesses.
[03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:36.520]  Yeah, regarding that, this is the...
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:40.520]  I believe you took out your relatives, my mother,
[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:43.520]  and a host of other people around us.
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:45.520]  And this is what I was trying to say about,
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:47.520]  instead of going into problem reaction solution,
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:50.520]  as the two gentlemen, previous callers came up with,
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:52.520]  there's a morphic field.
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:54.520]  All points in space and time are connected.
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:56.520]  He who can give us the worst possible
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:00:58.520]  can also give us all of the answers.
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:00.520]  If we drop out of our left brain, out of our mind,
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:02.520]  and do our collective consciousness
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:04.520]  of heartfelt Christ consciousness,
[03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:06.520]  all the answers are right in front of us.
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:09.520]  I'm going to give you one, two names real quickly.
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:11.520]  And Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, which was sad,
[03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:14.520]  the last time I talked to you back in February,
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:16.520]  when we were talking about the mystery illness,
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:18.520]  I was going to mention Dr. Sherry Tenpenny,
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:20.520]  because she is one of the leading...
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:22.520]  And we've had her on probably 50 times
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:24.520]  over the last decade,
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:25.520]  and her husband just died,
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:28.520]  so we've been kind of letting her have some time off.
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:30.520]  Right, and well, she's also one of the leading
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:33.520]  foremost experts on chlorine dioxide, MMS.
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:35.520]  With my mother, we took out the flu.
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:37.520]  I had the flu, too, here after Christmas.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:39.520]  And 48 hours completely annihilated it.
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:41.520]  Within one week, this mystery illness,
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:43.520]  whatever you want to call it, goes to the lungs.
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:45.520]  And it's all about oxidizers.
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:48.520]  Two names, Sherry Tenpenny and Dr....
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:50.520]  I'm not a doctor, but Jim humbled me.
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:52.520]  Yeah, yeah, we'll get her back on. God bless you. Thank you.
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:54.520]  Okay, Lori in Ohio.
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:56.520]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:58.520]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:00.520]  Thank you.
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:04.520]  I just wanted to comment on the lady from France.
[03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:08.520]  She said it was too late to wake up.
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:11.520]  It may have taken me two years between
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:13.520]  my husband, Shiloh, and you,
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:15.520]  but I am fully awake,
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:19.520]  and I just want to thank you and my husband.
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:24.520]  And I try and plug and throw things out there
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:27.520]  that I've learned from the both of you,
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:31.520]  to co-workers, to friends, as much as I can.
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:36.520]  For example, real quick, a co-worker was telling me
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:40.520]  how she wanted to start eating healthier and things like that.
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:44.520]  And I said, well, don't buy anything fruit or vegetable
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:45.520]  from the West Coast.
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:48.520]  And she looked at me with this really strange look,
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:49.520]  and she was like, why?
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:52.520]  And I said, Fukushima, the radiation.
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:56.520]  She had no clue what that was.
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:02:59.520]  And I was flabbergasted.
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:02.520]  Well, they're doing blood tests on people on the West Coast,
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:04.520]  and they've got increased radiation,
[03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:07.520]  isotopes in their blood, very serious situation.
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:08.520]  I mean, this is happening.
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:09.520]  Yeah.
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:13.520]  And I had to literally sit there and explain to her,
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:16.520]  you know, how Fukushima came about with the earthquake
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:17.520]  and all that stuff.
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:20.520]  And I said, you need to download Drudge Report,
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:24.520]  and you need to go to infowars.com
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:28.520]  and read all you can and get healthy
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:29.520]  and stay healthy.
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:33.520]  The very next day, she came running at me through the store,
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:38.520]  and she's like, I cannot believe how effed up the world is.
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:42.520]  And, you know, so I try and do all I can to spread the word.
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:43.520]  Sure.
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:44.520]  I mean, that was the issue with the lady.
[03:03:44.520 --> 03:03:45.520]  She just woke up a few months ago,
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:47.520]  and she says no one's going to wake up.
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:48.520]  It doesn't happen right away.
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:52.520]  It's like 410 from Navarone, which is based on a composite
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:54.520]  of true stories, where they blow up the dam,
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:57.520]  and it doesn't crack and fall apart right away.
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:03:58.520]  It takes a few minutes.
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:03:59.520]  Yeah.
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:00.520]  And it's the same thing.
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:02.520]  You got to keep firing on the enemy.
[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:03.520]  They will go down.
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:04.520]  Yeah.
[03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:06.520]  My husband and I had many fights.
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:08.520]  I would fight him tooth and nail.
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:10.520]  Why are you listening to this?
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:12.520]  I don't understand why you have to listen to this.
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:14.520]  Why are you making me listen to this?
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:15.520]  And then one day it just clicked.
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:16.520]  Oh, my God.
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:20.520]  You know, I didn't realize I got to jump at great points.
[03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:21.520]  David, you only got 30 seconds.
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:22.520]  I apologize.
[03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:24.520]  I didn't see you were calling from South America.
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:25.520]  Go ahead.
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:26.520]  You got 30.
[03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:30.520]  Okay, you know, ahead of the epiphany is more and more police
[03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:33.520]  ignore the Supreme Court regarding the legality of recording
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:34.520]  police.
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:36.520]  They beat up journalists and regular citizens,
[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:38.520]  and arrest them for contempt of cop, basically.
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:40.520]  Now, there's going to be a trend, and this is going to start
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:42.520]  to be more than a daily event.
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:45.520]  Mainstream media are really going to start to get into
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:48.520]  reporting it, but it's not going to be for any noble reason.
[03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:51.520]  It will be to sell the idea of having your smartphone
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.520]  automatically record any interaction with the police.
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:56.520]  That's right. They're already selling that.
[03:04:56.520 --> 03:04:57.520]  Great idea. You're right.
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:05:26.520]  Let the computers take over. That's the plan.
