[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:33.200]  investigative journalist wane madson joins us in the next hour jeb bush conclusively linked
[00:33.200 --> 00:39.600]  to major drug cartels and money laundering well his dad headed up the cia the cocaine
[00:39.600 --> 00:46.000]  importation agency what do you expect but the bush's classically get massive amounts of campaign
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  funds out of latin america from major drug cartels that's come out before and of course i
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.640]  ran contra and the rest of it hillary gets her money from third world dictators for weapons
[00:56.640 --> 01:03.840]  transfers and also for major drug cartels as well they are a bunch of gangsters and of course the
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.440]  fb is now rated her hard drives but it's being sent to the justice department run by them to
[01:09.440 --> 01:17.360]  basically deep six all the information but the democrats are in major panic mode they're in turmoil
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.080]  and bernie sanders the socialist is surging to the head of the line that's some of the news that's
[01:24.080 --> 01:30.640]  up on drudge report if you go to info wars you can see the wane madson report he's a reporter
[01:30.640 --> 01:39.200]  for info wars dot com breaking all of that down uh it is again an exclusive story on info wars dot
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.760]  com jeb bush linked to cartel money laundering while serving the cia jeb should explain his
[01:45.760 --> 01:51.040]  association with violent cartels he spends much of the year in mexico he goes to very
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.880]  secretive conferences with mexican leaders even when he's not governor i mean he is a major
[01:56.880 --> 02:04.640]  capo in organized crime in my view but i mean his his grandfather was the top nazi agent in the us
[02:05.200 --> 02:11.360]  we reported that 17 years ago but it was in the one in guardian even the new york times the last
[02:11.360 --> 02:19.600]  six seven years and the week they were going to arrest him prescott bush he created a bunch of
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.600]  veterans organizations right as world war two was starting including the ones where they get the
[02:25.600 --> 02:31.760]  you know hollywood folks and entertainers to go entertain uh the troops and so oh you know too
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.320]  big of a pr stunt can't do that and it was because so many of the political elite were
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.560]  involved as well they didn't want to have the embarrassment just like edward the eighth king
[02:42.560 --> 02:49.360]  of england had to step down because he was a nazi and when that came out in the news two weeks ago
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.000]  people were all apologizing to me or three weeks ago i was getting all these emails and calls it's
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.920]  like it's all over the news the queen of england heiling hitler queen elizabeth the second in video
[02:59.920 --> 03:06.400]  and in film footage when she was a little kid uh with her uncle the king i'm telling you folks and
[03:06.400 --> 03:15.120]  i want to be clear i'm not saying this is a nazi conspiracy i'm explaining that that's the mindset
[03:15.120 --> 03:20.960]  of these people that they got on board with the nazis because the nazis got on board with british
[03:20.960 --> 03:30.240]  and us eugenics and so if you want to understand what's currently happening today if you want to
[03:30.240 --> 03:38.400]  understand why the elites operate the way they do that's what this is the vaccines the gmo the
[03:38.400 --> 03:47.120]  floride it's all social engineering's and these people wrote books about it and we make films
[03:47.120 --> 03:51.840]  showing you the books showing you the statements and if we ever push it out in the open that plan
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.720]  parenthood created the nazis created them if we ever push it out in the open that they funded the
[03:58.720 --> 04:06.400]  keiserville home institute and created nazism before hitler ever showed up and took over the
[04:06.400 --> 04:12.800]  national socialist workers party if we're ever able to push out the organ harvesting of babies
[04:12.800 --> 04:19.200]  then every other domino will fall and now major political republican candidate dr ben karson
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.520]  i think would make a great president by the way i mean that would be a real black president right
[04:23.520 --> 04:30.560]  there a patriot a christian a brain surgeon a smart guy with a libertarian bent he's come out
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.400]  on the news and said plan parenthood are the klan are the nazis are the enemy and picked up our push
[04:36.400 --> 04:43.600]  with uh dr children's and others to say all lives matter and all black lives matter because they
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.480]  obsess over you know maybe a hundred blacks shot a year in questionable circumstances like it's the
[04:48.480 --> 04:54.080]  end of the world but george soros funding it while we've got millions of blacks a year getting
[04:54.080 --> 05:00.640]  chopped up inside the womb and it's part of the nazi operation turns out it wasn't just yoga moves
[05:00.640 --> 05:05.760]  on hillary's server after all after months of denials and delaying actions hillary clinton
[05:05.760 --> 05:10.960]  has decided to turn over her private email server to the department of justice well she really doesn't
[05:10.960 --> 05:16.080]  have much choice these weren't just ordinary secrets found in clinton's private server
[05:16.080 --> 05:22.480]  but some of the most classified material the u.s government has in other words top secret but what
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.680]  difference at this point does it make right hillary especially after it's been revealed that chinese
[05:27.680 --> 05:34.640]  email hackers have been spying on top us figures since 2010 and clinton's server was completely
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.680]  unencrypted for several months people found to have willfully mishandled such highly classified
[05:39.680 --> 05:45.360]  information faced severe punishment at minimum they have their clearances suspended pending the
[05:45.360 --> 05:51.040]  outcome of the investigation if the democratic frontrunner who's now under a criminal fbi probe

[08:38.000 --> 08:44.240]  investigative journalist wane madson has done it again info wars.com reporter will be joining us
[08:44.240 --> 08:53.520]  coming up at the start of the next hour to break down his report at info wars.com exclusive
[08:53.520 --> 08:59.280]  jeb bush linked to cartel money laundering while serving the cia and the clinton's are linked to
[08:59.280 --> 09:07.440]  it too that's why these two families work together and why they call each other family truly disgusting
[09:07.440 --> 09:16.240]  and i hope he's for real but donald trump is hooked in with both groups as well and is talking
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.600]  about a third party run which you better believe will put hillary clinton in the white house but
[09:21.600 --> 09:29.840]  a lot of people say bushes don't run to lose so it could be jeb bush well i'm gonna be politically
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.640]  correct because i don't know which one i hate more hillary clinton or jeb bush so i'm gonna support
[09:34.640 --> 09:42.640]  hillary over jeb bush i can't even say that i was being quasi sarcastic but i'm gonna throw up
[09:43.760 --> 09:47.760]  it's like one of those choices where robby the robot can't compute he goes
[09:47.760 --> 09:53.520]  cannot compute cannot compute smoke starts coming out your ears so instead i'm gonna focus on going
[09:53.520 --> 10:00.880]  after speaker of the house john bainer we are very close to having the votes as congressman
[10:00.880 --> 10:10.080]  walter jones talked about yesterday to remove him from the speakership and if we had one tenth or even
[10:10.080 --> 10:17.120]  less of the energy that patriots libertarians constitutionalist paleo conservatives had
[10:17.120 --> 10:23.280]  focusing on the dog and pony show that is the 2016 presidential election if we had a micron
[10:23.280 --> 10:32.400]  of that energy focused on going after these rhino globalists that help ride obama care
[10:32.400 --> 10:38.000]  who are pushing for open borders who are pushing to expand the national debt these people that are
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.520]  just as bad as nancy polosi just as bad as harry reid and they are the reason we can't get this
[10:47.520 --> 10:54.320]  country out of a rut and we had ran paul just three months ago the front runner he'd been the
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.880]  front runner for a year now in the middle of the pack because of the donald trump
[11:02.240 --> 11:08.080]  extravaganza so here's all i'm saying i think most of what trump sands dead on i like the fact
[11:08.080 --> 11:13.680]  he's aggressive he doesn't apologize that's refreshing he's confident and he has knowledge
[11:13.680 --> 11:20.560]  make no mistake if he wanted to he could win the presidency and he knows tactics and techniques of
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.080]  free market and cutting taxes that would reverse this country's nose dive and pull the world out
[11:26.080 --> 11:33.040]  of a depression but the very globalist that he's worked with his whole life don't want that they
[11:33.040 --> 11:37.920]  want to bring down national sovereignty in the middle class and the single family home and all
[11:37.920 --> 11:44.720]  the rest of it under the global treaty agenda 21 that is the plan standardized from germany
[11:45.360 --> 11:53.520]  to australia to the united states from south africa to chile all these countries are basically
[11:53.520 --> 12:01.120]  under the same system and so i don't see donald trump delivering on that i hope he does i'm giving
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.520]  him benefit of the doubt and there are people that get violently angry if i don't denounce donald trump
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.920]  there are people to get viciously angry if i don't fall down his feet and worship him
[12:11.920 --> 12:19.680]  as a second coming of blsbump all i know is i smell a big stinking rat
[12:22.560 --> 12:26.640]  now there's a lot of news we're going to be getting to today i could feel death massive
[12:26.640 --> 12:33.520]  explosion rocks chinese port city marshal law declared 42 dead nine firemen over 400 injured
[12:33.520 --> 12:44.320]  another environmental disaster epa contractor behind colorado mine spill got 381 million
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.520]  dollars from taxpayers yeah one of the biggest scams and boondoggles is the so-called environmental
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.760]  cleanups and even the government even the different accounting offices that have looked at this you
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.800]  can pull it up yourself admit that a lot of the times these cleanups do more environmental damage
[12:58.800 --> 13:07.520]  than what's already there but you got a lot of these no bid contracts going to selected friends
[13:07.520 --> 13:14.160]  selected groups billions and billions of years spent on this and now the epa may have been
[13:14.160 --> 13:18.640]  trying to hide the identity of the contracting company responsible for causing a major wastewater
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.720]  spill in southern colorado but the wall street journal has revealed the company's identity
[13:22.720 --> 13:28.880]  environmental resources llc a missouri-based firm was the contractor whose work caused a mine spill
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.200]  in colorado that released an estimated three million gallons of toxic sludge into a major
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.600]  river system the wall street journal was told a source familiar with the matter the paper also
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.040]  found government documents to cooperate what their source told them we'll get into that
[13:42.480 --> 13:49.920]  creepy school um that's their quote rolls out iris scanning for cafeteria buying and selling
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.720]  i mean yeah that's that's the mark of the beast the spy satellite secrets and hillary's emails
[13:57.440 --> 14:04.560]  not news unarmed white teen killed by cop two white cops killed by blacks call it the ferguson
[14:04.560 --> 14:10.800]  effect we're going to get into the massive economic bubble and the crisis with china
[14:11.840 --> 14:17.120]  with harry dent who predicted it all with precision formerly with bane capitol or the
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.360]  chief strategist and analyst he'll be joining us to talk about the economy in the third hour
[14:23.360 --> 14:29.200]  and the demographic cliff people weren't listening when he was on five years ago or a year ago or six
[14:29.200 --> 14:36.640]  months ago predicting all of this but boy they're listening now that's what's crazy people never
[14:36.640 --> 14:43.360]  listen when the information could really help them they listen once it's once the bus is about
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.520]  two feet away from me about to run you over and quite frankly they again they say a cobbler's
[14:49.520 --> 14:55.520]  children have no shoes a shoemaker's children have no shoes i'm the same way i haven't really gotten
[14:55.520 --> 14:59.680]  ready for all the stuff coming down the road i'm too busy running around on the parapet like a chicken
[14:59.680 --> 15:08.560]  with my head cut off trying to warn people and i've mentioned this since last week but i'm
[15:08.560 --> 15:15.360]  going to play the clip coming up former head of defense intelligence agency former intelligence
[15:15.360 --> 15:23.200]  chief isis rise it was a willful washington decision former dia director us made willful
[15:23.200 --> 15:29.040]  decision to support isis and syria and i say that now because obama started nato bombing
[15:29.040 --> 15:38.400]  campaigns against any syrian forces that try to fight isis or al-qaeda we ought to get uh michael
[15:38.400 --> 15:43.680]  maloof on to talk about that sometime this week or next week that's a world that daily
[15:43.680 --> 15:51.120]  wnd.com article here's some of the news up on info wars dot com state department establishes

[16:02.080 --> 16:07.040]  stirring up the russians i mean this is this is what obama's doing and of course if the russians
[16:07.040 --> 16:12.320]  were communist or evil or doing something to america i'd say go ahead and do that but rush
[16:12.320 --> 16:17.760]  does not do anything to anybody george soros overthrew ukraine a year and a half ago and it's

[24:39.680 --> 24:47.840]  merit on quality on free association in real choice political correctness and globalism
[24:47.840 --> 24:54.800]  is a worldwide mafia system a planetary corporate government above the law with diplomatic
[24:54.800 --> 25:01.920]  community with the power to create unlimited digital currency and counterfeit financial
[25:01.920 --> 25:10.160]  instruments with that they then force buyout the nation states companies and individuals
[25:10.880 --> 25:17.360]  ah you're not going to sell they have written global regulations being implemented at a
[25:17.360 --> 25:26.000]  planetary and local level to make it impossible for you to operate to bankrupt you again microcosm
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.040]  example one conservative group in three years by the irs has been given tax exemption 10 000 plus
[25:35.040 --> 25:42.400]  have been given to socialist communist liberal and nambla type organizations if you're nambla you get it
[25:42.400 --> 25:51.600]  by controlling money they control everything it was george washington that said famously
[25:52.400 --> 25:58.240]  the power to tax is the power to destroy and then the head of the supreme court decades later
[25:59.440 --> 26:05.040]  quoted washington and expanded on that that the power to tax was the power to destroy if
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.720]  you run government as the general electric that sat on the president's economic commission
[26:10.720 --> 26:18.400]  and you get him to put in place regulations outside of law to shut down now it's upwards
[26:18.400 --> 26:26.560]  to a thousand power plants a thousand coal powered plants most of them of new manufacturer totally
[26:26.560 --> 26:33.440]  clean and then general electrics given a five year waiver that's about to be up we'll see
[26:33.440 --> 26:39.120]  him obama reissues he gave it to him his first about a year into office this was five years ago
[26:39.120 --> 26:46.960]  a five year waiver where they could stay open and operate what happened in five years general
[26:46.960 --> 26:55.200]  electric expanded its power output and increased profits massively but couldn't supply enough
[26:55.200 --> 27:02.560]  and so power prices went up and industrialization collapsed further the federal government
[27:02.560 --> 27:10.880]  traderously outside of law literally increased electricity prices by almost 100 percent in
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.880]  the last six years and they're just getting started in his last two years in office obama
[27:16.880 --> 27:25.120]  pledged two weeks ago to further quote cripple coal and every time i talk about this they have
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.240]  articles in newspapers i mean there's no kidding probably 30 newspapers attacked me yesterday
[27:30.240 --> 27:37.760]  i haven't even checked today saying alex jones paid off by big energy promotes coal i've never
[27:37.760 --> 27:50.480]  been paid one micron not one stinking red penny from coal but doesn't matter just say i'm paid off
[27:50.480 --> 27:55.120]  by coal and let the president go around giving speeches saying you can build a coal power plant
[27:55.120 --> 28:02.480]  but we will bankrupt you that's a quote there's a lot of telegraph barack obama's green plans
[28:02.480 --> 28:08.480]  could cripple america's economy do you know who followed everything in the un treaty to a t in
[28:08.480 --> 28:15.680]  europe and who now has 42 percent unemployment it's called spain gorgeous country incredible
[28:15.680 --> 28:24.240]  resources smart hardworking people and flying into spain from the aircraft all i saw was wind
[28:24.240 --> 28:30.720]  mills on their coast and in their mountains windmills that don't produce a third of the power for the
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.400]  cost and are incredibly expensive to maintain and have to transfer the power over long distances
[28:38.160 --> 28:44.400]  and it's crippled their country they are crippled spain is crippled
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.560]  and that's the plan and now they're going under e u dictatorship and just as i said a month ago
[28:52.560 --> 28:57.440]  spain is next to fall it was in the financial times of london when i flew back to the united

[34:14.960 --> 34:21.120]  just shows why the power structure pushes these two families is because they are so mobbed up
[34:21.120 --> 34:30.000]  and so corrupt and can be basically blackmailed now joining us is reverend clenard children's
[34:30.000 --> 34:37.520]  of black genocide dot ol rg radio host author filmmaker and he was just on with us a few months
[34:37.520 --> 34:44.640]  ago when he started the movement all black lives matter and then of course he ultimately went on
[34:44.640 --> 34:51.120]  to point out no all lives matter period and when you see democrat candidates who aren't hillary or
[34:51.120 --> 34:57.920]  aren't uh others come out and say no all live matters then they get attacked uh by the george
[34:57.920 --> 35:04.560]  soros funded movement that wants to make this a race war instead of humanity coming together
[35:04.560 --> 35:12.080]  for life period but he started the all black lives matter movement and now we see that being
[35:12.080 --> 35:19.200]  picked up by dr ben karson the brain surgeon who's running uh as a candidate for the republican
[35:19.200 --> 35:25.760]  party and i think he's a very moral guy very intelligent uh good policies good ideas light
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.960]  years better than a jeb bush i'll say that i'm supporting rand paul because i know him i know
[35:30.960 --> 35:37.680]  he's for real i know he's a patriot uh but i would not cry myself to sleep at night uh if
[35:37.680 --> 35:41.600]  dr ben karson ended up being president in fact i'd love it
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.880]  he has come out on fox news and talked about margaret singer's eugenic philosophy
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.120]  and her ties to the kukluks clan and i know for us that's old news you can just type in
[35:55.120 --> 35:59.760]  margaret singer at clan rallies and it's them all around her worshiping her the rockefellers
[35:59.760 --> 36:05.520]  funded them the keiser vellum institute is what hitler got educated by he gave her awards she
[36:05.520 --> 36:13.600]  gave him awards they were pen pals people over use the term this is not see that's not see i mean
[36:13.600 --> 36:22.720]  when you're talking about plant parenthood it's the nazis mama and they're digging up confederate
[36:22.720 --> 36:29.440]  generals that have nothing to do with any type of racism and they're saying get rid of the battle flag
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.200]  and all this stuff just because some racists use it okay get rid of it but get rid of plant parenthood
[36:35.200 --> 36:41.920]  and public funding for it and get rid of it inside the smithsonian where they have whole
[36:41.920 --> 36:50.880]  areas worshiping her worshiping eugenics colesprings harbour in new york that set up the nazis and
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.560]  their philosophy the nazi science came from colesprings harbour and the rockefeller foundation
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.200]  and margaret singer and of course they had a colesprings harbour had to resign two years ago
[37:01.200 --> 37:06.320]  remember three years ago uh dr watson because he said blacks weren't humans remember that
[37:08.720 --> 37:15.040]  so that's what we're dealing with here is is the so-called democrats so-called liberals
[37:15.040 --> 37:21.760]  i've been around them folks at the high level they're the smart racists that's why george soros
[37:21.760 --> 37:28.960]  nazi collaborator again you can't make this stuff up funds the radical right wing in ukraine it was
[37:28.960 --> 37:34.880]  in even a newsweek that blacks need not apply that that ukrain's racist in the west well of
[37:34.880 --> 37:42.480]  course they are i mean it's nazis not about saying even a majority of the western ukrainians but the
[37:42.480 --> 37:48.400]  large group our government's funding show when they're really racist like hitler told rolling stone i
[37:48.400 --> 37:55.600]  want to be like hitler and i don't like black people in 1977 he gets awards from the adl because
[37:55.600 --> 38:04.160]  he's a nazi but when you fight the real deal they have ns mbc come out and say i'm deeply racist
[38:04.160 --> 38:08.720]  and then show no proof this is how they operate but the great news the reason we got reverend
[38:08.720 --> 38:12.000]  children's song on short notice is before i was going to play this clip the start of the show i
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  thought assuming it reverend children's song because it shows that you can take action and throw that
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.280]  rock in the pool and it sends out waves forever he had the idea and gave speeches and traveled around
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.360]  the country just three four months ago saying let's stop the race war let's talk about all black
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.160]  lives matter let's hijack this george soros term and let's point out the real genocide that's going
[38:32.160 --> 38:38.640]  on that black genocide dot org exposes and now that's happening and now it's in mainstream news
[38:39.200 --> 38:43.920]  that margaret sanger was a nazi and that hillary says she admires her and all the rest of it
[38:43.920 --> 38:51.360]  but let's be fair she gave birth to the nazis ideologically if anybody was their mama because
[38:51.360 --> 38:57.200]  they had a lot of mamas but she was the big mama and of course the rockefellers were the big daddy
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.120]  and and that's why when some dumb ignorant trendy looks at you because you don't want to turn your
[39:03.120 --> 39:08.880]  guns in or you don't want to have your kids raised by the state or you don't want to have high taxes
[39:08.880 --> 39:13.120]  or obama care and they call you a racist like it's a power word you need to get in their face and say
[39:13.120 --> 39:17.520]  shut your stupid mouth you little ignorant creature until you actually know what's really
[39:17.520 --> 39:22.560]  going on out here stop using terms like that when you sit there and work for the most racist
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.720]  evil anti-human people this world's ever seen i'm ranting i'm gonna go to our guest
[39:27.440 --> 39:32.880]  but here is one of the clips of dr ben karson on planned parenthood because it's a controversial
[39:32.880 --> 39:39.040]  group but democrats have seized on republicans concerns about plan parenthood as being a war
[39:39.040 --> 39:45.760]  on women that you're out to get women well you know i maybe i'm not objective when it comes
[39:45.760 --> 39:52.320]  to planned parenthood but you know i know who margaret sanger is and i know that she believed
[39:52.320 --> 39:59.120]  in eugenics and that she was not particularly enamored with black people and and one of the
[39:59.120 --> 40:05.440]  reasons that you find most of their clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find a
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.800]  way to control that population and i think people should go back and read about margaret sanger
[40:10.800 --> 40:16.400]  who founded this place a woman who hillary clinton by the way says that she admires look and see
[40:16.400 --> 40:23.680]  what many people and nazi germany thought about her wow and they couldn't kill all the black people
[40:23.680 --> 40:28.800]  she said that was her goal in in the letters so instead they came in broke up the family paid
[40:28.800 --> 40:34.240]  women not to have men in the house mtv funded gangster rap and i've talked to former mtv top
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.640]  executives they were in the meetings in the early 90s they said rock and roll is going out
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.800]  we're going to go with violent gangster rap that's the directive from the government
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.120]  and part of that's been declassified and i've had top rappers i mean you know from public enemy
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.400]  you name it who have exposed this as well i mean this is the plan before that rap was about
[40:54.400 --> 40:59.520]  empowerment the community hip hop and then it just got taken over and now it's a disease spreading
[40:59.520 --> 41:06.240]  across the world causing crime you name it in in every population weaponized media joining us now
[41:06.240 --> 41:14.960]  is reverend clenard children's and he joins us black genocide dot org and since 1974 he's been
[41:14.960 --> 41:20.960]  fighting against the extermination of everybody but particularly the main focus the apple of the
[41:20.960 --> 41:26.960]  eugenesis knife is black people and uh if you they can't kill all the blacks they'll just kill
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.520]  their culture they've done a pretty good job now they're killing everybody else so it's like tony
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.000]  brown has said on this show what they do to the blacks they do to everybody folks uh so joining
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.160]  us reverend thank you for coming on i know uh you've got to feel a little bit of satisfaction
[41:40.160 --> 41:45.520]  that finally who margaret shanger really is is breaking out big time is that exciting to you sir
[41:46.160 --> 41:53.680]  oh this is absolutely awesome uh it's going far beyond what i thought originally but
[41:53.680 --> 42:02.240]  but unquestionably i want to give kudos to uh dr carlson and certainly his platform right now is
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.440]  basically saving babies because people are beginning to connect the dots i'd like to personally thank
[42:09.440 --> 42:16.320]  george soros for funding black life matters because certainly it has connected the dots to the womb
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.760]  and it's doing just as we thought it would i i know we both thought about it at the same time
[42:21.760 --> 42:28.720]  and we're getting out into public square we were at the NAACP convention it was just unbelievable
[42:28.720 --> 42:35.280]  people when you start the conversation black life matters they're in agreement he's plowing up the
[42:35.280 --> 42:42.960]  ground for me for us to come in and say well what about here in the womb do you know that 1786
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.880]  african-american children are killed each day do you recognize that 52 percent of all pregnancies
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.720]  african-american in an abortion isn't that genocide do you recognize that this group is targeting
[42:55.280 --> 43:01.680]  african-americans and if they didn't know it before how sinister and insidious Planned Parenthood
[43:01.680 --> 43:07.440]  is now thank god for the center for medical progress this is all coming together it's like a
[43:07.440 --> 43:14.880]  crescendo of god helping the pro-life activists giving them the tools that they need we can't
[43:14.880 --> 43:22.000]  take credit for it because it certainly is an act of god totally but we have to ride the wave
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.360]  and so sure and as you know it's not about taking credit but we do need to get people's morale up
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.440]  because we're having victories every time good people take action i told you about mckayle
[43:31.440 --> 43:35.840]  failing here separately from you months after you were doing it we didn't even know even though
[43:35.840 --> 43:40.720]  you've been a guest in part of our work we didn't know you'd launched originally all black lives
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.960]  matter he had the idea i thought we ought to get reverend children's on and see what he thinks
[43:44.960 --> 43:50.560]  and you go yeah i launched it months ago we looked it up it was like simultaneously or just
[43:51.280 --> 43:56.720]  the spirit moving us whatever it was happening oh you got you to hit the nail around and it was
[43:56.720 --> 44:05.120]  the spirit and that really encouraged me to to know in that this was the thing to invest my time
[44:05.120 --> 44:13.040]  resources uh our our ministry in and and really take it to a level that we can we've never been
[44:13.040 --> 44:20.880]  before let's spend more time let's be more time on the radio let's really begin to uh totally you
[44:20.880 --> 44:28.720]  know sacrifice ourselves in this mantra that they had created for us and just add all black life
[44:28.720 --> 44:34.400]  matters and expose the hypocrisy and i have to tell you this story you just give me one minute
[44:34.400 --> 44:41.920]  i work out there at the uh NAACP i won't say the person's name but a top ranking NAACP
[44:42.560 --> 44:48.800]  delegate from a city where where they are holding the position of vice president they are a pastor
[44:48.800 --> 44:54.960]  she came out and took pictures of every one of our signs and uh and and and she's looking at it and
[44:54.960 --> 45:01.040]  she's comparing them she says this is wonderful we have to get this to our city and so my wife
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.840]  happened to be there she walked her over to me she says we have to bring this program to our city
[45:05.840 --> 45:11.920]  i'm the vice president of my chapter uh and i said what chapter she said the national action
[45:11.920 --> 45:20.880]  committee i got to get Al Sharpton involved in this so i said well that'd be a great day ma'am uh
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.280]  hopefully you let me know of your success i tell you i kept a straight face
[45:25.280 --> 45:34.000]  is skype just for a moment i'm sorry your your skype froze uh reverend you said you kept a straight
[45:34.000 --> 45:41.040]  face okay i i kept a straight face and said and uh didn't let her know what she'd be in for
[45:41.040 --> 45:46.480]  but i'm just totally letting you to know the ignorance of african americans when it comes
[45:46.480 --> 45:54.400]  to the abortion politics and it exposes how well these leaders like jesse jackson al sharped in the
[45:54.400 --> 46:03.200]  congressional black caucus the NAACP have censored the message uh really here she is a high-ranking
[46:03.200 --> 46:09.520]  officer in the national action committee in her town and she doesn't know how Al Sharpton really
[46:09.520 --> 46:14.240]  manipulates this subject well here's the good news is your this is why this is so huge folks
[46:14.240 --> 46:20.880]  this is coffin nails to the globalist agenda if this ever comes out it's a game changer when
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.760]  they're over there race baiting using a few sad stories of cops in questionable positions shooting
[46:25.760 --> 46:32.240]  somebody in the back cops get indicted whatever they're totally distracting from the real issue
[46:32.240 --> 46:37.680]  and if that ever comes out of that narrative ever gets in the discussion it's over for the
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.040]  democrats and the party of the coup class klan well that's the most exciting thing about it
[46:43.040 --> 46:48.880]  once again you hit the nail around the head and i'm getting trying to get pro-lifers to recognize
[46:48.880 --> 46:56.640]  this is the nail in the coffin this changes the narrative in the minds of millions this is an eye
[46:56.640 --> 47:02.960]  opener where people objectively really then now have to step back and say what is going on here
[47:03.520 --> 47:09.600]  what is this institution about and why have we been censored from this message exactly
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.320]  exactly instead of just saying their babies they could live outside the womb their humans be sweet
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.480]  that's part of the debate maybe a third of it but they never want us to strike it the root
[47:18.480 --> 47:24.400]  where it came from what it's about how sinister it is i found you put the truth out that defeats it
[47:24.400 --> 47:30.400]  and that's why when we go out and demonstrate for all black lives matter literal demons i'm sure
[47:30.400 --> 47:36.000]  you've seen the video show up black demons white demons you name it they are literal demons and they
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.720]  start professing they love killing babies they love the devil at the state house have you seen
[47:40.720 --> 47:46.080]  the video where they start saying hell satan i mean these are sick people and by us you and others
[47:46.080 --> 47:52.160]  going out and confronting them it makes them come out from under rocks and show people what we're
[47:52.160 --> 47:57.200]  really dealing with and now the entire tack as you said months ago on the show and you said god
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.440]  had really shown you this could happen and i think we're seeing providence here and i could feel how
[48:01.440 --> 48:07.280]  big it is that that we could change the tack from the arguments that are slow and aren't really winning
[48:07.280 --> 48:13.200]  overall we're slowly gaining ground but we need decisive victories and by changing the whole
[48:13.200 --> 48:18.320]  debate from you know the old kind of stale pro-life thing to really striking at the heart of it
[48:18.320 --> 48:24.080]  we could see the collapse we could see them defunded we could really see them defeated
[48:24.720 --> 48:32.000]  and that would be the greatest blessing for america in the last 200 years so uh we're right now at
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.360]  that front line i asked your listeners to be supportive uh to carry the narrative on their
[48:37.360 --> 48:45.440]  facebook's on their conversations uh it's getting to the black community such as never has been before
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.360]  since i've been involved and i'm just just so deeply excited about the fact that politicians now
[48:51.360 --> 48:57.520]  are going to have to give an answer first cece richards now has to explain about the blobs she
[48:57.520 --> 49:04.880]  told those young girls that she had in that blob was arms legs livers brains that she was selling
[49:04.880 --> 49:13.120]  for more profit uh now politicians uh have to explain their vote to fund planned parenthood
[49:13.120 --> 49:20.400]  every democrat and if there's any republican they should have be held accountable i mean right now
[49:20.400 --> 49:28.400]  why did you cast that vote to fund this heinous uh opera this heinous institution and that is purely
[49:28.400 --> 49:37.280]  racist and that is targeting african-americans and we need to really now we have a tool a means
[49:37.280 --> 49:43.760]  really to shake the system i mean literally shake it so uh i say to all those who are listening
[49:43.760 --> 49:50.000]  don't be afraid to carry this message they started it so let us come in now and really take this to
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.920]  the level where it needs to be and connect the dots back to the womb the democrats are in big
[49:55.920 --> 50:04.080]  trouble right now if we lay back if we do not go forward if we don't charge this is a time to
[50:04.080 --> 50:12.480]  charge storm the gates don't let the conversation go to the back burner again um mr politician
[50:12.480 --> 50:18.320]  do you support planned parenthood will you continue legislation that will be supportive of
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.400]  planned that's right who could have ever imagined planned parent who would now be one of the main
[50:22.400 --> 50:28.800]  issues in 2016 while we have all these bombshell videos while we'll be uh they're being exposed
[50:28.800 --> 50:33.600]  while you and others have hijacked the black lives matter fraud i mean it's just beautiful
[50:33.600 --> 50:39.600]  we're attacking from every angle we're storming the gates my friend yes and literally we must

[54:50.000 --> 54:57.280]  how do you get your abortions paid i pay for them i thought you said three uh upwards of 50
[54:57.280 --> 55:07.600]  really oh yeah you piece of bunch of misogynist mother take your male privilege somewhere
[55:07.600 --> 55:32.240]  out from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[55:32.240 --> 55:40.080]  i don't want to get preachy here i do not judge people who have had abortions and believed it
[55:40.080 --> 55:44.160]  was just birth control and didn't do it because they love death and hate their children and
[55:44.160 --> 55:49.120]  want to sell body parts but the people running the racket they're the ones that have the bad
[55:49.120 --> 55:55.520]  hearts that's the big evil and and for a lot of pro-life folks out here to say well what are you
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.640]  doing you know telling people that have been involved in all this that that it's okay i've
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.920]  studied the psychology people get into the abortion movement because they're guilty for what they've
[56:05.920 --> 56:13.600]  done they get judged and attacked so they double down and commit to it but i've had incredible
[56:13.600 --> 56:18.800]  success because i myself am guilty of reaching out to people and saying look what matters is
[56:18.800 --> 56:26.640]  how your heart was and especially if it was early on whatever you know in my gut all that
[56:26.640 --> 56:32.400]  matters is you repent and then realize you were fooled you were deceived and that's part of dehumanization
[56:33.360 --> 56:39.840]  but look i get there's a lot of racist black people um in fact a lot of black leaders you've
[56:39.840 --> 56:43.280]  been more honest have can pointed out that black people on average are some of the most racist
[56:43.280 --> 56:46.720]  people you're ever gonna find does that mean a majority are racist absolutely not does that
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.440]  mean they're not wonderful beautiful black people with incredible culture and and and art and
[56:51.440 --> 56:57.600]  everything else who i love absolutely but i grew up in dallas texas and let me tell you this a lot
[56:57.600 --> 57:01.520]  of racist black people i've seen a lot more racist black people than i have seen white people
[57:03.120 --> 57:08.800]  but it's racist white people at the top that are running things and what they've done to black
[57:08.800 --> 57:15.040]  people they're doing to everybody else and at a gut level i don't sit here and go yeah there's too
[57:15.040 --> 57:19.520]  many black people they don't like me good go ahead and abort them except that democrats tell me so
[57:19.520 --> 57:24.400]  many times off record they go you really want more black people running around you really want the
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.360]  gangs all the right i go listen that culture's been injected in black people weren't like that 70
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.920]  years ago 60 years ago i know the numbers and i've talked to people that were alive then
[57:35.520 --> 57:40.880]  government engineering social engineering collectivism did this and i'm not gonna shine on as
[57:40.880 --> 57:46.800]  someone leaders to go okay plant parents taking out the the garbage go ahead and well you like the
[57:46.800 --> 57:50.240]  republican leadership go ahead and let it keep operating because it's getting rid of the minorities
[57:53.520 --> 57:59.120]  the quote minorities that end up living then just like whites or anybody are turned into
[57:59.120 --> 58:03.600]  these socialist brainwash bots i want to free people's minds i want people to understand
[58:03.600 --> 58:11.360]  how they've been enslaved no i mean listen you shine on to killing black people or anybody else
[58:11.360 --> 58:17.840]  you're sick and just because there's a bunch of racist black people because they feel sorry for
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.960]  themselves the media created this victimology doesn't mean i'm gonna lower myself to that level
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.680]  and hate them you understand that i'm here to build people up i'm here to build everybody up
[58:27.680 --> 58:31.680]  and what you do the least of me you've done to me christ said that's what it comes down to

[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:52.240]  bush's connection to narcotics trafficking that should probably be the headline it's a
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:58.000]  strong headline but it's not strong enough exclusive jeb bush linked to cartel money laundering while
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:05.440]  serving cia wane madson the headlines should probably be exclusive jeb bush linked to drug
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:15.120]  cartels exclusive jeb bush linked to drug cartels money laundering because i mean that's really
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:20.960]  what it is and then i'm just going to have the crew in there pull up el paso times chicago tribune
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:27.680]  you just type in head of drug cartel work for cia or head of drug cartel secretly work for
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:33.200]  government and this came out three years ago in court that the major heads go in and say i actually
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:38.880]  work for the cia here's my secret code name and they shut down the prosecutions when the dea is
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:44.480]  going after the head of senola the head of los satis i mean it's a sick job and again the entire
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:51.280]  cia isn't even involved it's compartmentalized groups at the top the cia since it was the os s
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:56.640]  was doing narcotics trafficking a heroine into europe to finance resistance groups against headler
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:01.600]  there it is business insider confirmed dea struck a deal with mexico's most notorious drug cartel
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:07.040]  and that's a business insider kind of whitewash article you read the el paso times and others
[1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:12.560]  we actually broke this four years before with the former dea agent celica still and others on air
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:18.960]  naming him and others and that's what happens once your cover is blown as an operative they then
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:23.840]  arrest you that's like when hell turner got his cover blown as an fbi operative they then indicted
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:29.280]  him why would you want to be an fbi operative or a cia operative when they flush you down the toilet
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.680]  and of course they do that to scare everybody that works for the agencies it's all just
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:40.400]  gangsterism it's incredible the texas attorney general dared stand up against him so he's
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:48.560]  facing prison time now for not telling two people that he was invested in the company that he was
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:55.280]  telling him they ought to invest in at dinner and not paying a thousand dollar fine filing fee
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:03:01.360]  because he quit being a commodities trader and a securities trader years before but still kind of
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:06.400]  halfway did it you know it's like the amish they tricked a couple years ago into selling their
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:11.040]  neighbor cheese they had a year and a half sting cost a million dollars or more it was over a million
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:15.680]  i forget the exact number and they just kept saying sell me cheese please so and they said
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:22.800]  it just have the cheese and then after scores of times of giving him cheese the amish finally went
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:30.480]  okay you can pay me for the cheese and then the government the feds went and sold it across state
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.200]  lines and after they sold the cheese they said great my cousin loves this so much i'm gonna
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:38.800]  sell it to him the next state the amish didn't know what that meant and then they swat team the
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:42.960]  amish here's video we played it put their heads in the ground that's for the jury because if the
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.440]  government's putting your head in the ground you must be bad get down get down get down to the
[1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:55.120]  amish no criminal record selling cheese but again it's all theater whole world is a stage each of
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:01.200]  his players upon it i could bounce a check and they would get me for wire fraud and come in here
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:06.480]  that's what they did to let a little rush and run in here with machine guns and and aim it and
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:12.880]  then show that on the news i must be bad because there's machine guns and i'm on the ground meanwhile
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:18.480]  warren buffett's bank got caught laundering hundreds of billions of dollars hundreds of
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:27.440]  billions in drug money running the aircraft but he's a nice old man with an ice cream cone and a

[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:42.800]  everyone it's okay warren buffett's a nice old man he sits on the eugenics board is a eugenicist
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:49.280]  with bill gates but that's okay because he's liberal and he's the biggest recipient of the
[1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:57.920]  banker bailout your tax money a big fat disgusting degenerate gangster squatting on everyone
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:03.600]  wire is reporting that hackers can disable a sniper rifle or change its target in two weeks at
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:08.000]  the black hat hacker conference a pair of researchers plan on presenting results of a
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:13.120]  year's worth of hacking a pair of 13 000 tracking point self-aiming rifles the hacker couple has
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:17.680]  developed a set of techniques that could allow an attacker to compromise the rifle via its wi-fi
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:22.080]  connection and exploit vulnerabilities in its software their tricks can change variables in
[1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:26.880]  the scope's calculations make the rifle miss its target permanently disable the scope computer
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:31.840]  or even prevent the gun from firing the rifle maker tracking point launched in 2011 sold more
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:36.320]  than a thousand of its linux powered rifles with a self-aiming system the scope allows you to
[1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:40.160]  designate a target and dial in the variables like wind temperature and weight of the ammunition
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:45.360]  being fired the result is a weapon that can allow even a gun novice to reliably hit targets as far as
[1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:50.400]  a mile away but like everything else tied to the grid these two researchers are showing that it can
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:54.720]  be hacked for more information on all the things that can be hacked in this world and what it means

[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:38.800]  making sure there was no spying going on inside the national security agency he has broken hundreds
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:44.800]  of international news stories wane madson now works as a correspondent and will be at least once a
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:49.760]  month going on the road as part of investigative reports and his articles that first appear at

[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:16.480]  with harry dent joining us uh formerly of bane capitol who predicted six months ago that by
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:22.000]  now china would have a plunging stock market and causing a depressionary spiral and would lower
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.120]  the yawn it happened and of course he's made a bunch of other predictions that come true probably
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:33.760]  of all our guests and they're all right up there with about 97 accuracy rates he's becoming probably
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:41.680]  the kingpin of accuracy sickeningly accurate and i wish he wasn't that accurate because this is not
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:46.640]  going to be fine but we'll look at all the aspects and angles of the situation in china that affects
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:52.160]  everybody obviously because we're all under the same fraudulent system people all grease in that
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:57.680]  big all the you know iceland's not that big iron's not that big uh venezuela's not that it's all
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:03.920]  interconnected and the u.s has bigger debts overall when you count them all per capita than

[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:47.360]  to tie it into uh departing us army chief says iraq may have to be partitioned the plan that was the
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:53.840]  clark and others have exposed a decade ago is to break syria in three parts and is to break
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:11:02.320]  iraq in three parts and to give saudi arabia a piece of each one of them that they will then
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:11.520]  put together in the west of iraq west central area into the east of syria and and and make their new
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:23.360]  al qaeda al nazra isis wonderland and the public things were so dumb they have people like jeb bush

[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:49.200]  is crazy town it's like saying the washington redskins are the dallas cowboys with a straight
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:55.600]  face it's like when bush said that iran was supporting al qaeda and then al qaeda was shiai
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:01.360]  with the then president of afghanistan mohammed karzai and karzai said your excellency i apologize
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:07.440]  for correcting you but no it's not the same group knowing to his public that was just ridiculous
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:12.080]  it's like saying oliver cromwell was catholic

[1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:28.640]  got bush who was before you know bush 41 he was the top nazi agent in the us at brown brother
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:33.600]  harrowman that's why they're so secretly rich is that when the nazi wealth collapsed a lot of it
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:38.400]  was hidden in the us and in latin america and you know who got the nazi gold these these guys are
[1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:42.720]  some of the richest people in the world by the way and and and so i mean i guess it pays
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:49.920]  but whatever nazi hitler was on the cover of time magazine is a great guy in 1938 i'm not just
[1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:54.880]  demonizing the bushes out of hand i mean they thought they were on the winning team uh but we'll
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:59.520]  digress into that with wane madsen he's an expert on that subject as well but but wane thank you for
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:04.000]  joining us we're gonna skip this network break to give you more time uh here coming up in a few
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.240]  minutes you you're breaking so much big news i want to fly you uh on the campaign trail if you
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:14.960]  want i know you're in florida part of the time to track bush to really dig into this but great job
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:23.280]  suss out for people exactly the connections you were able to document well i've i discovered and
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:28.480]  you know a lot of this isn't new about the bushes and their connection to the cia and the drug
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:38.800]  trafficking and money laundering uh gary web pioneered on this topic uh back in the 1980s as
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:45.920]  did bob parry uh but i discovered in the cia archives a very interesting letter written on
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:55.040]  texas commerce bank uh letterhead 1977 uh from jee bush that's jeb bush you know jeb isn't his
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:18:01.120]  name that's an acronym his name is john ellis bush anyway it was written on texas commerce bank
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:07.680]  letterhead that's the bank that belongs to the james baker family uh to robert gambino uh the
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:15.440]  director of security for the cia thanking him for uh his uh indoctrination security indoctrination
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:23.040]  given to jeb bush in 1977 before he took off for two years to be the vice president excuse me
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:29.760]  of um texas commerce bank in caracas venezuela when he was in venezuel of course what was he
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:36.320]  doing there of course he had connections the main connections that would be very fortuitous uh for
[1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:43.520]  the future with the the collie and medellin drug cartels in neighboring colombia um and uh anti
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:51.040]  castro cubans who were operating out of venezuela so when he leaves uh caracas with his mexican wife
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:58.880]  and and moves to florida to join his dad's uh 1980 presidential campaign which was then
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:05.680]  against ronald reagan uh reagan reluctantly picked this guy george h.w bush as his vice
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:11.440]  presidential running mate at the eleventh hour all bets were and reagan wanted jerald ford to
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:16.880]  actually be his running mate i think reagan knew about the the dirty business involving the bushes
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:24.640]  but bush was forced on reagan's ticket by uh the money people out of new york and uh including
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:32.160]  william casey who later became a cia director and um so jeb bush uh after uh his dad becomes
[1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:41.680]  vice president the uh is meeting with all these florida-based bankers uh cia assets uh he's responsible
[1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:47.200]  or involved with a lot of the savings and loan collapses in florida and elsewhere of course
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:54.080]  that's how the cia got got a lot of its operating money its flush fund money from these uh made
[1:19:54.080 --> 1:19:58.560]  the fail and then we know from terry read the cia pilot who we can't get in touch with these days
[1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:03.680]  he's been on many times he who wrote the book compromise clinton bush and the cia he was there
[1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:10.000]  at mina years later in the 80s watching all these famous republicans and democrats going and coming
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:16.160]  at the airport and he looks in the c 130s and they're just full of cocaine yeah that's true and
[1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:21.760]  and you know one of the pilots uh who was in and out of mina was uh phil marshal the guy who they
[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:27.440]  said killed himself and his two kids and the family dog out in california a couple years ago i flew
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:33.520]  out there to investigate that if you know if if that was uh suicide i'm the queen of england uh
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:37.040]  why do you think that killed him because he might have been involved in that or because he he was a
[1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:44.240]  911 truther investigating probably they feared the fact that he knew about the cia and all their
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:53.840]  operations from the time of mina and the 1980s that he and being a pilot for 757 and 767 he was
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:21:00.640]  a great threat uh to expose the 9 11 uh incident uh that's why they had to get rid of him this guy
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:06.000]  was i i guess you could call him a man for all seasons when it came to exposing not only the
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:11.040]  cia did he have a book was about to come out i mean why would he yeah just like gerry Webb
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:18.240]  he had written three books one a novel about his time uh flying people like barry seal around
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:24.160]  with the cia and the two others on uh questioning the 9 11 official story he was working on yet a
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:32.560]  third book about the 9 11 but the hard disk uh disappeared from his home uh death and we don't
[1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:38.160]  know uh what became of that the last i heard it was in the it was in the computer lab of the
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:44.240]  justice department of the state of california and sacramento well from my research even pilots
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:49.680]  that play ball and think they're safe living in hawai or whatever they end up just by the time you
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:54.560]  get old they just drop by your house poison you or kill you why would anybody want to work in these
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:22:00.640]  in these dirty operations knowing it's a death sentence well i think if you talk to a lot of
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:06.480]  these people that originally worked for the cia i think it was the you know the excitement uh of
[1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:14.240]  flying for companies like air america and laos uh flying uh down to nicaragua and columbia uh but
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:19.520]  then again then you know these guys soon found out in some cases they were transporting illegal
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:26.400]  narcotics whether it was heroin out of the golden triangle in southeast asia or cocaine out of columbia
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:32.080]  and by the way if you're a new listener they had the solicitor general for the cia admit all this
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:37.120]  in 97 and hearings that you covered we're talking about things that are admitted and then still
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:42.080]  mainstream media will call it conspiracy theorist you know for saying that washington's on the
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:47.600]  patomic i mean we're talking about admitted facts here you've just ferreted out more connections
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:54.480]  with a jebby boy who isn't he really uh george herbert walker's favorite yeah and he's probably
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:02.880]  the more the most sinister of the lot i mean george w bush uh was bad but uh you know he was
[1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:08.880]  kind of an ignoramus when it came came came to what's going on around him that's not the case
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:14.640]  with jeb jeb fully knows what's going on uh he's not a dummy but he's extremely corrupt so when
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:21.360]  you look uh at the period of time before he became governor of florida he's involved in all kinds of
[1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:28.240]  stanky real estate deals with the known uh drug uh smugglers out he's involved with african
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:35.920]  dictators too i mean this guy's busy b oh nigerian scams uh most of us laugh when we get those emails
[1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:43.280]  from nigeria jeb bush was actually involved in it with some of these uh gangsters in nigeria on a
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:49.920]  on a water uh with a water company he was involved with so the guy the guy is absolutely corrupt
[1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:57.920]  um and uh you know but he's he keeps that bush mystique going uh this is a crime family and
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:04.880]  what jeb bush did is he basically extended the bush crime family's operations from houston and
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:14.160]  dalas uh to to miami and uh and florida became one like texas uh it was and still is i believe
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:22.480]  uh bush uh criminal uh operating ground uh he added florida to the uh to the mix so this is this
[1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:30.320]  is jeb bush's real legacy uh he was obviously a non-official cover cia agent in caracas uh
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:38.400]  gambino who gave him his in-briefing uh later joined the uh bush reagan campaign uh in 1980
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:43.920]  and bush rewarded him with the being the head of the selective service system when bush became
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:51.920]  president in 1989 uh so this here here we have just another example of this bush what i call the
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:58.720]  bush crime family in action and the mere fact that jeb is on that stage uh debating other
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:05.840]  republican candidates for the nomination just shows the hubris of of this bush family when it comes
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.800]  to their role in america scene i mean i forget it was a senator said that the the presidency's on
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:15.440]  a crown to be passed between two families let's shift gears out of your article that details
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:21.200]  this at info wars dot com we'll get more into it the next segment and look at hillary and and her
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:26.640]  her her emails i mean even if the justice department is controlled by them it's bold that the fbi
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:31.440]  rated these or is that to keep them from congress and what's the inside intel because you're up there
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:36.320]  on the hill every week or so on what's going to happen to hillary are they planning to put her in
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:41.120]  her jeb and we know it's those two we know her campaign manager went to belterberg no other
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:45.280]  political manager was there we think jeb might have been he was in austria at the time but we
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:50.640]  couldn't confirm it so maybe jeb and hillary were both there at least her manager but but it's admitted
[1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:56.400]  her manager was there and so where is all that going and what's the poop on trump well i still
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:01.520]  believe that hillary and jeb are the odds on favorite to rest the nominations of both the
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:07.360]  respective parties because the money is is currently with them now that may be changing a
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:11.920]  little bit i know there's some elders in the republican party that are looking at john kasek
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:18.400]  who did very well in a debate is probably the more electable of all of them on the republican side
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:24.640]  but two billion dollars potentially in hillary's war chest two billion dollars potentially in jeb's
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:29.920]  war chest this is going to be a four billion dollar general election i'm not even counting the primary
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:34.880]  here it's obscene amount of money that's going to be spent on getting getting control of the oval
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:42.720]  office as far as donald trump is concerned i mean i i you know everybody i talk to democrats and
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:49.440]  republicans are just sitting back and laughing at the fact he's actually in his own way making
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:56.400]  a mockery of a system that should be made a mockery of he's he said he he owned half of the
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:02.480]  people on the stage during the last debate in clave linney he's absolutely correct i i look at
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:09.280]  the donald trump really he's a he's kind of a billionaire version of archie bunker uh as he's
[1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:16.480]  really i mean what he's saying is catching on across the country uh just like back in 1972
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:21.760]  there were these archie bunker for president bumper stickers and buttons popped up all over the
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:27.440]  country because people related to this fictional character played by carol o'connor on all in
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:33.920]  the family but i think uh once again trump you we know you need money to run uh as an insurgent
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:40.080]  candidate whether it's a as a one of the two major parties or as an independent ross perot showed that
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:47.600]  in 1992 uh and uh i think we're in one of these election cycles where a trump is able to catch
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.480]  on because people are sick and tired of the system uh well sure they're sick of the mealy mouth
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:57.440]  double talk and that's why he's so refreshing but separately from that we know he's big buddies with
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:02.960]  the clintons and the bushes he's talking about a third party run i see him as a third party run
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:09.040]  obviously hurting jeb a lot more the question is in the clinton bush crime family where they call
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:15.760]  each other family where you know barbara calls him him son uh bush calls him brother i mean it's
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.160]  just really sick they've got foundations they money launder out of where they keep half the
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:25.600]  donations for their private jets i mean really a sick group of freaks here republicans love them
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:31.760]  because they're anti-gun pearl abortion uh you know i guess they love it and that's our so-called
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:37.520]  republican leadership uh but there's got to be something going on there do you think he's just
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:43.520]  doing this for himself in attention or do you think he's working for hillary oh i think uh you
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:48.560]  know you gotta look when you look at trump you gotta look at the ego uh trump has a as a huge
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:53.840]  overly inflated ego i think he's doing it for himself look whether he's the nominee or not and
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.920]  i don't think in the end he's going to be the nominee because the you know we know what the
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:04.880]  bush family is capable of even against the powerful and wealthy guy like trump i remember uh
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:11.200]  ross perot dropped out of that 1992 race which really killed him uh he was running around 33
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:16.480]  percent at one time he was actually ahead of clinton and george hw bush in the polls because
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:25.120]  he cited uh the bush uh a campaign was trying to um um heard his daughter's wedding by putting
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:29.680]  lesbians in there uh that that was true the bushes were up to that well let's talk about the dirty
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:33.200]  tricks i did against perot to understand what's happening now and he finally came out and said
[1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:37.120]  they're threatening to kill my family he said i'm done american wants this fan i'm out of here
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:44.160]  and of course we know perot sucked him on the cia big time like antlers on a deer i mean it's
[1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:52.880]  a redonkulous we'll be back with lane madson we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones

[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:20.480]  Bernhardt or prince philip any of them i've investigated them all i look at hundreds of
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:27.440]  news articles every day for 20 plus years and their quotes and and you'll see abc news at the
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:35.600]  the rockefeller institute royalty and others with the rockefellers met secretly and opra
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:41.120]  wimfrey was there to discuss overpopulation in world government it was even in the london
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:48.800]  guardian secret world government meeting i mean this stuff is crazy and then they ship drugs in
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:53.040]  and they have hollywood movies act like there's money and sex and it's cool and they'll use drugs
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:57.600]  kids it's the dare program they don't even tell the cops that are doing it that it doubles and
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:03.520]  triples drug use in kids don't use it here's the crack pipe here's the marijuana of course in the
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:10.800]  school i went to in rock wall the cops involved in the anti drug programs were then out dealing drugs
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:17.440]  most departments aren't like that but it even gets that corrupt you know where the cops own the
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:23.040]  topless bars and run the whores and everything else and then the public amacy international came
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:26.960]  out and said legalized prostitution yesterday and i agree with that it's not that i agree
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:34.560]  with prostitution overall it's that making it illegal is done so the mafia and government can
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:41.280]  control it and keep it hidden to oppress women and others all the major studies show you decriminalized
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:48.160]  drugs you decriminalize the sex trade it doesn't let the system sit there and then control it
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:55.920]  it makes drug use prostitution all of it actually goes down when you legalize it
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:06.880]  portugal made narcotics legal oh is it 15 years ago and they've seen more than a half drop in crime
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:13.120]  yeah people are out robbing to get their drug fix you know i'm ranting we got wayne madson

[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.960]  investigative journalist for info wars.com i've been bringing up a lot of the questions a lot
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:38.800]  of the points here i want to get more into what you see happening with the attacks on a sod saying
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:45.200]  take out a sod uh show that we'll stop ices i mean that's crazy i want to get into what's
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:48.720]  happening with china and the economy but i know you're always working on a bunch of big stories
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:55.200]  so you got the floor for the next 10 minutes or so what's on wayne madson's radar well um
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:01.120]  while everybody was focused alex on this debate and cleveland between the republican uh that you
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:07.760]  know the kitty uh kitty table team that went on at happy hour and the adult team that went on later
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:15.600]  i was in chicago uh investigating uh the presidential election not of 2016 but of 2020
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:22.720]  and uh the word is that rama manuel the current mayor of chicago who just won reelection against uh
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:34.320]  uh uh choy garcia uh who uh uh actually beat uh almost beat him uh in the uh first uh election
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:40.560]  and then he was forced into a runoff he kept rom under 50 forcing rom into a runoff that uh
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:47.520]  rama manuel is building up a political war chest to run for president in in 2020
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:56.560]  and um also it is quite apparent why former illinois governor rod blagojevich received an
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:06.240]  an unbelievable uh 14 year sentence in federal prison for for allegedly trying to sell obama
[1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:12.960]  sentencing the reason for that is is that if blagojevich who actually the appeals court just
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:20.560]  shaved or took five uh accounts off of his uh conviction five charges were dropped yet the
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:30.400]  judge james zagle refuses to uh reduce blagojevich's sentence this 14 year sentence is is crazy
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:38.800]  when you look at this is supposed crime um but this is the idea behind it uh the 14 years would
[1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:45.120]  of course cover obama's eight years in the presidency in addition to rama manuel's eight
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:53.360]  years as mayor chicago and if rama manuel is elected president in 2020 the first four years
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:39:01.840]  of the rama manuel presidency rod blagojevich isn't due to be released until uh the year 2025
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:11.360]  uh and uh that's because if he's released we know he likes to talk part of the reasons he got
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:17.120]  got himself in trouble he he's already i understand in prison he's working at the prison library he's
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:23.680]  connecting all the dots on who did this to him and other politicians especially in illinois
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:29.120]  in chicago and if he's out he's going to start squawking about a manuel now let me tell you
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:34.640]  where manuel's money is coming from this was a bit of a surprise to me i was talking to traders
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:40.960]  who work at the chicago board of trade who spoke to me uh anonymously because let's face it manuel's
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:48.880]  running a thugocracy in chicago uh he makes al capone look like the fairy godmother uh and uh
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:58.160]  where obama's getting his money from arie manuel his super agent hollywood uh brother who is just
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:06.000]  as nasty and foul mouthed as rom uh invested up to 15 million dollars in this ride share company
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  called uber um and the chicago cavities hate it because they spend as much as 425 thousand
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:21.360]  dollars for a cab medallion and uber is basically rendering that worthless and um david ploof who
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:30.480]  was the architect of obama's two presidential wins uh in 08 and 12 uh is the chief strategist for uber
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:37.920]  so we see what's happening uber is uh they hope to make at least uh arie manuel hopes to make at
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:43.600]  least a billion dollars on this it's estimated it might make much more than that but a lot of this
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:51.680]  money is going into the rama manuel coffers for his 2020 presidential campaign and i think that
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:58.480]  should be uh worrisome to all of us because manuel uh has basically screwed over the chicago
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:04.400]  public school teachers he's trying to uh kill off public education in the city of chicago
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:10.800]  he's destroyed the daily machine single-handedly something that no other politician was able to do
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:17.040]  and one can argue about machines but the daily machine uh i i believe was more of a benevolent
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:23.120]  machine uh than the malevolent political machine that manuel's running in chicago which is only
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:28.960]  benefiting the upper one percent those who live on the on the north shore those who are making money
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:35.760]  from the introduction of casinos in in chicago something that blagojevic was opposed to and
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:42.720]  uh you know who are um um manuel's buddies well it's the pritzker family penny pritzker is obama's
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:48.960]  commerce secretary the zeal family zeal used to own uh the chicago tribute which we should remember
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:55.680]  once employed david axelrod is one of its reporters and um and the crown family which is
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:04.320]  another one of these uh wealthy chicago oligarchs um so this is what the is being planned in chicago
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:09.760]  and um you know and unfortunately the rest of the country isn't hearing about this because the good
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:15.920]  old days of the muck raking journalists like mike roico who work for the sun times in a chicago
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:25.920]  tribune and uh and herb cups in it uh and even the non non movie critic um commentary of gene
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:33.200]  siscoe and roger ebert there it's all long gone in chicago uh you know the number one investigator
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:42.320]  for chicago w of bbm cbs two her her name is um is a pam zekman um well she was once married to
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:50.400]  james zagel the trial judge who put blagojevic away for 14 years so herein we see the uh nice little
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:58.880]  uh uh um circle of friends that are basically uh helping manuel seize control the oval office in
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:05.840]  2020 why did they go after blagojevic overall i mean didn't he come out of the same axelrod nest
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:10.560]  and they just basically saw him as a rival and he knew where the bodies were buried well he he
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:19.520]  came out of the machine uh politics of chicago but his wife patty uh her father uh his name uh he
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:26.080]  was a he was a like a 32 year uh alderman in chicago he was a member of the daily machine
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:35.760]  uh originally but uh the the blagojevic uh mel uh dynasty broke with the immanuel axelrod crown
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:42.960]  and uh blagojevic of course was trying to ensure that the person who got obama's uh senate seat
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:49.520]  was so many more to blagojevic is liking uh and not uh you know they at one time they wanted valery
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:55.920]  jarrett to get that seat that's the obama people did uh that that's this is i want to go to some phone
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:01.600]  calls uh shifting gears into geopolitical activities i see a lot of admissions in the
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:06.800]  press that the west is launching yet another color revolution attempt to overthrow russia
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:14.240]  like they've done ukraine uh we see the china situation dropping their yawn uh and threats
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:20.880]  between uh the west and china there uh we see stock markets in trouble uh what's your take on that
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:26.880]  well it's always been the ultimate intention of these color revolution fanatics these neil
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:35.360]  cons uh who who over you know basically overthrew uh two governments in ukraine in 2004 with the
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:41.360]  orange revolution and again uh with the most recent overthrow of the anikovic government
[1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:48.720]  uh uh last year uh you know they they've done it in george the republic of georgia uh they've
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:54.960]  done it uh they try to do it macedonia they succeeded partially there victoria newland this
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:45:00.640]  is her her thing she's the assistant secretary of state for european and european affairs she
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:05.600]  works hand in glove with a lot of these neocon ambassadors in these countries to foment these
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:11.280]  revolutions but the ultimate goal whether you're talking uh you can talk about ukraine and maldova
[1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:17.440]  and kyrgyzstan the ultimate goal is russian china uh that's that's the peanut crowds uh
[1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:22.400]  wet dream when it comes to these uh color revolutions that they they will end on the
[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:27.280]  streets of moscow and beijing if they have their way and they don't care whether they
[1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:31.680]  they cause world war three to happen in the process or not because one thing we know about
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:38.160]  the neocons these are ruthless people who do not worry about the uh the consequences of their
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:45.360]  actions like you know i present uh iraq and syria and the rise of isle as a um as an example
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:52.800]  sure what do you make a jeb bush because that's a segue into this blaming obama and the clintons
[1:45:52.800 --> 1:45:57.360]  for iraq i mean of course obama and the clintons are all part of it they're guilty like he is but
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:03.760]  that's just asinine well he he wants you to conveniently have amnesia when it comes to
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:11.360]  recent history uh i mean there's a reason he he uses jeb as his um campaign slogan he doesn't put
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:19.120]  bush on those buttons and those stickers because he he don't want people to remember uh bush so it's
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:24.640]  it's you know basically he he's an acronym followed by an exclamation sure he's inverting
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:30.800]  reality again just like he says take out a sod to defeat isis when a sod's battling isis let's
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:36.960]  play a clip of jeb bush we and our partners should declare a no fly zone in syria and then work to
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:42.880]  expand that zone to prevent more crimes by the regime enforce that no fly zone and will stop the
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:50.400]  regime's bombing raids that kill helpless citizens it could also help stop iranian flights from
[1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:56.400]  resupplying the regime and hezbollah and other bad actors a no fly zone is a critical strategic
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:02.480]  step to cut off a sod counter iranian influence keep the pressure on for a settlement and prevent
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:08.640]  more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it when we talk about no fly zones in
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:16.800]  syria precision airstrikes in iraq or any projection of military power to meet or deter threats all of
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:23.600]  this assumes that such power is there when we need it yet here as well the shortsightedness
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:29.440]  of the present administration will leave a cost we're in the seventh year of a significant dismantling
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:35.040]  of our own military in almost inverse proportion to the threats that are multiplying uh i mean
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:42.000]  obama's following a pure neocon strategy uh it's so clear and they're they're breaking iraq and
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:48.080]  three pieces it's a bipartisan plan and then he sits up here and acts like a sod started it all
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:53.680]  when the ally of the bush is saudi arabia quarterback this whole fiasco i mean it's just
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:48:00.480]  incredible he's so creepy i mean he's so creepy and disingenuous and obviously a dirtbag uh
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:05.440]  wane madson well jeb's pretty good at reading talking points from the american enterprise
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:12.080]  institute the washington institute for neary's policy both uh a notorious neocon think tanks
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:17.760]  uh but uh look he talks about the regime the regime we should be putting pressure on is
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:23.920]  the regime in turkey which is now pummeling kurdish positions in turkey and iraq the Kurds
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:30.880]  are fighting against isil asan is fighting against isil iranian forces are fighting against isil
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:38.080]  i'll give president obama this at least his his opening uh to iran with the nuclear deal
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:46.800]  he recognizes the fact that we're too uh suppress and defeat isil we need iran's cooperation
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:53.440]  we have it now but he wants to i think pretty much uh formalize it and of course he's got people in
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:59.760]  the senate in his own party for example charles schumer who's who's acting as brutus with julia
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:06.640]  caesar in the forum sticking a knife in president obama's back sure my view is it's all theater
[1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:11.760]  and they're gonna double cross iran and iran's out of control as well i mean the whole situation
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:17.600]  is just insane but uh now obama's saying he's gonna bomb uh the the syrians when they attack
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:21.520]  the good rebels we know there's really no good rebels wane we're gonna come back with two short

[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:33.040]  ask you this about do you say that if it gets to a bush clinton um election for one i think there's
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:38.320]  a better chance we're going to have a revolution in this country before we see an election we
[1:55:38.320 --> 1:55:44.160]  have an economic collapse come in i could see riots martial law a breakup that's why they're
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:48.320]  going to cause a race war to claim the collapse was that but but but i agree with you they got some
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:54.240]  nasty stuff stirred up wane oh i i you know if people are looking at yet another bush versus
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:56:02.080]  clinton election in 2016 i mean we're you know it's like a pressure cooker uh when does when does it
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:09.200]  go off uh when does it meet reach that point where people have had enough they're so arrogant this
[1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:15.920]  is so obviously fixed people quit watching heavyweight boxing because don king runs it right i mean
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:23.440]  yeah i the whole the whole thing is a charade uh the one thing about fox is um so-called debate
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:29.520]  that was more like a reality television show that wasn't a debate if we had real debates let
[1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:35.760]  him bring back the league of women voters that used to uh basically moderate those debates not
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:42.560]  somebody like megan kelly who's now in a some sort of big fight uh with uh donald trump it's like
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:47.920]  she's all parting around i'm so sick of it it's like celebrity apprentice you know he said she
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:55.280]  said this he said that uh that that business has no place in in in our political system but uh
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:02.800]  but you know uh fox uh saw a record audience for that and they'll continue to uh basically tarnish
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:07.200]  our political system with fully debate so-called debates well they're turning they're dumbing it
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:11.200]  down into bread and circuses by design this has been done before uh steven in florida you got a
[1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:17.440]  question or comment go ahead yeah good afternoon okay two quick questions uh wane first of all
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:23.680]  you have done a bombshell article for info wars several years ago showing the deep ties obama
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:31.040]  has with the cih or his parents and grandparents and alex had put out a documentary after obama
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:39.200]  got in showing that there was uh ties between uh bush and carrie uh through huhefner up there in
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:46.800]  chicago and being blood brothers so first of all is there ties of red stuff where obama is actually
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:52.000]  related to the bushes yeah we know obama is closely related to dick cheney are there any
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:59.600]  relations between obama and the bushes not that i'm aware of look uh both jim and obama as i've
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:07.440]  reported at worked as assets at the very least for the cia uh but just because somebody works for
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:14.640]  the cia or any of the other intelligence agencies doesn't mean uh that they're totally uh useless
[1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:21.600]  i think obama uh in his opening to iran is like nixon going to china nixon that ties with cia all
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:26.240]  stuff that's right and if you're a new listener we just pulled up the guardian bush and obama
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:31.120]  cousins we're not making this stuff up i mean when we say prince charles is the arrow counteractula
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:35.040]  we're not making it up i mean the truth is stranger than fiction the more i learn the
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:39.360]  more i realize that is the greatest cliche it's totally true third hour coming up five more minutes

[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:47.600]  is uh is an anathema to uh the bushes and the clintons um the the more people know about those
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:53.680]  two candidates and the more they know about the alternatives i think the better off we are uh look
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:59.680]  there's a reason why uh bernie sanders is catching fire over on the democratic side and has now
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:06.960]  uh gotten hillary he's beating hillary in the polls in new hampshire and uh and and jeb uh everyone
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:14.000]  thought his performance in cleveland was very lackluster so uh even with all their money it
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:18.400]  doesn't mean it's a foregone conclusion they're going to be the candidates although that's where
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:24.240]  the wise pundits uh that's what they're saying but uh we know hillary thought she was being
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:29.680]  coronated no eight and a guy named obama came along and uh that was the end of her dream well she's
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:32.880]  reportedly got a lot of health problems so you know the good lord may have something to do with
[2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:37.120]  stopping her as well these people are not god even though they think they are jessie in california
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:45.920]  has got a question for you wane go ahead jessie hey alex um whatever happened wasn't there another
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:51.120]  bush brother neil bush and he was involved in the saving his loan scandal back in the eighties
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:58.320]  yeah there's a whole crew of them yeah neil neil neil was uh that it was a silverado s and l
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:05.520]  collapse uh you know when you look at where these bushes were placed you had w placed in texas to go
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:11.760]  on to the governorship jeb and florida who became governor of course they both wanted you know one
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:18.160]  became president the other one wants to uh the two failures of course were neil and colorado uh
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:23.680]  plans to get him involved in uh politics and become potentially governor colorado went down
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:31.040]  a drain with the silverado s and l collapse and marvin bush in virginia uh the one we don't hear
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:37.200]  anything about which i i investigated him years ago you know his maid was run over by her own
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:44.480]  s u v uh in parked in front of his home uh back when w was president and i looked at that and uh
[2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:50.640]  and and marvin bush on the police report was actually listed as witness slash suspect in
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:56.640]  that death and uh of course the washington post didn't give it much attention uh but i i looked
[2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:02.960]  into it she was actually uh when she was run over by her own car she told marvin that she was getting
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:08.160]  a videotape out of her car and he said oh really i let me see it and that's when the car ran over
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:14.400]  her so that to me that's an unex still an unexplained death but you know there's a lot of dead bodies
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:20.240]  associated with the bush clan well we know one thing they're not conservatives and i don't know
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:25.280]  how any republican out there could ever vote for him and hillary's a fascist dirtbag i mean i'm just
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:30.000]  so sick of these people but we may just see the crown now they've got the bush grandson elected

[2:04:57.440 --> 2:05:02.560]  a major correction coming turns out it wasn't just yoga moves on hillary's server after all
[2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:07.280]  after months of denials and delaying actions hillary clinton has decided to turn over her
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:12.320]  private email server to the department of justice well she really doesn't have much choice these
[2:05:12.320 --> 2:05:17.520]  weren't just ordinary secrets found in clinton's private server but some of the most classified
[2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:23.760]  material the u.s government has in other words top secret but what difference at this point does it
[2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:28.880]  make right hillary especially after it's been revealed that chinese email hackers have been
[2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:35.840]  spying on top u.s figures since 2010 and clinton's server was completely unencrypted for several
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:41.360]  months people found to have willfully mishandled such highly classified information faced severe
[2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:46.720]  punishment at minimum they have their clearances suspended pending the outcome of the investigation

[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:10.320]  military build up against russia major military build up against china china lowering its currency
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:18.640]  china manipulating its stock market no one out there predicted this in writing on record like
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:24.320]  harry dent at harry dent dot com best-selling author author the demographic cliff made a lot
[2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:28.480]  of famous predictions that have been come through the last 20 plus years has been coming on our show
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:33.600]  five six i guess seven years now actually but he's just been hammering that he believes china
[2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:39.040]  will be the big one to bring down the world economy for about five years at least and you
[2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:42.480]  watch main street media they just say it's incredibly wonderful everything's going great
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:46.720]  your conspiracy theorist if you think they're at stock market that's double the last two years
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:52.000]  is overvalued or if you think their economy's rigged you're you're you're you're you're crazy
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:56.720]  if you think the sky's blue you're insane if you think you know you have turkey on
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:01.760]  Thanksgiving it's a conspiracy theory i mean this is a war against reality happening
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:06.720]  he of course has an MBA from harvard business school and bane company a strategy consultant
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:11.600]  for more than 100 companies he's also been the ceo of several and entrepreneurial growth companies
[2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:16.080]  and very very successful in that right i'm not going to go over all of his bio folks know who
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:23.120]  he is here but we're hitting the demographic cliff and historically with that they'll try to start
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:28.880]  wars a lot of other insanity and you notice he used to be on about twice a year then he's on
[2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:33.680]  three or four times a year last year now he's on every month we appreciate him coming on
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:38.960]  even came on a few days after his dad died a few months ago we appreciate that and now
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:44.720]  i'm really listening carefully because i want to hear how he thinks we might go over the cliff
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:52.560]  as we get closer to it are we going to see the big correction uh 2008 big bigger what will it
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:56.960]  cause they only increase the derivatives they only increase what got us in the situation
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:11:02.720]  will there be new banker bailouts new tax increases to give it to offshore corporations that
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:10.320]  cheat on their taxes mr dent is here to join us he's got charts on uh civil unrest increasing
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:14.880]  everything we're going to go over these in the next hour in the last 15 minutes or so we'll take
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:25.600]  a few questions at 800-259-9231 for mr dent okay mr crystal ball here we are uh now we've gotten
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:32.240]  closer to it i'm sure you've got more of an electron microscope view of this what in hades is going on
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:39.360]  well you know alex the biggest thing since we last talked china's bubble and stocks finally
[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:45.200]  burst it means nothing when a stock bubble burst 10 percent or 20 percent that can just be a no
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:51.600]  ordinary correction 35 percent in a little over three weeks and how much would have been if the
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:57.600]  government had not come in with a half a trillion dollar fund to buy their own stocks and this came
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:03.200]  after the government in china had been buying empty real estate to prop up that market that's
[2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:09.280]  been falling and after they created the greatest bubble in history by moving a half a billion
[2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:16.080]  people um low skill people from rural areas to urban areas in the shortest period of time in history
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:22.240]  china is the greatest bubble in history it is finally coming unravel that's why i am confident
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:30.000]  that we are when within i'd say weeks of of the global bubble bursting again china was the first
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:37.120]  thing actually before that in march germany the leading market in europe looked like a peak to me
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:44.560]  and then and then the china crash in late may um uh in in in july and now i think the us markets are
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:50.480]  going to start heading down by early september probably peaking in the next week or two so
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:57.680]  i think this is happening and the other big factor is that i don't get why the oil markets
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:03.120]  don't totally get this in the stock markets oil keeps dropping you predicted three years ago
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:08.240]  that when we hit the cliff oil would go to 40 now it looks like it's worse than you say bloomberg's
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:14.960]  talking about 30 dollar crude yeah i'm actually talking i've been talking for years about 10 to 20
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:21.360]  down the road i think we're going to see 32 dollars in the next two months and and what that says is
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:25.200]  and and again the markets still don't fully get this because everybody's thinking oil's
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.200]  going to come back to 78 the fracking industry a trillion dollar industry that's created hundreds
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:37.200]  of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly 600 billion dollars in junk bonds and highly
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:44.080]  leveraged debt this industry is going to be debt it's a bubble industry it's a high cost because
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:48.240]  i know because a lot of folks in texas are involved the debts are all coming due by next year
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:54.160]  it's all bankrupt could that be the detonator in the us sector yeah exactly i think china is the
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:58.960]  detonator for the global markets in the world because it's the biggest bubble and it's kind of
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:04.880]  like japan and the early 90s tracking but for the united states i think the first debt bubble to crack
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:10.800]  will be these crackers and when they start to fall things jump on rates will go up for other
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:16.800]  high-risk borrowers and then you get a whole thing like the subprime crisis in 2008 there was only four
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:23.760]  states that had a big subprime problem and underwater households and it triggered a global
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:30.000]  downturn that's what happened too much in debt all it takes is a trigger it's not that the subprime
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:35.680]  crisis was the biggest trend it's that the whole world was too much in debt demographics were starting
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:41.200]  to decline as we predicted for years and and this whole thing has only been kept together
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:46.880]  since 2008 when it started to crash last time by endless money printing sure i mean you've
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:51.120]  documented the problem you've been a hundred percent that on it's frightening what happens
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:55.760]  next now that you're closer you said till we got real close you couldn't you know break down with
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:01.200]  the trends exactly how it might unravel are you close enough now to tell us you say within weeks
[2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:07.520]  i mean how bad how does it cascade is it a big bust or is it an unraveling what what do you see
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:13.280]  happening well you know first of all our overall picture has been that you know we've seen higher
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:22.320]  highs in every boom and bubble uh in again in 2000 and then again in 2007 and then 2015 now every
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:27.840]  crash has taken us to lower lows we're seeing that we're going to go from a dow recently of
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:35.520]  18 300 we might get a little higher than that i doubt it but down to 5500 to 6000 that's a bigger
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:42.960]  crash than we had last time the largest crash since the great depression in 29 to 32 so but
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:48.640]  that's going to take a couple years what i've been warning investors um especially in the
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:55.600]  last several months when when you have a bubble like this you can't wait to prove that it's over
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:02.160]  and then get out because the first downturn is typically 30 to 40 percent that just happened
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:09.040]  in china 35 percent down and in a little over three weeks in the 2000 tech crash the first
[2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:16.080]  downturn in two and a half months 40 percent in the 1929 bubble burst the united states 40 percent
[2:16:16.080 --> 2:16:22.240]  down in the first downturn so you have to get out ahead of this i think we just bounce off of this
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:29.360]  chinese devaluation move another desperate move to save a failing economy and i think we'll bounce
[2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:34.880]  for a week or two and then the chinese market will turn back down start collapsing oil prices will
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:41.040]  bounce from 42 here which is something i predicted just weeks ago so we are in the dead cat bounce
[2:16:41.040 --> 2:16:46.880]  right now yeah yeah we'll get a little dead cat bounce and stocks uh actually stocks may hit a
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:52.960]  new high slightly oil will bounce from 42 to i don't know 48 or 50 and then next thing you know it'll
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:17:00.320]  be a 32 buck when it hits 32 dollars for the second time since 2008 in that massive crash stock
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:05.200]  market is going to finally realize in the junk bond market that finances these risky companies that
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:12.400]  the crackers are dead they're over they run out their wells at low cost once they develop them
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:18.320]  and they don't ever build any new wells again in a trillion dollar industry dies and starts at the
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:26.160]  fall so that again is the biggest trigger in the united states i think wow and then we've got all
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:30.960]  these other economic things happening you talked about europe you talked about the e you talked about
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:37.280]  grease defaulting looking at europe how does that play into all this then we've got obama care hitting
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:43.040]  that's like a wet blanket on the economy we've got obama taxes just wrecking everything i mean it
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:49.840]  looks like washington is trying to put the country into a cardiac arrest well you know again what
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:54.000]  governments are really doing they created this bubble in the first place they overstimulated
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:59.760]  they pushed interest rates artificially low and then when the whole thing started unraveling in 2008
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:05.120]  they started printing money out of nowhere you know like 10 10 trillion dollars around the world
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:10.960]  four trillion just in the united states just to keep the economy from collapsing and the
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:15.280]  banking system from collapsing but they created the bubble in the first place so they're just
[2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:22.320]  covering up what they're doing and and and you can see china's situation keeps getting worse
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:28.160]  you know they do x then they do y then they do z but then they have to do another thing
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:35.040]  it's because they're failing you cannot keep a bubble going forever sure and and and china is
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:40.560]  is the largest in history but europe has its bubble and they keep trying to stimulate the us
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:49.040]  has our bubble we keep trying to stimulate this thing's going to come apart i think alex when i
[2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:56.480]  look at history when you do have major crashes it is september and early to mid october when the first
[2:18:57.360 --> 2:19:03.200]  crashes usually hit the hardest and strongest so i'm telling people uh this market may have
[2:19:03.200 --> 2:19:09.760]  a week or two left i would not be stopped after august 25th okay when we come back i want to get
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:13.920]  your view on and i know you you've predicted with incredible accuracy you don't like to get
[2:19:13.920 --> 2:19:17.760]  down into a little micro stuff because it's impossible but in your gut what you expect this
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:23.840]  fall to be like what you expect christmas to be like uh you know elites separately i know are
[2:19:23.840 --> 2:19:30.160]  moving to like countryside redoubts uh they're acting scared and i've seen this building for years
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:33.760]  they all know like you said they've been covering it up i mean they know what's going on they just
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:39.120]  won't tell people uh and then what's going to happen when the bottom falls out geopolitically but

[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:38.400]  thinks is going to happen next how this he says within two weeks it can start what does the start
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:43.840]  of that look like but but getting into your 100 trillion in financial assets could disappear let's
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:51.040]  talk about that chart yeah you know people don't i always talk about deflation coming out of endless
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:56.240]  money printing and people go what they're printing money that should cause inflation they're only
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:03.040]  printing money rapidly desperately to fight deflation deflation happens in history every
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:10.160]  single time that you have a credit bubble that creates way too much debt uh debt grew 2.6 times
[2:26:10.160 --> 2:26:18.320]  the u.s economy from 1983 to 2008 and then started to collapse that debt causes financial asset
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:23.520]  bubbles and stocks and real estate and commodities and all these sort of things and when those debt
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:30.800]  bubbles deleverage when those financial assets and again what this chart shows is that it globally
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:38.960]  the best estimate today 231 trillion dollars in financial asset these are stocks bonds and loans
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:45.360]  it doesn't even count real estate which is huge and i'm saying that in the great depression and times
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:51.120]  like this are deleveraging those financial assets loans fail bonds go down in value but especially
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:58.240]  and especially stocks that money gets wiped out it disappears and it took uh 24 years for stocks
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:04.480]  to get back to their highs in 1929 in real estate 10 years to get back to their highs so this money
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:09.680]  disappears and when there's less money in the economy you get deflation there's less money
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:16.560]  changing the same chasing the same asset it's a reset and it's an important reset it's good it's
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:21.680]  good that if homes cost less it's good that if mortgage rates are less it's good that if public
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:28.480]  education and college education costs less because we get a reset and all these sure but they don't
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:34.640]  let us have real resets they're going to come in with bailout packages that only help the insiders
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:39.200]  so so that's a good question what do you expect them to respond to this with looking at what
[2:27:39.200 --> 2:27:45.600]  china's done adding a change saw to their juggling act now well yeah china's done it china keeps
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:51.520]  responding with more stimulus measures more fight the bubble bursting the us has been doing this and
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:56.640]  europe since 2008 everything governments have done around the world have been to fight this
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:03.520]  bubble from bursting nobody's written down hardly any loans what you have to do when a bank or banks
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:10.640]  or financial institutions lend too much money to bad creditors that they should have to write those
[2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:15.840]  loans down and take losses and their shareholders should have to take those losses nobody's allowing
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:22.320]  that to happen instead the everyday person is paying for this with declining wages and the rich
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:28.240]  are making more money than ever because sure money is free they've had to make money free to stop this
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:33.440]  crisis zero short-term interest rates zero and they get first access to it and then loan it out
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:39.520]  yeah and well well actually what happens is these financial institutions the way they're
[2:28:39.520 --> 2:28:45.600]  surviving they're not lending money to small businesses in every day they are speculating
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:50.960]  in markets that are rigged to go up by the government look at the stock market our second
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:59.360]  chart shows that the s&p 500 since 2011 has gone straight up with only a 10 range of volatility
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:03.520]  because the government just says we're going to keep pumping money in the markets we're going to
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:08.720]  keep interest rates at zero and now banks charge you to keep money with them because they got so
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:14.880]  much free money it's it's crazy but the free money causes these financial assets like stocks
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:20.080]  to go up most a half of the gains have been because companies are buying back their own stocks with
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:25.200]  free money they're buying back their own stocks and making their earnings go up for share even
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:30.240]  though they're not growing it's crazy well let's talk about then what that will do when they rush
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:35.040]  in and try to prop up the market like the chinese did what you expect how long they can prop it up
[2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:39.840]  or will it fail like china just failed i mean china has failed and now they're dropping their their
[2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:44.720]  currency which hurts the rest of the global economy i mean it is amazing stay with us mr

[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:44.080]  like to pitch your stuff but let me tell you out of all the great guests we have on and they've
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:48.320]  got really good track records of being accurate they say a lot of the same stuff you say but you
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:54.400]  say it with research precision and frightening accuracy put a plug in for your book at harry
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:39:01.040]  dent dot com the demographic cliff yeah again this book came out a few years ago we're offering it
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:06.160]  for free uh all you pay is shipping and handling and this is the real shipping and handling not on
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:14.080]  the 1995 commercials where you know you pay more than it's cost just 495 uh again if you like what
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:21.680]  you're hearing here we have a full analysis of the global economy of debt around the world of
[2:39:21.680 --> 2:39:26.720]  demographics around the world and demographics are so important and economists are so clueless
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:33.600]  about it and and we even show why real estate will never be the same people just don't get that
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:39.040]  real estate went up in our lifetime because the first middle class generation came out of world
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:43.680]  war two and bought homes massively for the first time sure and age interrupt you but you predicted
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:47.920]  that would be the final trigger would be a chinese housing crash here it is in the financial
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:54.480]  times of london two days ago sorry go ahead yeah yeah but i mean even when we do see this global
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:40:00.080]  crash in real estate it's not going to come roaring back maybe in india but not in the united states
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:05.280]  or china or many places like it did in the past so you know we help people see what you need to do
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:11.920]  now to protect your money from a big crash but where do you invest when we do see this crash and
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:18.800]  and there's a lot of areas but but housing is one of them that's not going to be the place to make
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:25.360]  big gains and and surprisingly gold after doing so poorly for years and and we'll do much more
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:30.800]  poorly ahead gold and commodities could be a great investment but emerging countries are going to be
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:38.000]  the future demographic around the world so we give people a whole picture in this book and and
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:44.800]  you can get it for free well people should go get the book i've read the book uh a while back
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:49.520]  and it's just you can't argue with it and now we're hitting that wall let me ask you this question
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:54.240]  and i asked it earlier but i want to talk about a few months to go to some phone calls here
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:41:00.880]  specifically zeroing in on what you think is going to start happening in two weeks
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:06.000]  and then what some of the other triggers could be and how this could look because
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:12.160]  uh major university studies estimate seven million people died during the ten year great depression
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:18.560]  from association of malnutrition and diseases from the collapse and we had 90 of people being
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:23.680]  rural most of them self-sufficient and we had seven million people starve to death or die
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:29.440]  as complications from malnutrition now if things go belly up and we got a lot of hard work in
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:36.640]  americans but we got a lot of spoiled brats too and this whole entitlement society and hollywood
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:42.400]  pushing you know gangster culture and all the rest of it i mean i look around me and it scares the
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:46.320]  daylights out of me to think about what a hardcore depression will look like in this country
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:53.600]  yeah i mean there's more political polarization that i've ever seen in u.s history uh there's more
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:01.680]  extreme inequality than we've seen since uh the late 1920s this cannot end well um a lot of people
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:07.520]  are going to blame each other when this happens and not nobody's going to be totally true about
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:11.760]  that but they're going to blame each other and people are not going to be happy and i tell you
[2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:16.880]  if you think it's going to be bad here don't even imagine being in china when the biggest
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:22.400]  urban migration in history falls apart and and these people can't even go back to their rice
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:28.240]  patties because they've been paved over with empty condominiums it just so i i think people like
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:34.800]  really need to hunker down and say look i mean i don't even know how bad this can get on the civil
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:40.560]  level i just see that it's not just going to be a financial collapse there are going to be civil
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:46.480]  problems and you need to live in a safe place you need to protect yourself in just very basic
[2:42:46.480 --> 2:42:53.920]  ways not just your investments um and just say how can i be as safe as possible if the world
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:58.240]  kind of melts down and it doesn't melt down forever i'm not a doom and gloomer i've been
[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:05.680]  bullish most my life but i am a doom and gloomer now because all the fundamental trends point down
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:11.200]  and and it worries me the most alex the governments have fought this so hard governments have never
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:18.640]  fought a downturn and a reset in financial assets and debt so hard you have to let a lot of this
[2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:24.400]  debt go it's like a financial detox you know just like people would do on diet or something if they
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:29.680]  want to get healthier if they had cancer or something we need this and they just won't let it happen so
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:35.440]  when it does happen it's going to be worse than it would have been so i say protect yourself and say
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:41.120]  where do i live how liquid are my financial assets how flexible am i that's the way to
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:46.480]  survive this and then when things fall apart it's going to be like joseph kennedy in the early 30s
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:52.320]  where you're buying stuff for 10 20 cents on the dollar that's right uh boy i'll tell you what are
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:57.120]  all the pundits and people that sold all these ideas what are they going to do just hope the public
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:03.040]  has the attention span of a goldfish well again you know i i listened to all the great experts
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:09.760]  and the hedge fund managers and i hate to say it one but nice decent guy great investor he
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:15.280]  doesn't have a clue of what's going on in the economy he's been a cheerleader or the government
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:20.800]  all these other financial experts and wall street they're all want to keep the bubble going because
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:27.200]  they all benefit when this thing burst they're going to get hit the worst the most the richest
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:32.080]  people in the world are going to get hit the worst except for the smartest one to get out of the way
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:36.800]  because they own the most financial assets this these financial institutions who are
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:43.600]  levered up unbelievably and now are speculators instead of lenders or investment bankers which
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:50.480]  is even worse they're going to get hit horribly so again i just told people there's nothing you
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:56.560]  can do about this there's nothing i can do about this all we can do is get out of the way absolutely
[2:44:56.560 --> 2:45:00.960]  and i meant to say earlier like with the supplements and stuff our greatest asset is our health and our
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:06.240]  security and our safety and it just comes down to that folks you got to take care of what you can
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:11.760]  take care of and the rest is we try to stop all this and whether it's this year or whenever i
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:16.720]  don't see how long they can hold this off and the elites i know are scurrying to the hills uh i
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:20.960]  want to go to some phone calls with mr dent here and you're listening to the alex jones show on
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:26.480]  stations across the country please support these local affiliates folks uh let's go ahead and talk
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:32.800]  to austin in florida i thought austin was in texas but another lame joke austin go ahead
[2:45:32.800 --> 2:45:40.960]  can you guys hear me yes sir go ahead okay my question is when the financial collapse does
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:47.040]  happen let's say and i don't just wonder let's just say how is the fact the u.s. geopolitically
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:53.440]  what's the cause of war russia or war war three and how is and will america people buy into it
[2:45:53.440 --> 2:45:57.440]  here's a question what do you expect to do to the dollar because of other countries are collapsing
[2:45:57.440 --> 2:46:01.680]  worse with the dollar go up i mean i don't think anybody really knows for sure but what's your gut
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:08.560]  tell you mr dent well i know i do know for sure on this one in the last crisis when things really
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:16.400]  went down and layman brothers went down and we had a financial uh crisis the u.s. dollar went up
[2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:24.480]  27 in a matter of months oil collapsed gold collapsed silver went running the money um real
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:31.280]  estate went down stocks around the world went down the dollar is v state haven't not because
[2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:37.040]  we're doing the right things but we're the best house in a bad neighborhood europe is stimulating
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:43.200]  much more than we are now japanese simulator three times as much as us they are in much worse shape
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:50.640]  when this thing boils down and when the global economy goes down a lot of these financial assets
[2:46:50.640 --> 2:46:56.400]  are priced in u.s. dollars and when these u.s. dollars get destroyed guess what the u.s. dollar
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:02.640]  goes up in value because there's fewer of them and it's going to buy more we have 23 aircraft
[2:47:02.640 --> 2:47:09.760]  carriers the next largest country has one or two france has the ss croissant as you know
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:14.560]  i mean this is there's nobody else to run to what happens to interest rates
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:23.520]  what do you see interest rates doing the next six months okay uh they may go up um at first for
[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:28.800]  treasury bonds when people worry about another downturn and higher deficit but ultimately
[2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:35.520]  the treasury bonds will go down even further with deflation and prices but junk bonds higher risk
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:43.120]  bonds will go up um astronomically and and and and junk bonds are like stocks we told people two
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:50.240]  years ago to sell the junk bond indexes and junk bonds because a higher risk economy will create
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:54.800]  greater default but for treasury bonds in the strongest countries like germany of the united
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:48:02.560]  state they will tend to uh hold their value and increase over time in the great depression the
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:10.240]  only sector of investment other than cash that had higher value were the treasury bonds and the
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:15.520]  highest quality triple a corporate bonds stocks sure well i think the best thing to do is just
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:20.080]  be in cash so when everything bottoms out like you said you can do a job kennedy i want to go to
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:23.840]  calls here but a lot of them are asking the same thing and luke and add others we're going to go to
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:29.040]  them uh and we'll get your answer but it's here's the headline in the telegraph european crisis
[2:48:29.040 --> 2:48:34.160]  everyone from putin ordinary savers of stockpiling gold if commodities are going to go down we've
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:37.600]  seen gold go up a little bit the last few days why would they be stockpiling i think it's because it
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:42.400]  is a good emergency backup if governments start confiscating cash but they could do that to gold
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:45.760]  too we'll get dense take on that luke in arizona you're on the air go ahead
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:54.880]  hello yes go ahead hi uh i just i had a statement and i wanted to ask a question
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:49:01.040]  you know we're not screening your call you're on air go ahead thank you uh first there are right now
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:07.120]  we're in checking accounts available to americans i have one uh i use silver all the time it's a
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:12.640]  debit card that works on the visa network uh and especially listening to the uh the guest today i'm
[2:49:12.640 --> 2:49:18.400]  going to be out of dollars you know coming to 25th uh i don't want to be anywhere near the system
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:25.280]  i guess my question for mr dent was do you think that uh china's uh you know play i guess you could
[2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:30.480]  say the managed crash of their system do you think they're doing this basically to cause to cause a
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:35.680]  ripple so that when everything kind of crashes and falls out and everybody has to kind of look at
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:40.400]  you know what hard assets do does their government have you know sovereign debt wise that they can
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:47.280]  back up with that their poultry 1600 uh ounces of gold is actually going to look pretty good
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:51.680]  when everybody else is kind of demanding their gold back from depositories uh especially from
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:55.760]  america and we you know we're not even giving Germany their gold back yet okay look i hear you
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:00.480]  think gold's going to go up you're you're promoting a scarcity of gold which i've said i think it'll
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:04.880]  go up as things get worse other commodities will go down just in my gut we see that happening dent
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:11.200]  disagrees with that and i'm not saying i'm right uh i i hold some gold this is a total emergency
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:16.960]  backup as a form of cash what do you say to what luke just said thank you luke well you know uh in
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:24.320]  the last crisis gold went up in the first several months stocks peak in october 2007 gold peak in i
[2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:29.920]  think like uh june or something and then went down when the crisis hit so i think the same thing
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:35.040]  could happen this time in the early stages gold could go up gold is way over gold right now if
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:39.600]  anything i mean i'd rather own gold right now short term than stocks but i think stocks are
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:47.280]  about to crash gold could go up but when we see deflation um gold is going to go down again like
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:54.480]  it did last time so so i am not a fan of gold longer term short term i am somewhat but super
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:51:01.760]  long term you think it's the ultimate winner right oh well well yeah 2040 i think gold could hit $5,000
[2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:06.160]  an ounce with the next commodity bubble that's going to be driven by the growth of emerging
[2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:11.040]  countries and guess who consumes the most gold in the world is consumers andians and chinese
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:18.320]  off the charts um but we're in a commodity downturn and i was the first to forecast this
[2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:23.680]  several years ago commodities are going to be down for years and gold goes up and down with the
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:31.120]  commodity index since it stopped becoming a monetary uh uh metal in the early 70s with nixon
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:35.840]  and stuff so people got to get over this gold the all sure what of the what are the globalists out
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:41.840]  of this world crisis bringing the sdr and trying to back it with a currency basket and a commodities
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:47.200]  basket made up of silver and gold i mean you know they're kicking that around but you can't do it
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:51.920]  that all of the gold in the world would fit in an olympic size swimming pool you cannot back
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:59.040]  today's modern information intensive service economy with gold like you could in the roman empire
[2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:06.160]  or even the 1800s when we were still mostly farmers gold is a standard it was a good standard
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:11.920]  we need a standard gold cannot and will not and i will predict this until i die sure will not be
[2:52:11.920 --> 2:52:19.040]  the standard what's the standard going to be then uh energy no you're going to have to have standards
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:24.000]  where governments make agreements among each other that you can't push down your currency
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  artificially you're talking about go back to a new britain woods and you cannot let debt grow
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:36.240]  more than x percent of the economy it's just a it's just a simple it'd be a quantitative standard
[2:52:36.240 --> 2:52:41.760]  but you can't back today's economy with a commodity like gold you're talking about a monetary treaty
[2:52:43.600 --> 2:52:48.640]  i mean why would we want to back it with gold if there was a strike in south africa and gold
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.600]  would be cut back and the whole world would collapse it's crazy no and i get what you're
[2:52:53.600 --> 2:52:58.400]  saying i was asking the question you know what's being bandied about by some of the top policy
[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:06.640]  makers as a new currency a new bubble okay okay ultimately a basket of currencies could be better
[2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:14.960]  but if i'm right and then what happened in 2008 occurs again and the us dollar rises and almost
[2:53:14.960 --> 2:53:21.600]  every other major currency falls who's going to want a basket of falling currency the us dollar
[2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:27.760]  i think for the next two to three years is safe as the reserve currency after that we do need a
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:33.600]  better monetary system i've told people when i retire and have a little extra time i'm going
[2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:38.960]  to figure a way to have a better global monetary system because even these floating exchange rates
[2:53:38.960 --> 2:53:45.280]  where where a company in the united states would be competitive one day and then not because the dollar
[2:53:45.280 --> 2:53:48.960]  you know rose and value that's part of it for speculators we're building the whole planet
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:56.320]  for speculators deon in illinois you're on the air with mr den yeah harry uh i don't know which
[2:53:56.320 --> 2:54:01.360]  which jobs uh are going to be wiped out by the collapse and which jobs you think would be on
[2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:07.360]  demand and what's going to happen to the people there are the labor market thank you you tell
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:15.040]  me about stocks or what jobs are secure and what jobs aren't well you know um the jobs that
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:20.400]  them do the best are the ones that are being demanded by the aging baby boomers jobs and
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:27.680]  health care jobs and travel cruise ships things like that even even um eating out is probably
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:33.280]  picking out auto sales are going to peak this year and and drop off like housing did many years
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:39.280]  before demographics will tell you what's going to do well and the economy will hurt almost all
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:46.640]  industries to some degree but i tell you health care uh things uh that serve older people uh
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:52.240]  maintenance services for houses i tell you in japan you know it's doing well convenience stores
[2:54:52.240 --> 2:54:58.000]  and pharmacies that's what's right well you can see that they're building a wallgreens or cvs on
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:04.160]  every corner it's going to be robots servicing robots robotics exactly how do you replace
[2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:10.240]  young people and workers you can afford when old people need more service it's just going to be
[2:55:10.240 --> 2:55:14.960]  unbelievable well one thing's for sure it's not going to be boring into the future uh let's go to
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:20.080]  adam adam you're on the year from ohio go ahead oh man i can't even believe i made it through
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:25.120]  you're on the year welcome go ahead um pretty much my answer my question was answered i just
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:30.400]  listened to both of you gentlemen talks um and first of all i like to want to appreciate or i
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:35.680]  want to say that how much i appreciate um all that you do end game with a fantastic documentary
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:41.520]  thank you and i do apologize i am a little nervous right now well i'm nervous too about
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:46.560]  what's happening brother go ahead you got a question for mr dent um well it's more of a
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:50.800]  comment now i just want to remind people to get involved in their church to get involved in their
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:56.480]  family and just uh keep the good fight you know i know it's it looks bad but it can always be better
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:00.640]  well adam god bless you and i'm really glad adam raises that because there's financial wealth
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:06.080]  but we could recreate it overnight if we have cultural wealth of free market liberty merit
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:12.720]  based economies transparency and have our health and have our friends and family that's the real
[2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:18.160]  wealth i haven't a garden's the real wealth i having children's the real wealth and i think
[2:56:18.160 --> 2:56:22.880]  we're going to see a major renaissance and people getting back to basics during this global depression
[2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:26.960]  what do you think harry do you think that there's going to be some good come out of this
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:34.000]  yeah i mean you know uh alex i study cycle i i was a cycle guy way before i was a demographic
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:38.800]  guy i just stumbled on demographics as the most important cycle in this new middle class world
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:46.000]  increasingly in the emerging world but but to me i one of the cycles i look at that is very
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:55.840]  very clear every 250 years we have a cultural political social revolution like democracy
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:57:03.360]  in the late 17 and it's set to hit in eight years isn't it yeah and so that the next decade is going
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:08.800]  to see a major revolution that is going to be powerful for emerging countries and is going
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:15.360]  to restructure developed countries around the values we need so i think that's going to be the
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:21.280]  most positive thing that comes out of this crisis people don't get clear don't make clear decisions
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:26.480]  don't go into the burning barn and save the horse and the dog and the kid and the baby
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:32.640]  until there's a crisis and when there's a crisis like 9 11 people just get incredibly clear and
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:38.800]  intelligent i think this crisis is going to bring a big revolution we've been destroying the free
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:44.400]  market capitalist system it's made us so prosperous especially over the last three decades and we're
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:49.520]  going to learn how to bring it back with greater wisdom and i think that's going to be the payoff
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:54.960]  all right well the book is free i know about shipping after you pay people to ship it and even
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:58:01.440]  ship it media mail i think you're losing money at 495 i am i'm losing money on the book we're
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:06.960]  breaking even on the shipping but again harry dent dot com this is the time to get a book like this
