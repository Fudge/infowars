[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:35.360]  it is Wednesday my friends Wednesday the 28th day of April 2010 we're going to be
[00:35.360 --> 00:42.560]  live here for the next four hours Reverend Manning James David Manning is
[00:42.560 --> 00:45.840]  going to be joining us on a host of issues with his expo say and his
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.960]  continued investigation of Barack Hussein Obama he will be joining us coming
[00:51.960 --> 00:56.800]  up the next hour then we have Christine Ebersol star of television films and of
[00:56.800 --> 01:05.200]  course the theater she had quite an experience with the TSA over the weekend
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.640]  and she'll tell her story here for the first time coming up for about 30 minutes
[01:10.640 --> 01:18.240]  for part of the third hour today and then we've got Judge Andrew Napolitano
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.640]  joining us to talk about the fact that he's being demonized by the ADL the
[01:22.640 --> 01:27.560]  Southern Barbery Law Center along with Ron Paul myself and many others but
[01:27.560 --> 01:32.960]  they are certainly picking a very very popular very very mainstream people I
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.480]  mean Ron Paul has got over an 80% approval rating and Napolitano's views
[01:38.480 --> 01:42.560]  are very populist very popular you've seen all the national polls were 80 plus
[01:42.560 --> 01:47.280]  percent of the public including many Democrats close to a majority of
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.440]  Democrats disagree with what the government's doing and so they want to
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.840]  divide us along party lines well I'm just outside of the whole party line
[01:56.840 --> 02:03.120]  situation to begin with I'm I'm I'm not bipartisan I'm not in that controlled
[02:03.120 --> 02:10.600]  system and we're also going to discuss the Arizona situation because Judge
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.400]  Andrew Napolitano but we're going to play that clip when we come back in the
[02:13.400 --> 02:19.200]  next break he has said he thinks what's happening in Arizona is a bad idea from
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.960]  a political strategy point of view and I can certainly see his point of view and
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.120]  agree with him to a certain extent what's constitutional is to have the
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.040]  federal government do their job and protect our borders and prosecute
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.360]  people that knowingly hire illegal aliens that would fix the problem very
[02:37.360 --> 02:43.480]  quickly not have two or three raids of a meat packing plant or a Walmart every
[02:43.480 --> 02:46.760]  year you know you got a million plus illegals coming in a year tens of
[02:46.760 --> 02:51.240]  millions here and then they arrest a few thousand at staged raids I mean give me
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.920]  a break it's kind of like these Goldman Sachs hearings they're having right now
[02:54.920 --> 03:01.120]  they're burning a few low-level underlings for you know selling cruddy
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.480]  derivatives and telling their customers it was triple a gold consciously
[03:05.480 --> 03:12.240]  knowing it was crud or well you've all seen the senator quoting the email
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.280]  because he had to to explain what they were saying senator a car 11 talking
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.640]  about Goldman Sachs exec saying this this particular stock is absolute crap
[03:23.640 --> 03:32.360]  but they use the sh it term with a y on the end of it and it's it's it's it's
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.720]  caused quite a sensation so we're gonna play an edited version of this a lot of
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.680]  talk radio because it is part of the government a senator said it are airing
[03:42.680 --> 03:48.200]  it on mainline radio there's no way the FCC can go after them they're airing it
[03:48.200 --> 03:51.920]  on cable networks because this is what this was said in the US Senate this is
[03:51.920 --> 03:57.000]  in testimony this is what was said and the people have a right to know it but
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  I'm not going to play it here plus it's ridiculous you kill a million Iraqis in
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.760]  a fake war in a fraudulent war and that's okay and tortures okay and torture
[04:08.760 --> 04:13.880]  of children's okay but heaven forbid somebody here a cuss word I mean that's
[04:13.880 --> 04:24.440]  how ridiculous things have gotten in this society so that is coming up as
[04:24.440 --> 04:30.440]  well in this hour I also want to take phone calls but but I would specifically

[08:07.000 --> 08:15.600]  sold them this is what your sales team were telling to each other got it 105
[08:15.600 --> 08:22.840]  yes mr. chairman look what your sales team was saying about timber wolf boy
[08:22.840 --> 08:28.040]  that timber wolf was a one deal
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.240]  they sold that this email was from the head of the division not the sales force
[08:36.240 --> 08:41.400]  whatever it was it was it's an internal it's an internal Goldman document this
[08:41.400 --> 08:46.960]  was an email to me in late June right and you sold timber will action no no you
[08:46.960 --> 08:52.480]  sold timber wolf after as well we did trades after that yeah okay and the
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.560]  trades after some context yeah might be helpful that context let me tell you the
[08:57.560 --> 09:04.760]  context is mighty clear June 22 is the date of this email boy that timber wolf
[09:04.760 --> 09:13.400]  was one deal how much of that deal did you sell to your clients after June 22
[09:13.400 --> 09:19.640]  2007 mr. chairman I don't know the answer to that but the price would have
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.880]  reflected levels that they wanted to invest oh of course they don't know
[09:23.880 --> 09:27.640]  it says you didn't tell him you thought it was a deal well I didn't say that no
[09:27.640 --> 09:33.040]  who did your people internally you knew it was a you know and that's what your
[09:33.040 --> 09:38.680]  email shows I think the context the message that I took from the email from
[09:38.680 --> 09:45.120]  mr. Montag was that my performance on that deal wasn't good and I think the
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.720]  fact that we had lost money related to that wasn't how about the fact that you
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.760]  sold hundreds of millions of that deal after your people knew it was deals that
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.600]  bother you at all you sold to customers something I don't recall selling hundreds
[09:59.600 --> 10:04.960]  of millions of that deal after that all right let's take a look exhibit 166
[10:04.960 --> 10:12.440]  series of emails first is June 26 oh seven that's after June 22
[10:21.240 --> 10:27.400]  July 1 2007 tells the sales force the top priorities timber wolf your top
[10:27.400 --> 10:31.680]  priority to sell is that deal
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.960]  mr. icon was I didn't recall the sales that you got it one second trying to
[10:38.960 --> 10:45.680]  sell okay you're trying to sell a deal and it's your top priority come on
[10:45.680 --> 10:49.760]  mr. Sparks well mr. Goldman Sachs be trying to sell and by the way it sold
[10:49.760 --> 10:55.480]  it a lot of it after that date should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell deal
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.920]  well can you answer that one answer that one yes or no there are prices in the
[11:01.920 --> 11:05.560]  market that people want to invest in things I didn't use that term with
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.760]  respect to the steel no it's your sale who did use that term who's time man
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.560]  time who's Daniel Sparks that's me and who's who's time I know who's time
[11:14.560 --> 11:21.120]  Montag Tom Montag was the head of the division at the time
[11:21.120 --> 11:27.080]  the head of the Goldman Sachs division on derivatives saying sell our customers
[11:27.080 --> 11:42.120]  absolute crud absolute sh-t now again we knew this ten years ago we knew this
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.600]  five years ago we knew this two years ago we knew this six months ago I mean
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.040]  every radio show we've done with all of the financial experts an economist I
[11:52.040 --> 11:57.440]  mean I went back to George Humphrey economist local Austinite businessman
[11:57.440 --> 12:04.160]  former city council member very successful financial investor and I
[12:04.160 --> 12:18.080]  remember he put out audio tapes in 1998 audio tapes in 1998 where he laid out
[12:18.080 --> 12:24.080]  how they were setting up a derivatives bubble thousands of times more than all
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.640]  the real money in the world all the real assets to bring in world government
[12:29.640 --> 12:42.080]  twelve years ago in fact he's he's written three books and I think the
[12:42.080 --> 12:45.960]  first one he wrote what was it about 97 the audio tapes came out 98 was a
[12:45.960 --> 12:55.040]  common sense after Patrick Henry you know what we've got to get those audio
[12:55.040 --> 12:58.800]  cassettes and CDs and I think we actually still sell them an info wars.com
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.160]  we've got to queue it up the next few days it'll take time it's like nine
[13:02.160 --> 13:05.680]  hours long if I remember correctly we've got to find the sections where he
[13:05.680 --> 13:11.360]  breaks that down and play it 12 years later I mean he knew 12 years ago and
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.160]  anyone who understands financial instruments and fractional reserve
[13:16.160 --> 13:20.560]  banking understands what's going on here but the point is he put it out 12
[13:20.560 --> 13:24.440]  years ago a year ago we released the Obama deception we broke down how
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.400]  Goldman Sachs and others by name we cover it and fall the Republic as well now
[13:29.400 --> 13:35.480]  out for six months we're going out and creating the Ponzi scheme not just to
[13:35.480 --> 13:41.600]  become fabulously more wealthy but to implode the economy by design and
[13:41.600 --> 13:46.520]  destroy their competition and now what is it five months ago they had the five
[13:46.520 --> 13:51.600]  part series four months ago five part series by McClatchy newspapers by Greg
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.640]  Gordon we had him on the show where they got separate emails from these
[13:56.640 --> 14:04.560]  Timberwolf emails where they're talking about the exact same thing oh we're
[14:04.560 --> 14:08.960]  going to get our competition will be the last standing we're going to
[14:08.960 --> 14:12.680]  consolidate things we'll make money on the way up and the way down because they
[14:12.680 --> 14:21.280]  were secretly a year and a half before the implosion of 2008 on record now
[14:21.280 --> 14:25.480]  we've all known this is that this radio audience has known this for a long time
[14:25.480 --> 14:35.000]  but now the public's learning that they consciously were betting against the
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.280]  crud they were selling people and they were having insurance companies like
[14:39.280 --> 14:51.640]  AIG now bailed out by the taxpayer to pay the guarantees to Goldman Sachs on the
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.680]  crud they created not just one side of the scam then they come out and say oh
[14:57.680 --> 15:03.920]  we're bankrupt we need trillions of dollars the big six the big eight the big
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.360]  ten there's different ways of breaking it down the news is now calling it the
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.840]  big six whatever there's eight main banks that own Federal Reserve stock but
[15:12.840 --> 15:18.440]  they say six of them on most of it and it's so secret that they the Congress has
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.040]  had a few investigations and thinks maybe there's ten banks but the other two
[15:22.040 --> 15:29.360]  were foreign Bank of England and then a German central bank the point is this is
[15:29.360 --> 15:35.400]  a group of absolute total criminals and look I know you know that but we better
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.520]  get this message out to the population because these bankers are now pushing a
[15:41.520 --> 15:47.080]  financial regulatory bill written by Senator Dodd in the White House who are
[15:47.080 --> 15:52.440]  completely bankrolled by the most criminal elements of Wall Street not all
[15:52.440 --> 15:56.040]  of Wall Street is criminal just like all banks are not criminal it's these big
[15:56.040 --> 15:59.920]  mega players that are criminal and why have they become the main players why
[15:59.920 --> 16:03.160]  do they run everything why are they so powerful why can no one stop them
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.480]  because they have unlimited money they just make up and it's backed up with
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.880]  government force that's why these are Ponzi scheme operators these are people
[16:11.880 --> 16:18.600]  like Ken Lay and Bernie Madoff who are allowed to play by whatever rules they
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.840]  make up and then we play by a separate set of rules that they create for us and
[16:24.840 --> 16:30.800]  the good news is there are some news reports now there are some banking
[16:30.800 --> 16:34.960]  association documents that I've seen out of Tennessee Texas New York and a few
[16:34.960 --> 16:39.520]  other places where healthy state-based banks and regional banks are coming out
[16:39.520 --> 16:43.360]  and pointing out this is a total fraud by the very mega banks that created the
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.120]  derivatives so so the truth is starting to get out there and that's good because
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.120]  this is a life-and-death situation for our economy but meanwhile we've got
[16:52.120 --> 17:00.560]  Goldman Sachs running around blank find their CEO in testimony yesterday and he
[17:00.560 --> 17:08.800]  made the rounds on television CNN Fox you name it CNBC he's running around saying
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.680]  man we've really learned from this we've learned from our mistake in fact I'll
[17:12.680 --> 17:18.680]  play this clip clip later we have time he said we've learned from our mistake we
[17:18.680 --> 17:23.520]  just didn't know that this was gonna happen we you know the economy was doing
[17:23.520 --> 17:30.080]  so well we thought that we just made a mistake no all the emails the documents
[17:30.080 --> 17:35.320]  their internal memorandum the orders being given by the directors of the
[17:35.320 --> 17:44.120]  major units of Goldman Sachs across the board was sell toxic poison labeled as
[17:44.120 --> 17:53.440]  mother's milk to investors and what should really concern everybody is
[17:53.440 --> 17:56.880]  Goldman Sachs is now out in the open that's how dumb they think we are the
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.520]  media the last month has been almost universally lying saying oh the banks
[18:02.520 --> 18:06.720]  were upset about this banking reform bill they don't want it this is going to
[18:06.720 --> 18:10.800]  you know get them in line this is going to end derivatives this is going to keep
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.960]  our economy safe and the big corrupt bankers they don't want it then
[18:15.960 --> 18:21.400]  meanwhile at the critical juncture Goldman Sachs comes out and says oh we
[18:21.400 --> 18:26.960]  actually support this legislation and we were involved helping the White House
[18:26.960 --> 18:34.400]  crafted so this would be like Ken lay sitting as the judge in his own trial
[18:34.400 --> 18:41.720]  and being given a ten million dollar lottery prize or publishers clearing
[18:41.720 --> 18:46.240]  house sweepstakes prize for robbing people I mean it's just it's too rich
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.600]  and the system is attempting this because they have absolute and total contempt
[18:51.600 --> 18:55.520]  for the American people and the people of every other nation they're robbing I
[18:55.520 --> 19:01.840]  mean why do you think Mexico and Brazil and in Asian countries are so bankrupt
[19:01.840 --> 19:06.120]  and people are so poor their people are smart they're hard-working they're
[19:06.120 --> 19:11.360]  intelligent but they have never had a chance at freedom they have been
[19:11.360 --> 19:15.440]  dominated by this by these systems for hundreds of years now we're being
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.840]  dominated by it that's why America's always been so hated by Latin America
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.240]  and Africa and poor areas of Asia and Eastern Europe because people knew it
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.480]  was US backed banks that were in there robbing them seven ways to Sunday well
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.720]  now the very same banks are doing that to us and we better bring them to justice
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.680]  now or it's gonna be very hard to kick them out if they're able to fully
[19:39.680 --> 19:44.120]  bankrupt us and get their financial straitjacket in place it's over for this

[24:11.360 --> 24:14.480]  passed their government takeover of health care but the states are fighting
[24:14.480 --> 24:23.240]  back the people are beginning to awaken the sleeping giant that is America the
[24:23.240 --> 24:27.960]  global carbon tax scheme is in deep deep trouble of wonderful news out of
[24:27.960 --> 24:33.440]  France Germany Australia they are saying that they are abandoning the global
[24:33.440 --> 24:38.120]  carbon taxes at the national and international level the problem is
[24:38.120 --> 24:41.640]  they're gonna counter strike at the local level we've already been hitting a
[24:41.640 --> 24:45.560]  head hard they're gonna suck 2.6 billion according to Austin Energy in the
[24:45.560 --> 24:49.400]  next three years out of Austin Heights ladies and gentlemen that's more than
[24:49.400 --> 24:53.360]  all taxation in the city combined each year I mean you talk about savaging
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.880]  people with a vicious criminal operation I mean these people are bold if
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.400]  there anything and meanwhile Goldman Sachs CEO on Democrat banking bill I'm
[25:03.400 --> 25:12.680]  generally supportive yes and then we have several other articles dealing with
[25:12.680 --> 25:19.280]  it here's one of the examiner this is Timothy P. Carey Goldman rallies for
[25:19.280 --> 25:24.600]  Obama in Wall Street reform and they report that Goldman Sachs is lobbying
[25:24.600 --> 25:29.360]  for this bill to pass now this is a bill that's supposedly going to stop all
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.960]  their derivatives and it doesn't do that it gives them the power as they hold
[25:32.960 --> 25:38.280]  almost every regulatory position to go after their competition and to go after
[25:38.280 --> 25:44.000]  banks and all financial institutions and all money transfers with a VAT paid
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.960]  into them see the bankers four months ago five months ago at Copenhagen man it's
[25:49.960 --> 25:55.120]  hard to believe how fast time's flying that was five months ago almost six
[25:55.120 --> 26:01.000]  months ago they failed to get a direct tax mechanism to the private banks through
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.440]  the carbon taxes so now they're back with a global banking reform bill and
[26:05.440 --> 26:10.480]  when you read the agreements that the G20 is hammering out and when you read
[26:10.480 --> 26:15.480]  the national laws it all integrates together to give them the exact same
[26:15.480 --> 26:20.760]  system of taxes they wanted before I mean there were financial VAT taxes
[26:20.760 --> 26:31.560]  Tobin taxes in the Copenhagen Treaty it's just it's like a zombie a vampire it
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.400]  never dies it just keeps coming and coming back and coming back but the
[26:35.400 --> 26:41.560]  good news is we're beginning to beat them they got the health care for now but
[26:41.560 --> 26:45.960]  let's go ahead and play of the CEO blank fine just a quick clip the full clips up
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.880]  on info wars dot com and present planet dot com I want to play a short clip of
[26:50.880 --> 26:54.720]  him saying well you know we are working with Congress and we learned the
[26:54.720 --> 26:58.400]  mistakes we made and you know we just thought the economy was doing so good
[26:58.400 --> 27:03.960]  we never thought this would happen there he is the day that the hearings are
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.440]  televised on national television and all over radio and all over the newspapers
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.080]  that it finally comes out that it was premeditated fraud that they knew
[27:12.080 --> 27:16.920]  exactly what they were doing by design and plan the whole thing and even bought
[27:16.920 --> 27:24.000]  insurance on it knowing it was gonna go under so they sold it to people that they
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.840]  knew were gonna be robbed and they and then they also insured themselves this
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.960]  is like somebody insuring their own restaurant and fire bombing it you know
[27:31.960 --> 27:38.360]  to collect the insurance money so so here he is lying to the nation on Fox
[27:38.360 --> 27:45.440]  News here is Peter Barnes and Lloyd Blank fine Mr. Blank fine long day but
[27:45.440 --> 27:52.760]  I'd like to look ahead what's next what's next is we are gonna learn and take
[27:52.760 --> 27:56.160]  the learning lessons from this period in fact we have and we're going to apply
[27:56.160 --> 28:02.240]  them and what's next for the Congress is they're going and having done their
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.480]  deep dive they're going to legislate hopefully in a bipartisan fashion and
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.040]  will come out with their new set of rules and we will engage in a very
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.480]  molecular view of our own business and make sure that we make the appropriate
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.320]  changes to our business model one thing that is still hanging out there is this
[28:20.320 --> 28:26.240]  SEC lawsuit as Congress finishes up regulation reform legislation what's
[28:26.240 --> 28:30.280]  next with that is there any consideration by the company and by you to
[28:30.280 --> 28:36.720]  settle that lawsuit with the SEC well what happens now is we have a complaint
[28:36.720 --> 28:41.200]  and we have to respond to that complaint and that has it just goes on with
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.600]  more deception it's come out the Goldman Sachs including Mr. Blank fine have
[28:46.600 --> 28:51.640]  had a whole bunch of meetings with Obama quietly in the White House and that
[28:51.640 --> 28:54.360]  they've been having meetings all over the place with Geithner who formerly
[28:54.360 --> 28:58.800]  worked for them and with Bernacke who formerly worked for them and with the
[28:58.800 --> 29:01.960]  other regulators that formerly worked with them I mean I literally can't find
[29:01.960 --> 29:05.400]  one senior regulator that didn't work with them who doesn't own stock in them
[29:05.400 --> 29:09.480]  who isn't getting the bailout money for themselves it goes back to Henry
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.480]  Paulson when they asked him well you got 200 plus million dollars in one payout
[29:14.480 --> 29:20.080]  from the bailout and then the congressman said how did you do that what
[29:20.080 --> 29:25.080]  that was congressman Stern and he said well I got a waiver who gave me the
[29:25.080 --> 29:29.520]  waiver oh the Treasury Department well who runs the Treasury Department well I
[29:29.520 --> 29:35.080]  did he gives himself a waiver it's like a bank manager giving himself a note
[29:35.080 --> 29:41.640]  that he can rob the bank I mean it just it's fraud but we'll come back finish up
[29:41.640 --> 29:43.960]  with this to get into the situation with the borders and the latest
[29:43.960 --> 29:47.760]  developments with Arizona saying they're gonna enforce the law we'll be right

[33:13.280 --> 33:26.840]  I hurt myself bookends on what developed to see in the last day with
[33:26.840 --> 33:37.480]  Goldman Sachs hearings it's really very simple problem reaction solution the
[33:37.480 --> 33:41.040]  private central banks and brokerage firms and investment banks come in they
[33:41.040 --> 33:46.720]  create derivatives they create basically counterfeit paper they sell it to the
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.800]  world they gain great power through the process then when it implodes they come
[33:51.800 --> 33:58.200]  back and say okay pass regulations so we don't make these mistakes again when
[33:58.200 --> 34:02.720]  it's all premeditated and then the very regulations that are passed give them
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.880]  more power and control to take over the economy it's very very simple and
[34:06.880 --> 34:14.680]  meanwhile they've got this top lawyer with the Department of the Treasury
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.280]  Barofsky says criminal charges possible and alleged AIG cover-up and that's how
[34:20.280 --> 34:25.960]  to Bloomberg today I mean the Treasury Department is run by Goldman Sachs
[34:25.960 --> 34:29.600]  operatives like Tim Geithner who formerly was one of the directors of
[34:29.600 --> 34:37.120]  Goldman Sachs and so the public is being shown on the surface what appears to be
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.000]  an investigation and they'll probably send a few underlings to prison for a
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.520]  few years and they may you know hand out some fines that amount to you know one
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.160]  penny on the thousand dollars these bankers stole and it'll sound big to
[34:52.160 --> 34:55.920]  the public oh this guy got fined five million and this company got fined a
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.120]  hundred million and this company got fined twenty million and this guy got
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.480]  six months and this guy got five years and they'll spend you know a month in
[35:04.480 --> 35:11.840]  prison or it could be like Ken Lay you know hundreds of billions of dollars
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.720]  are stolen out the back door Ken Lay gets convicted and then he's out on
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.480]  release in Aspen, Colorado and has a heart attack and supposedly dies and the
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.600]  word is from really reliable sources he's alive and down in Paraguay I mean
[35:25.600 --> 35:28.720]  that's how these guys operate it's just the witness protection program is
[35:28.720 --> 35:33.200]  basically used for these insiders who are tied into national security then
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.000]  when the heat gets too high and gets too hot they just stage their deaths but
[35:37.000 --> 35:44.520]  regardless most the people involved with the accounting firms that were engaged
[35:44.520 --> 35:51.480]  in the fraud with Ken Lay and Enron they got a slap on the wrist so that's
[35:51.480 --> 35:57.800]  what's happening there but I do want to take your calls at 1-800-259-9231
[35:57.800 --> 36:06.320]  1-800-259-9231 specifically on the banking and on the situation in Arizona
[36:06.320 --> 36:10.640]  those two twin topics I want to take a few calls coming up before this hour
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.800]  ends at the start of the next hour before we talk to Reverend Manning
[36:16.800 --> 36:25.160]  I do want to get back into the situation in Arizona before I go to your calls
[36:25.160 --> 36:29.360]  before we do that I want to tell you about mysolarbackup.com if you lost
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.840]  your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on if so
[36:33.840 --> 36:37.040]  you should check out mysolarbackup.com there's never been a better time to
[36:37.040 --> 36:41.280]  start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power and
[36:41.280 --> 36:45.600]  it's great plug-and-play solar generators from our sponsors Lucian from
[36:45.600 --> 36:49.280]  Science they need no installation and supply household current whenever and
[36:49.280 --> 36:51.800]  wherever you need it producing electricity directly from the Sun
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.000]  unlike gas generators the solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes you
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.160]  can call and get a free information packet 877-327-0365-877-327-0365 or you
[37:05.160 --> 37:10.960]  can go to mysolarbackup.com and lastly I want to tell you about a colobloat you
[37:10.960 --> 37:14.240]  don't need well water you don't need tap water you don't need to go to the river
[37:14.240 --> 37:18.560]  and get buckets of water this grabs water right out of the atmosphere that's
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.520]  what clouds are I know most of you know that but I get emails saying how does
[37:22.520 --> 37:25.940]  this work it looks like a water cooler without a water bottle on top and it
[37:25.940 --> 37:29.960]  grabs upwards of seven and a half gallons a day with their smallest unit they
[37:29.960 --> 37:33.080]  have bigger units and then it goes through seven to twelve filters depending
[37:33.080 --> 37:36.720]  on which unit you buy it's the best cleanest drinking water you can find I
[37:36.720 --> 37:46.600]  love it it's a colobloot.com E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com a colobloot.com or 800-691-643-800-691-643 a
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.120]  colobloot.com or you can just trust the government take all the vaccines and
[37:51.120 --> 37:59.720]  drink all the Florida water and not listen to us now we've got to look at
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.000]  all the angles of what's happening Mexico is a collapsed country it it is
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.680]  collapsed it is a failed state by any yardstick by any political socioeconomic
[38:10.680 --> 38:17.560]  cultural yardstick and it's a shame it's a rich nation with resources rich with
[38:17.560 --> 38:23.160]  intelligent hard-working smart people and when I get up here on radio when I
[38:23.160 --> 38:29.400]  talk about elements of La Raza and Mecha who call for killing the gringos or
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.640]  call for Oslon or call for the plan of San Diego that's a fact and has to be
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.920]  covered but that's like the media saying that all the Tea Party people are
[38:38.920 --> 38:47.600]  racist no the vast majority are not and so it's an oversimplification and that
[38:47.600 --> 38:50.920]  was not my intention yesterday but I I did hear some of the rebroadcast and if
[38:50.920 --> 38:54.880]  you didn't listen to the whole hour it I tend to get long-winded everyone knows
[38:54.880 --> 39:01.360]  that I think it's been called diarrhea the mouth before I was I was listening
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.600]  to about 30 minutes of my rebroadcast and I was jumping around on different
[39:04.600 --> 39:12.440]  topics and I want to be 100% clear this is a nation of immigrants we're all
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.160]  immigrants to this country even if it was 10,000 years ago and your ancestors
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.320]  came across the Bering Strait from Asia the original inhabitants of North
[39:21.320 --> 39:26.260]  America they're the folks that hunted out the woolly mammoths and the
[39:26.260 --> 39:30.520]  mastodons and hunted out a lot of other species that were here we know they were
[39:30.520 --> 39:37.880]  here a long time ago the issue is Mexico is a criminal government like most
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.800]  other governments but it's one of the most criminal and it's it's totally
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.240]  run by the big central banks in New York they have more billionaires per capita
[39:45.240 --> 39:48.640]  in Mexico than any other country in the world because they have stolen the
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.360]  riches of the people down there and the American people are now going into the
[39:52.360 --> 39:56.560]  similar bondage that the Mexicans have been under if we don't stop these
[39:56.560 --> 40:00.640]  banking cartels that's how every third world country has been brought down in
[40:00.640 --> 40:04.360]  history over and over again and when the countries try to struggle out of it
[40:04.360 --> 40:09.280]  they will you know fund revolutionaries to overthrow the government that's
[40:09.280 --> 40:13.280]  legitimate or they'll fund a neighboring country to invade them and it's just a
[40:13.280 --> 40:17.560]  shame what's happening in Mexico but you do have the criminal element fleeing
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.920]  justice in Mexico or fleeing persecution fleeing the agribusinesses that have
[40:22.920 --> 40:26.080]  moved down there and destroyed their way of life I've talked many times about
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.040]  going back 20 years ago when I'd be down in Mexico you'd see you in biosphere
[40:30.040 --> 40:33.480]  signs everywhere and they'd take the people's ancestral property that were
[40:33.480 --> 40:38.320]  growing corn on and maize and things and raising cattle on or sheep and force
[40:38.320 --> 40:43.160]  them to move to the cities to the maquiladoras and of course most of the
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.200]  maquiladoras are now shut down under globalization everything moved to China
[40:47.200 --> 40:50.320]  and India it's an absolute race to the bottom that was all done by design in
[40:50.320 --> 40:59.040]  Ross Perot tried to expose that and warn people but secondarily it is not states
[40:59.040 --> 41:03.960]  can do anything they want under the Bill of Rights and Constitution except for
[41:03.960 --> 41:07.240]  the powers not expressly given to the federal government and one of those
[41:07.240 --> 41:13.080]  powers is controlling the borders and that's why Andrew Napolitano who's a
[41:13.080 --> 41:20.560]  great constitutionalist has said that this is a very dangerous situation that's
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.360]  taking place in Arizona now I support what Arizona did because it draws
[41:25.360 --> 41:28.560]  attention to the fact that the government is not enforcing the law and
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.480]  that homes are being burned ranchers are being killed every week police are
[41:33.480 --> 41:38.200]  being killed citizens are being raped and robbed it is Wild Wild West it is
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.200]  in fact worse than Wild Wild West it is Road Warrior level in many areas of South
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.680]  and West Texas and many areas of Arizona and even the areas of Southern
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.280]  California I mean it is Road Warrior doesn't even begin to describe what's
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.640]  happening and I've been talking about this for six seven years as things heated
[41:56.640 --> 42:00.600]  up down there I mean I've been saying rocket attacks murder bombings killings
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.760]  rape kidnappings burning buildings and I'd get emails saying I don't see that on
[42:04.760 --> 42:09.120]  the news well you weren't reading South Texas news or Southern Arizona news you
[42:09.120 --> 42:11.660]  weren't talking to people that live down there you weren't interviewing the
[42:11.660 --> 42:18.240]  sheriffs I mean it is it is insanity what's going on down there and this
[42:18.240 --> 42:21.800]  type of lawlessness is beginning to spread deeper into the country so we
[42:21.800 --> 42:28.480]  must secure the border the bipartisan federal plan of Bush and now Obama is
[42:28.480 --> 42:31.280]  just yeah we'll fix the illegal alien problem we'll just legalize them all
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.840]  well if we completely capitulate and say unlimited numbers of people can come
[42:35.840 --> 42:43.040]  here when there's 6 billion 250 plus million people outside the US that's
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.160]  conservative there's over 6.5 billion that's an old number so 300 million out
[42:47.160 --> 42:53.760]  of that you get 6.2 plus 6.2 billion people they want to come here not just
[42:53.760 --> 42:57.560]  because it was land of the free home of the brave if there was no welfare like
[42:57.560 --> 43:00.160]  there was a hundred years ago and the churches and local communities with a
[43:00.160 --> 43:07.160]  welfare then we could take 30 million people from Mexico alone but we can't
[43:07.160 --> 43:11.280]  do that ladies and gentlemen because when they get here big government shoves a
[43:11.280 --> 43:16.560]  welfare trough in front of them because they want them as pliant political
[43:16.560 --> 43:21.920]  slaves that they can use as a political weapon and that's why I have to throw
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.200]  everything I've got against this because I see the program very clearly and I
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.120]  have the SPP documents where they said we're gonna use the border collapsing as
[43:30.120 --> 43:33.760]  a pretext to set up the North American Union we're gonna use financial crises
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.320]  and we're gonna use biological crises ie the flu and you've seen them do all
[43:38.320 --> 43:41.880]  of that every time there's a crisis the answer is just get rid of the borders
[43:41.880 --> 43:47.760]  that will fix it have a unified system which then brings us all under tyranny
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.920]  I want liberty in Mexico I want them to be free I want their people to have big
[43:52.920 --> 43:58.080]  houses and swimming pools and to build big cities and I I'd probably move there
[43:58.080 --> 44:02.760]  I love Mexico it's a love hate relationship though beautiful wonderful
[44:02.760 --> 44:08.200]  place but it's in squalor in so many areas and it's falling apart and America
[44:08.200 --> 44:12.800]  is gonna fall apart like that if we don't do something about this right now I
[44:12.800 --> 44:16.440]  mean do you know how people live in Latin America have you been there I've
[44:16.440 --> 44:21.280]  been there have you been to Central America I've been there I've been quite a
[44:21.280 --> 44:27.080]  few places it is hellish trips with machine guns everywhere barefoot kids
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.160]  walking around with sores on their faces sewage running down the street
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.000]  chickens running around the middle of the road and now what is America starting
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.400]  to look like troops with machine guns checkpoints I mean just the whole thing
[44:38.400 --> 44:45.000]  it's happening and we've got to do something about this now I want to go
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.720]  to Nick Earl Matt John and Alex but let's play the Palatano's concern here
[44:49.720 --> 44:54.480]  and then when he's on with us coming up later in the last hour of the show I can
[44:54.480 --> 45:01.160]  you'll get his take on this but I really respect his deep insight and and I
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.960]  understand the point he's got here but then I also have some caveats with a
[45:06.960 --> 45:10.320]  different perspective so let's go ahead and play this clip and the president
[45:10.320 --> 45:15.000]  real quick what I got to you this governor Brewer saying this immigration
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.520]  that she's going to bankrupt the Republican Party in the state of Arizona
[45:18.520 --> 45:20.960]  look at what happened to the Republicans in California with the
[45:20.960 --> 45:28.320]  opposition happens Hispanics who have a natural home in the Republican Party
[45:28.320 --> 45:32.000]  because they are socially conservative will flee in droves she's also going to
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.720]  bankrupt her state because no insurance company will provide coverage for this
[45:35.720 --> 45:38.840]  and for all the lawsuits that will happen for all the people that are
[45:38.840 --> 45:43.240]  wrongfully stopped her budget will be paying for it her budget will be paying
[45:43.240 --> 45:47.600]  the legal bills of the lawyers who sue in behalf of those that was stopped this
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.600]  will be a disaster for Arizona to say nothing in the fact that it's so
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.160]  unconstitutional I predict a federal judge will prevent Arizona from
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.120]  enforcing it as soon as they attempt to do so that would probably be tomorrow
[45:59.120 --> 46:05.880]  well judge judge in the bison of the definitive but see the position the
[46:05.880 --> 46:13.400]  country's put in the feds will not protect the border and it is their
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.800]  authority their job their duty their responsibility they will not do it
[46:18.800 --> 46:25.840]  Arizona is being overrun and so Arizona passes a law and the media
[46:25.840 --> 46:31.720]  misconstrues it I've read the law it says that if you have probable cause
[46:31.720 --> 46:37.160]  suspicion that means if you pull somebody over and they're drunk and they
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.400]  and they're an illegal alien and they got a consul matricula card in their
[46:41.400 --> 46:46.680]  wallet you take them to jail and then they're deported I mean you Mexico will
[46:46.680 --> 46:51.360]  deport you in a minute that's another issue it's how bad Americans are
[46:51.360 --> 46:56.840]  treated in Mexico I mean you know you start demanding your rights down in
[46:56.840 --> 47:03.880]  Mexico they'll just shoot you I mean they don't play games down there and you
[47:03.880 --> 47:09.160]  know he's right about the fact that it federal courts are gonna rule it
[47:09.160 --> 47:17.520]  unconstitutional but then that brings us to the point of what do you do when the
[47:17.520 --> 47:20.920]  federal government won't do its job
[47:21.040 --> 47:25.440]  well under the 9th and 10th amendment the states can do one thing they can
[47:25.440 --> 47:28.880]  pull out of the union because there isn't a union the union doesn't exist
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.760]  anymore it's run by Lloyd blank flying it's run by people like Henry Paulson
[47:34.760 --> 47:42.200]  it's run by these crooks who love wrecking things so they can consolidate
[47:42.200 --> 47:48.280]  them what's a mosquito do when it sticks its proboscis down into your skin and
[47:48.280 --> 47:55.360]  into a capillary it injects a saliva an acid enzyme that dissolves the cells so
[47:55.360 --> 48:01.880]  that it can suck the juices into its belly and that's what they do they they
[48:01.880 --> 48:07.280]  dissolve a nation they dissolve a country so they can consolidate it they
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.680]  don't care of it wrecks the society as long as they get the power and as long
[48:11.680 --> 48:20.440]  as they get the control and so we've got a Democrat says Arizona law like Nazi
[48:20.440 --> 48:25.800]  Germany no what Nazi Germany is is the federal government that's now so
[48:25.800 --> 48:29.280]  concerned about illegal aliens rights the federal government that runs
[48:29.280 --> 48:33.080]  warrantless checkpoints paying local police with grants to take blood without
[48:33.080 --> 48:37.680]  warrants or to have naked body scanners in the airports now going in mobile
[48:37.680 --> 48:43.480]  vans on the streets and trucks and federal programs putting ATF deputized
[48:43.480 --> 48:49.280]  local agents in the schools to brainwash your children and and having
[48:49.280 --> 48:54.960]  federal grants for laptops watching kids at home as they undress that is
[48:54.960 --> 48:59.480]  Nazi Germany Nazi Germany is the Patriot Act Nazi Germany is torturing
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.320]  Iraq he's a death Nazi Germany is attacking countries that have done
[49:04.320 --> 49:10.160]  nothing to us Nazi Germany's having a big out-of-control central government
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.160]  that's what Nazi Germany is Nazi Germany I mean I mean what is Arizona like half
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.680]  Hispanic nobody's gonna pull anybody over with brown skin half the cops are
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.840]  Hispanic they're Americans but if you see a truck full of eight people in the
[49:24.840 --> 49:29.760]  back and they're driving around drinking beer right I mean the funny thing is I
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.200]  watch illegal aliens drinking beer every weekend in the backs of their trucks
[49:34.200 --> 49:37.360]  because they know the cops leave them alone you try being a citizen I don't
[49:37.360 --> 49:40.440]  care if you're Hispanic black white whatever it is guzzling beer and
[49:40.440 --> 49:44.080]  everybody knows what illegal alien looks like okay there weren't cowboy hats they
[49:44.080 --> 49:47.600]  got cowboy boots normally they've been doing construction work there's dirt all
[49:47.600 --> 49:51.760]  over them and you know when they're driving home and people say well that's a
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.360]  job nobody else will do oh really Americans regardless of what color you
[49:55.360 --> 50:02.160]  are you used to can make a good living in construction and now it's driven the
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.360]  price down so much that it's destroyed our economy see when you pay people less
[50:08.360 --> 50:12.240]  it destroys the economy when you pay people more then people have more money
[50:12.240 --> 50:20.520]  to spend an example of this is 50 years ago Walmart not Walmart Freudian slip
[50:20.520 --> 50:28.240]  McDonald's the Walmart of fast food began putting trays out that said thank
[50:28.240 --> 50:32.360]  you and they got people to throw away their own trash now you go in a
[50:32.360 --> 50:37.200]  McDonald's or any other fast food place they're filthy because there's the
[50:37.200 --> 50:41.920]  corporation has trained you to not expect to go to a clean restaurant when
[50:41.920 --> 50:45.560]  they can be paying some entry-level teenagers to be out there keeping a
[50:45.560 --> 50:49.800]  clean and what you pay five cents more for the hamburger but then you'd have an
[50:49.800 --> 50:55.000]  economy this is a strep mining economy all right whatever you've seen what
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.920]  napkin gap and open borders have done you've seen the proof is in the pudding
[50:57.920 --> 51:05.760]  the proof is in the results remain in your houses the president of the United
[51:05.760 --> 51:11.320]  States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004 will they do it
[51:11.320 --> 51:16.600]  will they pull the trigger this time we all pray they stand down but an
[51:16.600 --> 51:21.400]  engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day think it can't
[51:21.400 --> 51:29.240]  happen here executive order 10,990 locks down all highways executive order 10,995
[51:29.240 --> 51:34.880]  seizes control of all media outlets executive order 10,998 controls all

[54:10.240 --> 54:16.240]  his quest to expose Barry Sitaro aka Barack Obama and we've got Christina
[54:16.240 --> 54:21.320]  Ebersole with her harrowing tail with the TSA in the airport and then of
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.760]  course we've got Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us right now let's go to Nick in
[54:25.760 --> 54:29.920]  Arkansas you're on the air Nick thanks for holding thank you Alex can you hear
[54:29.920 --> 54:37.600]  me yes I can okay I'm about to listen to you for about a year now and I just
[54:37.600 --> 54:43.200]  want to tell you that we're out here fighting the good battle I'm a Hispanic
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.920]  American or shall I say an American who happens to be have Mexican roots exactly
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.400]  I'm not a European American I'm not a native American even though I have some
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.240]  native blood I'm just an American exactly exactly and I guess I just wanted
[54:58.240 --> 55:05.280]  to call and say that I do support this new law in Arizona and also I think that
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.240]  the rest of the states need to pass this because if people would just wake up to
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.920]  what the new world order is and the agents and tools that they use to take
[55:14.920 --> 55:20.480]  over our nation then they too can break loose of this paradigm that they're
[55:20.480 --> 55:24.880]  stuck in exactly I mean look the big banks the federal government the
[55:24.880 --> 55:29.200]  globalist worldwide the UN wants no borders this is a very simple equation
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.120]  they want to bring down wealthy Western nations they don't want upwardly
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.840]  mobile middle-class people whether it's in Japan or the United States they
[55:37.840 --> 55:41.520]  don't care and they want to bring in giant populations that are politically
[55:41.520 --> 55:46.760]  ignorant if that's possible Americans are pretty ignorant on average to to to
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.640]  rewrite the way this system works because in a democracy 51% can vote to
[55:51.640 --> 55:55.040]  rob the other 49 and they've been teaching that we're a democracy when
[55:55.040 --> 56:00.000]  we're when we're a republic and look I want freedom for Mexico and as long as
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.600]  they use the United States as a steam valve for people that would be down
[56:04.600 --> 56:09.360]  there taking their country back I mean Mexico has never had freedom and and
[56:09.360 --> 56:12.640]  that's why freedom is so special most nations have never had freedom and when
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.520]  you get freedom you produce incredible wealth when you have tyranny you don't
[56:16.520 --> 56:20.600]  have wealth for the average person anything else Nick yes just a quick
[56:20.600 --> 56:24.600]  comment just to let you know that we are waking up other Hispanic or other
[56:24.600 --> 56:29.400]  Americans who are Hispanic to the New World Order everyone within earshot of
[56:29.400 --> 56:33.440]  my voice please do not be afraid to use the word New World Order because that's
[56:33.440 --> 56:39.240]  what it is it's their own word and also a quick question FEMA is starting to
[56:39.240 --> 56:43.040]  stretch out their tentacles into my local government asking local and city
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.600]  governments to pass an ordinance to require people to have the flood
[56:48.600 --> 56:53.960]  insurance because of this new shaded X zone I'm not really sure about it what
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.880]  I'm familiar with it let me comment on that Nick all over the country people
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.720]  who are on hilltops who've never flooded are being made to get flood
[57:03.720 --> 57:09.320]  insurance and it's it's it's more total federal control and and we've got the
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.080]  federal government coming in saying they want to regulate salt now and decide
[57:13.080 --> 57:16.720]  what you can eat I mean it's just that they have no jurisdiction again the
[57:16.720 --> 57:20.160]  federal government does everything it has no jurisdiction to do and doesn't do
[57:20.160 --> 57:23.800]  the things it has jurisdiction to do Earl in Maryland you're on the air
[57:23.800 --> 57:33.680]  Earl good yeah I've been listed as a show on basically I had been somebody
[57:33.680 --> 57:39.840]  basically in addition to your new chains and all that and my opinion about
[57:39.840 --> 57:47.080]  everything is just yeah part of the new world I want I know I'm not I'm not down
[57:47.080 --> 57:52.600]  for it all for real this it needed to destroy right away because it's so
[57:52.600 --> 57:56.880]  corrupted and so many people that actually any of life from like they
[57:56.880 --> 58:03.360]  got Birkberg group fours um even a couple people from like the Congress that
[58:03.360 --> 58:09.840]  and then like here we kiss sir Bill Clinton Hillary they're all in it the
[58:09.840 --> 58:14.040]  entire leadership of every Western nation is part of this criminal banking
[58:14.040 --> 58:18.040]  cartel that can just make up any amount of money they want backed up by
[58:18.040 --> 58:23.480]  taxpayers to buy everybody off it's fraud it has to end but instead of the
[58:23.480 --> 58:26.480]  name of financial reform and I appreciate your call Earl they're about to
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.080]  give even more power to the crooks oh that'll teach him that'll get them that's
[58:31.080 --> 58:35.280]  like you know giving a serial killer ten more people to kill that'll that'll
[58:35.280 --> 58:38.800]  teach him we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with Matt John Alex and

[58:58.120 --> 59:01.720]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[59:01.720 --> 59:05.080]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[59:05.080 --> 59:08.880]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.320]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.160]  then Christina ever sold and judge Andrew Napolitano we're continuing with
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.880]  your phone calls right now let's go to who's up next here I guess that would be
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.720]  Matt in Minnesota you're on the air Matt welcome hey Alex thanks for taking my
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.040]  call thanks for calling a couple quick comments on regarding Arizona and one
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.440]  regarding Glenn Beck I think Arizona this this this new legislation they passed
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.520]  I think the Obama administration and the rest of his minions see it as a major
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.480]  threat because they realized that the rest of the slaves in this nation you
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.240]  know might realize the full potential of states right that's a states rights
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.920]  rebellion and there are so many ways for the states to constitutionally stand
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.800]  up the problem is this is one of the three things the federal government's
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.960]  actually empowered to do but again if they're not doing their duty we have an
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.680]  inherent right that falls back to the people to protect our nation from crime
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.840]  and the way the media is spinning it saying they're gonna have checkpoints
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.160]  to grab illegals they're gonna try to make them victims the way this law is
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.200]  really written it just says if they pull people over for drunk driving or
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.600]  whatever it is and they find out they're illegal then they're there to take them
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.880]  to jail I mean and and that's that's what the states are supposed to do I mean
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.760]  if if state police or local police catch somebody committing a federal crime
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.400]  it's their job to take them into jail so I don't think it's unconstitutional but
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.560]  the way the media is putting it out there and the way they're phrasing it
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.160]  they're gonna have the feds come after it as if it's unconstitutional yeah
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.920]  they're they're definitely they're playing the race card and illegal
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.600]  immigrants is is not a race it's a crime but that's that's what they're
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.800]  telling us so happens 80% is is from Mexico though but yes yes in fact I
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.720]  wish it was a European country that bordered us that was doing this because
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.000]  then we would have fixed this problem a long time ago but you're not allowed to
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.320]  do that because the media gets to play the race card okay yeah hey one quick
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.080]  comment I was in the Glenn Beck show that just this Monday and I was pretty
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:39.480]  surprised he said quote we are heading for world government a new world order
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.200]  and nobody's doing anything about it not even the Republicans and he used the
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.280]  term new world order about five times I don't have I don't have a lot of time to
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.400]  monitor him but the word is he's gotten a lot better lately so I think his
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.640]  listeners are pressuring him to stop whitewashing and he actually said the
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.160]  new world order is a fact and I'm just like well that's that's great you came
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.600]  on saw that Glenn but what are you going to do about that and well here's the deal
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.400]  limbaugh still makes jokes about world government and you know if limbaugh for
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.400]  the last 20 years would have been telling the truth about this they would
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.200]  have never gotten away with it if conservatives knew the truth but
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.800]  conservatives were taught that it was like a religious belief to be a
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.240]  conservative that there's no world government and there is no big banking
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.320]  cartel well look at the banking cartel now they've robbed us and they're the
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.520]  ones calling for a world government that we pay taxes to there's no more time
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:35.520]  to screw around and so Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity all need to
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.440]  be pressured to come completely clean with everything I mean it's look I had
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.200]  nightline here yesterday and I had to have arguments with them that world
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.080]  governments being set up and I started trying to show him Herman von Roompi and
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.280]  other clubs and they would just then fall back and say well isn't that just
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.920]  countries working together no it's a bunch of private banks creating a global
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.800]  corporate government I mean there's there's no wiggle room it's a hundred
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.360]  percent and I'm tired of being called a kook because I'm trying to defend this
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.760]  country I'm sorry go ahead yeah yeah no I don't understandable yeah I agree I'm
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.240]  well I was looking at Limbaugh this week too and he was he basically said they're
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.360]  defending the whole Goldman Sachs thing too I mean he's defending them no big
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:21.680]  problem I know and he calls it free market no it's not free market to sell
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.680]  somebody a car and and to tell him that you know the engine has no problems when
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.880]  you know full well it's gonna break down five miles after they leave so I mean
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:37.720]  it's fraud fraud is not free market yep hey and one last comment I just wanted
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.280]  to say your videos you did when you you had had an interview with CNN that was
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.640]  awesome and I thought that was one of the greatest things you ever did yeah I
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:50.000]  didn't shoot anything but with the interview with the nightline yesterday I
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.560]  probably should have I just I just got too tired plus I'm having my yearly
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.840]  allergy attack right now in the springtime some kind of out of it thanks a
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.800]  lot buddy we'll be right back

[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.800]  over America the trilateral Commission would control the world invisible
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.840]  Empire Chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.160]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe first of all
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.680]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.720]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so it's
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.880]  going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:57.840]  o r g I'm Alex Jones of info wars dot com and prison planet dot TV Reverend
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.120]  Manning is really drawn you know our attention in the last year or so
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:11.760]  really eloquently exposing Barry Sitaro Barack Obama aka Barack Obama look
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.360]  we know he was born in Kenya all the evidence points at that we know it's a
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.680]  fake birth certificate receipt that they put out but we know 100% bonafide
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:28.560]  proven because we can't 100% prove the other 99% that he did give up his US
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.440]  citizenship he did become an Indonesian citizen his real name is Barry
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.360]  Sitaro and that's now suddenly been in Newsweek and British newspapers and they
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.160]  just put it out there like it's no big deal this guy he's got a CIA connected
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.840]  mother with these big foundations and working for Geithner's dad he's got a
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:53.640]  classic CIA type background and that's what Reverend Manning is working on with
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:10:00.080]  his influential church in New York in Harlem and he's been doing research on
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.200]  that he's gonna have a I guess a public trial citizen trial to put this
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:10.520]  evidence on so I wanted him to go over some of that evidence today with us he
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:15.280]  is the chief pastor of OTTLA that stands for all the land anointed holy
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.040]  world missionary church in New York City and we really appreciate him coming on
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.840]  with us today good to have you here Reverend Alex thank you very much for
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.360]  having on your broadcast today well there's so much going on here but I mean
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.200]  let's cut right to the chase the I've seen a lot of evidence that he is an
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.640]  intelligence operative and we know his real names Barry Sitaro and we have a
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:42.600]  president who has a fake name so it just gets worse and worse how did you begin
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.200]  to research his CIA connections of course they've been secretive about his
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.840]  college records unlike any other president we've had a break it down for
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:56.560]  us well I answered the question bluntly is that the information was brought to
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.720]  me back in 2009 regarding the CIA connection and when I first was made
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.320]  aware of it I was that I'm not going to promote this or talk about it because
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.520]  it makes him look like he's a patriot having served America during the time
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:17.160]  of the Soviet Union invasion in Afghanistan and which are things who
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.400]  were trying to stave off the Russian invasion needed some help but the
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:26.000]  American forces could not go in troops could not go in on the ground and a
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.920]  assist or the CIA does what it does so proficiently is that they from the
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:37.840]  mercenary if you will type of a covert operation with arms and logistics and
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.480]  with training for the majority that Obama was integral in that they recruited
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.160]  him out of an optional college when he was just a South war there recognizing
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:55.280]  that he had Muslim experience he speaks the Islamic language by the way and he
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.120]  was perfect for going into Afghanistan up in that Pakistan area in as much as
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.760]  that I mean if you put taken angles taxes the IA agent put them up there in that
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.320]  area of Afghanistan Pakistan is that I like for what's up Obama proved to be
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.720]  very very helpful to to the the Buzhat Dean and I would just interrupt an ad
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:20.040]  that Arab television and others have marveled that his diction and his
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.680]  pronunciation of Arabic is better than most Arabs I mean this guy is highly
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.040]  trained no doubt about it he's extremely well versed and he was extremely
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.600]  helpful I mean he he played a major role in helping to turn that war around and
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.920]  that ultimately the Buzhat deans were able to defeat the Soviet Union they
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.640]  later became the Taliban which Obama was integral in organizing but he was a
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.720]  great asset to the Afghan and to the CIA and American people okay what evidence
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.160]  do you have of this well I you know I can only state that as I stated there
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.560]  I'm just not able to go beyond that but I'm going to demonstrate to that trial
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.680]  that we do have substantial evidence on this matter well I mean I know he was in
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.360]  Pakistan he was in Afghanistan he had his records have been sealed he had all
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.920]  these different names he was using that we know his mother was involved in
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.080]  intelligence at some level so through these foundations so I mean I I see
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.880]  evidence there on the surface but you're saying you have been given bonafide
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:28.760]  bulletproof evidence and I mean tell us what you can about the evidence without
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.640]  getting into it but but but you know I mean I mean why this evidence is so
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.280]  documented that I think that we have that that's most telling is that he was
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.960]  not a student in the traditional or the non-traditional way at Columbia University
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.720]  or Columbia College for two years as he states that he was and they awarded him
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:54.080]  and conferred upon him a degree he was not there on then any circumstance can
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.800]  he demonstrate that he was there I think that what we can demonstrate is that he
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.080]  made a statement which was not a part of his dreams of his father's book or any
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.080]  other statement during the campaign that he traveled to Pakistan in 1981 I've
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.240]  spoken to several other people who were part of the market this club and
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.160]  off the dental who identified Obama with several friends from the Pakistan
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.960]  Afghanistan area and I believe it was those people who introduced Obama none
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.720]  of these people have ever uttered one word about their college friend about
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.800]  the person who's now gone on to become president this guy she holds the D.E.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:40.720]  the another person the born for the born they've not uttered one word and in a
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.800]  two-year period about this individual Obama and he's gone on to become
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.680]  president you can't get an interview out of them but they certainly went
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:54.560]  integral in introducing him to become in tech to part of the the Afghan
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:01.760]  majority defense forces well we know that Tony Blair and this has been
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:08.080]  declassified was in my six and we know that they do get people in fact the new
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:15.120]  film ghostwriter is basically about Tony Blair being CIA and that's the main
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.560]  reason they went ahead and picked up Roman Polanski I was first told that by
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:24.560]  an actor who knows some of these people and now it's I wouldn't saw the film
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.320]  it's amazing but it separately has been for the last five years in mainstream
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.760]  British news that he was in my six so so that fits the model of how they get
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:40.240]  them in college and then groom them to be prime ministers to be presidents but
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.480]  but means separate from that you're saying you have I mean well tell us
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.240]  about this trial and I mean and you're saying you have witnesses you have
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.480]  documents I mean when is this trial coming what's gonna happen I think the
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.920]  other thing that we need to make note of not only Tony Blair being a part of the
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.200]  intelligence agency but Vladimir Putin as well was in the high echelon of the
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:07.040]  KGB so it appears that the major world powers over the last decade or so have
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.520]  been involved in bringing people out of the intelligence business into the
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.200]  leadership of the nation that's right and it's also been declassified that when
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:22.680]  Clinton Bill Clinton was over in England he was being run by the CIA section
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.080]  chiefs there when he was a Rhodes Scholar so it just did we see how this
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.160]  takeover works and you got Bush elder being director of the CIA and then of
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.840]  course his son being president what we've been able to demonstrate is that
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:41.320]  there is of course though Obama did not attend Patrice Lumumba school in Moscow
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.800]  a school that was founded by the Russian government to spread Marxism
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.680]  throughout the continent of Africa but they picked up this nobody who was the
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.360]  head of the Congo a young man at 34 years of age made him a great hero in
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.680]  Russia built a school unto him and then sent him back into Africa into the
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.920]  nations there to recruit and to develop the Marxist ideology what we have to be
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:09.120]  and we can see that that the KGB would do that what we have not looked at as the
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.840]  American people is that the universities such as Harvard Yale Princeton
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:20.160]  Columbia and others they bring in people from other nations and give them
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.720]  honorary degrees honorable degrees rather PhDs or master's degrees and then
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.240]  send them back into their nations and many of these people are not really
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:31.360]  qualified to see to receive those types of degrees but they're good for the
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.280]  propaganda of whatever it is America wants to infiltrate into those nations
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.400]  and we've been able to demonstrate that as well. Obama again fit right into that
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:46.400]  process. Well we know that Yale and Harvard almost 100% founded the OSS and
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.960]  CIA and Skull and Bones was an integral part of that it was already a private
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:57.240]  opium-dealing intelligence agency that just became our CIA. Yes absolutely and
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.120]  at Yale in particular and these universities have been involved in
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.880]  the actions of intelligence recruiting students because they have the
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.640]  opportunity to go in in a benign way as if they're about the business of
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:15.560]  education and they can select leaders with children or and other people from
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.520]  other nations and make them important and integral and then the next thing you
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.400]  know where you got a nation you got a nation and upheavals such as what we
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:28.080]  have going on in Iran now I would say if we were to check the number of students
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.080]  that have graduated Harvard at Yale or from Columbia that are now back in
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.560]  Iran you would see where the movement is coming from. Well no that's actually been
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.720]  confirmed that these groups are based out of the US and England and then our
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.400]  people are trained here in the West to go do that this with these major nations
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.000]  too but Reverend I mean when is the trial and are you saying you have other
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.400]  evidence? Yes I have yes I do the trial is scheduled for the 14th of May Alex we
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.800]  have a two programs going we've got the trial going and I need to let everyone
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.560]  know that this trial is not some sort of a mock or moot or kangaroo trial without
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.640]  any power. Constitutionally we have the right under the 10th amendment if we feel
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.000]  that the federal government or the state government has not brought us they are
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.800]  given given us access to process then the right fall to the people to proceed
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.240]  and we're proceeding under that right that we have not been given due process
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:29.600]  and we can demonstrate that there have been cases presented to the US Supreme
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.760]  Court that have been summarily dismissed based on a flimsy statement of
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.160]  whether or not someone has standing so we're moving up forward under the 10th
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.600]  amendment we believe we've got an excellent case we've got proof we've got
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.600]  documented evidence and we believe we can convict Obama. Let's talk about the
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.280]  specifics of the upcoming trial will it be televised on the internet how don't
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.680]  we find out more with our Reverend James David Manning we're also gonna open the

[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:34.800]  Anderson. Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers investment advisors won't
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.000]  talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.600]  industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is out
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.880]  performed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold

[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.720]  I'm Don from the Mexican. January of 2000 I had a heart attack. Then my real
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.480]  health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:17.880]  vision and I really wasn't sleeping well. I was a mess pretty much. Don reports
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.520]  dramatic improvements with heart and body extract. I started taking heart and
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.720]  body extract and from within a few days I started sleeping a lot better. My blood
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:30.040]  pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized and my sleep really did
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.520]  improve. Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.080]  with the assistance of heart and body extract. Order at HBextract.com or call

[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.160]  Folks I did not expect this at all. By the seventh, eighth and ninth day I saw
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.960]  dramatic improvements from taking heart and body extract. Details at HBextract.com

[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.840]  I want to get into other issues with Reverend Manning, the Tea Parties, what
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.720]  Barry Sitaro is up to, but you got cut off by the break. Will we be able to
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.480]  watch the trial? How's it going to be, you know, prepared? I mean how are you
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:25.400]  going to solve it? We're not going to do any live screaming of the trials for one
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:31.320]  reason and one reason only. In order to make the trial an effective event, we
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.320]  need people to come to New York to put boots on the ground and around Columbia
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.480]  University because the second thing that we have not been able to talk about is
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.880]  that we're planning a march around Columbia University for a period of
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.240]  seven days demonstrating that they were complicit in everything that Obama
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.160]  has done and they confer a degree upon him in violation of state laws and
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.240]  federal laws. But if we were to televise it then probably people would not come.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:04.120]  In order to make it effective we've come to the understanding that people need to
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:10.000]  be here in large numbers to speak loudly to witness this issue and at that
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.880]  point we can force the press to begin to deal with it in a way that's
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:19.600]  appreciable. Now what form of citizens grand jury or citizens trial is this?
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.320]  I mean what, who would be the judge? The grand jury hearing. The grand jury
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.200]  took place some time ago. The indictments have been handed down both to
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.040]  Obama and of course at Columbia University and now what we're proceeding
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.280]  with is a trial. This is not a grand jury hearing where only an indictment or a
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.800]  sense of guilt would be outlined. This is an actual trial where witnesses I've
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.960]  subpoenaed to Condoleezza Wright, Zignu Prozensky, Michael Sovrin, George
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:56.280]  Stephanopoulos, Wayne Allen Roode, I've subpoenaed Louis Farrakhan, James
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:02.280]  Conell West. I've subpoenaed a large number of people. This is a trial. This is
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.640]  not a grand jury. We're expecting to affect the verdict and we never know. We're
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.000]  asking people in the community here in Harlem and every place else around
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.320]  America to participate in the trial. We expect a guilty verdict but
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.960]  this is not a grand jury hearing. This is an actual trial. Okay, okay. I'm sorry I'm
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.440]  ignorant of that. That's why we've got you here so I can find exactly what's
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:28.360]  going on. So I mean how big is the jury gonna be? Well I think the petite jury
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.920]  is 12 members. In a criminal case you would need at least that many members
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.480]  to render a verdict and that's exactly how we're going to proceed. Are you
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.880]  gonna randomly select them from those that arrive or? Well what we're gonna do
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.280]  is that we're gonna go through a jury selection process. We've got at present
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.160]  I think about 60 people who have volunteered from across America to serve
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.280]  as jurors and once they're here we're gonna in the first day of the trial the
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:57.920]  process will be to select jurors. The defense will have an opportunity to
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.760]  select jurors and will select jurors as well. And what is the trial trying to
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:12.200]  find? What are the charges? The charges are that Obama was not a US citizen and
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.800]  therefore his event at Columbia University was under the name or at
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:26.200]  least under a foreign if you will national status yet they conferred a
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:31.800]  degree upon him while he was not at the school and that within itself is a
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.000]  violation of state law. He did not study there he would and we can demonstrate
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.800]  nine ways the Saturday documented evidence and
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:44.200]  controversial evidence. He just wasn't there for two solid years. What that then
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.720]  does is that it puts him and it demonstrates that he was not a US
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.560]  citizen. One of the reasons why Columbia proceeded with him and the CIA
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:58.960]  proceeded with him as they did but once we demonstrate that he was not a he
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.720]  did not receive that degree on a normal circumstances then a crime took place
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.440]  and everything that he has done since then having acknowledged that degree and
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:13.800]  Columbia University they have been in conspiracy even to the point of him
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.360]  being president because if they knew at the time that he was at Columbia that he
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:23.160]  was not a US citizen yet they've allowed him to proceed to the presidency
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.200]  without if they have a duty to inform the American people and you may have
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.600]  noticed that Columbia was extremely silent during the time of Obama's
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:36.680]  primary and general election campaign they've been extremely silent about him
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.960]  throughout the process they have not spoken about him and no president Michael
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.000]  Sovereign who is the president who presently still teaches at Columbia has
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.560]  not come forward is that the man graduated pardon me the man is a
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.800]  full graduate that he met all the requirements Lee Bollinger who said
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:58.680]  no one has come forward because they cannot come forward and we can
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:05.120]  demonstrate it. Shifting gears we're about to go to break we see the media I
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.920]  had nightline here yesterday and they asked me they said your criticism of
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.560]  the government aren't you concerned it's going to generate violence and we've
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.160]  seen the Geico spokesman's now lost his job for it you know calling up the Tea
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:23.280]  Party saying it's gonna be your fault when somebody gets killed and we see
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.160]  Bill Clinton saying you know there's gonna be another Oklahoma City and it's
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.440]  gonna be your fault I really see them setting the stage for stage terror
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.520]  attacks here in the United States to be blamed on the American people and I
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.920]  want to I want to talk to you about the race card and how the media starting to
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:43.160]  play it and get your take on where all of this is going Reverend James David
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:47.560]  Manning is our guest and whatever you think of this trial it's certainly in
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:50.800]  the draw attention to the fact that Barack Obama is an Indonesian citizen

[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:16.800]  gears I mean you heard my question going into the break I did so for those
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.440]  who just joined us recapping what do you see in developments with homeland
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.720]  security demonizing conservatives libertarians Christians anti-abortion
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:30.720]  people claiming we're terrorists and that we're now the biggest threat they're
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.040]  not really worried about al-qaeda anymore now the American people are
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.400]  supposedly the terrorist well I think that one of the things that we're
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.080]  concerned about here with the trial here in Harlem is that there would be
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:48.560]  possibly the opportunity for either Homeland Security female or the CIA to
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:55.240]  incite riotous responses to the trial to get the community stirred up to oppose
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.200]  it and then destroy it and that on that wise I don't think that is going to
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.200]  happen a number of people have spoken to me and stated that this is going to
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.080]  invoke the anger and the amulet of black people like you won't believe and
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.120]  you're holding it in Harlem but Alex I can tell you this I mean I've lived in
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:19.280]  Harlem for 20 years for 30 years I've been a pastor for 28 years and black
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.960]  people and Harlem we're not of the riotous kind of behavior that we may have
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  been in the 1960s or even the 70s and the reasons for riotous behavior do not
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.320]  exist as they once did I am convinced that unless the CIA and I don't think
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.520]  they have a lot of influence with black people I mean they infiltrated the FBI
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:46.040]  infiltrated the black Panthers and other organizations that were anti-American
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:50.640]  and were able to incite the riotous behavior I don't think we're gonna have
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.080]  any kind of this riotous behavior as a result of this trial I believe that what
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.240]  will take place about the community will stand back and observe listen to the
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.960]  truth and make their own decisions as to whether or not this matter is true or
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:09.720]  not true but I don't I don't see it being a riot okay to be clear I wasn't
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:14.840]  really implying in fact I wasn't even thinking about your situation in New
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:20.520]  York I was just wanting to get your overall view and see if you agree that
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.520]  they're really demonizing the Tea Party and anybody else that criticizes Obama
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.320]  implying that any criticism is going to lead to violence and so they're trying
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:35.320]  to chill free speech oh absolutely no doubt about it Bill Maher said that the
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.440]  Tea Party was nothing more than a clan rally a couple of weeks ago the the way
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.640]  to to remove the effectiveness of the Tea Party is to demonize them to make
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:54.760]  them a if you will an extreme right-wing group that's anti-black anti values
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.280]  that many of us would probably consider normal yeah they are trying to do that
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.760]  and how successful they're going to be depends I was talking with Dale Robinson
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.200]  who is the David Robinson who's the president of the New York State chapter
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.760]  of the Tea Party and they are being marginalized I mean they've got infighting
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.320]  going on now because they've been infiltrated by by FEMA and by Homeland
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:21.240]  Security and of course by the media as well absolutely I mean are you concerned
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.360]  about false flag terror to be blamed on the American people well you know this
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:30.200]  testing of a nuclear device in Nevada during the days of the trial I do have
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.600]  some concerns about that our even organized a hell of a tendency has been
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.840]  following up on this and trying to find it determine as much information about
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.160]  this as possible you're talking about north com in le oh 10 we have a new
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:45.280]  article with the latest developments at info wars dot com for those just joined
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.920]  us secret FEMA documents were leaked confirmed to be real in the last month
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.920]  for those that just joined us again I'm just recapping this where the government
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.040]  was going to have secret unannounced simulations of nukes going off go ahead
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:03.400]  yeah and that their schedule slated for the days that we're planning holding the
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.080]  trial now whether that's a coincidence or not I don't think so I think that the
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:12.040]  Obama administration of the CIA and other agencies both national and
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.560]  international governments are very concerned about the what will be the
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.000]  outcome of this trial they know I can demonstrate the evidence what they're
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.720]  gonna have to try to do is either to stop it with something put to the false
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.400]  flag or let it go through and then come what may in this nation I don't think
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.560]  they're gonna do that I think they're gonna try something put to the false
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:37.800]  flag well they want a false flag to demonize everybody and and obviously
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.040]  demonize you as well and let's remind folks you did get visited by Homeland
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.840]  Security and New York police they've become more sophisticated idea but they
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.040]  become more sophisticated now they're visiting our church as potential
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:57.040]  worshipers members that kind of a thing now and we're getting a nice flux of
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.600]  them coming through but you can tell this yeah it's kind of hard once you go
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.040]  through that indoctrination process of being a CIA agent it's hard to get the
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.120]  look out of your eyes you know but they're coming now they there's a vein
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:12.600]  what we're doing there looking for appointments to talk with me they have
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:17.760]  not stopped and their attempts to either discredit me or to find some way to
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.680]  weaken me or to help me which they've not been able to do all right let's take a
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.680]  few phone calls here in the last few minutes we have left with Reverend
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.840]  James David Manning let's talk to Jeff in Texas you're on the air Jeff hey I
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:37.160]  have a couple of quick questions first one and I want I would like Alex and the
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:41.800]  Reverend to both share their comments on this if it's possible but the Obama
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:46.080]  thing even if all this is proven if all this you know he wasn't an American
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:50.280]  citizen all that all that goes through can't the Obama can't they just hide
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:53.920]  behind the fact that he's married to an American citizen that he fathered
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.800]  children in America no no not under federal law under federal law you've
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:03.880]  got to be natural born meaning both parents and born here and you know they
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.480]  can argue and say well he really wasn't born in Kenya even though we have that
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.240]  cue that up Michelle Obama what two weeks ago coming out and saying that you
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.320]  know they they went back to Kenya his home country I mean we've got his
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.560]  grandmother saying and I mean he goes on and on we know what can't be just
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.000]  proven and what is a fact is he is an Indonesian citizen and that you can't
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.080]  give up your citizenship and then become a president later that is an
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:38.880]  absolute fact and so it's the very sitaro issue that's unstoppable I
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.280]  appreciate your call we'll get Reverend Manning's comment on this in just a
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.480]  moment but let's play this short clip of her on a national television saying that
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.160]  this that he went back and visited his home country of Kenya which is still
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:56.040]  plaguing so many of our communities which you all know a lot of that is due
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:02.360]  to homophobia Barack has led by example when we took our trip to Africa and
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:08.400]  visited his home country in Kenya we took a public HIV test all right Reverend
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.640]  Manning I mean his approval rating continues to sink everything they're
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:18.800]  trying to push through is in trouble your take on the state of Barry sitaro
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.000]  but first of all you're absolutely right there is no way on God's earth that
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.080]  Obama could ever demonstrate he's a natural one it just it cannot happen the
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.760]  Barry sitaro incident and being a citizen in Indonesia is absolutely
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.000]  correct but the other thing I think is important is that I believe that Michelle
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.720]  statement the fist bumper Obama regarding his homeland in Kenya was an
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:45.240]  attempt to begin to leak information because they realized the pressure that's
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:50.000]  being placed upon the administration to demonstrate that Obama is not eligible
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.720]  to serve they're going to try to leak it leak the information out and then
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:58.440]  perhaps find a way to seek the I suppose the forgiveness of the American
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.520]  people and then you ask me a question I forgot what your question was I wanted
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.360]  to take that as well no I mean that's basically I mean that's basically it I've
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.760]  suddenly in the last two months seen a whole bunch more than 10 mainly British
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.480]  but some US newspapers just slip it in oh is Indonesian friends remembering
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.240]  he's Barry sitaro so they're really starting to just quietly let it out yeah
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.160]  absolutely and thinking that perhaps in doing so that the American people will
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.040]  become accustomed to it and we would be willing to move on now the other thing
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.080]  is that a number of people are again stating that you just cannot remove a
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.720]  sitting president without especially the alleged first African-American one
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.880]  without having a major uprising in America that's not true it just isn't
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:49.280]  true at all but they are leaking information trying to I'm convinced that
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.160]  the effect of this trial and other events as well forcing them to try to
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.000]  destroy the information that I have that's why I'm very current about what
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.040]  I think let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Illinois you're on the air Tony
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:07.280]  hello oh man thank you pastor man thank you so much for doing this I'm so proud
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.840]  of you doing this I wear my brace of Taurus shirt today in pride walking
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.120]  downtown Chicago people looking at me and everything but my question is what do
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.520]  you plan to do if this if he is found guilty do you plan to get him in his
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.200]  party kicked out of the White House everybody that's been part of it yeah
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.320]  how will you enforce this because the government's gonna I understand your
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:30.120]  10th Amendment argument and it certainly holds quite a bit of weight if other
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:33.240]  remedies have been ignored it reverts to the people under the 9th and 10th
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:36.600]  Amendment but I mean obviously they're gonna ignore this and they're gonna try
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.160]  to ignore it in the media we can get it out in the media then it becomes more
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.640]  dangerous for them but I mean let's say you do that you know the jury does say
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:50.400]  you know he's found guilty what happens the 10th Amendment you're right
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.960]  does hold quite a bit of weight in this matter but Alex we're out to see you
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:59.760]  committing a crime murder there were any crime for that matter and I reported you
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.360]  to the authorities and the authorities took no action you'd have to wonder what's
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.480]  going on in our nation we're going to demonstrate at this trial we're gonna
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.800]  have people testifying the crimes that were committed we're gonna demonstrate
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.280]  documented that crime did take place and we're gonna present this information to
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.040]  the government and they would have to take some sort of action but the other
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:26.880]  thing I think is critical is that if we get boots on the ground the more people
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.880]  we can't we have come to witness this trial over a period of seven days the
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:37.280]  the more we'll have in terms of leverage to force the media to begin to deal with
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.440]  it I think just having a bunch of white folk marching through Harlem I don't
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.720]  give you only got 500 is gonna call the media to want to come up and find out
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:49.200]  what's going on but having said that you know if I come if I see you
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.080]  committing a trial crime Alex I report you you're going to jail
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:59.400]  absolutely okay Tony I appreciate your call and I'm glad you got the Barry
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.280]  Sitaro shirts that we sell that supports us financially but more importantly
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.160]  people will come up and ask you what it means I mean if you had folks Tony now
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:12.840]  if you're still there come to you and say why does that say Barry Sitaro no
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.560]  they were just looking at me I'm a ballhead Latino so a lot of people were
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.920]  just like looking at me but you know what I don't care it gets the point across
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.600]  I went to a home they have a Wall Street mate a Wall Street versus Main Street
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.760]  Rally today I went there a lot of people are looking at me over there but they
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.400]  were kind of understanding no they didn't ask me questions I would have told
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.000]  them Barry Sitaro is the reason why there really are no jobs the bailed the
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.280]  banks bailed him out they walked past the Federal Reserve and they were they
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.800]  were off screaming no the banks got bailed out we got sold out but they
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.880]  don't know that Barry Sitaro took part of that well that's what's sick about it
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.680]  he's totally owned by these people and he's proposing now this new banking
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.800]  regulation that gives them more power and blank fine the king rat is running
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.760]  around saying he's for this legislation that should be everything we need to
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:01.760]  know I appreciate your call Tony very exciting let's go to Damien in Missouri
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.560]  you're on the air go ahead Damien thanks a lot Alex I appreciate you having the
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:13.640]  pastor on today you've had first of all this um it's been a lot of rumors about
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.200]  Obama being a homosexual you know I kind of wanted to get the pastor's thoughts
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:27.760]  on that and you know as well as Michelle Obama being like a front for him
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.840]  and I'm gonna hang up and listen thanks a lot guys okay appreciate the call well
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.160]  if he's not gay then they I mean he's in the minority in Washington that just
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:47.480]  seems to be the way it goes but I mean my take on this is that I find it highly
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:55.920]  unusual for someone as striking as tall well-spoken and suave as Obama for him
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:02.560]  not to have some other woman to encounter dating other than Michelle the
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.960]  despot for Obama cannot I cannot believe that he could spend his entire life and
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.880]  only one woman has come forward or one woman that we know about exactly I mean
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.680]  I mean I'm not as good-looking as Obama I mean I'm just average-looking and I
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:25.560]  mean I've had a shameful amount of girlfriends quite frankly I have no
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.240]  comment though but I mean seriously that's another good point everybody
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.840]  around him is quiet no one talks about what he did earlier in his life and where
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:36.920]  are the other women well what we do have we do have some people stating that they
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:40.000]  were involved in almost actual relationship with them one being Larry
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.240]  Sinclair of course and if you have ever seen the pitch of him and Sadiki sitting
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.800]  on that couch that is a very unnatural position for two men to be in unless they
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:56.040]  are gay and now this young fellow Reed Reggie Love 21 year old who is now
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.000]  Obama's very special assistant carries this cigarette form shoots hoops with
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.280]  him in the gym you gotta wonder what on earth is going on here with this man
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:13.880]  maybe he's Batman's Robin I think so I think he's I think they're lovers in
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:19.040]  fact I think most people know that as Obama by the way the outing of
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.640]  information as you might remember Anderson Cooper was one who outed the
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.640]  information or at least allowed Obama to leak the information that he was still
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:30.680]  smoking cigarettes because I mean he's smoking cigarettes in the White House
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.800]  there's no way he could continue to hide that Anderson Cooper did an interview
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:38.680]  which allowed Obama to gently break the information that he's trying it's best
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:45.840]  to not to not smoke but sometimes he falls off the wagon I see the same thing
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.480]  happening now regarding this Barrett tutorial issue that there's no way he
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.840]  can defend and this trial Alex will demonstrate if nothing more that this
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.400]  man is not a natural born citizen there's no way the evidence has never
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.840]  been presented at a trial there have been documents presented to the US
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.960]  Supreme Court they've been rejected and so there therefore no evidence has been
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.920]  able no trial has been had this will demonstrate this man is not a US citizen
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:17.160]  the American people would then know it well I tell you Reverend I appreciate
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.880]  spending this time with us today and I'll certainly try to get some reports as
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:25.760]  we build up towards the citizen trial that you're having and regardless it'll
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:29.600]  certainly bring out these issues and we appreciate your courage because love him
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.840]  or hate him and I happen to like him he's got a lot of courage
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.040]  othla.org is the website we'll talk to you again soon Reverend Manning God bless
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.960]  you thank you so very much God bless you God speed all right ladies and gentlemen
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.600]  more and more people standing up and speaking out they can't silence us all
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:55.800]  and you know will Obama be outed like the senator was Lindsey Graham who now
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.320]  has torpedoed the whole globalist agenda
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.680]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:08.400]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:11.960]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:15.720]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.600]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and

[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:34.520]  give you a account of what happened to her over the weekend the TSA horrors the
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.560]  good news is I'm gonna cover this more after she leaves us Merkel abandons
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:45.640]  aim of binding climate agreement that's their spiegel we also have France
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:49.240]  abandoning it that we have out of Australia they've announced they're
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.240]  abandoning it now they're gonna come back by stealth at the local level which
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.440]  they've already taken over the city I live in it's just I love Austin so much
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:01.960]  it's just inhabited and run by criminals the highest levels so we're gonna be
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.160]  breaking that down but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up briefly because Ted
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.040]  Anderson bought gold back when it was a thousand fifty a thousand sixty I haven't
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:16.160]  even asked him today what he's got left at that price if any but now it's at a
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  thousand one hundred and seventy plus today so it's up over a hundred and
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.880]  twenty dollars from the level that he bought in big time that's what Ted does
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:28.360]  and he can't always offer these but he's been able to the last few months
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:33.120]  where he buys gold when it's low and sells it when it's high at the old low
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:37.640]  price and that's how he beats all his competition we're free market people
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:41.320]  here and also supports the broadcast but I will tell you the markup on these
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:44.880]  coins say these fifth of an ounces I've seen it it's three to five dollars it's
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  it's ridiculous it's a lost leader and you can't beat the deals and I wanted to
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:53.400]  bring Ted up talk about what's happening in the economy because people need to
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.440]  move and my opinion is what I've done assets out of paper into gold and silver
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:03.040]  that you hold and now is the time with all this data news coming out red
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:07.440]  handed with JP Morgan Chase suppressing the price of gold worldwide and they
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.880]  can't do it forever you see it creeping up kind of a managed retreat Ted
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:16.360]  Anderson yeah yeah you're describing that real well that's what gold is doing
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.720]  it's just sort of etching its way back upward again right now at eleven hundred
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:23.960]  and seventy three dollars an ounce it's seen as high as eleven hundred and seventy
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:29.840]  five today and I think Bill is right about the price hitting up into that
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:35.680]  three thousand dollar range a lot of a lot of economists are saying that we'll
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.880]  see over two to three thousand dollars an ounce before the end of this year but
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:43.600]  nonetheless whether if it happens or not gold is creeping upward I've been
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.840]  holding the Franks down in price and I still have them there at two hundred and
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:52.040]  forty nine sixty eight now Alex those price the Franks have gone up eleven
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.640]  dollars since I bought in at that particular price which puts it at fifty
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.960]  five dollars an ounce higher if you're gonna buy it at the current market level
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.000]  so that's a really good buy and then when you compound that with the fact if
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.720]  you just buy one of them I'm gonna give you a full year subscription to the
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:12.440]  international forecaster which is a hundred and fifty nine dollars right
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:18.480]  there it you know that that is just a spectacular buy and I really think people
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:21.800]  need to be getting into the gold and silver especially now you can see what's
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:25.360]  going on I mean crying a lot Obama's getting out there and he's talking about
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:29.680]  how we have to be fiscally responsible here in our country and he's the biggest
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.160]  spendthrift there ever was since we've ever had a president and the debt is
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.240]  just going through the roof the value the dollar is gonna reflect that and now
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:41.960]  they're saying they're gonna take the pension funds and bail out the banks
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:47.320]  again I mean the dollar world currencies are all being devalued basically in a
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:51.840]  concerted effort as a hidden tax and people need to move into silver and gold
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:55.280]  what are some of the other special offers you have on silver and gold Ted well
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.600]  right now we also have we I'm still carrying the walking liberty half at
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.440]  924 which is less than ten dollars that's going to be shooting up above that
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:08.640]  level and then in the gold market we have the British sovereigns currently
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:13.000]  right now there are three twenty four forty three I have a pretty good supply
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.320]  of us eagles if that's what interests you I know that we have you know some gold
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.680]  buyers well Alex Jones since you see you get the lower price or you will pay
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:30.680]  more and still our price is still a great deal 800 686 2 to 3 7 800 686 2 to 3 7

[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.480]  looks like a false flag we can't prove it we can prove the underwear bomber was
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:27.720]  an inside job but I wanted to go back to Ted Anderson here for just a minute for
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:30.840]  those that just joined us Ted Anderson is the owner of the Genesis Network he
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:36.080]  also owns Midas Resources and I only promote sponsors I believe in and you
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.960]  know a lot of these gold companies haven't been around but for a few months
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:42.720]  or maybe a year Ted's been in the golden silver business for 31 years he's had
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.440]  Midas Resources for what is it 12 or 13 and he's got a triple A rating with a
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:52.200]  better business Bureau folks there's not many gold outfits that have that because
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.640]  you know even if they're a good outfit people complain no he has a triple A
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.880]  rating I don't know of anybody else that has that triple a better business
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.320]  Bureau rating and when I'm telling you that I buy my silver and gold few silver
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:09.920]  coins here a gold coin there that over the years I bought quite a bit of gold
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:14.520]  and silver as an emergency backup and I don't buy it as an investment you know
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:19.480]  when gold went up to 1200 plus dollars an ounce or almost up to $1300 an ounce I
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:25.800]  didn't sell gold I bought it $800 I didn't sell gold I bought it $270 I
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:30.040]  didn't sell gold I bought it $500 I didn't sell silver you know that I bought
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:35.120]  it $5 $6 an ounce when you know almost hit $20 an ounce I just keep it as an
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.720]  emergency backup and of course it's not silver bullet it's not bullet proof but
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:44.880]  it's the closest to a silver bullet that you're gonna get and so I just wanted
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:49.920]  to have Ted back briefly here to again tell folks about that gold offer one
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:53.600]  more time and explain to him with the fifth of an ounce Frank coin what you're
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.120]  basically getting gold at $500 an ounce with that deal you really are if you
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:03.400]  consider the discount of the subscription I mean Bob Chapin writes a
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.640]  really good newsletter he does charge a hundred and fifty nine dollars a year I
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:12.000]  need to say that's probably one of the lowest price annual subscriptions to the
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.120]  newsletters out there and the information I mean it's 40 to 60 pages he
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:24.920]  emails it twice a week and it's I think it's important information to have so
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:31.440]  when you factor that in off the 249 68 which right now is you know it it's the
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:37.880]  260 range now for the same coin it's quite the discount it's really a good
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:43.120]  value and I really think that people need to have fractional gold coins I mean
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:46.600]  it's gonna get down to the point where if you need to buy a loaf of bread and
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:50.440]  some gasoline and whatever else other staples that you need and the value of
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:54.960]  the currency has fallen through the floor a fifth of an ounce of gold is
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:59.440]  gonna mean an awful lot to you even if it's only one that you you can buy at
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.240]  least this gives you the opportunity to buy one and also get a full year
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:08.280]  subscription and it gets you down actually below that $500 an ounce and
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:12.880]  you'd have to go clean back more than ten years to be able to buy gold at the
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:21.280]  same level well folks the toll-free number to call and to take advantage of
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:28.640]  this offer is 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 and again if you want to take
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:32.880]  advantage of this super deal Ted's been offering these discounts I don't know
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:37.280]  how much longer they can last Ted's had this going for quite a while when are
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.120]  you gonna have to raise prices Ted well I mean that I have a few francs left in
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:44.640]  storage so I'll be holding it for a little while but I again it's just a
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.760]  matter of when people buy in and when they when I run out of supply prices
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:57.080]  will go up so 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 get involved the day folks thank you

[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:09.760]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:19.480]  you've all seen it on the news the it's slave train the naked body scanners
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:25.280]  recording your genitals and by the way I'm going to announce the winners tomorrow
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:28.640]  I always get behind on these contests because there's scores of videos to
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:32.000]  watch but I've got to narrow down to just a few I will announce tomorrow
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  absolutely the winners of the naked body contest video that's now educating so
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.840]  many people out there the TSA knows it's an act of submission now they have
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:47.000]  mobile trucks they want we've played the homeland security videos we're outside
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.400]  sports stadiums or events they're gonna make you go through these naked body
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.560]  scanners but you've seen it on the news where they get women and men but
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:00.160]  especially women and the the TSA guards take their hands and go around the
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:08.160]  women's breast and Paul Watson in England talked about his girlfriend and
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:14.160]  I talked to her on the phone she said it's very painful and but imagine having
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:20.400]  people squeezing your breasts putting their hands between your legs doing all
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:25.600]  of this but what happened with Christine Ebersol is that she said no you're not
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:28.600]  going to touch my breast because you know there's a little piece of metal in
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:32.760]  her bra and so they let her on through but then basically sent a SWAT team after
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.560]  as an act of submission Christine Ebersol Christine Ebersol.com is an
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:42.160]  American actress and singer she's been a veteran of television film and Broadway
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:46.640]  for a number of years she started a number of television programs including
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.960]  Saturday Night Live, One Life to Live, Will and Grace, Shoot Me, Just Shoot Me and
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:56.520]  Murphy Brown and she found considerable success also appearing in
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:03.200]  Oklahoma Camelot dinner at eight steel magnolias 42nd Street which she won the
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.600]  Tony Award for best leading actress in a musical and I've gotten a chance to
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:14.680]  know her she's a 9-11 skeptic a 9-11 truther somebody that has a lot of
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:19.840]  courage and I've had a chance to you know march with her in Lower Manhattan and
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:22.880]  had a chance to go out with her and her husband for dinner she's a great lady and
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:29.800]  again we appreciate her coming on with us she called me I guess it was Saturday
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.720]  somewhat agitated but still controlled saying she was on the plane that she
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:40.400]  just basically been SWAT teamed at the airport and again this is psychological
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:44.160]  conditioning to then have these type of activities on the streets they now have
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:48.640]  federal grants for police to take blood without warrants all over the country in
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:52.680]  many states this is happening and it's just really getting into our comfort
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.880]  zones really getting into our space doing things that are more authoritarian
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.400]  you know the Nazis stopped you at checkpoints and asked for papers well
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.200]  now they want your blood now they want to scan your body the British
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.560]  government admits and our government admits these body scanners violate child
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:11.160]  porn laws but they don't care Christine Ebersole thanks for joining us thanks
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:16.000]  for having me Alex I really think this is a important story it's just to let
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.720]  people know that we have rights as sovereign human beings and I think I
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:24.680]  was exercising them on that Sunday in Burbank Airport but I just wanted to
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:28.880]  share with you just kind of a straight up about what happened you know I've been
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:32.600]  traveling a lot because I'm a singer and I've been doing concerts around the
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:39.880]  country and I first became concerned you know at that staged underwear bomber
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:43.720]  Christmas pageant as I call it you know which allowed them to put in the
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:47.760]  scanners in Chicago and I was very worried about that because I thought I'm
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.520]  not going to go through the scanners I'm not going to subject myself to the
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:56.280]  radiation and let alone that it's a violation of my privacy so I did stop
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.440]  through Chicago and I was kind of had spent some sleepless nights rehearsing
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:04.560]  what I was going to say but I was able to circumvent that because I you know
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:08.920]  because they make it random and they do these random sort of drills and they
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:11.920]  just keep you off balance so you never know what's going to hit you or what
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.840]  time or when but at this particular case I was able to circumvent it and you know
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:22.160]  go through a place that was not a scanner and naked body scanner however
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.480]  when I did go through the metal detector and didn't put off any alarms in
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:30.280]  Chicago they patted me down they said I have to pat you down and I never said
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:33.640]  anything you know because you're always surprised when it's a new experience you
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.800]  don't really have the wherewithal to say the things that you want to say but
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.760]  afterwards I just felt this sort of toxic residue and felt ashamed and felt
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:45.200]  embarrassed and humiliated and it stayed with me for a long time and then the
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.480]  second time that it happened when I traveled again and I had gone to the
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:53.320]  metal detectors and was nothing made no sound but then it's always in my case
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:58.440]  when a female guard is it's almost like the prison you know the female prison
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:03.760]  guard you know that wants to just show dominance whenever it's a female I don't
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.000]  really get it when it when it's going through when there's men behind the yeah
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.480]  this is a prisoner I mean we're all being trained people who'd never be inside
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:16.040]  of jail to to to go through a prison frisking procedure yeah so it's usually
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.760]  it's always the women that pick me out randomly and say you have to be patted
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:23.400]  down so then the second time it happened I said why why are you patting me down
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:27.640]  it's random so then I let her do it again and again I felt this like toxic
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:31.440]  residue just fell and it felt which again sets the precedent that we all
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:36.120]  randomly are searched getting rid of the fourth and fifth amendment exactly so
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:41.360]  what happened was I kind of forgot about it and I did a concert in Northridge on
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:44.840]  Saturday night and Sunday morning I was flying to San Francisco so I went through
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:48.880]  the Burbank Airport so my flight was around 9 30 I get to the airport around
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:52.200]  8 15 and one of the first things that happened was when I'm putting on my
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:56.240]  shoes you know to put them in the security bin all of a sudden somebody
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:59.880]  from Homeland Security starts shouting I don't know what they're saying because
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:03.800]  you know it's all new and it's just sort of chaotic and everybody's ordered to
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:10.080]  freeze in their spot whatever they're doing freeze and then sometimes goes by
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.280]  and then you're able to continue what you're doing and again this is so
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:17.240]  Orwellian they're just adding more and more controls more and more harassment
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.080]  and they do this with the school kids in these drills now too training us how
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:25.040]  to be prisoners exactly so I asked one of the guards I said what was that about
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.280]  he says it's just a drill man in case something happened so then after I take
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.000]  you know my shoes off and everything and I go through and I'm not wearing any
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.760]  jewelry nothing I don't set off any alarms oh there's a woman guard on the
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:40.440]  other side she says you have to go behind right behind the metal detector is
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:44.000]  sort of a glass room where everybody can see what you're getting as part of the
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.680]  public humiliation training you to just put up with anything so which she takes
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:52.680]  me back into the classroom and she says I have to pat you down I said I don't want
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:57.040]  to be patted down so that kind of surprised them a little bit I said you
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:03.480]  can use the wand but I don't want you to touch me so they kind of ignored it a
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:07.040]  little bit you know because they were which is a basic human right to not be
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:12.480]  touched I mean again they're just there I mean they're blowing past all these
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:15.880]  boundaries and I know I keep interrupting I just want to point out how each part of
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:20.400]  this has been psychologically designed to humiliate you and break your will go
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.440]  ahead exactly so I said you can use the wand so she has me first of all sit down
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.000]  and look at the bottom of my feet to make sure there's no bomb making material
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.920]  on my bare feet and then I'm supposed to spread my legs and stand on on the image
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.480]  of feet on the floor and so at this certain distance you know if I'm
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:45.600]  spreading my legs and she says if the wand goes off I'm going to have to
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:52.320]  touch the spot where the wand you know makes the noise so my the bra that I
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:57.360]  was wearing has wire in it and you know metal there's little metal things in the
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:03.840]  strap so she gets to the point where it's underneath my breast and she the
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:11.040]  alarm goes off and you know rather than touching me there I lifted my shirt and
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:15.920]  showed her my bra I said this is my bra and you see the wire underneath that
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:20.200]  that's what's making the sound this is in lieu of having her touch me there
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:24.000]  because I instructed I did not want her to touch me and again here you are this
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.720]  evil guilty person for having tiny little clips in your bra and and and you're
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:34.600]  now the prisoner in having to go through this this is the new American way so
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:39.360]  because I lifted my bra in this glass area I mean I lifted my shirt and
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:45.120]  showed my bra with which everyone could see I didn't mind you know you wear you
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:48.960]  wear that in the summertime when you're at the beach so I said but I don't want
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.160]  her to touch me so I showed the bra and that that's when the supervisor came in
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.760]  or what I assume was the supervisor and she said we're having a problem here I
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:02.920]  said no there's no problem she we having a problem here slave uh-huh yeah and it
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:06.520]  was with the slight you know of course the attitude and basically want to lecture
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:10.880]  me that I'm I'm causing trouble because I'm impeding the security measures because
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:15.320]  and she went on to explain again if there it was any sound she'd have to
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:23.160]  touch that but I said well ma'am I answer to a higher authority and I am a
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.160]  sovereign human being which means I am the supreme authority over my body and
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:33.080]  I have a right as a sovereign human being to ask you not to touch me I'm not a
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:38.480]  criminal I haven't been accused of a crime are you suspecting me of something
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:42.600]  are you looking for something we're looking she said we're looking for bra
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:48.720]  bombs you see now they've moved from the from the shoe to the underwear and now
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:54.480]  to the bra and it's an interesting it's interesting how now they're going to
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:18:01.200]  the traditionally in tribal you know law the more vulnerable group the women
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.240]  who bear the children that are there for the tribe to protect and let's
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:09.280]  remember we've proven the shoe bomber was staged it's been conclusively proven
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:14.560]  that the underwear bomber was staged all of this is staged and now they admit
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:19.200]  homeland security is for the American people it was never for the cave people
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:24.120]  well after she gave me the lecture and she said you know the reason why I was
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.040]  profiled was because I was wearing loose clothing and I went you know and I took
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:31.920]  a no I took off all the loose clothing so that you could just see a t-shirt that
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:35.840]  was sort of tight fitting and I lifted up my pants legs and I showed her my
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:39.760]  bare legs which also upset her she did not want me to do that because in that
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:44.440]  means that she couldn't touch my body you see so then I said is it everything
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.240]  okay am I free to go now are you satisfied that you haven't you know that
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:51.200]  I'm not a bomber I'm not a terrorist that are you satisfied that you haven't
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:55.240]  been able to find anything and she said yes but she basically said I would
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:59.000]  suggest you don't fly anymore because flying is a privilege and I can call the
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.080]  police and have them taking you off yeah they say owning a gun's a privilege
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:08.240]  traveling's a privilege everything's a privilege now and we pay all our taxes to
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.560]  the government and they turn all these minimum wage goons loose on us but then
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:17.200]  that's only the beginning of the story they were gonna make you submit they
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:22.280]  were gonna show everybody what happens to somebody that talks back to the
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:26.600]  warden in the prison because we're a prison planet and we're about to go to

[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:49.200]  now expanding this training our children how to be slaves and so you go on
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.200]  towards the gate what happens next you know we were early so I was sitting at
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:58.320]  the gate with my my musical director John Otto for about 45 minutes and they're
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:02.080]  just talking and I was kind of saying to you believe what just happened thinking
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:05.600]  that was the end of the story and then they announced that they're gonna begin
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:08.920]  boarding and I was on one of those short flights so you know how it is Alex
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:12.880]  whether you don't have a sign seating but they'll say you know you're in a 15
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.520]  to 18 so you kind of get in a line and there's three different lines so
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:20.480]  everybody was in line they announced that we're boarding we all get in line so
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:25.480]  everyone's facing the front like the front of a classroom all of a sudden
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.640]  there's about six security members they were different and they were different
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:35.880]  than the ones that had me at the security checkpoint they were they were
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:40.480]  different group and they said ma'am we need you to come over to me to come over
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:44.560]  here right now I've got to patch you down take me out of the group now I
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:48.360]  mind you everyone's waiting to get on the plane so I go to the front of the
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:50.520]  class and take to the front of the class because you know they caught me
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:55.760]  you know throwing spitballs so I'm at the front there and I said I don't
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:59.600]  understand what's going on we went through this at security ma'am it's
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:03.840]  random ma'am I need to patch you down right so another lie again this is
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:08.240]  supposedly random so they just congenital lying a culture of deceit
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.880]  yeah twice random I don't think so and that's what John said he goes what do
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:14.720]  you mean we went through that was random back at security it's not random now
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:20.200]  you're selecting her out they wouldn't answer him so I start to take I go to
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:23.640]  the front and I said I thought we already went through this I told you I
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:28.080]  don't want you to touch me and I start to take my coat off and I start to take
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:38.680]  my shirt off my outer shirt off and they're freaking out they didn't want
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.560]  me to take my coat off because then that would you know mess them up from you
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.920]  know they wouldn't know they've got to have the act of submission yeah I mean
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:50.080]  this is their great power and how many have been caught being pedophiles how
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:53.320]  many have been caught demanding women give them sex I mean this is their
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:58.160]  domination yeah so I continue to take my coat off I did wasn't listening to them
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:04.240]  and they were continuing to yell for the police and then I said I see is this
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:09.400]  because I said I didn't want you to touch me back at security so you're
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:14.480]  showing me who's boss now you're making an example of me man it's random I said
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:17.520]  are you having a problem with me no ma'am you've been a model passenger you've
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:22.360]  been a model passenger now put your arms out we got to patch you down so and
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:26.320]  everybody's watching it everybody's watching it so I mean I never raised my
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:29.880]  voice never did any of that I put my arms and I said I already told you I
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:34.520]  didn't want you to touch me and that they went ahead and they patted me up and
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:39.720]  down you know with a t-shirt on that's you know clinging to my body so and pants
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:43.760]  the bottom which I already showed them back at security I lifted up my pants
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:47.840]  like I showed my bare legs underneath but you know they want to show who's boss
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:52.280]  and then when I said am I am I the only one that's being picked up randomly no
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:54.360]  man we're waiting for you to get on the plane I get on the plane you want to get
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.400]  on the plane now you want to get on the plane you want to fly today want to fly
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:03.960]  today so that that was the deal there but of course I wasn't you see those they
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:08.800]  wait until the everyone's boarding and I've got a concert I got a you know I
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:13.640]  gotta make money I have a family to support and so I'm not going to jeopardize
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:19.600]  that no it's all been psychologically figured out to make you submit now now
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:24.400]  you described this to me a SWAT team like yeah well it was because they had
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:28.440]  like some guy I mean I didn't see any guns but I'm just saying like metaphorically
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:31.480]  a SWAT team because like they all there's like six or seven people they're sending
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:36.720]  on me all these security guards and they probably all had a conference with
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:39.840]  you know with each other at because they were pissed off because I said I don't
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:44.200]  want you to touch me so they said hey you know let's go after her and make her
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:49.000]  an example and show her who's boss I've seen countless YouTube videos of local
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.760]  news of TSA going crazy have you seen the one where the military vet in his
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:59.560]  uniform they want to search him they want to humiliate him so when he just
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:03.960]  talks back they beat him up and then charge him with assaulting him or the
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:08.800]  new thing is making people who can't walk get up and if a person won't get out
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.880]  of a wheelchair they just tell you that you're not gonna fly so it's now they
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:16.800]  make people get out of their wheelchairs who can't walk and so families
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:20.960]  try to hold them up and then they get screamed at I mean I don't want to fly
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:26.040]  through George W. Bush or George HW Bush Airport in Houston because I've flown
[02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:31.240]  through it three times and once internationally and they're just
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:34.920]  screaming at everyone yelling it's it's like Planet of the Apes we're like
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:39.280]  running and then in the TSA screaming and yelling and people are freaked out
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:42.160]  they're screaming at old women on crutches and just foaming at the mouth

[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:38.840]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:42.880]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so it's

[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:11.280]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:15.080]  than silver or gold it's true seeds and all perform even gold and silver before
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:18.920]  in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:22.480]  and solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:28.000]  seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of

[02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:10.960]  all right I'm gonna get into the global carbon tax collapsing at the national
[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:15.240]  and international level but not at the local level we're winning battles but
[02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:22.280]  not the war yet but we're well on our way to exposing that fraud I've got some
[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:28.520]  other false flag terror news I want to go over and your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:33.960]  so Christine Ebersole you know you've told the story of what happened to you
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:38.280]  this has happened to countless other fliers I've been screamed at I've had
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:42.440]  them pull out our Sony cameras that a five-year-old can tell what it is a
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:46.880]  three-year-old probably could some two-year-olds could tell and say what
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:52.920]  is this it's a camera I said what is this and I have you know had them pull
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:57.200]  out a little shampoo bottle that even follows their specs in Billings
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:00.960]  Montana and start screaming at me getting off on it and it seems to be
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:05.160]  certain airports you go through some they're really nice it's not very
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:09.400]  oppressive you go through others it's worse let's be specific what airport did
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:13.920]  this happen to you in and have you seen that it's worse than certain airports
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:20.280]  well of course Chicago because that's you know really a central area for flying
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:24.120]  international flying I think the most flights go out of there but this was in
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:32.840]  Burbank Bob Hope Burbank Airport in California in Burbank California well I
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:37.120]  think really Alex what I've noticed is just happening happening incrementally
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:42.240]  it's like the Jews you know didn't start out at the camp they start out with the
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:48.000]  star then they can't go out after six then they're in the ghetto and then you
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.640]  know it finally leave your name on the luggage at the platform we'll get it to
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:53.920]  you but it doesn't happen it's that what you were discussing earlier it's the
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.880]  incremental that's happening and I noticed that they stop using the wands
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:02.520]  and then they start using the pat down this is like something that's been kind
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:06.920]  of recent for me anyway well think about what a big deal this is naked body
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:12.120]  scanners putting their hands on you asking you questions and it only gets
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:15.520]  worse and worse and worse and it's training them it's training the
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:21.000]  government employees that all of this is acceptable and and again it's all
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.800]  being done by design where do you see this is headed because we know that well
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:32.560]  I think really what the hope is is to sort of view this experience as nonviolent
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:37.600]  resistance and and you know like Rosa Parks didn't give up her seat you know
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:40.800]  don't you don't give up your seat at the lunch counter know your rights know
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:46.320]  that we are because the mere fact that we were created and that we live on this
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:51.400]  earth gives us rights and we are sovereign human beings and know your
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:55.320]  rights and you that's what we teach our children isn't it we teach our children
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:00.680]  listen don't let any strangers touch you you know this is your body and you're
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:04.520]  you need to protect it and you speak out does that change when you become an
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:08.560]  adult and then all of a sudden you submit yourself it's okay to teach your
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:12.200]  children but not for yourself you don't have to protect yourself so you see
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:17.080]  that's the thing is it you know that we don't understand how powerful we are as
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:22.200]  human beings we don't understand that and that's if everybody went to the
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:25.920]  airport and said I don't want you to touch me and I don't want I'm not going
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:30.320]  to the scanners the whole thing would collapse it's because we're in agreement
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:33.080]  with it because we think we don't have any rights I was talking to somebody in
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:37.720]  front of the line just be you know on my way back to California from San
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:41.720]  Francisco and she was making a joke about like you know she was ridiculous
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:44.320]  but she was making a joke about the scanners you know we'll all have to go
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:47.480]  to the scanners I said I'm not going to the scanners she said you know she
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:53.760]  looked at me like we're the choice I said you have a choice you are a sovereign
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:59.560]  human being you are the supreme authority over your body unless you're a
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:03.760]  convicted prisoner and they're treating us like convicted prisoners in the low
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:06.680]  level people don't even know what they're doing they're just as ignorant as
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:10.360]  the general public but the globalists know exactly what they're doing and this
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:16.680]  is a key part of their overall operation this is a drill or a boot camp
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:21.760]  training us that all of America and all of the world is basically a giant
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:27.000]  reeducation camp that's right so I think it's just a matter of practicing
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  nonviolent resistance and knowing knowing the rights of man it's that simple
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.400]  well I mean you know I don't really believe in the classic term karma but I
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:42.640]  do believe in you reap what you sow I can't imagine you know the bad mojo or
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:47.200]  whatever you want to call it of grabbing people's genitals rubbing people's
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.000]  breasts dominating people putting them through naked body scanners and how is
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:58.280]  Americans or as British this is global or as Europeans will you let them take
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:01.760]  your three-year-olds because now TSA has said just like England they are
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:05.200]  phasing it in it will be mandatory they're just quote acclimating the public
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:09.240]  I mean that's TSA's own words so we're now going to put our babies and body
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:13.840]  scanners that pound us with radiation now they're saying well women may have
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.760]  have people so in bombs inside their breasts so now we may have to have chest
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:25.400]  x-rays which nobody doubts our cause cancer I mean what what comes next we've
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:28.640]  got to do brain surgery before you can fly to make sure there's not a bomb
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.160]  inside your head if you need a colonoscopy you don't need to go to the
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:35.920]  doctor just go through it for security you know they don't find the terrorists
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:39.200]  they might get a couple of polyps you know I mean it's ridiculous so that's
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:42.800]  why we have to practice nonviolent resistance I mean there there's there's
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:46.920]  a way to beat it you know there's a way to at least combat it you know at least
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.040]  you know here's the thing the bottom line is after I stood up for myself and
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  they still you know touched my body I didn't have the same residual toxic
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:07.520]  effect because I stood up for something I believe in I didn't just lay down you
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:13.520]  fought back against the rape you didn't you didn't enjoy it no but I didn't I
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:20.640]  didn't stick I didn't submit woefully and you know and feel exactly I found that
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:23.760]  when I argue with the TSA when they get out of control and put them in their
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:28.260]  place sternly like I'm talking to my dog when it's been bad that I then feel
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:32.200]  good and they they feel bad but see they're getting a good feeling off their
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:36.960]  evil it's it's it's it's adding to the whole delusion that the terror threat is
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:41.360]  real and that it isn't staged for those that don't know it's now been in the
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.640]  Detroit news it's now been in other publications in congressional testimony
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:50.760]  we even have the video actually ought to play that the deputy head of the state
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:54.840]  department said we were ordered to let the underwear bomber on the plane and he
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:58.000]  was protected and the FBI for two months lied about that and had to admit
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.360]  later they were covering up I mean that whole thing was staged in 77 it was a
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.960]  drill using government passage and thought they were taking part in drill
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:09.520]  and again we're showing video right now off the main off the mainstream news
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:14.000]  where they put their hands under women's breast and go in circles and I've talked
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.080]  to again Paul Watson's girlfriend now many years and she says it's painful
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:25.360]  what they do in England she says they actually squeeze but why but then what
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  if you said no I won't do it what if what if hundreds of people said no hundreds
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:35.680]  of people said no well they are saying no and then 30 civil rights groups have
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:41.400]  sent letters to TSA and the Homeland Security but look it's not just that
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.560]  they're going to squeeze women's breast and grab men's generals and body scan
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:48.440]  your your your the naked image of your children your wife your husband they're
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:51.160]  going to take your pension funds they're going to raise your taxes they're doing
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:55.240]  it there I mean this is a criminal group and they're using psychology and
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:57.960]  they're on I mean now we told people a year and a half ago I'm not bragging it's
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:02.280]  sad that Goldman Sachs premeditatedly engineered this whole thing with the
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:07.440]  other top six banks and globally ten banks and they know what they've done
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:13.640]  and they might get a slap on the wrist now for robbing everyone well we are
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:19.800]  obviously in in the middle of a major major shift and if we look can look at
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:25.360]  it in sort of a spiritual sense that we are at the period of the rotting fruit
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:30.880]  right now and the weight of the rotting fruit it cannot stand on the tree and it
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:36.480]  will eventually fall and this this is the nature and the actual physical
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:42.880]  energy of secrets and lies they are finite and corporal like the body truth
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:48.880]  is infinite but underneath the rotting fruit lies the golden seed and if we can
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:54.240]  align ourselves with that seed and just try to just you know buckle up Betty and
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:59.200]  just kind of take the ride of this shift right now I think that we're going to
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:06.760]  come out in a golden age I really believe that and I think that's really the idea
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:12.520]  of standing in truth not being afraid of yourself being a spiritual warrior not
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:18.120]  being afraid to speak the truth and not being afraid of yourself that's another
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:22.160]  thing when we give away our power we think that we're worthless but it's not
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.360]  the darkness that we're afraid of it's the light it's the power of who we are
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:31.560]  in our being created in indivinity and that's what we need to just pay attention
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:40.080]  to well in alignment with that extremely heavy absolutely Veritas what
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:44.280]  you've said is the truth Christina Ebersol and who was it Martin Luther King
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:52.680]  that you like to quote that the universe is long but it bends toward justice so
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:57.840]  when we stand in truth we have the support of the universe and that's what
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:02.320]  this shift is about it's a shift in consciousness and people are waking up
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:06.920]  and waking up and being able to see like the matrix through through the false
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.960]  paradigm through the lies and now it's becoming it's happening in such rapid
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:15.520]  speed and now it's becoming so transparent the desperate act of those
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:20.400]  SWAT team coming after me we just showed their desperation it said nothing
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:27.920]  about me it showed everything about this yeah it's not about terrorism it's
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:32.600]  about domination it's about letting you know hey we're the boss
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:37.280]  well you guys it's as simple as the click of the heel folks click the
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:41.360]  both little heels you didn't know that you could get home to who you are that
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:46.160]  quickly you know because right now and it's a horse of a different color but
[02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:51.640]  you don't forget you got the movie and all you do is click them and you
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:57.560]  return to yourself and that's the most powerful thing we have well what is the
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:07.280]  movie ants the the cartoon the animated that's a great one and you've got the
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.240]  grasshoppers all sitting around there in a grain bin plenty of food and one of
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:16.640]  the the aid to camp to the head to evil grasshopper comes over and says we got
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:19.640]  plenty of food here why are we dominating and fighting with these ants
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:24.240]  and he goes those little puny ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:30.680]  they ever figure that out it's over for us that's right and I think we're
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:34.800]  starting to figure it out that's why it looks that's why everything is just so
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:44.040]  transparent everywhere you turn you know and that's why 9-eleven as the
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:48.240]  years go by people are starting to wake up to like wait a minute it's the
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:53.400]  Santa Claus conspiracy a big fat guy can't fit down a little pipe you know
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:45:06.920]  and you know he sees you when you sleep he knows when you're awake you know
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:10.000]  that they've been better good so go to sleep otherwise you don't get the
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:14.440]  presence you know meanwhile if you're awake perfect metaphor you see that mom
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.920]  and dad are arguing over the you know the bicycle they can't put together for
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:22.360]  you so that's the thing you just you know it's the Santa Claus conspiracy you
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:26.240]  know I've got great parents and they never instilled fairy tales in me but
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:31.280]  they when I was about three it's one of my earliest really clear memories there
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:37.040]  was the chimney in their little house on San Fernando way in in in Dallas Texas
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:42.160]  and it had the red bricks with the little spaces in between her the mortar
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:46.440]  and they were explaining Santa Claus comes down to the chimney like in
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:50.560]  between these bricks I remember being three years old and saying but he's big
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:54.520]  and fat this chimneys little bitty because it was a small house there's no
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:46:00.640]  ways coming down this and my dad said yeah it's just fine it's not really true
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:05.800]  but it's just like they were on the news saying we're gonna blow up building
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:10.880]  seven then they blew it up then they said you never saw that on the news
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:36.800]  well they blow all three of them up in front of everybody and then that day
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:39.440]  they're saying we're blowing it up there's cops saying get back we're
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:44.600]  blowing it up and and again that's the mind control the matrix those cops
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:47.560]  weren't involved in it they were just told we've talked to the cops there was
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:50.880]  a countdown they were told them for two hours before we're gonna blow it up the
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:54.600]  cops went you know they didn't think well how do you wire a building when it's
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:58.120]  on fire it takes weeks to do this right and then they blew it up perfectly in
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:01.400]  the cops were like get back they're blowing it up and then Silverstein comes
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:04.400]  out and says we blew it up people say well how did you blow it up he says well
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:08.960]  I didn't mean that and then we have a Fox News reporter go yeah no Silverstein was
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:13.280]  talking about blowing it up that day but that's he they supposedly debunk us
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:16.840]  by admitting they were talking about blowing it up but that they didn't blow
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:21.280]  it up Christine yeah of course not I mean that's this is what's so crazy of
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:23.600]  course they're gonna say that you know well that's why they're freaking out
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:44.480]  because exactly because because the rock of truth it's built on a rock and it never changes 2 plus 2 is always border it's never 85 I mean that's the perfect story you know did you ever watch the movie 1984 oh yes yeah so you remember like when John
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.040]  heard is in the Ministry of Love which is a torture chamber and Richard Burton's holding
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:52.080]  up four fingers he says how many fingers am I holding up he says four and he gets
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:56.040]  tortured the camera goes back it comes back up he says how he holds up four
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.880]  fingers he says how many fingers am I holding up he says I don't know he says
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:04.080]  that's better and that's that's the whole thing they just want to wear you down
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:08.720]  if you're terrified and tortured then you just don't want to be killed you know
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.960]  and that's what happened on that day it was a shock and awe of 9-11 everyone
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.040]  scared to death it's just you know I do believe in stokes I do I do I do just don't
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:20.880]  kill me you know me and and and here's the biggest tell not just all the
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:25.120]  evidence of the drills in the Northwoods and the PNAC documents and the
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:32.000]  hijacker train at US bases on and on and on forever and the lies about WMD's the
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.600]  biggest issue is within about 15 20 minutes I'm watching the channels live
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  I'm in the shower my wife girlfriend at the time wife now comes just get out get
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:45.240]  out something's happened and I come out and I'm sitting there telling off and
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:50.920]  one tower has been hit and I said this is terrorism and she said no it's
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.000]  probably just a plane I said no you watch is going to be terrorism then
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:00.960]  another one hits and then by the time the second one hit they were on every
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:05.040]  channel and I was I had two TVs on you know one in each room flipping back and
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:08.320]  forth and they were all saying the same thing it's a new world order you're
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:11.680]  gonna have to give your rights up we're gonna have to attack Iraq and it was all
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:15.360]  the same script and if you're in the media you understand the script I mean
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:19.200]  you're an actress you understand a script and you can do the same play in LA
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:25.120]  that you can do in in San Francisco or you can do in New York City you know on
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:29.500]  Broadway and then you know the script you're like oh that's Othello or that's
[02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:35.840]  Romeo and Juliet or you know that's whatever play it is I mean I'm watching
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:48.880]  them reading scripts yeah no exactly and it was an exact script on three
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:56.080]  different networks it's so transparent you see that's the way lies are you have
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:59.960]  to keep changing the story in order to keep it going you know with the truth
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:06.240]  you just have to tell it once it's so much easier you know well Mark Twain said if
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.560]  you tell the truth you never have to remember anything and that's what's so
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:13.940]  easy about my job I mean I don't know as I get facts and figures and numbers
[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:19.640]  backwards but it's it's it's it's rare in a four-hour show maybe once a day I'll
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:22.600]  you know listen back to the show and I'll hear it's something in exactly right
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:26.720]  and I'll come back and correct it but these guys are I mean it's like Fox News
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:29.800]  saying there was never a plan to blow up building seven and then now one of
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:33.240]  their senior people goes okay we were there they were talking about blowing it
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:37.840]  up and it's just incredible Christine ever saw thank you for standing up thank

[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:14.400]  wrestling tour I had to come through Washington DC and I had a similar
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:22.320]  experience to my fellow performer there I can't believe when I was listening to
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:27.120]  what she went through it's not like a typical criminal molestation I mean
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:32.200]  I couldn't believe what they put her through but they made me take my
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:37.320]  championship belt out of my bag because they said it was blocking the view of my
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:41.280]  carry-on so that was embarrassing I had to take my belt out in front of
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:45.960]  everybody and then after that I did everything they told me to do go into
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:50.800]  the scanners and then they wanted me to go into the full-body scanner at the
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:56.760]  customs after I scan my passport and my visa everything from Brazil and they
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.680]  wanted to get your biometric body scan what happened next well I refused I told
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.040]  him I was afraid of the radiation I didn't want to go through it I told
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:10.920]  him I felt that it was against my fourth and fifth amendment right and that I
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:14.840]  did have a lawyer and that if they wanted to give me a problem I said take a
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:19.640]  look at my belt I'm not a nobody I do have lawyers and so what happened well
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:24.840]  they basically asked me to step over behind it wasn't a room but it was like
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:29.560]  a glass I don't know it looked like a like one of the cubicles but it was see
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:34.160]  through glass and they basically wanted me down and then they wanted to pat me
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:37.960]  down and I said you know I'm not a criminal I'm not being suspected of
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:44.000]  anything you have checked my bags I've been very very cooperative you have no
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:49.720]  right to do this to me I don't want you touching me I then reiterated again but
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:54.320]  I do have legal representation and then what happened well they basically told
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:59.160]  me that I was allowed to go but then the TSA security he looked like a kid
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:05.320]  younger than me he was at least 21 years old 22 he took my suitcase and he threw
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:08.600]  it on the ground and broke it was a 70-pound suitcase have my laptop and
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:14.440]  all my belongings in it so now they smash your goods yeah and I tried to
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:17.360]  report it to a supervisor and a supervisor you know I love it when they
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:21.840]  they try to say sir sir sir like they're being polite but what they're
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:26.080]  really trying to do is just be you know like a polite way of saying you're gonna
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:30.760]  do whatever we want period or don't get excited sir don't get excited as they
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:34.920]  get in your face exactly and then they tried you know I'm in my my prime right
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:40.760]  now as a professional wrestler and as as the great Jesse the body Ventura I'm a
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:45.760]  pretty big guy myself so they try to they tend to try to flip the card on you

[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:05.520]  and they call other people over I said look you have no right to pick my

[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:15.720]  broke the the handle that folds out and it totally broke off the suitcase from

[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:07.880]  the air hey Alex I just wanted to tell you what a great witness you gave the
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:12.600]  other day when you had the the generate atheist comedian guy on and to hear the
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:18.840]  contrast between your approach to life versus his just it it really meant
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.240]  something when you heard it and and you can just see the difference in what it
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:27.280]  means to have a purposeful meaningful life and to just be dilly-dallying around
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:30.400]  and said oh I'm just having a great time and blah blah blah I mean Doug
[03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:33.720]  Standhope I don't think is a bad person and he's a talented guy at certain
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:37.640]  levels but it's you know just look at the bad in the world some people accuse me
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:41.080]  of being negative because I'm pointing out the bad no I'm going after the bad
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:46.960]  to protect this wonderland we live in a beauty and in this creation and and and
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:51.000]  hundreds of billions of galaxies spinning around us I mean it's every
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:55.320]  moment is just an absolute gift from the creator and then these people are like
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:59.360]  oh the world's horrible everybody's dumb you can't fix anything if we have that
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:05.040]  attitude we are going to lose our humanity and and everything we've got
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:09.160]  is because people believe they could build something better and it just makes
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:15.480]  me sick at my stomach to listen to it yeah and just it but it matters to hear
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:20.200]  the difference to have you and him talking at the same time and to be able
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:24.360]  to actively compare the difference between two people with entirely
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:31.480]  different views on on life was was very nice to hear and it was uplifting to
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:36.920]  hear that that you can just you can just see the difference the contrast was
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:41.120]  just amazing to see well my dad heard the interview he said basically the same
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:44.480]  thing and a lot of other people I talked to it's a very popular video up at the
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:47.720]  Alex Jones channel that hour-long interview that we did with Doug Stan
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:51.840]  Hope and Doug's really changed over the years I met him nine ten years ago and
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:03:01.160]  he is but that's really the spirit of the world I mean the attitude he has about
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:05.240]  everything is just so sad and I mean even if you don't believe in God or a
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.920]  creator of the universe I mean who made that the hundreds of billions of
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:12.800]  galaxies that Hubble has photographed hundreds of billions with with each
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:18.560]  galaxy having between tens of millions of stars tens of billions and tens of
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:21.560]  trillions they're all different sizes and combinations and to look at those
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:27.960]  giant gas clouds forming billions of stars you know inside galaxies and to see
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:32.680]  black holes and what is it where does it go where does it end you know what made
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:40.440]  it I mean what is reality I mean it's so unbelievable to be able to just to be
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:43.960]  conscious and to have this gift it makes you want to fall flat on my face to the
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:47.800]  creator I can feel the creator I can feel it the universe I know what good and
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:53.600]  evil is and and I just can't imagine people that just think humanity is a
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:56.440]  bunch of trash that's what the elite think they think we're all a bunch of
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:04:00.280]  trash and they want to kill us and I'm just I'm not for it I mean and then I'm
[03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:07.320]  the bad guy yeah exactly like that that to hear the that attitude you just hear
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:11.360]  the elite working through individuals like that just like they there it's
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:14.800]  coming out of their eyes and their mouths like the puppet master just
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:19.000]  saying here say this here say that here say this and it'll spread and and it's
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  an easy sale it's like they have our life force they sap our will to resist they
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:28.800]  sap our will to live they sap our will to procreate they sap our humanity
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:33.800]  he being humans means you love you fight you stand up against evil you have
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:37.800]  children you struggle to raise them right you struggle to keep them from
[03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:41.360]  falling to the world that's what that that's what makes us strong and the

[03:09:08.240 --> 03:09:11.960]  leaders all over the news hundreds of articles a day saying planetary
[03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:16.480]  government taxes paid to a world government run by banks at the top of
[03:09:16.480 --> 03:09:20.800]  that are JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs criminals at the top doesn't mean
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:24.120]  all their employees but the system committing all these crimes and they
[03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:28.680]  said we're gonna pay all these taxes and value-added taxes and VAT financial
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:32.960]  taxes will be paid to the IMF World Bank that has gotten a lot of trouble so now
[03:09:32.960 --> 03:09:37.520]  they're calling it world financial reform the exact same taxes and they'll
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:40.840]  come back with some new reason you know an anti-terror attacks a security tax
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.920]  but it's it's the same system global governance and that's been called for all
[03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:51.480]  week long by Obama by Gordon Brown and by others but the good news is some of
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:58.240]  the biggest stalwarts supporting this Germany France Australia and others in
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:06.240]  the last week have completely pulled out of it and I'm reading what Sarkozy said
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:10.240]  because in a parliamentary election he almost lost control of the country
[03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:15.520]  Merkel's in trouble because of this the Prime Minister of Australia is in
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:19.520]  trouble and they're saying in a concerted effort okay it's off the table for
[03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:25.920]  at least three years now they're they're waiting for our movement to expose them
[03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:30.320]  as criminals bringing in this carbon tax to control our entire economy and
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:34.640]  shut down our industrial base and that's the UN's own statements quote destroy
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:40.840]  an industrial society so they can control us but here is der spiegel today
[03:10:40.840 --> 03:10:46.760]  Copenhagen fallout Merkel abandons aim of binding climate agreement frustrated
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:49.920]  by the climate change conference in December German Chancellor Angela Merkel
[03:10:49.920 --> 03:10:54.000]  is quietly moving away from her goal of a binding agreement on limiting climate
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:11:01.480]  change and it continues here is a another article out of the National Post
[03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:05.400]  seeing seeing countries around the world back away from their climate change
[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:09.320]  commitments and seeing his own electoral support crumble Australian Prime
[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:13.080]  Minister Kevin Rudd announced today that Australia will be shelving its
[03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:16.560]  cap and trade program for at least three years until after the next election
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:19.400]  that will provide the Australian government at the time with a better
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:23.880]  position to assess the level of global action on climate change he told the
[03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:30.600]  Australian press so what's happening there is they're publicly backing off
[03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:37.120]  now Gordon Brown Obama they're not and Schwarzenegger isn't in the US they've
[03:11:37.120 --> 03:11:40.680]  still got it in the Senate Obama's is implemented two weeks ago the EPA is
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:46.440]  going after factories coal powered plants coal mines they're now outside of law
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:51.840]  just creating new fines and fees and expanding other regulatory fees against
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:57.400]  our industrial base remember China India Mexico and a hundred plus it's over a
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:02.600]  hundred and sixty plus nations are making zero cuts so our industry will
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:06.920]  just leave and go there and if the earth's one planet with one atmosphere
[03:12:06.920 --> 03:12:11.520]  and so you if you believe carbon dioxide so deadly that plants breathe that will
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:16.600]  only cause more of the devil gas that according to these people will eat the
[03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:20.480]  skin off your bones of course that is a true but it isn't true that polar bears
[03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:23.520]  are dying it isn't true the ice caps are melting they're getting bigger it just
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:26.960]  doesn't matter that they think the public are a bunch of morons and they're not
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:30.600]  morons they're just not focused on real issues we're gonna get them focused on
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:34.400]  real issues we're gonna slap them upside the head with an intellectual two by
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:38.000]  four that's what we're doing with the films and the radio show and the
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:42.840]  activists and we're not gonna stop so that is very exciting news the problem
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:48.480]  is Schwarzenegger in fact let's Google this for people right now on air let me
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:52.120]  try to call up for memory it's a memory game one of the exact headlines
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:13:01.400]  Schwarzenegger organizes council of governors and mayors to fight climate
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:08.840]  change and he said we're gonna go to the cities and counties and levy these
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:17.200]  taxes and California's now done it Austin was seized in a vote last week on
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:24.280]  Earth Day 2.6 billion in taxes on our power and on our gas and it's just all
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:29.640]  going to the banks and so it's gonna be a pinched guerrilla info war now where
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:33.040]  we're not fighting the big Death Star the UN at this point they've got their
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:36.640]  minions working for the banks at the local levels doing this is a guilt
[03:13:36.640 --> 03:13:41.960]  trip open the borders up or your racist oh you don't want to keep your wages oh
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:46.520]  Nathan Gatt is good or your racist oh carbon taxes are good or you want to
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:52.680]  kill the earth oh you can guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt but the good news is
[03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:59.360]  it's not working anymore and on the subject of what Arizona has done saying
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:03.040]  that and I've read the bill I've covered it here on air it does not say
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:06.880]  they're gonna set up checkpoints and arrest people with brown skin close to
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:13.360]  half of Arizona is Hispanic they're great Americans okay and they know what's
[03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:16.840]  going on that's why in Gallup polls all and some of them are over 80% most are
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:20.440]  in the low 70s of Hispanic Americans want to control the borders they don't
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:24.480]  buy the lie that well Hispanics don't don't want and you know they're not to
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:28.480]  be amnesty that's not even true that's like a mind control thing where
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:32.440]  everybody agrees man made global warming's real the science has settled
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:38.560]  no one disagrees well you know it's settled all Hispanics want open borders
[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:43.340]  yes they all want the country overrun with poor people that will bankrupt the
[03:14:43.340 --> 03:14:50.400]  welfare system and who will drive down the wages I mean there's six plus
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:54.440]  billion people who want to come to the United States there's 6.5 plus billion
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:58.760]  people there's 300 million here so there's 6.2 plus billion people that
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:01.760]  want to come here I mean have you been to a third-world country do you know
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:06.160]  what it's like believe me all you people that want open borders just go to
[03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:13.080]  Mexico City go to Mexico City and then come back I mean it's scary folks
[03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:19.080]  25 to 30 million people dust storms of human feces in the sky just absolute
[03:15:19.080 --> 03:15:23.240]  hell on earth the country is completely collapsing and I feel sorry for those
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:26.080]  poor people down there who are desperate for jobs who've been driven off their
[03:15:26.080 --> 03:15:31.400]  property by the UN biosphere movement oh yes they were promised they could move
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:34.920]  north and get Makillodora's jobs on the border almost all of those have been
[03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:39.720]  shut down over 90% because Mexico can't compete with China nothing can compete
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:44.720]  with the billion slaves so it's it's a it's a giant implosion and so
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:49.880]  Schwarzenegger says that he is now going to have the cities and the counties and
[03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:56.560]  the states do it as an act of treason the UN coming in to our country and
[03:15:56.560 --> 03:15:59.960]  circumventing the federal government because we're about to gain control the
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:06.320]  federal government now what we have here is something similar but it's done to
[03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:10.240]  defend the republic under the 9th and 10th amendment if the federal government
[03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:14.440]  won't carry out its duties it's left to the states to defend themselves and I
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:18.040]  agree with Andrew Napolitano that this is gonna get shot down in court what
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:22.400]  Arizona's done but at least because it is the feds per view that's one of the
[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:29.720]  few things they've got the jurisdiction on but the bigger issue here is is that
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:33.040]  under the I'm gonna ask the judge about this former federal judge coming up a
[03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:36.560]  real constitutionalist constitutional scholar what do you do though when the
[03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:40.480]  feds won't do their job so how do you respond to that representative wants
[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:46.720]  Arizona immigration law in Texas and this is out of NBC Dallas Republican
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:49.800]  Texas lawmaker plans to introduce a tough immigration measure similar to the
[03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:54.000]  new law in Arizona a move state Democrats say would be a mistake but at
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:57.840]  least this is showing people that the power is at the state level here's
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:02.240]  another one Arizona cities consider fighting immigration law sanctuary
[03:17:02.240 --> 03:17:07.560]  cities at least and now look the state is above the city the city is chartered
[03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:12.120]  by the state that's none of their stinking business and in the cities
[03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:16.160]  it's unconstitutional for them to go challenge at the federal level okay and
[03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:19.480]  there are a bunch of criminals when they do this it's questionable what the
[03:17:19.480 --> 03:17:22.600]  state's doing but if they're doing it out of necessity and that's in the
[03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:27.560]  Constitution the Bill of Rights that they have some precedent here this is
[03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:32.400]  out of control they have the cities of Arizona bucking the legislature that
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:36.920]  legislature is elected by the people that's your boss okay your city was
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:40.960]  chartered under the state legislature the state Constitution at least three
[03:17:40.960 --> 03:17:43.720]  Arizona cities are considering a lawsuit to block the new immigration
[03:17:43.720 --> 03:17:47.920]  enforcement bill the cities include Phoenix Tucson Flagstaff and it goes on
[03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:53.920]  there just absolutely disgusting continuing here's another headline out of
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:57.960]  NBC deport children to be legals and that's what a representative saying out
[03:17:57.960 --> 03:18:02.160]  there well I mean what do you do when the illegals come across and they have
[03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:06.120]  ads in the newspapers on both sides in California especially in Texas and it
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:09.600]  says they call anchor babies and they wait they'll even wait till their
[03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:13.560]  water breaks they'll rush across go into an emergency room it's all paid for by
[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:18.720]  taxpayer money and then immediately the whole family goes on welfare and we get
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:24.480]  to pay for it absolutely we need to change the laws where we deport these
[03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:29.000]  people I mean they need to be deported you can wait till they get me you can't
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:32.400]  turn away from the hospital but we're all paying for this this is why we're
[03:18:32.400 --> 03:18:35.880]  going bankrupt folks you want to lose your job you want to lose your country
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:40.840]  you want to go bankrupt and you want to be like Latin America I mean listen
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:44.520]  this is put up or shut up time the country is being butchered right now
[03:18:44.520 --> 03:18:48.680]  okay and the globalists are doing the same thing in Europe they're doing the
[03:18:48.680 --> 03:18:52.520]  same thing worldwide and they bring in outside groups to then be a voting block
[03:18:52.520 --> 03:19:00.280]  against the nation so absolutely we have to change that I mean does Mexico let
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:05.880]  you go down there and have a baby and get free healthcare I mean can I as a US
[03:19:05.880 --> 03:19:10.840]  citizen let's put the shoe on the other foot okay and walk a mile in our shoes
[03:19:10.840 --> 03:19:15.560]  Mexico can you go to Mexico and walk in and have your water break in a hospital
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:21.320]  and have them pay for everything no and then your baby gets Mexican citizenship
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:25.960]  and then you all get welfare no you will pay for it all if the police can find
[03:19:25.960 --> 03:19:29.920]  something you've done wrong they're gonna arrest you take your kid and suck a
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:33.360]  hundred grand out of your family in the US as extortion artist that's what's
[03:19:33.360 --> 03:19:38.120]  gonna happen in Mexico so oh Mexico always playing this guilt using the
[03:19:38.120 --> 03:19:42.680]  goodness of the American people to do this because what Wells Fargo takes
[03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:46.480]  about 30% of the money that's wired back down to Mexico billions of dollars a
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:50.600]  year it's all the big banks it's all about using the illegals using the
[03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:56.760]  citizens of America using us all or the globalist so no I can't I tell it to
[03:19:56.760 --> 03:20:00.920]  Mexico and have everything paid for the Mexican government
[03:20:00.920 --> 03:20:07.160]  you may be arrested and or subject to other police action tyranny is here the

[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:18.800]  a second amendment call to action for the citizens of the state of California
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:24.200]  right now is legal to open carry a firearm state of California and there's
[03:25:24.200 --> 03:25:28.040]  been a movement recently where people have been exercising this right and you
[03:25:28.040 --> 03:25:31.240]  know why they want to pass a law now because they were making everybody
[03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:35.880]  think guns were illegal with TV ads and PSAs but now everybody's open carrying
[03:25:35.880 --> 03:25:39.480]  and people are going what it's not illegal to own a gun yeah assembly
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:44.000]  member Soanda is sponsoring this bill actually in response to this movement
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:50.120]  it's assembly bill 1934 and and again why would the why would the illegal
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:54.120]  aliens supporting politicians and the illegal aliens why would they want to
[03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:57.880]  take the guns they can't own guns in Mexico why is always the pro-illegal
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:01.680]  alien groups that want our guns that's the number one reason I say shut it down
[03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:06.040]  and deport the illegals you're not getting my guns go ahead yeah but I'm
[03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:09.880]  going to pull it off topic from the illegal issue but I basically want to
[03:26:09.880 --> 03:26:13.160]  call on all the listeners in California to respectfully contact their assembly
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:18.720]  members and implore them to oppose this bill it's assembly bill 1934 if you need
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:22.920]  more information on this this bill or open carrying in California I'm going to
[03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:28.400]  ww dot California open carry dot org and if possible I was wondering if we can
[03:26:28.400 --> 03:26:33.320]  get the judges take on this type of legislation sure absolutely I appreciate
[03:26:33.320 --> 03:26:36.000]  your call yeah they're moving at the state level everywhere to get our gun
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:40.280]  and it's despicable and if they get a big enough illegal alien population
[03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:43.800]  voting they'll get our guns and they'll arm them as the police to take our guns
[03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:48.320]  that's the game plan Tim and Michigan you're on the air go ahead hey Alex
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:55.080]  hey buddy hey what's up man listen I you know I never got a really got a chance
[03:26:55.080 --> 03:26:59.520]  to literate on some of the stuff that we had talked about and I've talked to you
[03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:03.960]  a few times first off I'd like to thank you for invisible Empire and police
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:09.040]  stayed for I've watched both of them very informative that very well presented
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:14.440]  and I want to tell you about when we were talking about the mission be
[03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:19.960]  Michigan militia he talked to me a few weeks ago I wanted to tell you about a
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:27.720]  some woman named Anna who had been emailing somebody from the other
[03:27:27.720 --> 03:27:33.880]  Michigan militia to she was climbing down a creek with her 12-year-old son to
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:39.040]  escape the FBI because they were kicking down doors and taking people's
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:47.560]  children on the basis of that they were speaking anti-government state well
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:51.480]  wait a minute that happened in Williamson County they came and took Barry
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:56.960]  Cooper's son began they put on the CPS form because they were teaching their
[03:27:56.960 --> 03:28:00.400]  children that you can't trust the government I appreciate your call on the
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:03.920]  question of the Atari that's a whole other subject but it's now come out what
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:07.640]  I said before the raid and what I said after they had an FBI agent and an
[03:28:07.640 --> 03:28:12.920]  informant in there they provocateur they basically made it all up and now it's
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:18.160]  been confirmed the different my Michigan militia groups are the ones that call the
[03:28:18.160 --> 03:28:22.560]  FBI on Atari that's because those groups are full of feds that isn't
[03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:25.880]  criticizing the militia it's not criticizing the mission of the
[03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:32.160]  Michigan militia feds and fed-controlled dupes in those militias attack me when I
[03:28:32.160 --> 03:28:37.400]  picked out Atari in August of last year we're talking 10 a month ago or nine
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:41.840]  months ago months before this happened and I said that Atari looks like they're
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:46.880]  being set up and interviewed pale horse or aka sickles and I warned him that he
[03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:52.520]  was being set up if he wasn't a fed and so you know we've covered that we we've
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:57.400]  gone over it and I've warned militias anybody that starts calling for violence
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:02.640]  in your ranks 95% of the time they're a fed and you better rebuke them and expose
[03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:06.680]  them immediately or they are gonna set you up and then you notice the groups
[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:12.080]  that we build a straw man and say I'm criticizing the militia that's not what
[03:29:12.080 --> 03:29:16.400]  I've done that shows you who the feds are because they don't want me up here
[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:20.840]  warning people they want to be able to go and set up the militias and do this
[03:29:20.840 --> 03:29:24.760]  around the country and demonize the tea parties and the militia movement that
[03:29:24.760 --> 03:29:29.400]  Edwin Vieira and others have promoted for so long so I appreciate your call

[03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:22.640]  we are back live judge Andrew de Poletano is our guest for the rest of the
[03:33:22.640 --> 03:33:26.400]  hour rest of the broadcast want to say congratulations he's gonna be starting
[03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:31.840]  the next few months his show on the fox business TV network and that'll
[03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:34.720]  definitely get the highest ratings on that channel because he is a
[03:33:34.720 --> 03:33:38.640]  constitutionalist and I agree with judge Andrew de Poletano on almost every
[03:33:38.640 --> 03:33:42.440]  issue if I've never really found anything I disagree with him on but it
[03:33:42.440 --> 03:33:46.080]  caused quite a stir this week I'm sure most of you know about it we played a
[03:33:46.080 --> 03:33:52.040]  clip of it started the show earlier today where he said look the federal
[03:33:52.040 --> 03:33:55.400]  government's courts are gonna find this unconstitutional and that is one of the
[03:33:55.400 --> 03:34:00.160]  powers the federal government has one of the three powers and of course he's a
[03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:03.920]  former federal judge constitutional law scholar and you know he's saying that
[03:34:03.920 --> 03:34:07.440]  this is gonna turn off his spanics the Republican Party my issue is I've seen
[03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:10.840]  the Gallup polls as high as 80% of Hispanic Americans want to control the
[03:34:10.840 --> 03:34:14.000]  borders because they know it's driving down wages I mean there's a six plus
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:17.560]  billion people that want to come here and if we didn't have the big welfare
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:21.480]  system that would bankrupt us then I would be for the type of totally open
[03:34:21.480 --> 03:34:25.520]  immigration we had a hundred years ago but even a hundred years ago those
[03:34:25.520 --> 03:34:29.560]  numbers per capita are much smaller than they are now but here to talk about
[03:34:29.560 --> 03:34:32.640]  this out of the gates is judge Andrew de Poletano judge good to have you here
[03:34:32.640 --> 03:34:36.360]  with us it's always a pleasure now you can say that there isn't anything that
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:42.520]  we disagree on because that's the key is the social benefit welfare system we
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:46.920]  have here which draws good hard-working people but lazy people that want the
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:50.800]  government to take care of them cradle to grave in the break we were talking
[03:34:50.800 --> 03:34:54.920]  about how my grandparents came here I mean they came here they registered at
[03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:58.040]  Ellis Island they they got the vaccinations to make sure they didn't
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:01.400]  have any communicable diseases and that was it they didn't have to meet a quota
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:06.800]  they went to school they learned English they became productive members of
[03:35:06.800 --> 03:35:11.240]  society they didn't have to carry any ID they became citizens as children when
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:16.560]  their parents became citizens but that was before the dictatorship of Franklin
[03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:21.240]  Delano Roosevelt which of course established these changed the
[03:35:21.240 --> 03:35:26.560]  relationship of the federal government to individuals by taxing from a to give
[03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:31.280]  to be I always like to tell this story you knock it there's a knock on your
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:35.840]  door you open the door as a guy with a gun and the guy says give me your money
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:40.200]  I want to distribute it to other people I want to be charitable in your name you
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:44.760]  call the police you find out he is the police and that's basically what the
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:48.200]  government does you can't be charitable that the people's money you can only be
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:51.880]  charitable with your own but it forces us to give money away to people that we
[03:35:51.880 --> 03:35:54.480]  would choose not to give it away there's no authority for that in the
[03:35:54.480 --> 03:36:01.400]  Constitution FDR cowed the Supreme Court FDR used all kinds of political
[03:36:01.400 --> 03:36:06.120]  favors to get a Democratic Congress to start giving money away and every
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:10.040]  president since then even Ronald Reagan added to that the worst of course was
[03:36:10.040 --> 03:36:15.760]  was lbj as a result you could come here legally or illegally and be taken care
[03:36:15.760 --> 03:36:18.760]  of cradle to grave by the federal government that's what draws people
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:23.720]  here now back to what you talked about yes I was on with the okavuto talking
[03:36:23.720 --> 03:36:27.120]  about whether or not governor blagojevic can subpoena the president
[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:31.480]  answer yes and I hope he does I would love to see the president under oath in a
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:36.000]  federal courtroom in Chicago explaining how the corrupt system of Democratic
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:39.600]  politics probably Republican politics as well but here it's Democratic under
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:43.680]  scrutiny works as sort of a throwaway question meaning we had about 40 seconds
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:47.880]  left Neil says to me by the way judge governor Brewer just signed this piece
[03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:52.240]  of legislation in Arizona what do you think about it and of course I said you
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:56.520]  know I'm I believe in state sovereignty I believe in state sovereignty so much
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:00.680]  that I think that the states can take back the agreement they made with the
[03:37:00.680 --> 03:37:04.000]  federal government that they can nullify what the federal government does that
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:08.680]  they can see seed from the union however the one legitimate power that the
[03:37:08.680 --> 03:37:13.880]  feds do have is the power to regulate foreign affairs and to regulate foreign
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:17.840]  people in the state of Arizona doesn't have any power there moreover the state
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:21.600]  of Arizona does not have the power to say to its cops you can stop people on
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:25.960]  the basis of the way they look and ask them to prove a negative on the spot the
[03:37:25.960 --> 03:37:29.680]  negative is that they're not here illegally we fought a cold war against
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:33.000]  countries in Eastern Europe that thought they had the power to stop people on the
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:38.200]  basis of the way they looked and demand to see their papers if this law is
[03:37:38.200 --> 03:37:44.280]  enforced a federal judge might say you know what Alex it's unfair to only make
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:49.200]  the immigrants carry ID cards so the only way to do this here's the slippery
[03:37:49.200 --> 03:37:53.280]  slope is for everybody to carry ID cards you think I'm making this up my judge
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:37:57.240]  let me let me interject but that's not the slippery slope that's indeed what's
[03:37:57.240 --> 03:38:03.680]  happening as you know exactly Obama Obama and Bush's amnesty plan makes
[03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:07.600]  everybody have a worker ID card and basically just legalizes all the
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:12.280]  legal so I go back to the previous point if people come across the border an
[03:38:12.280 --> 03:38:16.320]  hour before their water breaks everything's paid for the kid becomes a
[03:38:16.320 --> 03:38:20.440]  citizen the parents are there I've got to pay for it in a democracy two wolves
[03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:24.120]  and a sheep voting on what's for dinner this is a giant voting block that
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:28.560]  generally votes to take my guns take my private property and make me their slave
[03:38:28.560 --> 03:38:33.520]  they're being used as a client of the big federal government exactly exactly
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:37.040]  agree with I agree with so what do we do then what do we do when the feds won't
[03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:41.000]  carry out one of their only legitimate powers doesn't it fall back to the ninth
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:44.920]  and tenth amendment that the states are I mean I guess the legitimate way would
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:50.520]  be then for Arizona to secede yes that would be the constitutional way for
[03:38:50.520 --> 03:38:55.760]  Arizona to do it the better way would be to elect a federal government willing
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:39:00.240]  to enforce federal law and here's the conundrum Alex from Ronald Reagan to
[03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:04.440]  Barack Obama from from a conservative Republican to a liberal Democrat
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:09.920]  everything in between the two Bush's Clinton and Carter no American president
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:16.000]  since Richard Nixon has been willing to enforce the immigration laws I'll
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  repeat it no American president since Richard Nixon has been willing to
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  enforce the immigration laws and every American president since Richard Nixon
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:30.120]  has added to the social safety net for people who can't work or don't want to
[03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:34.400]  work or your grandparents didn't get any welfare they broke their back to build
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:39.760]  the country correct correct the welfare started with FDR and every president has
[03:39:39.760 --> 03:39:43.760]  made it worse so this is not a problem that can be resolved by interfering with
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:50.000]  constitutional liberty I love the idea of hard-working people coming here and
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:55.800]  experiencing and enjoying the American dream but I do not love interfering with
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:40:00.360]  their constitutional liberties and mine because if they can stop somebody on the
[03:40:00.360 --> 03:40:04.360]  basis of the way they look which the Constitution prohibits in order to find
[03:40:04.360 --> 03:40:08.240]  out if they're here legally then they could stop somebody sure basis of the
[03:40:08.240 --> 03:40:12.280]  way they look to find and we know they've been using salt or a too much sugar or
[03:40:12.280 --> 03:40:16.160]  whatever else the government wants to regulate sure but and and we know these
[03:40:16.160 --> 03:40:20.720]  checkpoints 50 75 miles in all over the country even in places like Vermont and
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:25.560]  Maine they are using it to harass citizens and they left the illegals go
[03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:29.080]  right through so we know that all these things you're warning about are
[03:40:29.080 --> 03:40:34.480]  actually already manifesting themselves so so here's the big question you know
[03:40:34.480 --> 03:40:38.480]  looking at the legislation the way I see it it says if they have suspicion
[03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:43.040]  probable cause you see ten guys at a day labor site piling into the back of a
[03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:48.980]  truck you know then you can pull them over or if you pull somebody over who's
[03:40:48.980 --> 03:40:53.640]  swerving and they don't have IDs and you arrest them for drunk driving they
[03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:57.320]  can now be deported when it's proven that they're an illegal I mean what was
[03:40:57.320 --> 03:41:01.760]  Arizona thinking if you're saying I respect you that you've read the bill
[03:41:01.760 --> 03:41:05.320]  as a as a constitutional law scholar and you're saying you believe it's
[03:41:05.320 --> 03:41:09.760]  unconstitutional then what should they have crafted because Texas is about to
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:15.640]  get on board according to NBC and other states are flocking to do this they
[03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:20.120]  should curtail the social benefits that they provide but in fairness to Arizona
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:23.680]  that you know this is all part of the big problem that you and I talk about all
[03:41:23.680 --> 03:41:27.160]  the time which is the micromanagement of all government by the federal government
[03:41:27.160 --> 03:41:31.760]  much of what Arizona spends on social welfare is mandated by the federal
[03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:35.600]  government they have no choice but to do it the only way not to do it would be to
[03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:41.720]  nullify the federal law or to secede from the union or to persuade the electorate
[03:41:41.720 --> 03:41:46.000]  to elect people to Congress that will get rid of the social welfare state that
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:50.760]  actually started with Abraham Lincoln but but in in a in a direct way with
[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:53.640]  Franklin Roosevelt now that's not gonna happen overnight but I've got to say two
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:59.960]  things one I did not know about the internal checkpoints 50 miles in until
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:04.720]  you told me about that and that is my job to know these things so I am deeply
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:10.840]  grateful to you for that my great fear is that this this immigration issue in
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:15.160]  Arizona will be used by people like Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham and I'm
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:18.360]  not just picking them out of the blue they've proposed the legislation which
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:22.760]  basically says you know all these immigrants legal and illegal they have
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:26.000]  to have an ID card but since the feds won't the federal courts won't let us
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:29.400]  discriminate between Americans and immigrants we're gonna make everybody
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:33.560]  have an ID card so you can't do anything without showing that ID card then
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:37.920]  East Germany is here and maybe even the antebellum South why do I say that
[03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:41.520]  because this Arizona law lets you stop people on the basis of the way they look
[03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:45.600]  now you know what I look like Alex if I don't shave for two days and I fall
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:52.720]  asleep in the Sun and I wake up in Phoenix they're gonna stop me and that's
[03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:56.320]  not gonna be fun that's gonna create a lot of angry people and I'm making fun
[03:42:56.320 --> 03:43:00.040]  of myself and my own and my own looks but we live in a society where the
[03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:03.240]  government can't do that where the government can't demand your papers
[03:43:03.240 --> 03:43:06.880]  where the police can't stop you unless they have objective evidence of crime
[03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:11.960]  called probable cause or or a search warrant signed by a judge to whom they
[03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:16.160]  presented probable cause let me tell you a story driving around in his Monte
[03:43:16.160 --> 03:43:20.840]  Carlo he's been dead for years my grandfather was out in the Texas Hill
[03:43:20.840 --> 03:43:24.800]  country 200 plus miles from the border he was pulled over by the border patrol
[03:43:24.800 --> 03:43:29.080]  and I'm gonna print the article and and and and I'll give you the name of it
[03:43:29.080 --> 03:43:33.640]  right now but it's up on screen but but yes sir there is a hundred mile but
[03:43:33.640 --> 03:43:38.360]  they normally only go in 75 buffer zone around the entire country it's an
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:45.960]  internal border 100 miles in and it's basically a constitution free zone is
[03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:50.560]  what the ACLU calls it I agree with the ACLU and from the reports of it that I
[03:43:50.560 --> 03:43:54.460]  have learned about because of your exposure of it you are correct it is
[03:43:54.460 --> 03:43:58.320]  patently unconstitutional it may not exist and I'm waiting for a federal
[03:43:58.320 --> 03:44:02.720]  judge to comply with his or her oath to uphold the Constitution and invalidate
[03:44:02.720 --> 03:44:07.160]  it have you seen the video of the pastor Anderson no who owns the
[03:44:07.160 --> 03:44:10.880]  construction company and he has to drive through these every day and he said
[03:44:10.880 --> 03:44:14.400]  stop searching my car so they beat him within an inch of his life I did not
[03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:18.640]  know that did he bring an action against them did he get their videotapes we
[03:44:18.640 --> 03:44:22.120]  need to get him back on about that you know we we we cover this stuff and then
[03:44:22.120 --> 03:44:26.080]  you know it's it's in the rearview mirror we never look at it again I want to
[03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:28.880]  shift gears into some other issues here in a moment with the limited time we have
[03:44:28.880 --> 03:44:32.520]  with Andrew Napolitano his new book is out doing quite well why is the
[03:44:32.520 --> 03:44:36.360]  government told you myth power and the deception in American history judge
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:43.000]  Andrew P. Napolitano for by Congressman Ron Paul but just in closing the states
[03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:47.040]  are going to move to protect themselves they are going bankrupt predominantly
[03:44:47.040 --> 03:44:51.840]  because of the illegals and and the way they draw on the welfare we have
[03:44:51.840 --> 03:44:55.200]  sanctuary cities we have Austin cops that have told me they won't arrest
[03:44:55.200 --> 03:44:58.320]  illegals for drunk driving because they just get released and they're basically
[03:44:58.320 --> 03:45:02.800]  told not to do it my issue is the illegals now have more rights than
[03:45:02.800 --> 03:45:09.840]  citizens in these sanctuary cities wow you know it's the world turned upside
[03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:13.240]  down you and I talked about the census again I'll give you an example knock on
[03:45:13.240 --> 03:45:17.440]  the door it's a census taker and an FBI agent the FBI agent is there to arrest
[03:45:17.440 --> 03:45:21.040]  you the census taker is there to ask you questions the census taker says how
[03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:24.040]  many people live here and how many toilets do you have the FBI agent says
[03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:28.480]  you have a right to remain silent so you have more rights as a person being
[03:45:28.480 --> 03:45:32.880]  arrested than you do as a person being visited by by a bureaucrat from the
[03:45:32.880 --> 03:45:37.000]  census taker that this federal government has succeeded in turning the
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:42.160]  world upside down in terms of where freedom should be in where in terms of
[03:45:42.160 --> 03:45:46.520]  where rights should be and in terms of who can do what with their property how
[03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:50.720]  do we stop this we stop this by the things that you and I do exposing what
[03:45:50.720 --> 03:45:55.400]  the government does the camera is the new gun filming what the government does
[03:45:55.400 --> 03:46:01.520]  filming the the negotiations away of our liberty and and our property so that
[03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:05.080]  everybody can see how those who work for us have betrayed us and the
[03:46:05.080 --> 03:46:09.320]  Constitution they've sworn to uphold judge and how about starting with getting
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:13.320]  our counties and cities back and making our police chiefs have equal
[03:46:13.320 --> 03:46:17.160]  enforcement of the law when they catch illegals without insurance without
[03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:20.720]  driver's license they arrest a citizen they let the illegals go when they catch
[03:46:20.720 --> 03:46:24.360]  illegal drunk driving we're just going to have to keep them in jail as long as
[03:46:24.360 --> 03:46:28.280]  we keep an American citizen in jail but Americans are seen as the big fat milk
[03:46:28.280 --> 03:46:35.280]  gals regardless of what color we are to this system well I don't know of these
[03:46:35.280 --> 03:46:39.600]  cases and whether of which you speak Alex in which Americans have been punished
[03:46:39.600 --> 03:46:43.680]  for longer than illegal so you are you telling me that that the states have
[03:46:43.680 --> 03:46:47.600]  been forced to let illegals go who should be incarcerated because only the
[03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:51.720]  feds can incarcerate them that's ridiculous if an illegal breaks a state
[03:46:51.720 --> 03:46:58.080]  law that illegal can be prosecuted and if it found guilty fairly in a court of
[03:46:58.080 --> 03:47:01.360]  law because the Constitution protects persons the illegal has the same due
[03:47:01.360 --> 03:47:05.280]  process rights as the rest of us and when they get out of prison like anybody else
[03:47:05.280 --> 03:47:08.320]  when they get out of prison you can pull this up in the Houston Chronicle in fact
[03:47:08.320 --> 03:47:17.560]  pull up I believe that the headline was 200,000 felons released 200,000 illegal
[03:47:17.560 --> 03:47:21.160]  alien felons released in Texas and I think that was 2004 I remember that
[03:47:21.160 --> 03:47:26.880]  headline here it is ACLU two-thirds of US population lives in Constitution free
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:33.280]  zone and then it goes over the map of the 100 mile border zone and you can pull
[03:47:33.280 --> 03:47:38.520]  that up but but certainly this is a constitutional crisis that we're going
[03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:43.040]  into because I understand you're a pure libertarian a pure constitutionalist and
[03:47:43.040 --> 03:47:46.720]  I respect that and I understand the issues you're raising here and they and
[03:47:46.720 --> 03:47:50.680]  they're all valid but what do you do when the federal government's been seized
[03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:55.320]  by offshore banks and is it war against the Constitution what do you do when
[03:47:55.320 --> 03:48:00.360]  the illegals are coming in and being forged into a political weapon of the
[03:48:00.360 --> 03:48:04.680]  collectivist the the the states formed the federal government and not the other
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:08.920]  way around Reagan reminded us of that in the second paragraph of his fur of his
[03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:14.560]  first inaugural address the states gave limited specific precise delegated
[03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:19.200]  discrete powers only 16 of them to the federal government in the Constitution
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:23.800]  now when I say this to gatherings all over the country I say the following and
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:29.200]  nothing gets a bigger applause than than this power given by the states can be
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:34.960]  taken back that's what you do and when the Chuck Schumer's and Lindsay Graham's
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:40.680]  of this world realize that their empire is shrinking they will either comport
[03:48:40.680 --> 03:48:44.840]  themselves as those who love freedom or they will have no empire over which to
[03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:48.240]  reign and that brings me to our next issue but I did want to give you the
[03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:56.240]  federal statute federal statute eight CFR 287.1 a one dash three defines the
[03:48:56.240 --> 03:49:00.480]  border zone for enforcement purposes is encompassing an area within 100 miles of
[03:49:00.480 --> 03:49:04.320]  the actual border and they're now all over the country building hardened
[03:49:04.320 --> 03:49:07.800]  checkpoints in the last two years where they search everyone there's literally
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:12.040]  hundreds of YouTube videos of this and you're an important and influential guy
[03:49:12.040 --> 03:49:15.560]  so I'm glad that you're on the case ask me ask me if I know how members of
[03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:19.640]  Congress voted on that statute I know the answer I don't know how do they vote
[03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:25.160]  nobody voted it's CFR it's the code of federal regulations it's not the US code
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:30.960]  that means Congress authorized a group of bureaucrats to promulgate these rules
[03:49:30.960 --> 03:49:35.600]  Congress never even voted on the rules themselves the code of federal
[03:49:35.600 --> 03:49:40.800]  regulations is ten times as long as the US code the US code of the statutes
[03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:45.280]  Congress votes on for whatever political or moral or immoral or legitimate or
[03:49:45.280 --> 03:49:48.960]  illegitimate reasons it's what Congress debates on and votes on the health care
[03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:53.640]  law is in the US code I judge far as the insidious one that's the one that the
[03:49:53.640 --> 03:49:58.200]  bureaucrats have created yeah it's their own little code that they can just add
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:50:01.120]  whatever they want to we're about to go to break but I want to start getting into
[03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:04.760]  this now Bill Clinton came out and said gee I hope there doesn't have to be
[03:50:04.760 --> 03:50:08.760]  another Oklahoma City bombing for UT parties to shut up the mantra is we're
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:13.960]  going to cause violence when there's no evidence of that I'm really concerned
[03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:19.240]  about them creating a provocation or hyping something because clearly the
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:22.960]  things they've done politically are political suicide and now they're
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:28.240]  demonizing you and Ron Paul calling you both harbingers and enablers of

[03:54:16.520 --> 03:54:21.000]  everywhere judge de Paulitano and we're seeing massive demonization from MSNBC
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:25.240]  CNN Southern Prairie Law Center all these groups now they're even saying
[03:54:25.240 --> 03:54:28.720]  Ron Paul's bad you're bad they're claiming that we're gonna stir up
[03:54:28.720 --> 03:54:33.480]  violence with our First Amendment right criticizing corrupt government I mean
[03:54:33.480 --> 03:54:38.320]  this is pretty dangerous it's dangerous if they think that by our that they can
[03:54:38.320 --> 03:54:42.040]  interfere with our freedom of speech it's dangerous for Bill Clinton to say
[03:54:42.040 --> 03:54:45.240]  that those who question the government that those who think taxes are too high
[03:54:45.240 --> 03:54:49.280]  that those who think that the that life begins at the moment of conception and
[03:54:49.280 --> 03:54:53.320]  that the right to keep and bear arms as a natural right are dangerous people we
[03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:57.640]  are traditional Americans who are defending our freedom and will not be
[03:54:57.640 --> 03:55:03.240]  silenced by those who are attempting to do so but I think it's backfiring on I
[03:55:03.240 --> 03:55:07.800]  mean people are really saying through this race card you know I've been to
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:14.160]  many tea parties you know that many in the state of Texas in Ohio in Arizona in
[03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:20.760]  Florida I've not I've not detected a hint of racism of homophobia of any of the
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:25.960]  nonsense that these people that dislike the Tea Partiers claim is there what
[03:55:25.960 --> 03:55:31.120]  they dislike is the fact that the great middle class has finally been awakened
[03:55:31.120 --> 03:55:35.640]  and has finally agreed to read the Constitution and has finally recognized
[03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:38.760]  that we have a government that doesn't respect the Constitution doesn't honor
[03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:42.120]  it doesn't read it doesn't even know what it means thinks it can write any law
[03:55:42.120 --> 03:55:46.600]  regulate any event tax any behavior whether it's in the Constitution or not
[03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:50.920]  and let me tell you when ordinary people confront members of Congress and say
[03:55:50.920 --> 03:55:55.600]  where is this in the Constitution Alex I have not seen an awareness of freedom
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:56:01.480]  like this since Barry Goldwater ran for president against Lyndon Johnson in 1964
[03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:07.520]  and the establishment in both parties fears this is that why Lindsey Graham is
[03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:13.640]  now caving in on open borders and caving in on carbon taxes and caving in on I on
[03:56:13.640 --> 03:56:17.360]  ID cards absolutely because he's part of the establishment he's not a lover of
[03:56:17.360 --> 03:56:21.160]  freedom like you and me and most of the people listening to us he's more
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:25.720]  interested in his own power than he is in the in the Constitutional liberties
[03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:30.440]  and natural rights of those he represents we've only got a couple minutes left
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:35.120]  here I wanted to bring up the Goldman Sachs situation I see them picking some
[03:56:35.120 --> 03:56:39.360]  of the smaller things that Goldman's done so they can then derail a real
[03:56:39.360 --> 03:56:43.080]  investigation I see it as a big whitewash where do you stand on that I
[03:56:43.080 --> 03:56:47.520]  agree with you I think that Goldman will cave on this litigation brought by the
[03:56:47.520 --> 03:56:52.480]  SEC which is bogus and which is frivolous I can tell you why if you want to go
[03:56:52.480 --> 03:56:56.600]  into that I think that Goldman will cave on it in order to avoid more serious
[03:56:56.600 --> 03:57:00.360]  investigations like how could the chairman of Goldman Sachs also have been
[03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:04.200]  the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve at the same time that's the
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:07.120]  kind of stuff that they don't want investigated so they'll cave on this
[03:57:07.120 --> 03:57:12.960]  one yesterday when Lloyd Lloyd Blank fine appeared before Carl Levin he said
[03:57:12.960 --> 03:57:16.920]  yes I'm in favor of the of the financial regulation the president wants nobody
[03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:20.040]  Wall Street in their right mind is in favor of it unless you want to carry
[03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:23.760]  favor with the establishment so that after they enact this legislation they'll
[03:57:23.760 --> 03:57:27.840]  leave you alone well that's the word from the Texas Banking Association they
[03:57:27.840 --> 03:57:32.000]  say the mega banks are going to be given new power to go and consolidate their
[03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:35.800]  competition the worst part about this is that more power is going to the most
[03:57:35.800 --> 03:57:40.200]  insidious entity among us the Federal Reserve and if they if the if the
[03:57:40.200 --> 03:57:45.080]  administration thinks that they're going to be transparent aboveboard fair and
[03:57:45.080 --> 03:57:48.680]  respecting of freedom they have disregarded the past 100 years of
[03:57:48.680 --> 03:57:52.560]  human history what's the word on the financial takeover bill is it going to
[03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:56.440]  pass you know I talked to some Republicans today who told me that they
[03:57:56.440 --> 03:58:00.320]  expect the filibuster to succeed and that it won't pass as long as there's the
[03:58:00.320 --> 03:58:03.840]  too big to fail in it that is as long as the government can force you to sell
[03:58:03.840 --> 03:58:08.480]  you sell them your shares of stock against your will that's pretty gutsy of
[03:58:08.480 --> 03:58:13.080]  Republicans who I'm generally critical of if they'll stick to that all right
[03:58:13.080 --> 03:58:16.720]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is a new TV show on Fox Business coming up in the next
