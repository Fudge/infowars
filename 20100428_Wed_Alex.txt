[00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.193]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:07.955]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:09.716]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:11.297]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:12.258]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:17.041]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:24.326]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:26.888]  It is Wednesday, my friends.
[00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:27.529]  Wednesday.
[00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.157]  The 28th day of April 2010.
[00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:38.045]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.167]  Reverend Manning.
[00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:50.828]  James David Manning is going to be joining us on a host of issues with his expose and his continued investigation of Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:52.709]  He will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:59.114]  Then we have Christine Ebersole, star of television, films, and of course, the theater.
[00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:13.536]  She had quite an experience with the TSA over the weekend and she'll tell her story here for the first time coming up for about 30 minutes for part of the third hour today.
[00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.550]  I think
[00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:37.303]  Has got over an 80% approval rating.
[00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:40.444]  Napolitano's views are very populist, very popular.
[00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:50.909]  You've seen all the national polls where 80 plus percent of the public, including many Democrats, close to a majority of Democrats, disagree with what the government's doing.
[00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.970]  And so they want to divide us along party lines.
[00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.572]  Well, I'm just outside of the whole party line situation to begin with.
[00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:01.173]  I'm not bipartisan.
[00:02:01.173 --> 00:02:04.214]  I'm not in that controlled system.
[00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:21.868]  And we're also going to discuss the Arizona situation because Judge Andrew Napolitano, we're going to play that clip when we come back in the next break, he has said he thinks what's happening in Arizona is a bad idea from a political strategy point of view.
[00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:26.391]  And I can certainly see his point of view and agree with him to a certain extent.
[00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.494]  What's constitutional is to have the federal government do their job and protect our borders.
[00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:36.011]  And prosecute people that knowingly hire illegal aliens.
[00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.855]  That would fix the problem very quickly.
[00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.822]  Not have two or three raids of a meat packing plant.
[00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:43.785]  Or a Walmart every year.
[00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:50.709]  You know, you've got a million plus illegals coming in a year, tens of millions here, and then they arrest a few thousand at staged raids.
[00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.170]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.972]  It's kind of like these Goldman Sachs hearings they're having right now.
[00:02:54.972 --> 00:03:07.520]  They're burning a few low-level underlings for, you know, selling cruddy derivatives and telling their customers it was AAA gold, consciously knowing it was crud.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.122]  Or, well, you've all seen the senator
[00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:16.156]  Quoting the email because he had to to explain what they were saying.
[00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:24.320]  Senator Carl Levin talking about Goldman Sachs execs saying this this particular stock is absolute crap.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.143]  But they use the SHIT term with a Y on the end of it.
[00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:33.944]  And it's it's it's it's caused quite a sensation.
[00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:36.445]  So we're going to play an edited version of this.
[00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.626]  A lot of talk radio because it is part of the government.
[00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:39.446]  A senator said it.
[00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:42.507]  Are you
[00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.440]  Play it here, plus it's ridiculous.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:12.204]  You kill a million Iraqis in a fake war, in a fraudulent war, and that's okay, and torture's okay, and torture of children's okay, but heaven forbid somebody hear a cuss word.
[00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:19.627]  I mean, that's how ridiculous things have gotten in this society.
[00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:25.990]  So that is coming up as well in this hour.
[00:04:27.473 --> 00:04:33.078]  I also want to take phone calls, but I would specifically ask listeners, because I want to hear what you have to say on this.
[00:04:33.078 --> 00:04:35.820]  What did you think watching the Goldman Sachs hearings yesterday?
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.781]  Dog and Pony Show?
[00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:37.302]  Whitewash?
[00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:42.606]  What do you think about Blank Fine?
[00:04:42.606 --> 00:04:43.127]  Testimony?
[00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:49.097]  I've got a clip of him on Fox News where he was just lying perpetually.
[00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:50.859]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:54.304]  We'll tell you what's happening with the stock market globally as it plunges right now.
[00:04:54.304 --> 00:04:57.388]  Carbon tax is completely collapsing worldwide.
[00:04:57.388 --> 00:04:58.309]  Great news on that front.
[00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.750]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.623 --> 00:05:07.287]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:12.431]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:21.157]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.157 --> 00:05:25.219]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.161]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.224]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:38.087]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.308]  Others don't.
[00:05:39.308 --> 00:05:41.450]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.231]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:46.133]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:52.759]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.461]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:57.823]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:58.684]  Others don't.
[00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:04.879]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.140]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.024]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.024 --> 00:06:12.306]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:18.172]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.172 --> 00:06:24.399]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:30.802]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:35.003]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:39.285]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:45.227]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:48.789]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.750]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.190]  It's here.

[00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:01.109]  You worry.
[00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:03.130]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.672]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:07:05.672 --> 00:07:07.774]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:07:07.774 --> 00:07:09.375]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:12.978]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:07:12.978 --> 00:07:18.221]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:22.024]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:23.705]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:26.568]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:29.530]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:38.295]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:42.998]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:56.106]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:56.106 --> 00:07:58.127]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:04.709]  Six hundred million dollars of Timberwolf securities is what you sold.
[00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:13.897]  Before you sold them, this is what your sales team were telling to each other.
[00:08:13.897 --> 00:08:14.878]  Got it?
[00:08:14.878 --> 00:08:16.480]  105?
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.001]  Yes, Mr. Chairman.
[00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:22.765]  Look what your sales team was saying about Timberwolf.
[00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:26.088]  Boy, that Timberwolf was one sh**ty deal.
[00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:32.679]  They sold that.
[00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.780]  This email was from the head of the division, not the sales force.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.322]  Whatever it was, it's an internal Goldman document?
[00:08:41.322 --> 00:08:44.323]  This was an email to me in late June.
[00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:44.783]  Right.
[00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:46.484]  And you sold Timberwolf?
[00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:46.884]  No, no.
[00:08:46.884 --> 00:08:50.245]  You sold Timberwolf after as well.
[00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:51.465]  We did trades after that.
[00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.466]  Yeah, okay.
[00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.667]  The trades after... Some context might be helpful.
[00:08:56.294 --> 00:08:59.418]  The context, let me tell you, the context is mighty clear.
[00:08:59.418 --> 00:09:03.122]  June 22 is the date of this email.
[00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:07.146]  Boy, that Timberwolf was one f****** deal.
[00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:12.933]  How much of that f****** deal did you sell to your clients after June 22, 2007?
[00:09:16.277 --> 00:09:22.958]  Mr. Chairman, I don't know the answer to that, but the price would have reflected levels that they wanted to invest in at that time.
[00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.179]  Oh, of course, but they don't know.
[00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:26.159]  You didn't tell them you thought it was a s*** deal?
[00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:27.559]  Well, I didn't say that.
[00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:29.080]  No, who did?
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.020]  Your people, internally.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.521]  You knew it was a s*** deal, and that's what your email shows.
[00:09:34.521 --> 00:09:43.083]  I think the context, the message that I took from the email from Mr. Montag, was that my performance on that deal wasn't good.
[00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:48.529]  And I think the fact that we had lost money related to that wasn't good.
[00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:54.512]  How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of that deal after your people knew it was a f****** deal?
[00:09:54.512 --> 00:09:55.813]  Does that bother you at all?
[00:09:55.813 --> 00:09:57.594]  You sold a customer something?
[00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:02.537]  I don't recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal after that.
[00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:03.858]  Alright, let's take a look.
[00:10:03.858 --> 00:10:05.399]  Exhibit 166.
[00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:06.940]  Series of emails.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.560]  First is June 26, 07.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.741]  That's after June 22.
[00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:26.933]  July 1, 2007, tells the sales force the top priority is Timberwolf.
[00:10:26.933 --> 00:10:35.559]  Your top priority to sell is that **** deal.
[00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.781]  Mr. Chairman, my comment was I didn't recall the sales.
[00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:38.201]  You got it?
[00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:40.643]  We're trying to sell.
[00:10:40.643 --> 00:10:44.106]  Okay, you're trying to sell a **** deal, and it's your top priority.
[00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:46.828]  Come on, Mr. Sparks.
[00:10:46.828 --> 00:10:50.532]  Should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell... And by the way, it sold it.
[00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:52.234]  A lot of it, after that date.
[00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:56.137]  Should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell the f***ing deal?
[00:10:56.137 --> 00:10:56.338]  Well...
[00:10:57.974 --> 00:11:00.236]  Can you answer that one yes or no?
[00:11:00.236 --> 00:11:04.400]  There are prices in the market that people want to invest in things.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.023]  I didn't use that term with respect to the steel.
[00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:09.125]  Who did use that term?
[00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.246]  Who's Tom Mantag?
[00:11:10.246 --> 00:11:11.927]  Who's Daniel Sparks?
[00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:13.148]  That's me.
[00:11:13.148 --> 00:11:14.429]  Who's Tom Montag?
[00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:18.693]  Tom Montag was the head of the division at the time.
[00:11:21.976 --> 00:11:30.504]  The head of the Goldman Sachs division on derivatives saying sell our customers absolute crud.
[00:11:30.504 --> 00:11:38.312]  Absolute sh-t.
[00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:41.735]  Now again, we knew this ten years ago.
[00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.076]  We knew this five years ago.
[00:11:43.076 --> 00:11:44.238]  We knew this two years ago.
[00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:45.399]  We knew this six months ago.
[00:11:46.437 --> 00:11:51.998]  I mean, every radio show we've done with all of the financial experts and economists.
[00:11:51.998 --> 00:11:54.478]  I mean, going back to George Humphrey.
[00:11:54.478 --> 00:12:04.000]  Economist, local Austinite businessman, former city council member, very successful financial investor.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.221]  And I remember he put out audio tapes in 1998.
[00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:08.121]  Audio tapes in 1998.
[00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:30.194]  Where he laid out how they were setting up a derivatives bubble, thousands of times more than all the real money in the world, all the real assets, to bring in world government.
[00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:36.716]  Twelve years ago!
[00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:46.839]  In fact, he's written three books, and I think the first one he wrote, what was it, in about 97, the audio tapes came out in 98, was it Common Sense?
[00:12:50.163 --> 00:12:53.264]  After Patrick Henry?
[00:12:53.264 --> 00:12:53.624]  You know what?
[00:12:53.624 --> 00:12:56.566]  We've got to get those audio cassettes and CDs.
[00:12:56.566 --> 00:12:59.207]  I think we actually still sell them on Infowars.com.
[00:12:59.207 --> 00:13:01.107]  We've got to queue it up in the next few days.
[00:13:01.107 --> 00:13:01.728]  It'll take time.
[00:13:01.728 --> 00:13:04.128]  It's like nine hours long, if I remember correctly.
[00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:07.350]  We've got to find the sections where he breaks that down and play it.
[00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.330]  Twelve years later!
[00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.491]  I mean, he knew twelve years ago!
[00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:19.124]  And anyone who understands financial instruments and fractional reserve banking understands what's going on here.
[00:13:19.124 --> 00:13:21.426]  But the point is, he put it out 12 years ago.
[00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.768]  A year ago, we released the Obama deception.
[00:13:23.768 --> 00:13:30.334]  We broke down how Goldman Sachs and others, by name, we cover it in full, the Republic as well, now out for six months.
[00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:43.444]  We're going out and creating the Ponzi scheme, not just to become fabulously more wealthy, but to implode the economy by design and destroy their competition.
[00:13:43.444 --> 00:13:58.895]  And now, what is it, five months ago, they had the five-part series, four months ago, five-part series by McClatchy Newspapers, by Greg Gordon, we had him on the show, where they got separate emails from these Timberwolf emails,
[00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:04.310]  Where they're talking about the exact same thing.
[00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.990]  Oh, we're going to get our competition.
[00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.691]  We'll be the last standing.
[00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:10.132]  We're going to consolidate things.
[00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:12.313]  We'll make money on the way up and the way down.
[00:14:12.313 --> 00:14:21.356]  Because they were secretly, a year and a half before the implosion of 2008, on record.
[00:14:21.356 --> 00:14:23.157]  We've all known this.
[00:14:23.157 --> 00:14:25.578]  This radio audience has known this for a long time.
[00:14:25.578 --> 00:14:29.319]  But now the public's learning that they consciously
[00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:53.071]  We're betting against the crud they were selling people and they were having insurance companies like AIG now bailed out by the taxpayer to pay the guarantees to Goldman Sachs on the crud they created.
[00:14:53.071 --> 00:14:56.313]  That's just one side of the scam.
[00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:58.515]  Then they come out and say, oh, we're bankrupt.
[00:14:58.515 --> 00:14:59.896]  We need trillions of dollars.
[00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:06.239]  The Big Six, the Big Eight, the Big Ten, there's different ways of breaking it down.
[00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.421]  The news is now calling it the Big Six.
[00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:09.782]  Whatever.
[00:15:09.782 --> 00:15:15.606]  There's eight main banks that own Federal Reserve stock, but they say six of them own most of it.
[00:15:15.606 --> 00:15:23.032]  It's so secret that the Congress has had a few investigations and thinks maybe there's ten banks, but the other two are foreign.
[00:15:23.032 --> 00:15:25.514]  Bank of England and then a German central bank.
[00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.412]  The point is, this is a group of absolute, total criminals.
[00:15:32.412 --> 00:15:34.933]  And look, I know you know that.
[00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:37.694]  But we better get this message out to the population.
[00:15:37.694 --> 00:15:50.920]  Because these bankers are now pushing a financial regulatory bill written by Senator Dodd in the White House, who are completely bankrolled by the most criminal elements of Wall Street.
[00:15:52.165 --> 00:15:55.246]  Not all of Wall Street is criminal, just like all banks are not criminal.
[00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:59.847]  It's these big, mega players that are criminal, and why have they become the main players?
[00:15:59.847 --> 00:16:01.007]  Why do they run everything?
[00:16:01.007 --> 00:16:02.127]  Why are they so powerful?
[00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.408]  Why can no one stop them?
[00:16:03.408 --> 00:16:06.529]  Because they have unlimited money, they just make up.
[00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:09.289]  And it's backed up with government force, that's why.
[00:16:09.289 --> 00:16:15.771]  These are Ponzi scheme operators, these are people like Ken Lay and Bernie Madoff, who are allowed to
[00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:22.947]  Play by whatever rules they make up, and then we play by a separate set of rules that they create for us.
[00:16:27.793 --> 00:16:44.560]  The good news is there are some news reports now, there are some Banking Association documents that I've seen out of Tennessee, Texas, New York and a few other places where healthy state-based banks and regional banks are coming out and pointing out this is a total fraud by the very mega banks that created the derivatives.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.163]  So the truth is starting to get out there and that's good because this is a life-and-death situation for our economy.
[00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:54.324]  But meanwhile we've got Goldman Sachs running around
[00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:04.120]  Blankfein, their CEO, in testimony yesterday and he made the rounds on television, CNN, Fox, you name it, CNBC.
[00:17:06.513 --> 00:17:10.736]  He's running around saying, man, we've really learned from this.
[00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:12.377]  We've learned from our mistake.
[00:17:12.377 --> 00:17:15.199]  In fact, I'll play this clip later if we have time.
[00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:18.601]  He said, we've learned from our mistake.
[00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:22.644]  We just didn't know that this was going to happen.
[00:17:22.644 --> 00:17:27.387]  The economy was doing so well, we thought that we just made a mistake.
[00:17:27.387 --> 00:17:28.348]  No.
[00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:35.753]  All the emails, the documents, their internal memorandum, the orders being given by the directors of the major
[00:17:36.853 --> 00:17:51.746]  Units of Goldman Sachs across the board was sell toxic poison labeled as mother's milk to investors.
[00:17:51.746 --> 00:17:55.149]  And what should really concern everybody is Goldman Sachs is now out in the open.
[00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:56.851]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:58.192]  The media the last month has been
[00:17:59.716 --> 00:18:04.700]  Almost universally lying, saying, oh, the banks are upset about this banking reform bill.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.041]  They don't want it.
[00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:07.722]  This is going to get them in line.
[00:18:07.722 --> 00:18:10.144]  This is going to end derivatives.
[00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:12.026]  This is going to keep our economy safe.
[00:18:12.026 --> 00:18:15.889]  And the big corrupt bankers, they don't want it.
[00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:27.598]  Then meanwhile, at the critical juncture, Goldman Sachs comes out and says, oh, we actually support this legislation and we were involved helping the White House craft it.
[00:18:29.002 --> 00:18:38.730]  So this would be like Ken Lay sitting as the judge in his own trial and being given a $10 million lottery prize or
[00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:44.847]  Publishers clearinghouse sweepstakes prize for robbing people.
[00:18:44.847 --> 00:18:55.852]  I mean, it's just it's too rich and the system is attempting this because they have absolute and total contempt for the American people and the people of every other nation they're robbing.
[00:18:55.852 --> 00:19:03.356]  I mean, why do you think Mexico and Brazil and Asian countries are so bankrupt and people are so poor?
[00:19:03.356 --> 00:19:04.696]  Their people are smart.
[00:19:04.696 --> 00:19:06.017]  They're hard-working.
[00:19:06.017 --> 00:19:06.957]  They're intelligent.
[00:19:08.638 --> 00:19:10.959]  But they have never had a chance at freedom.
[00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:14.521]  They have been dominated by these systems for hundreds of years.
[00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:18.124]  Now, we're being dominated by it.
[00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:24.427]  That's why America's always been so hated by Latin America and Africa and poor areas of Asia and Eastern Europe.
[00:19:24.427 --> 00:19:29.370]  Because people knew it was U.S.-backed banks that were in there robbing them seven ways to Sunday.
[00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.832]  Well, now the very same banks are doing that to us.
[00:19:32.832 --> 00:19:35.474]  And we better bring them to justice now or
[00:19:36.414 --> 00:19:38.815]  It's going to be very hard to kick them out.
[00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:44.976]  If they're able to fully bankrupt us and get their financial straitjacket in place, it's over for this society.
[00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:49.957]  I'm going to come back, finish up with this, then get into the latest on the Arizona situation.
[00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:55.618]  We've got Reverend Manning joining us, Christina Ebersole, and Judge Andrew Napolitano today.
[00:19:55.618 --> 00:19:58.979]  It's the power-packed Transmission InfoWars.com.
[00:20:01.314 --> 00:20:08.317]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[00:20:08.317 --> 00:20:16.480]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.022]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:34.147]  Herbal supplements at ResearchedHerbs.com are backed by over 1100 published clinical trials and endorsed by over a quarter of a million healthcare professionals in 76 countries worldwide.

[00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:57.047]  Researchedherbs.com supplements.
[00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.729]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.271]  Gold.
[00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:02.792]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:09.076]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.076 --> 00:21:13.258]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.258 --> 00:21:15.200]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.621]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:25.026]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:21:25.026 --> 00:21:26.127]  We're good to go.
[00:21:40.213 --> 00:21:40.814]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.312]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.312 --> 00:22:04.693]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:07.895]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:13.018]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.018 --> 00:22:17.201]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:19.863]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:19.863 --> 00:22:22.745]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:25.667]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:25.667 --> 00:22:33.273]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:33.593 --> 00:22:38.996]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:38.996 --> 00:22:41.838]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:45.540]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.600]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.941]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:49.442]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:58.175 --> 00:24:05.837]  It works!
[00:24:05.837 --> 00:24:07.078]  I was a highway man.
[00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:11.160]  So, here we are.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.962]  They've passed their government takeover of healthcare, but the states are fighting back.
[00:24:14.962 --> 00:24:23.208]  The people are beginning to awaken the sleeping giant that is America.
[00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:27.030]  The global carbon tax scheme is in deep, deep trouble.
[00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.332]  Wonderful news out of France, Germany, Australia.
[00:24:30.332 --> 00:24:36.136]  They are saying that they are abandoning the global carbon taxes at the national and international level.
[00:24:37.537 --> 00:24:40.798]  The problem is they're going to counter-strike at the local level.
[00:24:40.798 --> 00:24:42.239]  We've already been hit and hit hard.
[00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:48.381]  They're going to suck 2.6 billion, according to Austin Energy, in the next three years out of Austinites.
[00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:51.383]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's more than all taxation in the city combined each year.
[00:24:51.383 --> 00:24:56.024]  I mean, you talk about savaging people with a vicious criminal operation.
[00:24:56.024 --> 00:24:59.486]  I mean, these people are bold, if they're anything.
[00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:06.689]  And meanwhile, Goldman Sachs CEO on Democrat banking bill, I'm generally supportive.
[00:25:06.689 --> 00:25:06.909]  Yes.
[00:25:08.407 --> 00:25:12.829]  And then we have several other articles dealing with it.
[00:25:12.829 --> 00:25:14.730]  Here's one out of the Examiner.
[00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.051]  This is Timothy P. Carey.
[00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:26.355]  Goldman rallies for Obama in Wall Street reform, and they report that Goldman Sachs is lobbying for this bill to pass.
[00:25:26.355 --> 00:25:31.137]  Now, this is a bill that's supposedly going to stop all their derivatives, and it doesn't do that.
[00:25:31.137 --> 00:25:34.599]  It gives them the power, because they hold almost every regulatory position.
[00:25:35.399 --> 00:25:35.559]  I think?
[00:25:57.162 --> 00:26:02.907]  They failed to get a direct tax mechanism to the private banks through the carbon taxes.
[00:26:02.907 --> 00:26:05.770]  So now they're back with a global banking reform bill.
[00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:18.101]  And when you read the agreements that the G20 is hammering out, and when you read the national laws, it all integrates together to give them the exact same system of taxes they wanted before.
[00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:22.805]  I mean, there were financial VAT taxes, Tobin taxes in the
[00:26:25.848 --> 00:26:26.989]  Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:30.932]  It's just, it's like a zombie, a vampire.
[00:26:30.932 --> 00:26:32.473]  It never dies.
[00:26:32.473 --> 00:26:35.195]  It just keeps coming and coming back and coming back.
[00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:37.997]  But the good news is we're beginning to beat them.
[00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:41.439]  They got the health care for now.
[00:26:41.439 --> 00:26:44.321]  But let's go ahead and play the CEO blank fine.
[00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:48.384]  Just a quick clip, full clips up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:48.384 --> 00:26:48.905]  I want to play
[00:26:50.126 --> 00:27:00.114]  A short clip of him saying, well, you know, we are working with Congress and we learned the mistakes we made and, you know, we just thought the economy was doing so good, we never thought this would happen.
[00:27:00.114 --> 00:27:19.148]  There he is, the day that the hearings are televised on national television and all over radio and all over the newspapers, that it finally comes out that it was premeditated fraud, that they knew exactly what they were doing, by design, and planned the whole thing, and even bought insurance on it, knowing it was going to go under.
[00:27:20.233 --> 00:27:27.758]  So they sold it to people that they knew were going to be robbed, and then they also insured themselves.
[00:27:27.758 --> 00:27:34.683]  This is like somebody insuring their own restaurant and then firebombing it, you know, to collect the insurance money.
[00:27:34.683 --> 00:27:39.686]  So here he is lying to the nation on Fox News.
[00:27:39.686 --> 00:27:44.109]  Here is Peter Barnes and Lloyd Blankfein.
[00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:47.231]  Mr. Blankfein, long day, but I'd like to look ahead.
[00:27:47.231 --> 00:27:47.692]  What's next?
[00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:54.335]  What's next is we are going to learn and take lessons from this period.
[00:27:54.335 --> 00:27:56.616]  In fact, we have and we're going to apply them.
[00:27:56.616 --> 00:28:09.481]  And what's next for the Congress is they're going, having done their deep dive, they're going to legislate, hopefully in a bipartisan fashion, and will come out with their new set of rules.
[00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:17.704]  And we will engage in a very molecular view of our own business and make sure that we make the appropriate changes to our business model.
[00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:26.077]  One thing that is still hanging out there is this SEC lawsuit as Congress finishes up regulation reform legislation.
[00:28:26.077 --> 00:28:27.418]  What's next with that?
[00:28:27.418 --> 00:28:32.363]  Is there any consideration by the company and by you to settle that lawsuit with the SEC?
[00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:42.056]  Well, what happens now is we have a complaint and we have to respond to that complaint and that process has... And then it just goes on with more deception.
[00:28:42.056 --> 00:28:50.501]  It's come out that Goldman Sachs, including Mr. Blankfein, have had a whole bunch of meetings with Obama quietly in the White House.
[00:28:51.421 --> 00:29:00.829]  And that they've been having meetings all over the place with Geithner, who formerly worked for them, and with Bernanke, who formerly worked for them, and with the other regulators that formerly worked with them.
[00:29:00.829 --> 00:29:08.696]  I mean, literally, you can't find one senior regulator that didn't work with them, who doesn't own stock in them, who isn't getting the bailout money for themselves.
[00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:16.843]  It goes back to Henry Paulson, when they asked him, well, you got $200-plus million in one payout from the bailout.
[00:29:16.843 --> 00:29:18.725]  And the congressman said, how did you do that?
[00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:21.856]  That was Congressman Stern.
[00:29:21.856 --> 00:29:24.676]  And he said, well, I got a waiver.
[00:29:24.676 --> 00:29:25.516]  Who gave you the waiver?
[00:29:25.516 --> 00:29:27.917]  Oh, the Treasury Department.
[00:29:27.917 --> 00:29:29.157]  Well, who runs the Treasury Department?
[00:29:29.157 --> 00:29:31.298]  Well, I did.
[00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:32.998]  He gives himself a waiver.
[00:29:32.998 --> 00:29:36.179]  It's like a bank manager giving himself a note that he can rob the bank.
[00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.480]  I mean, it's fraud.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:47.422]  But we'll come back, finish up with this, and get into the situation with the borders and the latest developments with Arizona, saying they're going to enforce the law.
[00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:48.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.042 --> 00:29:48.482]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.018 --> 00:29:54.959]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.959 --> 00:30:00.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.760]  What's your home worth?
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.880]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.921]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:30:06.921 --> 00:30:14.622]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:31:00.748 --> 00:31:03.752]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.752 --> 00:31:09.079]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:11.142]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.142 --> 00:31:16.148]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.148 --> 00:31:17.330]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.051]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:20.313]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.313 --> 00:31:21.394]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.394 --> 00:31:23.597]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.597 --> 00:31:24.938]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.938 --> 00:31:26.460]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.725]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.725 --> 00:31:35.309]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:38.793]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:40.354]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.354 --> 00:31:41.255]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.255 --> 00:31:42.355]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.355 --> 00:31:43.276]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:44.377]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.377 --> 00:31:47.439]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:50.281]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.081]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.981]  This is Steve Shank, eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:07.405]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:08.726]  Congratulations!
[00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:15.170]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:20.233]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[00:32:20.233 --> 00:32:21.034]  Now something fun!
[00:32:21.334 --> 00:32:22.294]  It's springtime.
[00:32:22.294 --> 00:32:30.238]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[00:32:30.238 --> 00:32:31.118]  Here's the plan.
[00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:40.041]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.362]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[00:32:42.362 --> 00:32:43.863]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:32:48.965 --> 00:32:53.013]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you wait for your supplemental garden to grow.
[00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:54.476]  Call 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, slash Alex.
[00:33:14.017 --> 00:33:29.983]  I want to put bookends on what developed in the last day with Goldman Sachs hearings.
[00:33:29.983 --> 00:33:34.504]  It's really very simple.
[00:33:34.504 --> 00:33:35.965]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:52.697]  The private central banks and brokerage firms and investment banks come in, they create derivatives, they create basically counterfeit paper, they sell it to the world, they gain great power through the process, then when it implodes, they come back and say, okay,
[00:33:55.031 --> 00:33:59.733]  Pass regulations so we don't make these mistakes again when it's all premeditated.
[00:33:59.733 --> 00:34:05.795]  And then the very regulations that are passed give them more power and control to take over the economy.
[00:34:05.795 --> 00:34:07.415]  It's very, very simple.
[00:34:07.415 --> 00:34:15.458]  And meanwhile, they've got this top lawyer with the Department of the Treasury.
[00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:19.959]  Marofsky says criminal charges possible and alleged AIG cover-up.
[00:34:19.959 --> 00:34:21.220]  And that's out of Bloomberg today.
[00:34:22.307 --> 00:34:31.391]  I mean, the Treasury Department is run by Goldman Sachs operatives like Tim Geithner, who formerly was one of the directors of Goldman Sachs.
[00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:38.355]  And so, the public is being shown on the surface what appears to be an investigation.
[00:34:38.355 --> 00:34:50.701]  And they'll probably send a few underlings to prison for a few years, and they may, you know, hand out some fines that amount to, you know, one penny on the thousand dollars these bankers stole.
[00:34:51.221 --> 00:35:05.181]  And it'll sound big to the public, oh, this guy got fined $5 million and this company got fined $100 million and this company got fined $20 million and this guy got six months and this guy got five years and they'll spend, you know, a month in prison.
[00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:10.998]  Or it could be like Ken Lay.
[00:35:10.998 --> 00:35:20.328]  Hundreds of billions of dollars are stolen out the back door, Ken Lay gets convicted, and then he's out on release in Aspen, Colorado, and has a heart attack and supposedly dies.
[00:35:20.328 --> 00:35:24.313]  And the word is, from really reliable sources, he's alive and down in Paraguay.
[00:35:25.441 --> 00:35:26.942]  I mean, that's how these guys operate.
[00:35:26.942 --> 00:35:36.886]  It's just the Witness Protection Program is basically used for these insiders who are tied into national security, and when the heat gets too high and gets too hot, they just stage their deaths.
[00:35:36.886 --> 00:35:51.232]  But regardless, most of the people involved, with the accounting firms that were engaged in the fraud, with Ken Lay and Enron, they got a slap on the wrist.
[00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:52.093]  So that's what's happening.
[00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.549]  There.
[00:35:53.549 --> 00:35:59.132]  But I do want to take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:59.132 --> 00:36:01.413]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:01.413 --> 00:36:06.376]  Specifically on the banking and on the situation in Arizona.
[00:36:06.376 --> 00:36:07.676]  Those two twin topics.
[00:36:07.676 --> 00:36:14.840]  I want to take a few calls coming up before this hour ends and at the start of the next hour before we talk to Reverend Manning.
[00:36:21.252 --> 00:36:26.126]  I do want to get back into the situation in Arizona before I go to your calls, but before we do that...
[00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.011]  I want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:41.916]  If you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on, if so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com if there's ever been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:46.599]  And it's great plug-and-play solar generators from our sponsors, Solutions from Science.
[00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:52.441]  They need no installation and supply household current whenever and wherever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:55.763]  Unlike gas generators, the solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[00:36:56.903 --> 00:37:07.308]  You can call and get a free information packet 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or you can go to mysolarbackup.com.
[00:37:07.308 --> 00:37:10.870]  And lastly, I want to tell you about a Coloblue.
[00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:16.032]  You don't need well water, you don't need tap water, you don't need to go to the river and get buckets of water.
[00:37:16.032 --> 00:37:18.473]  This grabs water right out of the atmosphere.
[00:37:18.473 --> 00:37:19.434]  That's what clouds are.
[00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.111]  I know most of you know that, but I get emails saying, how does this work?
[00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:29.892]  It looks like a water cooler without a water bottle on top, and it grabs upwards of seven and a half gallons a day with their smallest unit.
[00:37:29.892 --> 00:37:31.093]  They have bigger units.
[00:37:31.093 --> 00:37:34.694]  And then it goes through seven to 12 filters, depending on which unit you buy.
[00:37:34.694 --> 00:37:36.714]  It's the best, cleanest drinking water you can find.
[00:37:36.714 --> 00:37:37.134]  I love it.
[00:37:37.134 --> 00:37:42.415]  It's acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, acolablue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[00:37:48.937 --> 00:37:54.987]  Or you can just trust the government and take all the vaccines and drink all the Florida water and not listen to us.
[00:37:54.987 --> 00:37:55.247]  Now, um...
[00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:01.427]  We've got to look at all the angles of what's happening.
[00:38:01.427 --> 00:38:03.809]  Mexico is a collapsed country.
[00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:04.650]  It is collapsed.
[00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:12.695]  It is a failed state by any yardstick, by any political, socio-economic, cultural yardstick.
[00:38:12.695 --> 00:38:13.355]  And it's a shame.
[00:38:13.355 --> 00:38:19.680]  It's a rich nation with resources, rich with intelligent, hard-working, smart people.
[00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:35.748]  And when I get up here on radio and I talk about elements of La Raza and Mecha who call for killing the gringos or call for Aslan or call for the plan of San Diego, that's a fact and it has to be covered.
[00:38:35.748 --> 00:38:40.691]  But that's like the media saying that all the Tea Party people are racist.
[00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:43.453]  No, the vast majority are not.
[00:38:43.453 --> 00:38:44.954]  And so it's an oversimplification.
[00:38:47.383 --> 00:38:54.386]  And that was not my intention yesterday, but I did hear some of the rebroadcast, and if you didn't listen to the whole hour, I tend to get long-winded.
[00:38:54.386 --> 00:38:55.106]  Everyone knows that.
[00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:57.067]  I think it's been called diarrhea of the mouth before.
[00:38:57.067 --> 00:39:06.270]  But I was listening to about 30 minutes of my rebroadcast, and I was jumping around on different topics, and I want to be 100% clear.
[00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:12.118]  This is a nation of immigrants.
[00:39:12.118 --> 00:39:22.746]  We're all immigrants to this country, even if it was 10,000 years ago and your ancestors came across the Bering Strait from Asia, the original inhabitants of North America.
[00:39:22.746 --> 00:39:30.030]  They're the folks that hunted out the woolly mammoths and the mastodons and hunted out a lot of other species that were here.
[00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.152]  We know they were here a long time ago.
[00:39:34.485 --> 00:39:39.867]  The issue is, Mexico is a criminal government, like most other governments, but it's one of the most criminal.
[00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:43.888]  And it's totally run by the big central banks in New York.
[00:39:43.888 --> 00:39:50.630]  They have more billionaires per capita in Mexico than any other country in the world because they have stolen the riches of the people down there.
[00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:57.472]  And the American people are now going into the similar bondage that the Mexicans have been under if we don't stop these banking cartels.
[00:39:57.472 --> 00:39:59.653]  That's how every third world country has been brought down.
[00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:00.695]  Yes.
[00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:21.270]  I don't know.
[00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:42.393]  And forced them to move to the cities, to the Maquiladoras.
[00:40:42.393 --> 00:40:45.054]  And of course, most of the Maquiladoras are now shut down.
[00:40:45.054 --> 00:40:47.936]  Under globalization, everything moved to China and India.
[00:40:47.936 --> 00:40:49.257]  It's an absolute race to the bottom.
[00:40:49.257 --> 00:40:54.140]  That was all done by design, and Ross Perot tried to expose that and warn people.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:41:01.104]  But, secondarily, it is not... States can do anything they want.
[00:41:02.017 --> 00:41:06.760]  Under the Bill of Rights and Constitution except for the powers not expressly given to the federal government.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.883]  And one of those powers is controlling the borders.
[00:41:10.883 --> 00:41:21.750]  And that's why Andrew Napolitano, who's a great constitutionalist, has said that this is a very dangerous situation that's taking place in Arizona.
[00:41:23.154 --> 00:41:36.005]  Now, I support what Arizona did because it draws attention to the fact that the government is not enforcing the law, and that homes are being burned, ranchers are being killed every week, police are being killed, citizens are being raped and robbed.
[00:41:36.005 --> 00:41:38.086]  It is Wild Wild West.
[00:41:38.086 --> 00:41:39.668]  It is, in fact, worse than Wild Wild West.
[00:41:39.668 --> 00:41:48.195]  It is road warrior level in many areas of South and West Texas, and many areas of Arizona, and even areas of Southern California.
[00:41:48.675 --> 00:41:53.639]  I mean, it is... Road Warrior doesn't even begin to describe what's happening.
[00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:57.181]  I've been talking about this for six, seven years as things heated up down there.
[00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:05.567]  I mean, I've been seeing rocket attacks, murder, bombings, killings, rape, kidnappings, burning buildings, and I'd get emails saying, I don't see that on the news.
[00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:09.010]  Well, you weren't reading South Texas News or Southern Arizona News.
[00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.851]  You weren't talking to people that live down there.
[00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:12.092]  You weren't interviewing with sheriffs.
[00:42:12.092 --> 00:42:14.514]  I mean, it is... it is insanity.
[00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:17.556]  What's going on down there?
[00:42:17.556 --> 00:42:25.181]  And this type of lawlessness is beginning to spread deeper into the country, so we must secure the border.
[00:42:25.181 --> 00:42:31.805]  The bipartisan federal plan of Bush and now Obama is just, yeah, we'll fix the illegal alien problem, we'll just legalize them all.
[00:42:31.805 --> 00:42:38.089]  Well, if we completely capitulate and say unlimited numbers of people can come here, when there's 6,250,000,000 people outside the U.S.
[00:42:42.898 --> 00:42:43.618]  That's conservative.
[00:42:43.618 --> 00:42:46.220]  There's over 6.5 billion, and that's an old number.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.462]  So 300 million out of that, you get 6.2 plus.
[00:42:50.462 --> 00:42:53.443]  6.2 billion people, they want to come here.
[00:42:53.443 --> 00:42:55.904]  Not just because it was land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:42:55.904 --> 00:43:00.527]  If there was no welfare, like there was 100 years ago, and the churches and local communities were the welfare,
[00:43:01.856 --> 00:43:06.640]  Then we could take 30 million people from Mexico alone.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:19.309]  But we can't do that, ladies and gentlemen, because when they get here, big government shoves a welfare trough in front of them because they want them as pliant political slaves that they can use as a political weapon.
[00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:24.992]  And that's why I have to throw everything I've got against this because I see the program very clearly.
[00:43:24.992 --> 00:43:27.995]  And I have the SPP documents where they said we're going to
[00:43:28.855 --> 00:43:32.459]  Use the border collapsing as a pretext to set up the North American Union.
[00:43:32.459 --> 00:43:36.843]  We're going to use financial crises, and we're going to use biological crises, i.e.
[00:43:36.843 --> 00:43:37.504]  the flu.
[00:43:37.504 --> 00:43:38.845]  And you've seen them do all of that.
[00:43:38.845 --> 00:43:42.489]  Every time there's a crisis, the answer is just get rid of the borders.
[00:43:42.489 --> 00:43:44.191]  That will fix it, have a unified system.
[00:43:45.973 --> 00:43:48.253]  Which then brings us all under tyranny.
[00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:50.134]  I want liberty in Mexico.
[00:43:50.134 --> 00:43:51.274]  I want them to be free.
[00:43:51.274 --> 00:43:55.935]  I want their people to have big houses and swimming pools and to build big cities.
[00:43:55.935 --> 00:43:58.175]  And I'd probably move there.
[00:43:58.175 --> 00:43:59.796]  I love Mexico.
[00:43:59.796 --> 00:44:01.696]  It's a love-hate relationship though.
[00:44:01.696 --> 00:44:03.596]  Beautiful, wonderful place.
[00:44:03.596 --> 00:44:07.537]  But it's in squalor in so many areas and it's falling apart.
[00:44:07.537 --> 00:44:12.458]  And America is going to fall apart like that if we don't do something about this right now.
[00:44:13.612 --> 00:44:15.579]  I mean, do you know how people live in Latin America?
[00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:16.722]  Have you been there?
[00:44:16.722 --> 00:44:17.204]  I've been there.
[00:44:17.204 --> 00:44:18.528]  Have you been to Central America?
[00:44:18.528 --> 00:44:19.672]  I've been there.
[00:44:19.672 --> 00:44:19.973]  I've been...
[00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:22.737]  Quite a few places.
[00:44:22.737 --> 00:44:23.958]  It is hellish.
[00:44:23.958 --> 00:44:26.360]  Troops with machine guns everywhere.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.983]  Barefoot kids walking around with sores on their faces.
[00:44:28.983 --> 00:44:30.544]  Sewage running down the street.
[00:44:30.544 --> 00:44:32.767]  Chickens running around the middle of the road.
[00:44:32.767 --> 00:44:34.488]  And now, what is America starting to look like?
[00:44:34.488 --> 00:44:35.589]  Troops with machine guns.
[00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:37.251]  Checkpoints.
[00:44:37.251 --> 00:44:39.493]  I mean, just the whole thing.
[00:44:39.493 --> 00:44:40.614]  It's happening.
[00:44:40.614 --> 00:44:43.597]  And we've got to do something about this now.
[00:44:44.645 --> 00:44:56.371]  I want to go to Nick, Earl, Matt, John, and Alex, but let's play Napolitano's concern here, and then when he's on with us, coming up later in the last hour of the show, I can get his take on this.
[00:44:56.371 --> 00:45:05.476]  But I really respect his deep insight, and I understand the point he's got here, but then I also have some caveats.
[00:45:06.806 --> 00:45:09.167]  With a different perspective, so let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:31.361]  Hispanics, who have a natural home in the Republican Party because they are socially conservative, will flee in droves.
[00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:36.084]  She's also going to bankrupt her state because no insurance company will provide coverage for this.
[00:45:36.084 --> 00:45:39.726]  And for all the lawsuits that will happen, for all the people that are wrongfully stopped,
[00:45:40.326 --> 00:45:42.307]  Her budget will be paying for it.
[00:45:42.307 --> 00:45:47.490]  Her budget will be paying the legal bills of the lawyers who sue in behalf of those that were stopped.
[00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.771]  This will be a disaster for Arizona.
[00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:57.555]  To say nothing of the fact that it's so unconstitutional, I predict a federal judge will prevent Arizona from enforcing it as soon as they attempt to do so.
[00:45:57.555 --> 00:45:59.476]  That will probably be tomorrow.
[00:45:59.476 --> 00:46:04.719]  Well, Judge, alright, Judge, anybody's on to the definitive statement.
[00:46:04.719 --> 00:46:06.760]  But see the position the country's put in.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.401]  The feds
[00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:12.407]  Will not protect the border.
[00:46:12.407 --> 00:46:17.890]  And it is their authority, their job, their duty, their responsibility.
[00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.310]  They will not do it.
[00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.912]  Arizona is being overrun.
[00:46:22.912 --> 00:46:27.474]  And so Arizona passes a law and the media misconstrues it.
[00:46:27.474 --> 00:46:28.294]  I've read the law.
[00:46:28.294 --> 00:46:38.399]  It says that if you have probable cause, suspicion, that means if you pull somebody over and they're drunk and they're an illegal alien,
[00:46:39.414 --> 00:46:42.417]  And they got a consular matricula card in their wallet.
[00:46:42.417 --> 00:46:43.738]  You take them to jail.
[00:46:43.738 --> 00:46:45.279]  And then they're deported.
[00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:49.202]  I mean, Mexico will deport you in a minute.
[00:46:49.202 --> 00:46:50.003]  That's another issue.
[00:46:50.003 --> 00:46:54.407]  It's how bad Americans are treated in Mexico.
[00:46:54.407 --> 00:46:58.330]  I mean, you know, you start demanding your rights down in Mexico, they'll just shoot you.
[00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.274]  I mean, they don't play games down there.
[00:47:02.274 --> 00:47:06.978]  And, you know, he's right about the fact that it
[00:47:08.203 --> 00:47:12.865]  Federal courts are going to rule it unconstitutional.
[00:47:12.865 --> 00:47:21.828]  But then that brings us to the point of what do you do when the federal government won't do its job?
[00:47:21.828 --> 00:47:25.189]  Well, under the 9th and 10th Amendment, the states can do one thing.
[00:47:25.189 --> 00:47:27.970]  They can pull out of the union because there isn't a union.
[00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:29.610]  The union doesn't exist anymore.
[00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.571]  It's run by Lloyd Blankfein.
[00:47:32.571 --> 00:47:34.812]  It's run by people like Henry Paulson.
[00:47:34.812 --> 00:47:37.453]  It's run by these crooks.
[00:47:38.871 --> 00:47:43.876]  Who love wrecking things so they can consolidate them.
[00:47:43.876 --> 00:47:45.377]  What's a mosquito do?
[00:47:45.377 --> 00:47:59.651]  When it sticks its proboscis down into your skin and into a capillary, it injects a saliva, an acid enzyme that dissolves the cells so that it can suck the juices into its belly.
[00:48:00.646 --> 00:48:01.767]  And that's what they do.
[00:48:01.767 --> 00:48:03.549]  They dissolve a nation.
[00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:07.193]  They dissolve a country so they can consolidate it.
[00:48:07.193 --> 00:48:16.943]  They don't care if it wrecks the society as long as they get the power and as long as they get the control.
[00:48:16.943 --> 00:48:21.048]  And so we've got a Democrat who says Arizona law like Nazi Germany.
[00:48:22.378 --> 00:48:28.321]  No, what Nazi Germany is, is the federal government that's now so concerned about illegal aliens' rights.
[00:48:28.321 --> 00:48:39.206]  The federal government that runs warrantless checkpoints, paying local police with grants to take blood without warrants, or to have naked body scanners in the airports, now going in mobile vans on the streets and trucks.
[00:48:40.086 --> 00:48:48.289]  And federal programs putting ATF deputized local agents in the schools to brainwash your children.
[00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:54.612]  And having federal grants for laptops, watching kids at home as they undress.
[00:48:54.612 --> 00:48:55.912]  That is Nazi Germany.
[00:48:55.912 --> 00:48:57.993]  Nazi Germany is the Patriot Act.
[00:48:57.993 --> 00:49:00.734]  Nazi Germany is torturing Iraqis to death.
[00:49:00.734 --> 00:49:06.257]  Nazi Germany is attacking countries that have done nothing to us.
[00:49:06.257 --> 00:49:09.478]  Nazi Germany is having a big out-of-control central government.
[00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.556]  That's what Nazi Germany is.
[00:49:12.556 --> 00:49:14.818]  Nazi Germany, I mean, what is Arizona?
[00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.359]  Like half Hispanic?
[00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:18.862]  Nobody's gonna pull anybody over with brown skin.
[00:49:18.862 --> 00:49:21.824]  Half the cops are Hispanic, they're Americans.
[00:49:21.824 --> 00:49:25.267]  But if you see a truck full of eight people in the back,
[00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.758]  And they're driving around drinking beer.
[00:49:28.758 --> 00:49:36.063]  I mean, the funny thing is I watch illegal aliens drinking beer every weekend in the backs of their trucks because they know the cops leave them alone.
[00:49:36.063 --> 00:49:37.203]  You try being a citizen.
[00:49:37.203 --> 00:49:40.465]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, black, white, whatever it is, guzzling beer.
[00:49:40.465 --> 00:49:42.787]  Everybody knows what an illegal alien looks like.
[00:49:42.787 --> 00:49:44.007]  OK, they're wearing cowboy hats.
[00:49:44.007 --> 00:49:45.328]  They got cowboy boots.
[00:49:45.328 --> 00:49:47.049]  Normally they've been doing construction work.
[00:49:47.049 --> 00:49:48.050]  There's dirt all over them.
[00:49:49.113 --> 00:49:53.415]  And, uh, you know, when they're driving home and people say, well, that's a job nobody else will do.
[00:49:53.415 --> 00:49:53.815]  Oh, really?
[00:49:53.815 --> 00:50:01.098]  Americans, regardless of what color you are, you used to make a good living in construction.
[00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:07.040]  And now it's driven the price down so much, uh, that, uh, it's destroyed our economy.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.022]  See, when you pay people less, it destroys the economy.
[00:50:10.022 --> 00:50:15.684]  When you pay people more, then people have more money to spend.
[00:50:15.684 --> 00:50:17.865]  An example of this is 50 years ago, Walmart
[00:50:18.905 --> 00:50:19.866]  Not Walmart.
[00:50:19.866 --> 00:50:21.048]  Freudian slip.
[00:50:21.048 --> 00:50:28.477]  McDonald's, the Walmart of fast food, began putting trays out that said, thank you.
[00:50:29.352 --> 00:50:31.533]  And they got people to throw away their own trash.
[00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:46.318]  Now you go in a McDonald's or any other fast food place, they're filthy because the corporation has trained you to not expect to go to a clean restaurant when they can be paying some entry-level teenagers to be out there keeping it clean.
[00:50:46.318 --> 00:50:48.379]  And what, you pay five cents more for the hamburger?
[00:50:49.158 --> 00:50:50.960]  But then you'd have an economy.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.583]  See, this is a strip mining economy.
[00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:54.424]  Alright, whatever.
[00:50:54.424 --> 00:50:56.627]  You've seen what NAFTA and GATT and Open Borders have done.
[00:50:56.627 --> 00:50:58.129]  You've seen the proof is in the pudding.
[00:50:58.129 --> 00:50:59.070]  The proof is in the results.
[00:51:02.597 --> 00:51:04.599]  Remain in your houses.
[00:51:04.599 --> 00:51:10.363]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:51:10.363 --> 00:51:11.725]  Will they do it?
[00:51:11.725 --> 00:51:14.347]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:51:14.347 --> 00:51:20.792]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:51:20.792 --> 00:51:23.014]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:51:23.014 --> 00:51:25.055]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:51:27.257 --> 00:51:32.138]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:51:32.138 --> 00:51:37.059]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:51:37.059 --> 00:51:42.800]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:51.222]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[00:51:56.783 --> 00:52:01.027]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:52:01.027 --> 00:52:03.349]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:05.732]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.732 --> 00:52:08.935]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.935 --> 00:52:14.060]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:18.244]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.544 --> 00:52:20.906]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.906 --> 00:52:23.787]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.787 --> 00:52:26.689]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.689 --> 00:52:34.294]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.634 --> 00:52:40.039]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.039 --> 00:52:42.341]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.341 --> 00:52:46.564]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:47.645]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.645 --> 00:52:48.986]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.986 --> 00:52:50.488]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:15.613 --> 00:54:21.057]  And we've got Christina Ebersole with her harrowing tale with the TSA in the airport.
[00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:24.640]  And then of course we've got Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.422]  Right now let's go to Nick in Arkansas.
[00:54:26.422 --> 00:54:27.182]  You're on the air, Nick.
[00:54:27.182 --> 00:54:27.743]  Thanks for holding.
[00:54:28.966 --> 00:54:29.607]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:54:29.607 --> 00:54:30.207]  Can you hear me?
[00:54:30.207 --> 00:54:31.868]  Yes, I can.
[00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:42.115]  Okay, I've been listening to you for about a year now, and I just want to tell you that we're out here fighting the good battle.
[00:54:42.115 --> 00:54:49.459]  I'm a Hispanic American, or shall I say an American who happens to have Mexican roots.
[00:54:49.459 --> 00:54:49.960]  Exactly.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.841]  I'm not a European American.
[00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:53.982]  I'm not a Native American, even though I have some Native blood.
[00:54:53.982 --> 00:54:54.743]  I'm just an American.
[00:54:55.541 --> 00:54:56.801]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:54:56.801 --> 00:55:20.910]  And I guess I just wanted to call and say that I do support this new law in Arizona, and also I think that the rest of the states need to pass this, because if people would just wake up to what the new world order is, and the agents and tools that they use to take over our nation, then they too can break loose of this paradigm that they're stuck in.
[00:55:21.872 --> 00:55:22.473]  Exactly.
[00:55:22.473 --> 00:55:28.037]  I mean, look, the big banks, the federal government, the globalists, worldwide, the UN wants no borders.
[00:55:28.037 --> 00:55:29.498]  This is a very simple equation.
[00:55:29.498 --> 00:55:31.979]  They want to bring down wealthy western nations.
[00:55:31.979 --> 00:55:37.744]  They don't want upwardly mobile middle class people, whether it's in Japan or the United States.
[00:55:37.744 --> 00:55:38.865]  They don't care.
[00:55:38.865 --> 00:55:41.967]  And they want to bring in giant populations that are politically ignorant.
[00:55:42.387 --> 00:55:48.350]  If that's possible, Americans are pretty ignorant on average, to rewrite the way this system works.
[00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:52.431]  Because in a democracy, 51% can vote to rob the other 49.
[00:55:52.431 --> 00:55:56.973]  And they've been teaching that we're a democracy when we're a republic.
[00:55:56.973 --> 00:55:59.394]  And look, I want freedom for Mexico.
[00:55:59.394 --> 00:56:02.756]  And as long as they use the United States as a steam valve,
[00:56:03.596 --> 00:56:06.498]  For people that would be down there taking their country back.
[00:56:06.498 --> 00:56:08.999]  I mean, Mexico has never had freedom.
[00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:10.760]  And that's why freedom is so special.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.421]  Most nations have never had freedom.
[00:56:12.421 --> 00:56:14.902]  And when you get freedom, you produce incredible wealth.
[00:56:14.902 --> 00:56:18.264]  When you have tyranny, you don't have wealth for the average person.
[00:56:18.264 --> 00:56:19.845]  Anything else, Nick?
[00:56:19.845 --> 00:56:27.989]  Yes, just a quick comment just to let you know that we are waking up other Americans who are Hispanic to the New World Order.
[00:56:27.989 --> 00:56:32.772]  Everyone within earshot of my voice, please do not be afraid to use the word New World Order.
[00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:34.012]  Because that's what it is.
[00:56:34.012 --> 00:56:35.693]  It's their own word.
[00:56:35.693 --> 00:56:38.256]  And also a quick question.
[00:56:38.256 --> 00:56:49.166]  FEMA is starting to stretch out their tentacles into my local government asking local and city governments to pass an ordinance to require people to have flood insurance.
[00:56:49.557 --> 00:56:51.899]  Because of this new shaded X zone?
[00:56:51.899 --> 00:56:54.040]  I'm not really sure about it.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:54.841]  I'm familiar with it.
[00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:56.702]  Let me comment on that, Nick.
[00:56:56.702 --> 00:57:04.348]  All over the country, people who are on hilltops, who've never flooded, are being made to get flood insurance.
[00:57:04.348 --> 00:57:08.511]  And it's more total federal control.
[00:57:08.511 --> 00:57:13.815]  And we've got the federal government coming in saying they want to regulate salt now, and decide what you can eat.
[00:57:13.815 --> 00:57:15.597]  I mean, it's just that they have no jurisdiction.
[00:57:16.377 --> 00:57:22.239]  Again, the federal government does everything it has no jurisdiction to do, and doesn't do the things it has jurisdiction to do.
[00:57:22.239 --> 00:57:26.060]  Earl, in Maryland, you're on the air, Earl.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.141]  Hey, how you doing today?
[00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:29.941]  Good.
[00:57:29.941 --> 00:57:31.742]  Yeah, I've been listening to the show.
[00:57:31.742 --> 00:57:41.105]  Basically, I have been somebody, basically, in addition to Lou Chang and all that, and my opinion about everything is just
[00:57:42.066 --> 00:57:43.267]  Um, yeah.
[00:57:43.267 --> 00:57:48.332]  As far as the New World, one, I know I'm not, I'm not down for it at all.
[00:57:48.332 --> 00:57:53.757]  For real, this, it needed to be destroyed right away because it's so corrupted.
[00:57:53.757 --> 00:58:05.869]  And so many people that actually ended, like, from, like, they got the Thurber Group, um, Forbes, um, even a couple of people from, like, the Congress that ended, like, Henry Kissinger, um,
[00:58:06.468 --> 00:58:09.750]  Bill Clinton, Hillary... They're all in it.
[00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:20.376]  The entire leadership of every Western nation is part of this criminal banking cartel that can just make up any amount of money they want, backed up by taxpayers, to buy everybody off.
[00:58:20.376 --> 00:58:21.397]  It's fraud.
[00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:22.757]  It has to end.
[00:58:22.757 --> 00:58:28.581]  But instead, in the name of financial reform, and I appreciate your call, Earl, they're about to give even more power to the crooks.
[00:58:28.581 --> 00:58:29.401]  Oh, that'll teach them.
[00:58:29.401 --> 00:58:29.941]  That'll get them.
[00:58:30.942 --> 00:58:34.323]  That's like, you know, giving a serial killer ten more people to kill.
[00:58:34.323 --> 00:58:36.264]  That'll teach him.
[00:58:36.264 --> 00:58:42.567]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Matt, John, Alex, and others.
[00:58:42.567 --> 00:58:44.667]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:48.389]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.841]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.841 --> 00:58:57.425]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.425 --> 00:59:02.448]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.448 --> 00:59:07.492]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:08.012 --> 00:59:13.236]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.236 --> 00:59:15.557]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:15.557 --> 00:59:20.360]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.481]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.481 --> 00:59:24.523]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.523 --> 00:59:28.166]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:31.348]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:31.348 --> 00:59:33.589]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:34.490]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:42.376]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:42.376 --> 00:59:47.201]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:47.201 --> 00:59:53.687]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:53.687 --> 00:59:56.069]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:58.832]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:10.134]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[01:00:10.134 --> 01:00:11.715]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.715 --> 01:00:13.257]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.257 --> 01:00:17.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:30.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:33.794]  It is hour number two, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:35.118 --> 01:00:39.502]  Reverend Manning is joining us and Christina Ebersold and Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:42.625]  We're continuing with your phone calls right now.
[01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:46.368]  Let's go to... Who's up next here?
[01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:47.829]  I guess that would be Matt in Minnesota.
[01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:48.690]  You're on the air, Matt.
[01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:50.852]  Welcome.
[01:00:50.852 --> 01:00:52.133]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:52.133 --> 01:00:53.494]  Thanks for calling.
[01:00:53.494 --> 01:00:57.898]  I have a couple quick comments, one regarding Arizona and one regarding Glenn Beck.
[01:00:57.898 --> 01:01:01.501]  I think Arizona, this new legislation they passed,
[01:01:01.997 --> 01:01:14.388]  I think the Obama administration and the rest of his minions see it as a major threat because they realize that the rest of the slaves in this nation, you know, might realize the full potential of states' rights.
[01:01:14.388 --> 01:01:20.333]  That's a states' rights rebellion and there are so many ways for the states to constitutionally stand up.
[01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:26.759]  The problem is, this is one of the three things the federal government's actually empowered to do, but again, if they're not doing their duty,
[01:01:27.619 --> 01:01:31.843]  We have an inherent right that falls back to the people to protect our nation from crime.
[01:01:31.843 --> 01:01:37.508]  And the way the media is spinning it, saying they're going to have checkpoints to grab illegals, they're going to try to make them victims.
[01:01:37.508 --> 01:01:45.114]  The way this law is really written, it just says if they pull people over for drunk driving or whatever it is, and they find out they're illegal, then they're to take them to jail.
[01:01:45.114 --> 01:01:47.736]  And that's what the states are supposed to do.
[01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:50.499]  I mean, if state police or local police
[01:01:51.019 --> 01:01:54.581]  Yeah, they're definitely, they're playing the race card and illegal immigrants
[01:02:08.317 --> 01:02:11.658]  Is not a race, it's a crime.
[01:02:11.658 --> 01:02:12.998]  But that's what they're saying.
[01:02:12.998 --> 01:02:16.119]  Well, it just so happens 80% is from Mexico though, but yes.
[01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:23.000]  Yes, in fact, I wish it was a European country that bordered us that was doing this because then we would have fixed this problem a long time ago.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.901]  But you're not allowed to do that because the media gets to play the race card.
[01:02:26.901 --> 01:02:28.881]  Okay, yeah, hey, one quick comment.
[01:02:28.881 --> 01:02:33.782]  I was at the Glenn Beck Show just this Monday and I was pretty surprised.
[01:02:33.782 --> 01:02:37.803]  He said, quote, we are heading for world government
[01:02:38.587 --> 01:02:42.068]  I don't have a lot of time to monitor him, but the word is he's gotten a lot better lately.
[01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:44.909]  So I think his listeners are pressuring him to stop whitewashing.
[01:02:55.697 --> 01:02:58.778]  Yeah, he actually said the New World Order is a fact.
[01:02:58.778 --> 01:03:02.819]  And I'm just like, well, that's great you came on, but what are you going to do about that?
[01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:03.799]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:03:03.799 --> 01:03:12.741]  Limbaugh still makes jokes about world government, and if Limbaugh for the last 20 years would have been telling the truth about this, they would have never gotten away with it.
[01:03:12.741 --> 01:03:15.162]  If conservatives knew the truth, but conservatives were taught
[01:03:15.802 --> 01:03:21.907]  That it was like a religious belief to be a conservative that there's no world government and there is no big banking cartel.
[01:03:21.907 --> 01:03:23.949]  Well, look at the banking cartel now.
[01:03:23.949 --> 01:03:28.553]  They've robbed us and they're the ones calling for a world government that we pay taxes to.
[01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:30.515]  There's no more time to screw around.
[01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:39.062]  And so, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity all need to be pressured to come completely clean with everything.
[01:03:39.062 --> 01:03:40.463]  I mean, it's... Look, I had...
[01:03:41.264 --> 01:03:57.148]  Nightline here yesterday, and I had to have arguments with them that that world government's being set up And I started trying to show them Herman von rumpi and other clips And they would just then fall back and say well isn't that just countries working together No, it's a bunch of private banks creating a global corporate government.
[01:03:57.148 --> 01:04:03.850]  I mean there's there's no wiggle room It's a hundred percent, and I'm tired of being called a kook because I'm trying to defend this country.
[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:04.490]  I'm sorry go ahead
[01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.103]  No, it's understandable.
[01:04:07.103 --> 01:04:07.683]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:07.683 --> 01:04:13.184]  I was listening to Limbaugh this week, too, and he's basically sitting there defending the whole Goldman Sachs thing, too.
[01:04:13.184 --> 01:04:14.645]  I mean, he's defending them.
[01:04:14.645 --> 01:04:17.146]  No, that's his big problem.
[01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:17.766]  I know.
[01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:19.486]  He calls it free market.
[01:04:19.486 --> 01:04:26.549]  No, it's not free market to sell somebody a car and to tell them that, you know, the engine has no problems.
[01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:30.470]  When you know full well it's going to break down five miles after they leave.
[01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.411]  So, I mean, it's fraud.
[01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:33.711]  Fraud is not free market.
[01:04:35.785 --> 01:04:45.388]  Yeah, and one last comment, I just wanted to say your videos you did when you had that interview with CNN, that was awesome, and I thought that was one of the greatest things you ever did.
[01:04:45.388 --> 01:04:50.090]  Yeah, I didn't shoot anything with the interview with Nightline yesterday.
[01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:50.930]  I probably should have.
[01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.170]  I just got too tired.
[01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:56.612]  Plus, I'm having my yearly allergy attack right now in the springtime, so I'm kind of out of it.
[01:04:56.612 --> 01:04:57.232]  Thanks a lot, buddy.
[01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:57.812]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.618 --> 01:05:02.960]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.342]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:05:05.342 --> 01:05:08.544]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:05:08.544 --> 01:05:13.649]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:13.649 --> 01:05:17.852]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:18.152 --> 01:05:20.496]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:20.496 --> 01:05:23.400]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.304]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:26.304 --> 01:05:33.916]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:34.232 --> 01:05:39.633]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:39.633 --> 01:05:42.474]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:46.175]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:47.236]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:47.236 --> 01:05:48.576]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:48.576 --> 01:05:50.076]  Invisible Empire.

[01:08:01.004 --> 01:08:06.438]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.438 --> 01:08:08.703]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.315 --> 01:08:22.278]  Well, she's a movie star, a television star, and also a top Broadway star.
[01:08:22.278 --> 01:08:27.382]  Christina Ebersole got fondled by the TSA.
[01:08:27.382 --> 01:08:29.283]  She'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:08:29.283 --> 01:08:34.947]  She called me almost in tears from the airplane after she'd gone through the ordeal this weekend.
[01:08:34.947 --> 01:08:37.449]  She'll tell the story here first, coming up next hour.
[01:08:37.449 --> 01:08:42.633]  And then Judge Andrew Napolitano will be joining us in the second half of the final hour today.
[01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:43.533]  For the next 45 minutes,
[01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:52.556]  We've got Reverend Manning with us, Reverend James David Manning, atlah.org, atlah.org.
[01:08:52.556 --> 01:08:57.617]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:57.617 --> 01:09:08.700]  Reverend Manning has really drawn our attention in the last year or so, really eloquently exposing Barry Sotaro by Barack Obama.
[01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:09.959]  Okay.
[01:09:23.422 --> 01:09:29.507]  We can't 100% prove the other 99% that he did give up his US citizenship.
[01:09:29.507 --> 01:09:31.589]  He did become an Indonesian citizen.
[01:09:31.589 --> 01:09:39.695]  His real name is Barry Zitaro and that's now suddenly been in Newsweek and British newspapers and they just put it out there like it's no big deal.
[01:09:39.695 --> 01:09:46.540]  This guy has got a CIA connected mother with these big foundations and working for Geithner's dad.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.963]  He's got a classic CIA type background and
[01:09:51.184 --> 01:10:00.294]  That's what Reverend Manning is working on with his influential church in New York, in Harlem, and he's been doing research on that.
[01:10:00.294 --> 01:10:04.840]  He's going to have, I guess, a public trial, a citizen trial, to put this evidence on.
[01:10:06.221 --> 01:10:10.404]  So I wanted him to go over some of that evidence today with us.
[01:10:10.404 --> 01:10:21.713]  He is the Chief Pastor of ATLA, that stands for All the Land Anointed Holy World Missionary Church in New York City, and we really appreciate him coming on with us today.
[01:10:21.713 --> 01:10:23.735]  Good to have you here, Reverend.
[01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:26.137]  Alex, thank you so very much for having me on your broadcast today.
[01:10:26.986 --> 01:10:31.488]  Well, there's so much going on here, but I mean, let's cut right to the chase.
[01:10:31.488 --> 01:10:42.013]  I've seen a lot of evidence that he is an intelligence operative, and we know his real name is Barry Sotero, and we have a president who has a fake name, so it just gets worse and worse.
[01:10:42.013 --> 01:10:44.834]  How did you begin to research his CIA connections?
[01:10:44.834 --> 01:10:50.176]  Of course, they've been secretive about his college records, unlike any other president we've had.
[01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:50.957]  Break it down for us.
[01:10:52.082 --> 01:11:01.414]  Well, to answer the question bluntly is that the information was brought to me back in 2009 regarding the CIA connection.
[01:11:01.414 --> 01:11:09.424]  And when I first was made aware of it, I said, I'm not going to promote this or talk about it because it would make them look like you're the patriot having served America.
[01:11:09.984 --> 01:11:23.455]  During the time of the Soviet Union invasion in Afghanistan, and the Jihadis, who were trying to stave off the Russian invasion, needed some help, but the American forces could not go in.
[01:11:23.455 --> 01:11:25.016]  Troops could not go in on the ground.
[01:11:25.796 --> 01:11:40.883]  So the CIA does what it does so proficiently, is that they formed a mercenary, if you will, type of a covert operation with arms and logistics and with training for the Mujahideen.
[01:11:40.883 --> 01:11:42.823]  That Obama was integral in that.
[01:11:42.823 --> 01:11:51.187]  They recruited him out of Occidental College when he was just a sophomore there, recognizing that he had Muslim experience.
[01:11:51.187 --> 01:11:53.388]  He speaks an Islamic language, by the way.
[01:11:54.565 --> 01:11:59.661]  Uh, and he was perfect, uh, for going into Afghanistan, up in that Pakistan area.
[01:12:00.595 --> 01:12:07.779]  And I would just interrupt and add that Arab television and others have marveled that his diction and his pronunciation of Arabic is better than most Arabs.
[01:12:07.779 --> 01:12:08.840]  I mean, this guy is highly trained.
[01:12:27.179 --> 01:12:27.899]  No doubt about it.
[01:12:27.899 --> 01:12:30.580]  He's extremely well-versed and he was extremely helpful.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:39.863]  I mean, he played a major role in helping to turn that war around and ultimately the Mujahideens were able to defeat the Soviet Union.
[01:12:39.863 --> 01:12:48.986]  They later became the Taliban, which Obama was integral in organizing, but he was a great asset to the Afghan and to the CIA and American people.
[01:12:48.986 --> 01:12:50.527]  Okay, what evidence do you have of this?
[01:12:51.547 --> 01:13:01.467]  Well, you know, I can only state that, as I stated there, Alex, I'm just not able to go beyond that, but I'm going to demonstrate in that trial that we do have substantial evidence.
[01:13:02.622 --> 01:13:10.586]  Well, I mean, I know he was in Pakistan, he was in Afghanistan, he had his records have been sealed, he had all these different names he was using.
[01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:15.828]  We know his mother was involved in intelligence at some level through these foundations.
[01:13:15.828 --> 01:13:22.992]  So, I mean, I see evidence there on the surface, but you're saying you have been given bonafide, bulletproof,
[01:13:23.892 --> 01:13:31.017]  I mean, tell us what you can about the evidence without getting into it.
[01:13:31.017 --> 01:13:33.159]  I mean, why this evidence is so documented?
[01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:47.709]  One of the things that I think that we have that's most telling is that he was not a student in the traditional or the non-traditional way at Columbia University or Columbia College for two years, as he states that he was, and they awarded him.
[01:13:48.309 --> 01:13:50.091]  And conferred upon him a degree.
[01:13:50.091 --> 01:13:51.192]  He was not there.
[01:13:51.192 --> 01:13:55.275]  In any circumstance can he demonstrate that he was there?
[01:13:55.275 --> 01:14:09.007]  I think that what we can demonstrate is that he made a statement, which was not a part of his dream from his father's book, or any other statement during the campaign, that he traveled to Pakistan in 1981.
[01:14:09.007 --> 01:14:13.972]  I've spoken to several other people who were part of the Marxist club in Occidental.
[01:14:14.572 --> 01:14:24.856]  Who identified Obama with several friends from the Pakistan-Afghanistan area, and I believe it was those people who introduced Obama.
[01:14:24.856 --> 01:14:36.380]  None of these people have ever uttered one word about their college friend, about the person who's now gone on to become president, the special host, another person, Philip Boren.
[01:14:38.152 --> 01:14:45.560]  They've not uttered one word in a two-year period about this individual, Obama, and he's gone on to become president.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.442]  You can't get an interview out of them.
[01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:55.371]  But they certainly were integral in introducing him to become part of the Afghan Mujahideen.
[01:14:58.564 --> 01:15:13.214]  Well, we know that Tony Blair, and this has been declassified, was MI6, and we know that they do get people, in fact the new film, Ghostwriter, is basically about Tony Blair being CIA.
[01:15:14.435 --> 01:15:17.716]  And that's the main reason they went ahead and picked up Roman Polanski.
[01:15:17.716 --> 01:15:22.478]  I was first told that by an actor who knows some of these people.
[01:15:22.478 --> 01:15:24.598]  And now it's... I went and saw the film.
[01:15:24.598 --> 01:15:25.799]  It's amazing.
[01:15:25.799 --> 01:15:31.521]  But it separately has been for the last five years in mainstream British news that he was MI6.
[01:15:31.521 --> 01:15:37.623]  So that fits the model of how they get them in college and then groom them to be prime ministers, to be
[01:15:39.043 --> 01:15:40.044]  I don't know.
[01:15:51.377 --> 01:16:02.006]  The other thing that we need to make note of, not only Tony Blair being a part of the intelligence agency, but Vladimir Putin as well, was in the high echelon of the KGB.
[01:16:02.006 --> 01:16:12.635]  So it appears that the major world powers over the last decade or so have been involved in bringing people out of the intelligence business into the leadership of the nation.
[01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:18.620]  That's right, and it's also been declassified that when Clinton, Bill Clinton was over in
[01:16:20.102 --> 01:16:20.783]  England.
[01:16:20.783 --> 01:16:24.710]  He was being run by the CIA section chiefs there when he was a Rhodes Scholar.
[01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:27.896]  So it just... I mean, we see how this takeover works.
[01:16:27.896 --> 01:16:32.345]  You got Bush, elder, being director of the CIA, and then of course his son being president.
[01:16:33.746 --> 01:16:47.678]  What we've been able to demonstrate is that there is, of course, Obama did not attend Patrice Lumumba School in Moscow, a school that was founded by the Russian government to spread Marxism throughout the continent of Africa.
[01:16:47.678 --> 01:16:55.985]  What they picked up is nobody who was the head of the Congo, a young man at 34 years of age, made him a great hero and Russia built a school onto him.
[01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:56.766]  I'm good.
[01:17:07.597 --> 01:17:26.206]  What we have not looked at as the American people is that the universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and others, they bring in people from other nations and give them honorary degrees, or honorable degrees rather, PhDs, or master's degrees, and then send them back into their nations.
[01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:29.228]  And many of these people are not really qualified to receive those types.
[01:17:29.588 --> 01:17:33.330]  Well, we know that Yale and Harvard almost 100% founded the OSS and CIA, and Skull & Bones was an integral part of that.
[01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:35.911]  It was already a private, opium-dealing intelligence agency that just became our CIA.
[01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.745]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:59.946]  And Yale in particular.
[01:17:59.946 --> 01:18:18.334]  And these universities have been involved in the actions of intelligence, recruiting students, because they have the opportunity to go in in a benign way, as if they're about the business of education, and they can select leaders, children, and other people from other nations, and make them important and integral.
[01:18:18.334 --> 01:18:20.495]  And then the next thing you know, you've got a nation.
[01:18:21.395 --> 01:18:24.298]  Well, no, that's actually been confirmed that these groups are based out of the U.S.
[01:18:24.298 --> 01:18:30.963]  and England, and then our people trained here in the West to go do that, and that's what these major nations do.
[01:18:30.963 --> 01:18:35.266]  But, Reverend, I mean, when is the trial, and are you saying you have other evidence?
[01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:51.292]  Yes, I have.
[01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:52.073]  Yes, I do.
[01:18:52.073 --> 01:18:56.297]  The trial is scheduled for the 14th of May, Alex.
[01:18:56.297 --> 01:18:58.279]  We have two programs going.
[01:18:58.279 --> 01:19:08.651]  We've got the trial going, and I need to let everyone know that this trial is not some sort of a mock or moot or kangaroo trial without any power constitutionally.
[01:19:09.346 --> 01:19:21.352]  We have the right under the 10th Amendment, if we feel that the federal government or the state government have not brought us, given us access to due process, then the right falls to the people to proceed.
[01:19:21.352 --> 01:19:29.315]  And we're proceeding under that right, that we have not been given due process, and we can demonstrate that there have been cases presented to the U.S.
[01:19:29.315 --> 01:19:35.178]  Supreme Court that have been primarily dismissed based on a flimsy statement of whether or not someone has standing.
[01:19:35.818 --> 01:19:39.201]  So we're moving forward under the 10th Amendment.
[01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:40.722]  We believe we've got an excellent case.
[01:19:40.722 --> 01:19:41.362]  We've got proof.
[01:19:41.362 --> 01:19:43.163]  We've got documented evidence.
[01:19:43.163 --> 01:19:45.825]  And we believe we can convict Obama.
[01:19:45.825 --> 01:19:48.267]  Let's talk about the specifics of the upcoming trial.
[01:19:48.267 --> 01:19:50.048]  Will it be televised on the internet?
[01:19:50.048 --> 01:19:53.911]  How do we find out more with Reverend James David Manning?
[01:19:53.911 --> 01:19:57.533]  We're also going to open the phones up specifically for the Reverend.

[01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:31.771]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.771 --> 01:22:36.334]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.334 --> 01:22:42.159]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.159 --> 01:22:45.801]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.801 --> 01:22:48.523]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.523 --> 01:22:53.587]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.587 --> 01:22:53.867]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.429 --> 01:23:00.892]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:02.654]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:23:02.654 --> 01:23:03.995]  How would that make you feel?
[01:23:03.995 --> 01:23:05.716]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:23:05.716 --> 01:23:08.258]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:23:08.258 --> 01:23:15.823]  Then my real health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:23:15.823 --> 01:23:17.304]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:23:17.304 --> 01:23:20.066]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:23:20.066 --> 01:23:25.090]  I started taking heart and body extract and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:30.614]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:35.718]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:35.718 --> 01:23:38.140]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.461]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:48.187]  I did not expect this at all.
[01:23:48.187 --> 01:23:52.911]  By the 7th, 8th and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Hardened Body Extract.
[01:23:52.911 --> 01:23:56.213]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Hardened Body Extract.
[01:24:04.232 --> 01:24:13.561]  I want to get into other issues with Reverend Manning, the Tea Parties, what Barry Sitaro is up to, but you got cut off by the break.
[01:24:13.561 --> 01:24:16.344]  Will we be able to watch the trial?
[01:24:16.344 --> 01:24:20.328]  How's it going to be prepared?
[01:24:20.328 --> 01:24:26.975]  We're not going to do any live streaming of the trial for one reason and one reason only.
[01:24:27.915 --> 01:24:54.841]  In order to make the trial an effective event, we need people to come to New York to put boots on the ground in and around Columbia University, because the second thing that we have not been able to talk about is that we're planning a march around Columbia University for a period of seven days, demonstrating that they were complicit in everything that Obama has done, and they conferred a degree upon him in violation of state laws and federal laws.
[01:24:56.522 --> 01:24:59.305]  But if we were to televise it, then probably people would not come.
[01:24:59.305 --> 01:25:14.780]  In order to make it effective, we've come to the understanding that people need to be here in large numbers to speak loudly, to witness this issue, and at that point we can force the press to begin to deal with it in a way that's appreciable.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:19.624]  Now, what form of citizen's grand jury or citizen's trial is this?
[01:25:20.737 --> 01:25:22.619]  I mean, who would be the judge?
[01:25:38.972 --> 01:25:39.632]  We're good to go.
[01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:00.883]  A large number of people.
[01:26:00.883 --> 01:26:01.983]  This is a trial.
[01:26:01.983 --> 01:26:03.804]  This is not a grand jury.
[01:26:03.804 --> 01:26:06.486]  We're expecting to affect the verdict, and we never know.
[01:26:06.486 --> 01:26:13.949]  We're asking people in the community here in Harlem and every place else around America to participate in the trial.
[01:26:13.949 --> 01:26:16.871]  We expect a guilty verdict, but this is not a grand jury hearing.
[01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.151]  This is an actual trial.
[01:26:18.151 --> 01:26:19.492]  Okay, okay.
[01:26:19.492 --> 01:26:20.473]  I'm sorry I'm ignorant of that.
[01:26:20.473 --> 01:26:22.974]  That's why we've got you here, so I can find out exactly what's going on.
[01:26:22.974 --> 01:26:25.095]  So, I mean, how big is the jury going to be?
[01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:30.013]  Well, I think the petite jury is 12 members.
[01:26:30.013 --> 01:26:34.780]  In a criminal case, you would need at least that many members to render a verdict.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.344]  And that's exactly how we're going to proceed.
[01:26:37.344 --> 01:26:39.707]  Are you going to randomly select them from those that arrive?
[01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:44.804]  Well, what we're going to do is that we're going to go through a jury selection process.
[01:26:44.804 --> 01:26:51.871]  We've got, at present, I think about 60 people who have volunteered from across America to serve as jurors.
[01:26:51.871 --> 01:26:56.415]  And once they're here, we're going to, on the first day of the trial, the process will be to select jurors.
[01:26:56.415 --> 01:27:00.819]  The defense will have an opportunity to select jurors, and we'll select jurors as well.
[01:27:00.819 --> 01:27:03.441]  And what is the trial trying to find?
[01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:04.142]  What are the charges?
[01:27:05.148 --> 01:27:10.630]  The charges are that Obama was not a U.S.
[01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:29.777]  citizen, and therefore his advent at Columbia University was under the name, or at least under a foreign, if you will, national status, yet they conferred a degree upon him while he was not at the school.
[01:27:30.397 --> 01:27:30.697]  I'm good.
[01:27:46.255 --> 01:27:47.756]  And it demonstrates that he was not a U.S.
[01:27:47.756 --> 01:27:55.240]  citizen, one of the reasons why Columbia proceeded with him and the CIA proceeded with him as they did.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:05.286]  But once we demonstrate that he did not receive that degree under normal circumstances, then a crime took place and everything that he has done
[01:28:06.066 --> 01:28:14.531]  Since then, having acknowledged that degree and Columbia University, they have been in conspiracy, even to the point of him being president.
[01:28:14.531 --> 01:28:19.454]  Because if they knew at the time that he was at Columbia that he was not a U.S.
[01:28:19.454 --> 01:28:27.558]  citizen, yet they've allowed him to proceed to the presidency without—they have a duty to inform the American people.
[01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:30.880]  And you may have noticed that Columbia was extremely silent.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:37.946]  During the time of Obama's primary and general election campaign, they've been extremely startled about him throughout the process.
[01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:39.787]  They have not spoken about him.
[01:28:39.787 --> 01:28:47.074]  And no president, Michael Sovereign, who is the president, who presently still teaches at Columbia, has not come forward.
[01:28:47.074 --> 01:28:54.940]  The man graduated, pardon me, the man is a full graduate that he met all the requirements, Lee Bollinger, who's there.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:59.224]  No one has come forward because they cannot come forward, and we can demonstrate that.
[01:29:00.874 --> 01:29:02.581]  Shifting gears, we're about to go to break.
[01:29:04.033 --> 01:29:13.297]  We see the media, I had Nightline here yesterday, and they asked me, they said, your criticism of the government, aren't you concerned it's going to generate violence?
[01:29:13.297 --> 01:29:22.440]  And we've seen the GEICO spokesman's now lost his job for it, you know, calling up the Tea Party saying it's going to be your fault when somebody gets killed.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.382]  And we see Bill Clinton saying, you know, there's going to be another Oklahoma City and it's going to be your fault.
[01:29:27.382 --> 01:29:30.984]  I really see them setting the stage for staged terror attacks.
[01:29:31.644 --> 01:29:42.031]  Here in the United States to be blamed on the American people, and I want to talk to you about the race card and how the media is starting to play it, and get your take on where all of this is going.
[01:29:42.031 --> 01:29:51.317]  Reverend James David Manning is our guest, and whatever you think of this trial, it's certainly going to draw attention to the fact that Barack Obama is an Indonesian citizen.
[01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:55.240]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.921]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.681 --> 01:30:05.986]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:30:05.986 --> 01:30:08.769]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:30:08.769 --> 01:30:13.253]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:30:14.093 --> 01:30:18.555]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:31:01.104 --> 01:31:04.105]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.105 --> 01:31:09.446]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.446 --> 01:31:11.487]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.487 --> 01:31:16.488]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.488 --> 01:31:17.669]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:18.409]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.789 --> 01:31:20.670]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:21.751]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:23.952]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.952 --> 01:31:25.293]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.293 --> 01:31:26.814]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:32.098]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.098 --> 01:31:35.220]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:39.483]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.483 --> 01:31:40.704]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:41.624]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.624 --> 01:31:42.725]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.725 --> 01:31:43.646]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.646 --> 01:31:44.747]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.747 --> 01:31:47.809]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.809 --> 01:31:49.590]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:50.491]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:01.428 --> 01:32:09.914]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:32:09.914 --> 01:32:20.803]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:32:20.803 --> 01:32:26.247]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:32:26.787 --> 01:32:31.690]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:40.756]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:32:40.756 --> 01:32:50.863]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:32:50.863 --> 01:32:54.546]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:54.546 --> 01:32:55.546]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:17.142]  We're going to take a few calls for Reverend Manning.
[01:33:17.142 --> 01:33:20.864]  If you've got questions for him, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:20.864 --> 01:33:21.224]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:21.224 --> 01:33:26.346]  We're going to go to Jeff and others that are holding for him here in just a moment.
[01:33:26.346 --> 01:33:33.629]  But before we go back to Reverend Manning of ATLA.org, who's been an effective critic of Barry Sotaro, a.k.a.
[01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:40.212]  Barack Obama, who's really the front man for the globalist takeover of the republic here in their final phase.
[01:33:41.552 --> 01:33:41.752]  I don't
[01:33:58.759 --> 01:34:22.532]  It's all there in police state for the rise of FEMA two plus hours long 30 minutes of extras on one DVD and your purchase also makes this radio broadcast possible and of course we have invisible empire new order to find Jason Burmess's new excellent Documentary two plus hours itself going into the history of the globalist their current operations all the different crime operations their narcotics trafficking the sex rings
[01:34:23.593 --> 01:34:23.953]  Uh, yeah.
[01:34:42.273 --> 01:34:42.954]  We're good to go.
[01:35:10.877 --> 01:35:14.218]  Shifting gears, I mean, you heard my question going into the break.
[01:35:14.218 --> 01:35:15.879]  I did.
[01:35:15.879 --> 01:35:30.584]  So, for those that just joined us, recapping, what do you see in developments with Homeland Security demonizing conservatives, libertarians, Christians, anti-abortion people, claiming we're terrorists and that we're now the biggest threat?
[01:35:30.584 --> 01:35:32.785]  They're not really worried about Al-Qaeda anymore.
[01:35:32.785 --> 01:35:36.227]  Now the American people are supposedly the terrorists.
[01:35:36.227 --> 01:35:39.928]  Well, I think that one of the things that we're concerned about with the trials here in Harlem
[01:35:40.661 --> 01:35:58.933]  Um, is that there would be possibly the opportunity for either Homeland Security, FEMA, or the CIA to incite riotous responses to the trial, uh, to get the community stirred up, uh, to oppose it, uh, and, and, and destroy it on that wide.
[01:35:58.933 --> 01:36:00.554]  I don't think that is going to happen.
[01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:10.161]  A number of people have spoken to me and stated that this is going to invoke the anger and the amnesty of black people like you won't believe and you're holding it in Harlem.
[01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:11.942]  But Alex, I can tell you this.
[01:36:11.942 --> 01:36:15.605]  I mean, I've lived in Harlem for 28 years, for 30 years.
[01:36:15.605 --> 01:36:17.586]  I've been a pastor for 28 years.
[01:36:17.586 --> 01:36:27.573]  And black people and Harlem, we're not of the riotous kind of behavior that we may have been in the 1960s or even the 70s.
[01:36:27.573 --> 01:36:32.036]  And the reasons for riotous behavior do not exist as they once did.
[01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:33.497]  I am convinced
[01:36:34.037 --> 01:36:49.401]  That unless the CIA, and I don't think they have a lot of influence with black people, I mean, they infiltrated the FBI, infiltrated the Black Panthers and other organizations that were anti-American that were able to incite Raj's behavior.
[01:36:49.401 --> 01:36:54.783]  I don't think we're going to have any kind of this Raj's behavior as a result of this trial, I believe.
[01:36:55.706 --> 01:37:05.682]  That what will take place is that the community will stand back and observe, listen to the truth, and make their own decisions as to whether or not this matter is true or not true.
[01:37:05.682 --> 01:37:07.525]  But I don't see it being a riot.
[01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:16.076]  Okay, to be clear, I wasn't really implying, in fact, I wasn't even thinking about your situation in New York.
[01:37:16.076 --> 01:37:30.391]  I was just wanting to get your overall view and see if you agree that they're really demonizing the Tea Party and anybody else that criticizes Obama, implying that any criticism is going to lead to violence, and so they're trying to chill free speech.
[01:37:31.451 --> 01:37:34.014]  Absolutely, no doubt about it.
[01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:39.219]  Bill Maher said that the Tea Party was nothing more than a Klan rally a couple of weeks ago.
[01:37:39.219 --> 01:37:53.795]  The way to remove the effectiveness of the Tea Party is to demonize them, to make them a, if you will, an extreme right-wing group that's anti-black, anti-white.
[01:37:54.375 --> 01:37:54.695]  Absolutely.
[01:37:54.695 --> 01:37:58.337]  I mean, are you concerned about false flag terror to be blamed on the American people?
[01:38:24.704 --> 01:38:31.737]  Well, you know, this testing of a nuclear device in Nevada during the days of the trial, I do have some concerns about that.
[01:38:31.737 --> 01:38:37.688]  Our event organizer, Helen Tandy, has been following up on this and trying to find it, determine as much information
[01:38:38.632 --> 01:38:41.895]  You're talking about Northcom NLE 010.
[01:38:41.895 --> 01:38:45.840]  We have a new article with the latest developments at InfoWars.com for those that just joined us.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.744]  Secret FEMA documents were leaked, confirmed to be real, in the last month.
[01:38:49.744 --> 01:38:57.752]  For those that just joined us again, I'm just recapping this, where the government was going to have secret, unannounced simulations of nukes going off.
[01:38:57.752 --> 01:38:58.033]  Go ahead.
[01:38:58.857 --> 01:39:04.263]  Yeah, and their schedule is slated for the days that we're planning on holding the trial.
[01:39:04.263 --> 01:39:07.507]  Now, whether that's a coincidence or not, I don't think so.
[01:39:07.507 --> 01:39:17.999]  I think that the Obama administration, the CIA, and other agencies, both national and international governments, are very concerned about what will be the outcome of this trial.
[01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:20.720]  They know I can demonstrate the evidence.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:30.062]  What they're going to have to try to do is either to stop it with something that's a false flag or let it go through and then come what may in this nation.
[01:39:30.062 --> 01:39:31.082]  I don't think they're going to do that.
[01:39:31.082 --> 01:39:34.503]  I think they're going to try something that's a false flag.
[01:39:34.503 --> 01:39:38.925]  Well, they want a false flag to demonize everybody and obviously demonize you as well.
[01:39:38.925 --> 01:39:43.906]  Let's remind folks, you did get visited by Homeland Security and New York Police.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:48.422]  They've become more sophisticated now.
[01:39:48.422 --> 01:39:55.868]  They're visiting our church as potential worshippers, members, that kind of a thing now.
[01:39:55.868 --> 01:39:58.329]  And we're getting a nice flux of them coming through.
[01:39:58.329 --> 01:39:59.610]  But you can tell they're CIA.
[01:39:59.610 --> 01:40:00.291]  It's kind of hard.
[01:40:00.291 --> 01:40:06.415]  Once you go through that indoctrination process of being a CIA agent, it's hard to get that look out of your eyes, you know.
[01:40:06.415 --> 01:40:07.596]  But they're coming now.
[01:40:07.596 --> 01:40:12.299]  They're surveying what we're doing there, looking for appointments to talk with me.
[01:40:12.299 --> 01:40:13.160]  They have not stopped.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:21.985]  And their attempts to either discredit me or to find some way to weaken me or to out me, which they've not been able to do.
[01:40:21.985 --> 01:40:27.988]  Alright, let's take a few phone calls here in the last few minutes we have left with Reverend James David Manning.
[01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:29.369]  Let's talk to Jeff in Texas.
[01:40:29.369 --> 01:40:30.649]  You're on the air, Jeff.
[01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:33.931]  Hey, I have a couple of quick questions.
[01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:39.715]  First one, and I would like Alex and the Reverend to both share their comments on this, if it's possible.
[01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:50.775]  The Obama thing, even if all this is proven, if all this, you know, he wasn't an American citizen, all that goes through, can't the Obama, can't they just hide behind
[01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:55.253]  The fact that he's married to an American citizen, that he fathered children in America?
[01:40:55.253 --> 01:40:57.834]  No, no, not under federal law.
[01:40:57.834 --> 01:41:01.877]  Under federal law, you've got to be natural born, meaning both parents and born here.
[01:41:01.877 --> 01:41:08.221]  And, you know, they can argue and say, well, he really wasn't born in Kenya, even though we have... In fact, cue that up.
[01:41:08.221 --> 01:41:15.586]  Michelle Obama, what, two weeks ago, coming out and saying that, you know, they went back to Kenya, his home country.
[01:41:15.586 --> 01:41:18.288]  I mean, we've got his grandmother saying it.
[01:41:18.288 --> 01:41:19.089]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:32.658]  What can't be disproven, and what is a fact, is he is an Indonesian citizen, and that you can't give up your citizenship and then become a president later.
[01:41:32.658 --> 01:41:35.700]  That is an absolute fact.
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:39.082]  And so it's the Barry Sitaro issue that's unstoppable.
[01:41:39.082 --> 01:41:40.042]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:40.042 --> 01:41:49.849]  We'll get Reverend Manning's comment on this in just a moment, but let's play this short clip of her on national television saying that he went back and visited his home country of Kenya.
[01:41:50.469 --> 01:41:57.792]  Which is still plaguing so many of our communities, which you all know a lot of that is due to homophobia.
[01:41:57.792 --> 01:42:00.213]  Barack has led by example.
[01:42:00.213 --> 01:42:07.816]  When we took our trip to Africa and visited his home country in Kenya, we took a public HIV test.
[01:42:07.816 --> 01:42:12.098]  Alright, Reverend Manning, I mean his approval rating continues to sink.
[01:42:12.098 --> 01:42:16.060]  Everything they're trying to push through is in trouble.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.761]  Your take on the state of Barry Sotaro?
[01:42:19.718 --> 01:42:21.279]  First of all, you're absolutely right.
[01:42:21.279 --> 01:42:26.903]  There is no way on God's Earth that Obama could ever demonstrate he's a natural-born citizen.
[01:42:26.903 --> 01:42:27.984]  It cannot happen.
[01:42:27.984 --> 01:42:32.027]  The Beresford-Turrow incident and being a citizen in Indonesia is absolutely correct.
[01:42:32.027 --> 01:42:46.899]  But the other thing I think is important is that I believe that Michelle's statement, the fist bumper Obama, regarding his homeland in Kenya was an attempt to begin to leak information because they realized the pressure that's being placed upon the administration
[01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:48.140]  We're good to go.
[01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:05.293]  No, I mean that's basically, I mean that's basically it.
[01:43:05.293 --> 01:43:13.362]  I've suddenly in the last two months seen a whole bunch, more than ten, mainly British, but some US newspapers just slip it in.
[01:43:13.362 --> 01:43:17.027]  Oh, his Indonesian friends remember him, he's Barry Sitaro.
[01:43:17.027 --> 01:43:19.390]  So they're really starting to just quietly let it out.
[01:43:20.521 --> 01:43:21.482]  Absolutely.
[01:43:21.482 --> 01:43:28.145]  And thinking that perhaps in doing so, that the American people will become accustomed to it and would be willing to move on.
[01:43:28.145 --> 01:43:41.112]  Now, the other thing is that a number of people are, again, stating that you just cannot remove a sitting president without, especially the alleged first African-American one, without having a major uprising in America.
[01:43:41.112 --> 01:43:42.293]  That's not true.
[01:43:42.293 --> 01:43:44.994]  It just isn't true at all.
[01:43:44.994 --> 01:43:47.456]  But they are leaking information trying to
[01:43:48.416 --> 01:43:55.719]  I'm convinced that the effect of this trial and other events as well are forcing them to try to destroy the information that I have.
[01:43:55.719 --> 01:43:59.141]  That's why I'm very concerned about what I think.
[01:43:59.141 --> 01:44:00.981]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Illinois.
[01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:01.782]  You're on the air, Tony.
[01:44:01.782 --> 01:44:03.703]  Yeah, hello.
[01:44:03.703 --> 01:44:04.323]  Oh, man.
[01:44:04.323 --> 01:44:05.243]  Thank you, Pastor Manny.
[01:44:05.243 --> 01:44:06.744]  Thank you so much for doing this.
[01:44:06.744 --> 01:44:08.524]  I'm so proud of you doing this.
[01:44:08.524 --> 01:44:10.165]  I'm wearing my Bracelet Charles shirt today.
[01:44:10.165 --> 01:44:11.826]  I'm pride walking downtown Chicago.
[01:44:11.826 --> 01:44:14.567]  People are looking at me and everything, but my question is what
[01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:17.384]  What do you plan to do if he is found guilty?
[01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.912]  Do you plan to get him and his party?
[01:44:19.782 --> 01:44:23.305]  Yeah, how will you enforce this?
[01:44:23.305 --> 01:44:29.370]  Because the government's going to... I understand your Tenth Amendment argument, and it certainly holds quite a bit of weight.
[01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:34.034]  If other remedies have been ignored, it reverts to the people under the Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:37.777]  But, I mean, obviously, they're going to ignore this, and they're going to try to ignore it in the media.
[01:44:37.777 --> 01:44:41.080]  If we can get it out in the media, then it becomes more dangerous for them.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.281]  But, I mean, let's say you do.
[01:44:42.281 --> 01:44:46.704]  You know, the jury does say, you know, he's found guilty.
[01:44:46.704 --> 01:44:47.165]  What happens?
[01:44:48.442 --> 01:44:52.665]  The 10th Amendment, you're right, does hold quite a bit of weight in this matter.
[01:44:52.665 --> 01:45:07.474]  But Alex, were I to see you committing a crime, murder, or any crime for that matter, and I reported you to the authorities, and the authorities took no action, you'd have to wonder what's going on in our nation.
[01:45:07.474 --> 01:45:14.038]  We're going to demonstrate at this trial, we're going to have people testify to crimes that were committed.
[01:45:14.038 --> 01:45:16.660]  We're going to demonstrate, document it, that crimes did take place.
[01:45:17.316 --> 01:45:21.698]  And we're going to present this information to the government, and they will have to take some sort of action.
[01:45:21.698 --> 01:45:31.143]  But the other thing I think is critical is that if we get boots on the ground, the more people we have come to witness this trial over a period of seven days,
[01:45:32.436 --> 01:45:37.960]  The more we'll have in terms of leverage to force the media to begin to deal with it.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:45.866]  I think just having a bunch of white folk marching through Harlem, I don't care if you only got 500, is going to cause the media to want to come up and find out what's going on.
[01:45:45.866 --> 01:45:53.011]  But having said that, you know, if I see you committing a crime, Alex, I report you, you're going to jail.
[01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:55.590]  Absolutely.
[01:45:55.590 --> 01:46:05.453]  Okay, Tony, I appreciate your call and I'm glad you got the Barry Sitaro shirts that we sell that supports us financially, but more importantly, people will come up and ask you what it means.
[01:46:05.453 --> 01:46:12.735]  I mean, have you had folks, Tony, if you're still there, come to you and say, why does that say Barry Sitaro?
[01:46:12.735 --> 01:46:13.735]  No, they were just looking at me.
[01:46:13.735 --> 01:46:17.536]  I'm a bald-headed Latino, so a lot of people were just like looking at me, but you know what?
[01:46:17.536 --> 01:46:17.976]  I don't care.
[01:46:17.976 --> 01:46:18.937]  It gets the point across.
[01:46:20.322 --> 01:46:26.946]  They have a Wall Street vs Main Street Rally today and I went there and a lot of people were looking at me over there but they were kind of understanding.
[01:46:26.946 --> 01:46:29.008]  They didn't ask me questions, I would have told them.
[01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:32.470]  There is a reason why there really are no jobs.
[01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:34.351]  The banks bailed them out.
[01:46:34.351 --> 01:46:39.735]  They walked past the Federal Reserve and they were all screaming, the banks got bailed out, we got sold out.
[01:46:43.812 --> 01:46:44.912]  Well, that's what's sick about it.
[01:46:44.912 --> 01:46:56.398]  He's totally owned by these people, and he's proposing now this new banking regulation that gives them more power, and Blank Fine, the king rat, is running around saying he's for this legislation.
[01:46:56.398 --> 01:46:57.998]  That should be everything we need to know.
[01:46:57.998 --> 01:46:59.059]  I appreciate your call, Tony.
[01:46:59.059 --> 01:47:00.139]  Very exciting.
[01:47:00.139 --> 01:47:01.800]  Let's go to Damien in Missouri.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.320]  You're on the air.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.621]  Go ahead, Damien.
[01:47:03.621 --> 01:47:04.562]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:47:04.562 --> 01:47:07.043]  I appreciate you having the paper on today.
[01:47:07.043 --> 01:47:07.243]  You bet.
[01:47:10.678 --> 01:47:16.160]  There's been a lot of rumors about Obama being a homosexual.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:28.603]  I kind of wanted to get the pastor's thoughts on that, as well as Michelle Obama being like a front for him.
[01:47:28.603 --> 01:47:30.084]  I'm going to hang up and listen.
[01:47:30.084 --> 01:47:31.224]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[01:47:31.224 --> 01:47:32.724]  Okay, appreciate the call.
[01:47:32.724 --> 01:47:36.785]  Well, if he's not gay, then he's in the minority in Washington.
[01:47:36.785 --> 01:47:38.266]  That just seems to be the way it goes.
[01:47:44.827 --> 01:48:03.553]  My take on this is that I find it highly unusual for someone as striking, as tall, well-spoken, and suave as Obama, for him not to have had some other woman to encounter dating other than Michelle the Piss Pumper Obama.
[01:48:03.553 --> 01:48:05.374]  I cannot, I cannot believe
[01:48:06.306 --> 01:48:12.067]  That he could have spent his entire life, and only one woman has come forward, or one woman that we know about.
[01:48:12.067 --> 01:48:12.687]  Exactly!
[01:48:12.687 --> 01:48:14.948]  I mean, I'm not as good looking as Obama.
[01:48:14.948 --> 01:48:20.789]  I mean, I'm just average looking, and I mean, I've had a shameful amount of girlfriends, quite frankly.
[01:48:20.789 --> 01:48:25.209]  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, Alex.
[01:48:25.209 --> 01:48:26.850]  I have no comment, though.
[01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:28.930]  But I mean, seriously, that's another good point.
[01:48:28.930 --> 01:48:33.611]  Everybody around him is quiet, no one talks about what he did earlier in his life, and where are the other women?
[01:48:34.284 --> 01:48:39.507]  Well, Alex, what we do have, we do have some people stating that they were involved in an homosexual relationship with him.
[01:48:39.507 --> 01:48:50.673]  One being Larry Sinclair, of course, and if you have ever seen a picture of him and Sadiki sitting on that couch, that is a very unnatural position for two men to be in, unless they are gay.
[01:48:50.673 --> 01:49:00.678]  And now this young fella, Reggie Love, 21-year-old, who is now Obama's very special assistant, carries his cigarette for him, shoots hoops with him in the gym.
[01:49:02.519 --> 01:49:07.042]  You gotta wonder what on earth is going on here with this man.
[01:49:07.042 --> 01:49:09.003]  Maybe he's Batman's Robin?
[01:49:09.003 --> 01:49:12.766]  I don't think so.
[01:49:12.766 --> 01:49:15.308]  I think they're lovers, in fact.
[01:49:15.308 --> 01:49:17.369]  I think most people know that.
[01:49:17.369 --> 01:49:21.592]  As Obama, by the way, the outing of information, as you might remember,
[01:49:22.694 --> 01:49:28.456]  Anderson Cooper was one who outed the information, or at least allowed Obama to leak the information that he was still smoking cigarettes.
[01:49:28.456 --> 01:49:30.797]  Because, I mean, he's smoking cigarettes in the White House.
[01:49:30.797 --> 01:49:33.619]  There's just no way he could continue to hide that.
[01:49:33.619 --> 01:49:39.321]  Anderson Cooper did an interview which allowed Obama to gently break the information that he's trying his best to not.
[01:49:40.387 --> 01:49:44.150]  Uh, to not smoke, but sometimes he falls off the wagon.
[01:49:44.150 --> 01:49:50.475]  Uh, I see the same thing happening now regarding the Barrister Toro issue, that there's no way he can defend.
[01:49:50.475 --> 01:49:57.119]  And this trial, Alex, will demonstrate, if nothing more, that this man is not a natural-born citizen.
[01:49:57.119 --> 01:49:58.640]  There is no way.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.922]  The evidence has never been presented at a trial.
[01:50:00.922 --> 01:50:02.903]  There have been documents presented to the U.S.
[01:50:02.903 --> 01:50:03.484]  Supreme Court.
[01:50:03.484 --> 01:50:04.845]  They've been rejected.
[01:50:04.845 --> 01:50:09.208]  And so, therefore, no evidence has been able—no trial has been had.
[01:50:09.907 --> 01:50:11.607]  This will demonstrate this man is not a U.S.
[01:50:11.607 --> 01:50:12.267]  citizen.
[01:50:12.267 --> 01:50:14.848]  The American people would then know it.
[01:50:14.848 --> 01:50:33.671]  Well, I tell you, Reverend, I appreciate you spending this time with us today, and I'll certainly try to get some reports as we build up towards the citizen trial that you're having, and regardless, it'll certainly bring out these issues, and we appreciate your courage, because love him or hate him, and I happen to like him, he's got a lot of courage.
[01:50:33.671 --> 01:50:35.632]  Otla.org is the website.
[01:50:35.632 --> 01:50:37.492]  We'll talk to you again soon, Reverend Manning.
[01:50:38.786 --> 01:50:39.427]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:50:39.427 --> 01:50:40.388]  Thank you so very much.
[01:50:40.388 --> 01:50:41.048]  God bless you.
[01:50:41.048 --> 01:50:42.149]  Godspeed.
[01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:43.330]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:43.330 --> 01:50:45.052]  More and more people standing up and speaking out.
[01:50:45.052 --> 01:50:47.675]  They can't silence us all.
[01:50:47.675 --> 01:50:58.886]  And, you know, will Obama be outed like the senator was, Lindsey Graham, who now has torpedoed the whole globalist agenda?
[01:51:01.274 --> 01:51:02.555]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.555 --> 01:51:08.159]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.159 --> 01:51:13.162]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.162 --> 01:51:18.206]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.746 --> 01:51:23.970]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:26.271]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.271 --> 01:51:31.074]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.074 --> 01:51:32.195]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.195 --> 01:51:35.277]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.277 --> 01:51:38.900]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:42.082]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.082 --> 01:51:44.303]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:51.827 --> 01:51:57.928]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.928 --> 01:52:01.109]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:53:39.062 --> 01:53:40.483]  What have you got to lose?

[01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:17.036]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:17.036 --> 01:54:19.518]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:19.518 --> 01:54:23.201]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:23.201 --> 01:54:24.342]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:32.011 --> 01:54:34.452]  The TSA horrors.
[01:54:34.452 --> 01:54:43.316]  The good news is, I'm going to cover this more after she leaves us, Merkel abandons aim of binding climate agreement, that's Der Spiegel.
[01:54:43.316 --> 01:54:50.399]  We also have France abandoning it, we have out of Australia, they've announced they're abandoning it.
[01:54:50.399 --> 01:54:54.761]  Now, they're going to come back by stealth at the local level, which they've already taken over the city I live in.
[01:54:56.383 --> 01:54:57.666]  I love Austin so much.
[01:54:57.666 --> 01:55:00.472]  It's just inhabited and run by criminals at the highest levels.
[01:55:00.472 --> 01:55:02.697]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:55:02.697 --> 01:55:06.706]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up briefly because Ted Anderson
[01:55:08.004 --> 01:55:10.225]  Bought gold back when it was $1,050, $1,060.
[01:55:10.225 --> 01:55:15.469]  I haven't even asked him today what he's got left at that price, if any.
[01:55:15.469 --> 01:55:24.234]  But now it's at $1,170 plus today, so it's up over $120 from the level that he bought in big time.
[01:55:24.234 --> 01:55:25.315]  That's what Ted does.
[01:55:25.315 --> 01:55:34.000]  And he can't always offer these, but he's been able to the last few months, where he buys gold when it's low and sells it when it's high at the old low price.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.041]  And that's how he beats all his competition.
[01:55:36.041 --> 01:55:36.722]  We're free market.
[01:55:37.142 --> 01:55:37.322]  I think?
[01:55:54.508 --> 01:56:08.784]  In my opinion, that's what I've done, assets out of paper into gold and silver that you hold, and now is the time with all this Gata news coming out, red-handed with JPMorgan Chase suppressing the price of gold worldwide, and they can't do it forever.
[01:56:08.784 --> 01:56:11.747]  You see it creeping up, kind of a managed retreat.
[01:56:11.747 --> 01:56:12.308]  Ted Anderson.
[01:56:12.904 --> 01:56:15.405]  Yeah, yeah, you're describing that real well.
[01:56:15.405 --> 01:56:16.406]  That's what gold is doing.
[01:56:16.406 --> 01:56:19.167]  It's just sort of etching its way back upward again right now at $1,173 an ounce.
[01:56:19.167 --> 01:56:20.128]  It's seen as high as $1,175 today.
[01:56:20.128 --> 01:56:22.809]  And I think Bill is right about the price hitting up into that $3,000 range.
[01:56:33.754 --> 01:56:39.776]  A lot of economists are saying that we'll see over $2,000 to $3,000 an ounce before the end of this year.
[01:56:39.776 --> 01:56:43.318]  But nonetheless, whether it happens or not, gold is creeping upward.
[01:56:43.318 --> 01:56:47.159]  I've been holding the francs down in price, and I still have them there, at $249.68.
[01:56:47.159 --> 01:56:51.280]  Now Alex, the francs have gone up $11 since I bought in at that particular price, which puts it at $55 an ounce higher.
[01:56:58.803 --> 01:56:59.063]  If you're
[01:57:14.348 --> 01:57:21.173]  You know, that is just a spectacular buy, and I really think people need to be getting into the gold and silver, especially now.
[01:57:21.173 --> 01:57:22.254]  You can see what's going on.
[01:57:22.254 --> 01:57:23.234]  I mean, crying a lot.
[01:57:23.234 --> 01:57:33.021]  Obama's getting out there, and he's talking about how we have to be fiscally responsible here in our country, and he's the biggest spendthrift there ever was since we've ever had a president.
[01:57:33.021 --> 01:57:35.643]  And the debt is just going through the roof.
[01:57:35.643 --> 01:57:37.544]  The value of the dollar is going to reflect that.
[01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:42.430]  And now they're saying they're going to take the pension funds and bail out the banks again.
[01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:52.284]  I mean the dollar, world currencies are all being devalued basically in a concerted effort as a hidden tax and people need to move into silver and gold.
[01:57:52.284 --> 01:57:55.048]  What are some of the other special offers you have on silver and gold, Ted?
[01:57:55.148 --> 01:58:02.031]  Well, right now we also have, I'm still carrying the Walking Liberty half at $9.24, which is less than $10.
[01:58:02.031 --> 01:58:05.313]  That's going to be shooting up above that level.
[01:58:05.313 --> 01:58:11.355]  And then in the gold market, we have the British Sovereigns currently right now, they're at $324.43.
[01:58:11.355 --> 01:58:15.797]  I have a pretty good supply of US Eagles, if that's what interests you.
[01:58:15.797 --> 01:58:18.719]  I know that we have, you know, some gold bars.
[01:58:19.699 --> 01:58:26.103]  Alex Jones sent you so you get the lower price or you will pay more and still the higher price is still a great deal.

[01:58:52.082 --> 01:58:57.664]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?

[01:59:38.381 --> 01:59:40.122]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:53.922 --> 01:59:56.369]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.369 --> 01:59:59.118]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:10.440]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.001]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.001 --> 02:00:13.561]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.561 --> 02:00:17.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:22.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.485 --> 02:00:29.168]  We're going to be going live at PrisonPlanet.tv with the balance of the transmission starting in the next segment in T-minus seven and a half minutes.
[02:00:30.677 --> 02:00:34.821]  Got a bunch of other news I haven't even covered yet that we'll be going over.
[02:00:34.821 --> 02:00:38.905]  We have Judge Henry Napolitano coming up in the second half of the final hour today.
[02:00:38.905 --> 02:00:47.473]  We're going to have open phones in the last half hour of this hour and the next half hour into the final hour.
[02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:51.357]  I want to get into the Copenhagen.
[02:00:52.532 --> 02:01:03.751]  situation because this is really good news and uh... we need these victories and these are substantive victories uh... but these are only battles we've won we've not won the war
[02:01:04.804 --> 02:01:05.825]  That's important to understand.
[02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:07.406]  You can't have one battle and then go home.
[02:01:07.406 --> 02:01:11.248]  You've got to have sustained perseverance against this.
[02:01:11.248 --> 02:01:16.511]  Also, I want to get into Obama administration defies congressional subpoena on four hood documents.
[02:01:16.511 --> 02:01:20.153]  Cover up going on there with that case that looks like a false flag.
[02:01:20.153 --> 02:01:21.234]  We can't prove it.
[02:01:21.234 --> 02:01:24.135]  We can prove the underwear bomber was an inside job.
[02:01:24.135 --> 02:01:26.517]  But I wanted to go back to Ted Anderson here for just a minute.
[02:01:27.512 --> 02:01:27.732]  I think?
[02:01:47.256 --> 02:01:49.418]  He's got a triple A rating with the Better Business Bureau.
[02:02:03.851 --> 02:02:12.497]  A few silver coins here, a gold coin there, that over the years I bought quite a bit of gold and silver as an emergency backup.
[02:02:12.497 --> 02:02:14.339]  And I don't buy it as an investment.
[02:02:14.339 --> 02:02:18.182]  You know, when gold went up to $1,200 plus an ounce or almost up to $1,300 an ounce, I didn't sell gold.
[02:02:18.182 --> 02:02:18.542]  I bought it $800.
[02:02:18.542 --> 02:02:19.022]  I didn't sell gold.
[02:02:19.022 --> 02:02:20.263]  I bought it $270.
[02:02:20.263 --> 02:02:21.764]  I didn't sell gold.
[02:02:21.764 --> 02:02:22.145]  I bought it $500.
[02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:34.193]  I didn't sell silver, you know, that I bought at $5, $6 an ounce when it, you know, almost hit $20 an ounce.
[02:02:34.193 --> 02:02:37.975]  I just keep it as an emergency backup.
[02:02:37.975 --> 02:02:43.738]  And, of course, it's not silver bullet, it's not bulletproof, but it's the closest to a silver bullet that you're going to get.
[02:02:43.738 --> 02:02:55.165]  And so I just wanted to have Ted back briefly here to, again, tell folks about that gold offer one more time and explain to them with the fifth of an ounce Frank coin, what you're basically getting gold at $500 an ounce with that deal.
[02:02:57.762 --> 02:03:02.108]  You really are if you consider the discount of the subscription.
[02:03:02.108 --> 02:03:04.872]  I mean, Bob Chapman writes a really good newsletter.
[02:03:04.872 --> 02:03:08.036]  He does charge $159 a year.
[02:03:08.036 --> 02:03:13.164]  I need to say that's probably one of the lowest priced annual subscriptions to the newsletters out there.
[02:03:13.964 --> 02:03:14.725]  I think?
[02:03:29.972 --> 02:03:36.135]  You know, it's the 260 range now for the same coin.
[02:03:36.135 --> 02:03:37.176]  It's quite the discount.
[02:03:37.176 --> 02:03:38.937]  It's really a good value.
[02:03:38.937 --> 02:03:42.919]  And I really think that people need to have fractional gold coins.
[02:03:42.919 --> 02:03:56.286]  I mean, it's going to get down to the point where if you need to buy a loaf of bread and some gasoline and whatever else, other staples that you need, and the value of the currency has fallen through the floor, a fifth of an ounce of gold is going to mean an awful lot to you.
[02:03:56.906 --> 02:04:13.437]  Even if it's only one that you can buy, at least this gives you the opportunity to buy one and also get a full year subscription and it gets you down actually below that $500 an ounce and you'd have to go clean back more than 10 years to be able to buy gold at the same level.
[02:04:17.045 --> 02:04:23.430]  Well folks, the toll-free number to call and to take advantage of this offer is 800-686-2237.
[02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:24.011]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:24.011 --> 02:04:34.519]  And again, if you want to take advantage of this super deal Ted's been offering, these discounts, I don't know how much longer they can last.
[02:04:34.519 --> 02:04:37.062]  Ted's had this going for quite a while.
[02:04:37.062 --> 02:04:38.663]  When are you going to have to raise prices, Ted?
[02:04:38.843 --> 02:04:43.346]  Well, I mean, I have a few francs left in storage, so I'll be holding it for a little while.
[02:04:43.346 --> 02:04:49.271]  But again, it's just a matter of when people buy and when I run out of supply, prices will go up.
[02:04:49.271 --> 02:04:49.371]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:49.371 --> 02:04:49.591]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:49.591 --> 02:04:50.852]  Get involved today, folks.
[02:04:50.852 --> 02:04:51.493]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:04:51.493 --> 02:04:52.654]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:05:01.271 --> 02:05:07.914]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.914 --> 02:05:13.056]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.056 --> 02:05:21.780]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:25.842]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:25.842 --> 02:05:27.803]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.274 --> 02:05:34.857]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:34.857 --> 02:05:38.699]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:05:38.699 --> 02:05:39.940]  Others don't.
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:42.081]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.081 --> 02:05:43.862]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:05:58.451 --> 02:05:58.951]  Others don't.
[02:06:02.819 --> 02:06:05.002]  You're subject to other police action.
[02:06:05.002 --> 02:06:06.263]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.263 --> 02:06:10.068]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:10.068 --> 02:06:12.430]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:17.616]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.297 --> 02:06:24.963]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.963 --> 02:06:30.948]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.948 --> 02:06:34.632]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[02:06:48.897 --> 02:06:50.877]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.877 --> 02:06:51.998]  It's here.

[02:07:01.343 --> 02:07:04.344]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.344 --> 02:07:09.685]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.685 --> 02:07:11.726]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.726 --> 02:07:16.727]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.727 --> 02:07:17.908]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.908 --> 02:07:18.648]  When do you want it?
[02:07:19.028 --> 02:07:20.910]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:21.991]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.991 --> 02:07:24.194]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.194 --> 02:07:25.535]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.535 --> 02:07:27.057]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:27.057 --> 02:07:32.342]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.342 --> 02:07:35.926]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.926 --> 02:07:39.390]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:40.951]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.951 --> 02:07:41.852]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.852 --> 02:07:42.953]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.953 --> 02:07:43.894]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.894 --> 02:07:44.995]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.995 --> 02:07:48.038]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:48.038 --> 02:07:50.241]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:50.241 --> 02:07:51.242]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.253 --> 02:08:04.495]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.495 --> 02:08:14.744]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.744 --> 02:08:16.946]  You've all seen it on the news.
[02:08:16.946 --> 02:08:18.267]  It's slave trade.
[02:08:18.267 --> 02:08:21.090]  The naked body scanners recording your genitals.
[02:08:22.543 --> 02:08:25.504]  And by the way, I'm going to announce the winners tomorrow.
[02:08:25.504 --> 02:08:30.367]  I always get behind on these contests because there's scores of videos to watch, but I've got to narrow down to just a few.
[02:08:30.367 --> 02:08:34.148]  I will announce tomorrow absolutely the winners of the Naked Body.
[02:08:36.294 --> 02:08:43.617]  Contest video that's now educating so many people out there the TSA knows it's an act of submission now They have mobile trucks.
[02:08:43.617 --> 02:08:46.458]  They want we've played the Homeland Security videos.
[02:08:46.458 --> 02:09:02.866]  We're outside sports stadiums or events They're gonna make you go through these naked body scanners but you've seen it on the news where they get women and men but especially women and and the the TSA guards take their hands and go around the women's breast and and and
[02:09:04.524 --> 02:09:14.557]  Paul Watson in England talked about his girlfriend and I talked to her on the phone she said it's very painful and but imagine having people
[02:09:16.551 --> 02:09:17.031]  Thank you.
[02:09:35.094 --> 02:09:35.854]  Christine Ebersole.
[02:09:35.854 --> 02:09:39.697]  ChristineEbersole.com is an American actress and singer.
[02:09:39.697 --> 02:09:43.660]  She's been a veteran of television, film, and Broadway for a number of years.
[02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:53.526]  She starred in a number of television programs, including Saturday Night Live, One Life to Live, Will & Grace, Shoot Me, Just Shoot Me, and Murphy Brown.
[02:09:53.526 --> 02:10:00.791]  She found considerable success also appearing in Oklahoma Camelot, Dinner at Eight, Steel, Magnolias.
[02:10:01.851 --> 02:10:08.974]  42nd Street, which she won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical, and I've gotten a chance to know her.
[02:10:08.974 --> 02:10:21.898]  She's a 9-11 skeptic, a 9-11 truther, somebody that has a lot of courage, and I've had a chance to, you know, march with her in Lower Manhattan, and had a chance to go out with her and her husband for dinner.
[02:10:21.898 --> 02:10:25.039]  She's a great lady, and again, we appreciate her coming on with us.
[02:10:25.039 --> 02:10:28.401]  She called me, I guess it was Saturday,
[02:10:29.541 --> 02:10:30.262]  I don't
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:48.780]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:51.801]  I really think this is an important story just to let people know
[02:11:17.245 --> 02:11:24.068]  That we have rights as sovereign human beings, and I think I was exercising them on that Sunday in Burbank Airport.
[02:11:24.068 --> 02:11:27.750]  But I just wanted to share with you just kind of the straight up about what happened.
[02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:38.034]  You know, I've been traveling a lot because I'm a singer, and I've been doing concerts around the country, and I first became concerned, you know, at that staged
[02:11:39.156 --> 02:11:53.693]  Underwear bomber Christmas pageant as I call it, you know, which allowed them to put in the scanners in Chicago And I was very worried about that because I thought I'm not going to go through the scanners I'm not going to subject myself to the radiation and let alone that it's a violation of my privacy
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:12:13.284]  So, I did stop through Chicago, and I kind of had spent some sleepless nights rehearsing what I was going to say, but I was able to circumvent that because they make it random, and they do these random sort of drills, and they just keep you off balance, so you never know what's going to hit you at what time or when.
[02:12:13.284 --> 02:12:18.545]  But at this particular case, I was able to circumvent it and go through a place that was not
[02:12:19.285 --> 02:12:21.887]  Um, a scanner, a naked body scanner.
[02:12:21.887 --> 02:12:28.071]  However, when I did go through the metal detector and didn't put off any alarms in Chicago, they patted me down.
[02:12:28.071 --> 02:12:29.632]  They said, I have to pat you down.
[02:12:29.632 --> 02:12:33.575]  And I never said anything, you know, because you're always surprised when it's a new experience.
[02:12:33.575 --> 02:12:36.717]  You don't really have the wherewithal to say the things that you want to say.
[02:12:36.717 --> 02:12:42.621]  But afterwards, I just felt this sort of toxic residue and felt ashamed and felt embarrassed and humiliated.
[02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:44.262]  And it stayed with me for a long time.
[02:12:44.882 --> 02:13:01.202]  And then the second time that it happened when I traveled again, and I had gone through the metal detectors and made no sound, but then it's always, in my case, when a female guard is, it's almost like the prison, you know, the female prison guard, you know, that wants to just show dominance.
[02:13:01.842 --> 02:13:03.442]  Um, whenever it's a female.
[02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:08.283]  I don't really get it when it's going through, when there's men behind the... Yeah, this is a prisoner!
[02:13:08.283 --> 02:13:14.925]  I mean, we're all being trained, people who've never been inside a jail, to go through a prison frisking procedure.
[02:13:14.925 --> 02:13:15.525]  Yeah.
[02:13:15.525 --> 02:13:20.386]  So it's usually, it's always the women that pick me out randomly and say, you have to be patted down.
[02:13:20.386 --> 02:13:22.566]  So then the second time it happened, I said, why?
[02:13:22.566 --> 02:13:23.506]  Why are you patting me down?
[02:13:23.506 --> 02:13:24.526]  It's random.
[02:13:24.526 --> 02:13:25.967]  So then I let her do it again.
[02:13:25.967 --> 02:13:26.987]  And again, I felt this
[02:13:28.939 --> 02:13:35.004]  Which again sets the precedent that we all randomly are searched getting rid of the 4th and 5th Amendment.
[02:13:35.004 --> 02:13:36.064]  Exactly.
[02:13:36.064 --> 02:13:45.732]  So what happened was I kind of forgot about it and I did a concert in Northridge on Saturday night and Sunday morning I was flying to San Francisco so I went through the Burbank Airport.
[02:13:46.352 --> 02:13:47.533]  So my flight was around 9.30.
[02:13:47.533 --> 02:13:50.114]  I get to the airport around 8.15.
[02:13:50.114 --> 02:13:58.557]  And one of the first things that happened was when I'm putting on my shoes, you know, to put them in the security bin, all of a sudden somebody from Homeland Security starts shouting.
[02:13:58.557 --> 02:14:02.839]  I don't know what they're saying because, you know, it's all new and it's just sort of chaotic.
[02:14:02.839 --> 02:14:06.460]  And everybody's ordered to freeze in their spot.
[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:07.801]  Whatever they're doing, freeze.
[02:14:08.925 --> 02:14:12.327]  And then some time goes by, and then you're able to continue what you're doing.
[02:14:12.327 --> 02:14:17.810]  And again, this is so Orwellian, they're just adding more and more controls, more and more harassment.
[02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:22.332]  And they do this with the school kids in these drills now too, training us how to be prisoners.
[02:14:22.332 --> 02:14:23.273]  Exactly.
[02:14:23.273 --> 02:14:25.114]  So I asked one of the guards, I said, what was that about?
[02:14:25.114 --> 02:14:27.255]  He said, it's just a drill, man, in case something happens.
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:32.963]  So then after I take, you know, my shoes off and everything and I go through, and I'm not wearing any jewelry, nothing.
[02:14:32.963 --> 02:14:34.585]  I don't set off any alarms.
[02:14:34.585 --> 02:14:43.071]  Oh, there's a woman guard on the other side and she says, um, you have to go behind, right behind the metal detector is sort of a glass room where everybody can see.
[02:14:43.071 --> 02:14:45.252]  Which again is part of the public humiliation.
[02:14:45.252 --> 02:14:45.652]  Exactly.
[02:14:45.652 --> 02:14:48.094]  Training you to just put up with anything.
[02:14:48.094 --> 02:14:49.015]  Mm-hmm.
[02:14:49.015 --> 02:14:52.097]  So she takes me back to the glass room and she says, I have to pat you down.
[02:14:52.097 --> 02:14:53.318]  I said, I don't want to be patted down.
[02:14:54.986 --> 02:14:56.690]  So that kind of surprised him a little bit.
[02:14:56.690 --> 02:14:59.657]  I said, you can use the wand, but I don't want you to touch me.
[02:15:04.679 --> 02:15:08.240]  Which is a basic human right to not be touched.
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:08.640]  Exactly.
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.042]  I mean, again, they're just... I mean, they're blowing past all these boundaries.
[02:15:13.042 --> 02:15:20.284]  And I know I keep interrupting, I just want to point out how each part of this has been psychologically designed to humiliate you and break your will.
[02:15:20.284 --> 02:15:20.704]  Go ahead.
[02:15:20.704 --> 02:15:21.484]  Exactly.
[02:15:21.484 --> 02:15:23.445]  So, um, I said you can use the wand.
[02:15:23.445 --> 02:15:29.887]  So she has me, first of all, sit down and look at the bottom of my feet to make sure there's no bomb-making material on my bare feet.
[02:15:30.567 --> 02:15:37.273]  And then I'm supposed to spread my legs and stand on the image of feet on the floor.
[02:15:37.273 --> 02:15:40.956]  And so, at this certain distance, you know, so I'm spreading my legs.
[02:15:40.956 --> 02:15:50.644]  And she says, if the wand goes off, I'm going to have to touch the spot where the wand, you know, makes the noise.
[02:15:50.644 --> 02:15:54.787]  So, the bra that I was wearing has wire in it.
[02:15:54.787 --> 02:15:57.730]  And, you know, metal, there's little metal things in the strap.
[02:15:59.181 --> 02:16:06.243]  So she gets to the point where it's underneath my breast and the alarm goes off.
[02:16:06.243 --> 02:16:13.065]  And rather than touching me there, I lifted my shirt and showed her my bra.
[02:16:13.065 --> 02:16:16.446]  I said, this is my bra and you see the wire underneath that?
[02:16:16.446 --> 02:16:18.187]  That's what's making the sound.
[02:16:18.187 --> 02:16:20.228]  This is in lieu of having her touch me there.
[02:16:23.018 --> 02:16:32.903]  And again, here you are, this evil, guilty person for having tiny little clips in your bra, and you're now the prisoner in having to go through this.
[02:16:32.903 --> 02:16:34.504]  This is the New American Way.
[02:16:34.504 --> 02:16:43.649]  So because I lifted my bra in this glassed area, I mean, I lifted my shirt and showed my bra, which everyone could see, I didn't mind.
[02:16:43.649 --> 02:16:46.711]  You know, you wear that in the summertime when you're at the beach.
[02:16:47.512 --> 02:16:50.074]  So, I said, but I don't want her to touch me.
[02:16:50.074 --> 02:16:54.977]  So, I showed the bra, and that's when the supervisor came in, or what I assume was the supervisor.
[02:16:54.977 --> 02:16:56.798]  And she said, are we having a problem here?
[02:16:56.798 --> 02:16:58.059]  I said, no, there's no problem.
[02:16:58.059 --> 02:17:01.322]  We having a problem here, slave?
[02:17:01.322 --> 02:17:02.683]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[02:17:02.683 --> 02:17:05.224]  And it was with a slight, you know, of course, the attitude.
[02:17:05.224 --> 02:17:11.469]  And basically went on to lecture me that I'm causing trouble because I'm impeding the security measures.
[02:17:11.469 --> 02:17:13.150]  And she went on to explain again if there
[02:17:14.169 --> 02:17:32.835]  It was any sound she'd have to touch that but I said well ma'am I answer to a higher authority and I am a sovereign human being which means I am the supreme authority over my body and I have a right as a sovereign human being to ask you not to touch me.
[02:17:32.835 --> 02:17:33.655]  I'm not a criminal.
[02:17:33.655 --> 02:17:35.596]  I haven't been accused of a crime.
[02:17:36.693 --> 02:17:38.934]  Are you suspecting me of something?
[02:17:38.934 --> 02:17:40.395]  Are you looking for something?
[02:17:40.395 --> 02:17:43.516]  We're looking, she said, we're looking for bra bombs.
[02:17:43.516 --> 02:17:50.440]  You see, now they've moved from the, from the shoe to the underwear and now to the bra.
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:18:00.745]  And it's an interesting, it's interesting how now they're going to the traditionally in tribal, you know, bra, the more vulnerable group.
[02:18:00.745 --> 02:18:04.467]  The women who bear the children that are there for the tribe to protect.
[02:18:04.955 --> 02:18:07.997]  And let's remember, we've proven the shoe bomber was staged.
[02:18:07.997 --> 02:18:12.139]  It's been conclusively proven that the underwear bomber was staged.
[02:18:12.139 --> 02:18:13.900]  All of this is staged.
[02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:17.302]  And now they admit Homeland Security is for the American people.
[02:18:17.302 --> 02:18:19.164]  It was never for the cave people.
[02:18:20.618 --> 02:18:37.484]  Well, after she gave me the lecture, and she said, you know, the reason why I was profiled was because I was wearing loose clothing, and I went, you know, and I took, anyway, I took off all the loose clothing so that you could just see a t-shirt that was sort of tight-fitting, and I lifted up my pants legs, and I showed her my bare legs, which also upset her.
[02:18:37.484 --> 02:18:41.705]  She did not want me to do that, because then that would mean that she couldn't touch my body, you see.
[02:18:42.566 --> 02:18:44.848]  So, then I said, is everything okay?
[02:18:44.848 --> 02:18:45.829]  Am I free to go now?
[02:18:45.829 --> 02:18:53.175]  Are you satisfied that you haven't, you know, that I'm not a bomber, I'm not a terrorist, and are you satisfied that you haven't been able to find anything?
[02:18:53.175 --> 02:19:01.381]  And she said yes, but she basically said, I would suggest you don't fly anymore, because flying is a privilege, and I can call the police and have them taking you off.
[02:19:01.381 --> 02:19:10.129]  Yeah, they say owning a gun's a privilege, traveling's a privilege, everything's a privilege now, and we pay all our taxes to the government, and they turn all these
[02:19:10.789 --> 02:19:15.531]  Minimum wage goons loose on us, but then that's only the beginning of the story.
[02:19:15.531 --> 02:19:17.092]  They were gonna make you submit.
[02:19:17.092 --> 02:19:24.615]  They were gonna show everybody what happens to somebody that talks back to the warden in the prison.
[02:19:24.615 --> 02:19:26.856]  Because we're a prison planet and we're about to go to break.
[02:19:26.856 --> 02:19:28.657]  We're gonna come back with Christine Ebersole.
[02:19:28.657 --> 02:19:33.740]  ChristineEbersole.com and talk about what she describes as her SWAT teaming.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:43.467]  At the gate after she'd gone through the slave boot camp training grid, where they're always adding more suppression incrementally.
[02:19:43.467 --> 02:19:50.353]  Look, this is meant to prepare you for forced inoculation, forced DNA removal, DNA databases.
[02:19:50.353 --> 02:19:51.414]  That's all admitted.
[02:19:51.414 --> 02:19:52.255]  It's all over the news.
[02:19:52.255 --> 02:19:55.237]  They take babies' blood at birth for almost 38 years.
[02:19:55.237 --> 02:19:57.699]  This is just a lawless group of scum.
[02:19:57.699 --> 02:19:59.881]  Of course, the average TSA worker is not a bad person.
[02:19:59.881 --> 02:20:01.302]  They're just ignorant like the general public.
[02:20:03.598 --> 02:20:04.819]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.819 --> 02:20:07.319]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:07.319 --> 02:20:09.220]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.

[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:03.662]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.662 --> 02:22:06.043]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:06.043 --> 02:22:09.246]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.246 --> 02:22:14.369]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.369 --> 02:22:18.552]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.872 --> 02:22:21.334]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.334 --> 02:22:23.757]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.757 --> 02:22:27.020]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:34.627]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.952 --> 02:22:40.334]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.334 --> 02:22:42.655]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.655 --> 02:22:46.877]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.877 --> 02:22:47.957]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.957 --> 02:22:49.298]  You're everyone else.

[02:24:03.086 --> 02:24:07.595]  Tony Award winning, best leading actress, Christina Ebersole.
[02:24:07.595 --> 02:24:09.459]  Great lady is our guest.
[02:24:09.459 --> 02:24:10.561]  Charming, intelligent.
[02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:12.680]  Build with courage.
[02:24:33.946 --> 02:24:36.368]  Uh, through your, your, your privilege.
[02:24:36.368 --> 02:24:48.515]  They give you your privilege as government god, as the feds that have seized the airports, now seizing the roads, announcing they have TSA and checkpoints all over the country now, expanding this, training our children how to be slaves.
[02:24:48.515 --> 02:24:49.916]  And so you go on towards the gate.
[02:24:49.916 --> 02:24:50.656]  What happens next?
[02:24:50.656 --> 02:24:57.100]  Well, you know, we were early, so I was sitting at the gate with my, my musical director, John Otto, for about 45 minutes.
[02:24:57.100 --> 02:25:03.124]  And we were just talking, and I was kind of saying to you, Bodhi, what just happened, thinking that was the end of the story.
[02:25:03.857 --> 02:25:07.858]  And then they announced that they're going to begin boarding, and I was on one of those short flights.
[02:25:07.858 --> 02:25:16.420]  So, you know how it is, Alex, where you don't have assigned seating, but they'll say, you know, you're in A, 15 to 18, so you kind of get in a line, and there's three different lines.
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:17.801]  So everybody was in line.
[02:25:17.801 --> 02:25:19.441]  They announced that we're boarding.
[02:25:19.441 --> 02:25:24.843]  We all get in line, so everyone's facing the front, like the front of a classroom.
[02:25:24.843 --> 02:25:29.564]  All of a sudden, there's about six security members
[02:25:30.350 --> 02:25:35.293]  They were different, and they were different than the ones that had me at the security checkpoint.
[02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:37.734]  They were a different group.
[02:25:37.734 --> 02:25:39.896]  And they said, Ma'am, we need you to come over to me.
[02:25:39.896 --> 02:25:40.976]  Come over here right now.
[02:25:40.976 --> 02:25:41.717]  I've got to pat you down.
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:43.621]  I don't know.
[02:26:01.135 --> 02:26:02.235]  I need to pat you down right now.
[02:26:02.235 --> 02:26:03.496]  So another lie again.
[02:26:03.496 --> 02:26:05.176]  This is supposedly random.
[02:26:05.176 --> 02:26:07.237]  So it's just congenital lying.
[02:26:07.237 --> 02:26:08.377]  A culture of deceit.
[02:26:08.377 --> 02:26:08.917]  Yeah.
[02:26:08.917 --> 02:26:09.717]  Twice random?
[02:26:09.717 --> 02:26:10.618]  I don't think so.
[02:26:10.618 --> 02:26:11.498]  And that's what John said.
[02:26:11.498 --> 02:26:12.158]  He goes, what do you mean?
[02:26:12.158 --> 02:26:12.738]  We went through that.
[02:26:12.738 --> 02:26:13.918]  It was random back at security.
[02:26:13.918 --> 02:26:15.339]  It's not random now.
[02:26:15.339 --> 02:26:16.259]  You're selecting her out.
[02:26:16.259 --> 02:26:17.700]  They wouldn't answer him.
[02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:23.001]  So, um, I start to take, I go to the front and I said, I thought we already went through this.
[02:26:23.001 --> 02:26:25.162]  I told you, I don't want you to touch me.
[02:26:25.162 --> 02:26:30.243]  And I start to take my coat off and I start to take my shirt off, my outer shirt off.
[02:26:30.723 --> 02:26:34.208]  No, they've gotta have the act of submission.
[02:26:46.755 --> 02:26:48.116]  I mean, this is their great power.
[02:26:48.116 --> 02:26:49.997]  How many have been caught being pedophiles?
[02:26:49.997 --> 02:26:52.639]  How many have been caught demanding women give them sex?
[02:26:52.639 --> 02:26:54.620]  I mean, this is their domination.
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:55.201]  Yeah.
[02:26:55.201 --> 02:26:57.002]  So I continued to take my coat off.
[02:26:57.002 --> 02:26:58.363]  I wasn't listening to them.
[02:26:58.363 --> 02:27:01.024]  And they were continuing to yell for the police.
[02:27:01.024 --> 02:27:03.486]  And then I said, I see.
[02:27:03.486 --> 02:27:08.709]  This is because I said I didn't want you to touch me back at security.
[02:27:08.709 --> 02:27:10.791]  So you're showing me who's boss now.
[02:27:11.471 --> 02:27:13.152]  You're making an example of me.
[02:27:13.152 --> 02:27:14.273]  Ma'am, it's random.
[02:27:14.273 --> 02:27:15.795]  I said, are you having a problem with me?
[02:27:15.795 --> 02:27:17.396]  No, ma'am, you've been a model passenger.
[02:27:17.396 --> 02:27:18.437]  You've been a model passenger.
[02:27:18.437 --> 02:27:20.038]  Now, now, put your arms out.
[02:27:20.038 --> 02:27:21.999]  We gotta pat you down.
[02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:23.901]  So, and everybody's watching it.
[02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:25.182]  Everybody's watching it.
[02:27:25.182 --> 02:27:26.643]  So, I mean, I never raised my voice.
[02:27:26.643 --> 02:27:27.784]  Never did any of that.
[02:27:27.784 --> 02:27:29.005]  I, I put my arms out.
[02:27:29.005 --> 02:27:32.007]  I said, I already told you I didn't want you to touch me.
[02:27:32.007 --> 02:27:40.514]  And they went ahead and they patted me up and down, you know, with a t-shirt on that's, you know, clinging to my body, so, and pants, the bottom.
[02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:42.922]  Which I already showed them back in Chicago.
[02:27:42.922 --> 02:27:45.246]  I lifted up my pants like I show my bare legs underneath.
[02:27:45.246 --> 02:27:47.850]  But, you know, they want to show who's boss.
[02:27:47.850 --> 02:27:52.216]  And then when I said, am I the only one that's being picked out randomly?
[02:27:52.216 --> 02:27:53.418]  No, ma'am, we're waiting for you to get on the plane.
[02:27:53.418 --> 02:27:53.998]  Now get on the plane.
[02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.260]  You want to get on the plane now?
[02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:55.941]  You want to get on the plane?
[02:27:55.941 --> 02:27:56.602]  You want to fly today?
[02:27:56.602 --> 02:27:57.664]  Want to fly today?
[02:28:00.367 --> 02:28:02.389]  Well, that was the deal there.
[02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:07.434]  But of course, I wasn't, you see, they wait until everyone's boarding, and I've got a concert.
[02:28:07.434 --> 02:28:10.037]  I've got to, you know, I've got to make money.
[02:28:10.037 --> 02:28:12.219]  I have a family to support.
[02:28:12.219 --> 02:28:14.001]  And so I'm not going to jeopardize that.
[02:28:14.724 --> 02:28:17.908]  No, it's all been psychologically figured out to make you submit.
[02:28:17.908 --> 02:28:22.653]  Now, you described this to me as SWAT team-like.
[02:28:22.653 --> 02:28:31.723]  Yeah, well it was because they had like some... I mean, I didn't see any guns, but I'm just saying, like, metaphorically a SWAT team because, like, they all... There's like six or seven people defending on me!
[02:28:34.637 --> 02:28:37.739]  I've seen countless YouTube videos on local news of TSA going crazy.
[02:28:37.739 --> 02:28:39.601]  Have you seen the one where the military vet
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:57.042]  In his uniform.
[02:28:57.042 --> 02:28:58.062]  They want to search him.
[02:28:58.062 --> 02:28:59.083]  They want to humiliate him.
[02:28:59.083 --> 02:29:03.286]  So when he just talks back, they beat him up and then charge him with assaulting him.
[02:29:03.286 --> 02:29:07.749]  Or the new thing is making people who can't walk get up.
[02:29:07.749 --> 02:29:12.893]  And if a person won't get out of a wheelchair, they just tell you that you're not going to fly.
[02:29:12.893 --> 02:29:16.255]  So now they make people get out of their wheelchairs who can't walk.
[02:29:16.255 --> 02:29:19.437]  And so families try to hold them up and then they get screamed at.
[02:29:19.437 --> 02:29:21.339]  I mean, I don't want to fly through
[02:29:22.159 --> 02:29:24.180]  George W. Bush, or George H.W.
[02:29:24.180 --> 02:29:33.467]  Bush Airport in Houston, because I've flown through it three times, and once internationally, and they're just screaming at everyone, yelling.
[02:29:33.467 --> 02:29:34.628]  It's like Planet of the Apes.
[02:29:34.628 --> 02:29:44.675]  We're like running, and the TSA's screaming and yelling, and people are freaked out, and they're screaming at old women on crutches, and just foaming at the mouth, and insane power trips.
[02:29:44.675 --> 02:29:48.937]  Let's talk about what you'd like to be done about this when we come back.
[02:29:48.937 --> 02:29:49.358]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.616 --> 02:29:55.558]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.558 --> 02:30:01.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.241 --> 02:30:02.402]  What's your home worth?
[02:30:02.402 --> 02:30:04.503]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:30:04.503 --> 02:30:07.545]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:30:07.545 --> 02:30:15.269]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:31:00.757 --> 02:31:03.138]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:31:03.138 --> 02:31:05.459]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:31:05.459 --> 02:31:08.661]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:31:08.661 --> 02:31:13.784]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:31:13.784 --> 02:31:17.966]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:31:18.286 --> 02:31:20.627]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:31:20.627 --> 02:31:23.508]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:31:23.508 --> 02:31:26.429]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:31:26.429 --> 02:31:34.032]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:31:34.372 --> 02:31:39.757]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:42.620]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:46.304]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:31:46.304 --> 02:31:47.365]  And I got news for you.
[02:31:47.365 --> 02:31:48.726]  You're everyone else.
[02:31:48.726 --> 02:31:50.207]  Invisible Empire.

[02:32:00.694 --> 02:32:01.995]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.995 --> 02:32:07.598]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.598 --> 02:32:12.600]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:17.643]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:18.183 --> 02:32:23.407]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:23.407 --> 02:32:25.708]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:32:25.708 --> 02:32:30.531]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.531 --> 02:32:31.632]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.632 --> 02:32:34.714]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:34.714 --> 02:32:38.337]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.337 --> 02:32:41.519]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:43.740]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:44.681]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:48.383 --> 02:32:51.266]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:51.266 --> 02:32:57.371]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:57.371 --> 02:33:05.678]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:33:05.678 --> 02:33:14.305]  Alright, I'm going to get into the global carbon tax collapsing at the national and international level, but not at the local level.
[02:33:14.305 --> 02:33:16.327]  We're winning battles, but not the war yet.
[02:33:17.483 --> 02:33:20.565]  We're well on our way to exposing that fraud.
[02:33:20.565 --> 02:33:25.368]  I've got some other false flag terror news I want to go over and your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:25.368 --> 02:33:25.868]  So Christine Ebersole...
[02:33:31.758 --> 02:33:32.418]  I don't
[02:33:52.358 --> 02:34:00.440]  You know, I had them pull out a little shampoo bottle that even follows their specs in Billings, Montana, and start screaming at me getting off on it.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.840]  And it seems to be certain airports.
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.381]  You go through some, they're really nice.
[02:34:03.381 --> 02:34:05.761]  It's not very oppressive.
[02:34:05.761 --> 02:34:07.642]  You go through others, it's worse.
[02:34:07.642 --> 02:34:08.762]  Let's be specific.
[02:34:08.762 --> 02:34:12.703]  What airport did this happen to you in, and have you seen that it's worse in certain airports?
[02:34:14.752 --> 02:34:21.716]  Well, of course, Chicago, because that's, you know, really a central area for international flying.
[02:34:21.716 --> 02:34:23.557]  I think the most flights go out of there.
[02:34:23.557 --> 02:34:32.583]  But this was in Burbank, Bob Hope Burbank Airport in California, in Burbank, California.
[02:34:32.583 --> 02:34:37.647]  Well, I think really, Alex, what I've noticed is just happening incrementally.
[02:34:37.647 --> 02:34:41.329]  It's like the Jews, you know, didn't start out at the camp.
[02:34:41.329 --> 02:34:42.610]  They start out with the star.
[02:34:43.533 --> 02:34:45.855]  Then they can't go out after 6.
[02:34:45.855 --> 02:34:47.416]  Then they're in the ghetto.
[02:34:47.416 --> 02:34:51.479]  And then, you know, it's finally leave your name on the luggage at the platform and we'll get it to you.
[02:34:51.479 --> 02:34:52.160]  But it doesn't happen.
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.263]  It's just that what you were discussing earlier, it's the incremental that's happening.
[02:34:56.263 --> 02:35:00.266]  And I noticed that they stopped using the wands and then they start using the pat-down.
[02:35:01.172 --> 02:35:04.433]  This is like something that's been kind of recent for me, anyway.
[02:35:04.433 --> 02:35:06.474]  Well, think about what a big deal this is.
[02:35:06.474 --> 02:35:14.957]  Naked body scanners putting their hands on you, asking you questions, and it only gets worse and worse and worse, and it's training them.
[02:35:14.957 --> 02:35:23.381]  It's training the government employees that all of this is acceptable, and again, it's all being done by design.
[02:35:23.381 --> 02:35:25.402]  Where do you see this is headed?
[02:35:25.402 --> 02:35:26.142]  Because we know that
[02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:34.017]  Well, I think really what the hope is, is to sort of view this experience as non-violent resistance.
[02:35:34.017 --> 02:35:37.379]  And, you know, like Rosa Parks didn't give up her seat.
[02:35:37.379 --> 02:35:39.722]  You know, don't give up your seat at the lunch counter.
[02:35:39.722 --> 02:35:40.682]  Know your rights.
[02:35:40.682 --> 02:35:48.730]  Know that we are, because the mere fact that we were created and that we live on this earth gives us rights.
[02:35:48.730 --> 02:35:50.631]  And we are sovereign human beings.
[02:35:50.631 --> 02:35:51.892]  And know your rights.
[02:35:51.892 --> 02:35:53.614]  And that's what we teach our children, isn't it?
[02:35:54.292 --> 02:35:58.337]  We tell our children, listen, don't let any strangers touch you.
[02:35:58.337 --> 02:35:59.578]  You know, this is your body.
[02:35:59.578 --> 02:36:03.303]  And you need to protect it, and you speak out.
[02:36:03.303 --> 02:36:04.845]  Does that change when you become an adult?
[02:36:04.845 --> 02:36:07.788]  And then all of a sudden you submit yourself?
[02:36:07.788 --> 02:36:09.791]  It's okay to teach your children, but not for yourself?
[02:36:10.737 --> 02:36:12.538]  You don't have to protect yourself, though, you see?
[02:36:12.538 --> 02:36:18.462]  That's the thing, is that, you know, that we don't understand how powerful we are as human beings.
[02:36:18.462 --> 02:36:19.723]  We don't understand that.
[02:36:19.723 --> 02:36:27.948]  And that's... If everybody went to the airport and said, I don't want you to touch me, and I don't want... I'm not going through the scanners, the whole thing would collapse!
[02:36:28.988 --> 02:36:32.110]  It's because we're in agreement with it, because we think we don't have any rights.
[02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:44.858]  I was talking to somebody in front of the line, you know, on my way back to California from San Francisco, and she was making a joke about, like, you know, she knew it was ridiculous, but she was making a joke about the scanners, you know, we'll all have to go through the scanners.
[02:36:44.858 --> 02:36:46.840]  I said, I'm not going through the scanners.
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:49.421]  She said, you know, she looked at me like, we have a choice?
[02:36:49.421 --> 02:36:52.924]  I said, you have a choice.
[02:36:52.924 --> 02:36:54.424]  You are a sovereign human being.
[02:36:54.424 --> 02:36:56.546]  You are the supreme authority over your body.
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:05.804]  Unless you're a convicted prisoner and they're treating us like convicted prisoners and the low-level people don't even know what they're doing.
[02:37:05.804 --> 02:37:07.845]  They're just as ignorant as the general public.
[02:37:07.845 --> 02:37:14.989]  But the globalists know exactly what they're doing and this is a key part of their overall operation.
[02:37:14.989 --> 02:37:23.014]  This is a drill or a boot camp training us that all of America and all of the world is basically a giant re-education camp.
[02:37:23.014 --> 02:37:23.394]  That's right.
[02:37:24.495 --> 02:37:31.123]  So I think it's just a matter of practicing nonviolent resistance and knowing the rights of man.
[02:37:34.239 --> 02:37:39.443]  Well, I mean, you know, I don't really believe in the classic term karma, but I do believe in you reap what you sow.
[02:37:39.443 --> 02:37:51.451]  I can't imagine, you know, the bad mojo, or whatever you want to call it, of grabbing people's genitals, rubbing people's breasts, dominating people, putting them through naked body scanners.
[02:37:51.451 --> 02:37:55.694]  And how as Americans, or as British, this is global, or as Europeans,
[02:37:57.436 --> 02:38:05.482]  Well, you let them take your three-year-olds, because now TSA has said, just like England, they are phasing it in, it will be mandatory, they're just, quote, acclimating the public.
[02:38:05.482 --> 02:38:07.364]  I mean, that's TSA's own words.
[02:38:07.364 --> 02:38:11.447]  So we're now going to put our babies in body scanners that pound us with radiation?
[02:38:11.447 --> 02:38:21.496]  Now they're saying, well, women may have people sew in bombs inside their breasts, so now we may have to have chest X-rays, which nobody doubts cause cancer.
[02:38:21.496 --> 02:38:22.096]  That's right.
[02:38:24.378 --> 02:38:25.299]  What comes next?
[02:38:25.299 --> 02:38:29.541]  We've got to do brain surgery before you can fly to make sure there's not a bomb inside your head?
[02:38:29.541 --> 02:38:30.362]  No, that's right.
[02:38:30.362 --> 02:38:32.523]  If you need a colonoscopy, you don't need to go to the doctor.
[02:38:32.523 --> 02:38:34.084]  Just go through airport security.
[02:38:34.084 --> 02:38:34.964]  You know?
[02:38:34.964 --> 02:38:35.965]  They don't find the terrorist.
[02:38:35.965 --> 02:38:37.086]  They might get a couple of polyps.
[02:38:37.086 --> 02:38:37.866]  You know what I mean?
[02:38:37.866 --> 02:38:38.887]  It's ridiculous.
[02:38:38.887 --> 02:38:41.348]  So that's why we have to practice non-violent resistance.
[02:38:41.348 --> 02:38:43.549]  I mean, there's a way to beat it.
[02:38:43.549 --> 02:38:46.671]  You know, there's a way to at least combat it, you know?
[02:38:46.671 --> 02:38:48.712]  At least, you know, here's the thing.
[02:38:48.712 --> 02:38:52.735]  The bottom line is, after I stood up for myself, and they still
[02:38:53.635 --> 02:38:55.036]  You fought back against the rape.
[02:38:55.036 --> 02:38:57.536]  You didn't enjoy it.
[02:39:19.421 --> 02:39:20.022]  Exactly.
[02:39:20.022 --> 02:39:28.968]  I've found that when I argue with the TSA when they get out of control and put them in their place sternly, like I'm talking to my dog when it's been bad, that I then feel good.
[02:39:28.968 --> 02:39:30.369]  And they feel bad.
[02:39:30.369 --> 02:39:34.251]  But see, they're getting a good feeling off their evil.
[02:39:34.251 --> 02:39:38.855]  It's adding to the whole delusion that the terror threat is real and that it isn't staged.
[02:39:38.855 --> 02:39:45.700]  For those that don't know, it's now been in the Detroit News, it's now been in other publications, in Congressional testimony.
[02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:46.760]  We even have the video, actually.
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:47.361]  We ought to play that.
[02:39:48.294 --> 02:39:55.784]  The deputy head of the State Department said, we were ordered to let the underwear bomber on the plane and he was protected.
[02:39:55.784 --> 02:39:59.569]  And the FBI for two months lied about that and had to admit later they were covering up.
[02:39:59.569 --> 02:40:01.351]  I mean, that whole thing was staged.
[02:40:01.351 --> 02:40:05.036]  In 7-7 it was a drill using government passage and thought they were taking part in a drill.
[02:40:05.877 --> 02:40:13.600]  And again, we're showing video right now off the mainstream news where they put their hands under women's breasts and go in circles.
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:21.142]  And I've talked to, again, Paul Watson's girlfriend now many years, and she says it's painful what they do in England.
[02:40:21.142 --> 02:40:23.403]  She says they actually squeeze.
[02:40:23.403 --> 02:40:26.484]  But then what if you said no?
[02:40:26.484 --> 02:40:27.584]  I won't do it.
[02:40:27.584 --> 02:40:29.965]  What if hundreds of people said no?
[02:40:32.403 --> 02:40:38.152]  Well, they are saying no, and then 30 civil rights groups have sent letters to TSA and Homeland Security.
[02:40:40.666 --> 02:40:48.312]  Look, it's not just that they're going to squeeze women's breasts and grab men's genitals and body scan the naked image of your children, your wife, your husband.
[02:40:48.312 --> 02:40:49.573]  They're going to take your pension funds.
[02:40:49.573 --> 02:40:50.774]  They're going to raise your taxes.
[02:40:50.774 --> 02:40:51.775]  They're doing it.
[02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:55.177]  I mean, this is a criminal group and they're using psychology.
[02:40:55.177 --> 02:41:07.527]  I mean, now, we told people a year and a half ago, I'm not bragging, it's sad that Goldman Sachs premeditatedly engineered this whole thing with the other top six banks and globally ten banks and they know what they've done.
[02:41:09.108 --> 02:41:12.697]  They might get a slap on the wrist now for robbing everyone.
[02:41:12.697 --> 02:41:17.610]  We are obviously in the middle of a major, major shift.
[02:41:18.453 --> 02:41:26.581]  And if we can look at it in sort of a spiritual sense, that we are at the period of the rotting fruit right now.
[02:41:26.581 --> 02:41:32.546]  And the weight of the rotting fruit, it cannot stand on the tree, and it will eventually fall.
[02:41:32.546 --> 02:41:39.353]  And this is the nature and the actual physical energy of secrets and lies.
[02:41:39.953 --> 02:41:42.655]  They are finite and corporal like the body.
[02:41:42.655 --> 02:41:44.216]  Truth is infinite.
[02:41:44.216 --> 02:41:48.358]  But underneath the rotting fruit lies the golden seed.
[02:41:48.358 --> 02:42:02.646]  And if we can align ourselves with that seed and just try to just, you know, buckle up, Betty, and just kind of take the ride of this shift right now, I think that we're going to come out in a golden age.
[02:42:03.306 --> 02:42:04.347]  I really believe that.
[02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:17.717]  And I think that's really the idea of standing in truth, not being afraid of yourself, being a spiritual warrior, not being afraid to speak the truth, and not being afraid of yourself.
[02:42:17.717 --> 02:42:18.777]  That's another thing.
[02:42:18.777 --> 02:42:21.739]  When we give away our power, we think that we're worthless.
[02:42:21.739 --> 02:42:23.781]  But it's not the darkness that we're afraid of.
[02:42:23.781 --> 02:42:24.722]  It's the light.
[02:42:24.722 --> 02:42:30.206]  It's the power of who we are in our being created in divinity.
[02:42:30.206 --> 02:42:32.027]  And that's what we need to just pay attention to.
[02:42:33.348 --> 02:42:35.229]  And stand in alignment with that.
[02:42:35.229 --> 02:42:37.030]  Extremely heavy.
[02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:38.271]  Absolutely.
[02:42:38.271 --> 02:42:39.932]  Veritas.
[02:42:39.932 --> 02:42:41.173]  What you've said is the truth.
[02:42:41.173 --> 02:42:42.874]  Christina Ebersole.
[02:42:42.874 --> 02:42:43.594]  And who was it?
[02:42:43.594 --> 02:42:45.335]  Martin Luther King that you like to quote?
[02:42:45.335 --> 02:42:45.835]  Yes.
[02:42:45.835 --> 02:42:52.599]  That the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
[02:42:52.599 --> 02:42:57.422]  So when we stand in truth, we have the support of the universe.
[02:42:57.422 --> 02:42:58.923]  And that's what this shift is about.
[02:42:58.923 --> 02:43:01.044]  It's a shift in consciousness.
[02:43:01.044 --> 02:43:02.425]  And people are waking up.
[02:43:03.166 --> 02:43:09.411]  And waking up and being able to see like the Matrix through the false paradigm, through the lies.
[02:43:09.411 --> 02:43:14.256]  And now it's becoming, it's happening at such rapid speed and now it's becoming so transparent.
[02:43:14.256 --> 02:43:19.040]  The desperate act of those SWAT team coming after me would just show their desperation.
[02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:20.981]  It said nothing about me.
[02:43:20.981 --> 02:43:26.366]  It showed everything about this... Oh, we better go get her, you know, and hold on to this.
[02:43:26.366 --> 02:43:27.847]  Yeah, it's not about terrorism.
[02:43:27.847 --> 02:43:29.128]  It's about domination.
[02:43:29.128 --> 02:43:32.431]  It's about letting you know, hey, we're the boss.
[02:43:32.431 --> 02:43:34.032]  And guess what?
[02:43:34.032 --> 02:43:37.055]  It's as simple as the click of the heels, folks.
[02:43:37.055 --> 02:43:38.236]  Click of those little heels.
[02:43:38.236 --> 02:43:41.939]  You didn't know that you could get home to who you are that quickly.
[02:43:42.719 --> 02:43:46.060]  You know, because we're in Oz right now, and it's a horse of a different color.
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:50.242]  But you don't forget you got the Ruby Smooters on.
[02:43:50.242 --> 02:43:53.183]  And all you do is click them, and you return to yourself.
[02:43:53.183 --> 02:43:57.024]  And that's the most powerful thing we have.
[02:43:57.024 --> 02:44:00.885]  Well, what is the movie Ants?
[02:44:00.885 --> 02:44:05.067]  The cartoon, the animated... Yeah, that's a great one.
[02:44:06.789 --> 02:44:17.858]  And you've got the grasshoppers all sitting around, they're in a grain bin, plenty of food, and one of the aid-de-camp-to-the-head evil grasshopper comes over and says, we've got plenty of food here.
[02:44:17.858 --> 02:44:20.340]  Why are we dominating and fighting with these ants?
[02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:27.105]  And he goes, those little puny ants outnumber us 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for us.
[02:44:27.105 --> 02:44:30.108]  That's right.
[02:44:30.108 --> 02:44:31.649]  And I think we're starting to figure it out.
[02:44:32.634 --> 02:44:36.195]  That's why it looks, that's why everything is just so transparent.
[02:44:36.195 --> 02:44:38.755]  Everywhere you turn, it's like, oh my god, what a lie!
[02:44:38.755 --> 02:44:40.476]  Oh my god, that's such an obvious lie!
[02:44:40.476 --> 02:44:42.676]  You know?
[02:44:42.676 --> 02:44:50.018]  And that's why 9-11, as the years go by, people are starting to wake up to like, wait a minute, it's just a Santa Claus conspiracy!
[02:44:50.018 --> 02:44:57.800]  A big fat guy can't sit down at Little Pipe, you know, and put a 2,000 pound spread on your roof with 8 reindeer, the roof will collapse!
[02:44:59.170 --> 02:45:01.412]  And he can't get to China and to your room.
[02:45:01.412 --> 02:45:03.094]  You see, that's the perfect metaphor.
[02:45:03.094 --> 02:45:05.877]  If you're asleep, you know, he sees you when you're sleeping.
[02:45:05.877 --> 02:45:06.777]  He knows when you're awake.
[02:45:06.777 --> 02:45:08.359]  He knows if you've been bad or good.
[02:45:08.359 --> 02:45:10.761]  So go to sleep, otherwise you don't get the presents.
[02:45:10.761 --> 02:45:17.808]  You know, meanwhile, if you're awake, perfect metaphor, you see that mom and dad are arguing over the, you know, the bicycle they can't put together for you.
[02:45:17.808 --> 02:45:18.669]  So that's the thing.
[02:45:18.669 --> 02:45:21.492]  You just, you know, it's the Santa Claus conspiracy.
[02:45:22.295 --> 02:45:31.165]  Well, you know, I've got great parents, and they never instilled fairy tales in me, but when I was about three, it's one of my earliest really clear memories.
[02:45:31.165 --> 02:45:42.197]  There was the chimney in their little house on San Fernando Way in Dallas, Texas, and it had the red bricks with the little spaces in between under the mortar.
[02:45:43.098 --> 02:45:47.779]  And they were explaining Santa Claus comes down to the chimney like in between these bricks.
[02:45:47.779 --> 02:45:51.260]  I remember being three years old and saying, but he's big and fat.
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:54.240]  This chimney is little bitty because it was a small house.
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:56.661]  There's no way he's coming down this.
[02:45:56.661 --> 02:45:59.802]  And my dad said, yeah, it's just fine.
[02:45:59.802 --> 02:46:01.442]  It's not really true.
[02:46:01.442 --> 02:46:06.623]  But it's just like they were on the news saying we're going to blow up building seven.
[02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:07.923]  Then they blew it up.
[02:46:07.923 --> 02:46:09.864]  Then they said, you never saw that on the news.
[02:46:11.415 --> 02:46:13.276]  I mean, it's laughably tragic.
[02:46:13.276 --> 02:46:14.978]  It's really unbelievable.
[02:46:14.978 --> 02:46:16.539]  It's really unbelievable.
[02:46:16.539 --> 02:46:21.342]  The whole thing about 9-11, all you have to know is that 2 plus 2 is 4.
[02:46:21.342 --> 02:46:22.843]  That's all you have to know.
[02:46:22.843 --> 02:46:29.507]  That buildings cannot fall in 10 seconds without, unless there's free fall speed.
[02:46:29.507 --> 02:46:31.529]  It can't do it if there's gravity.
[02:46:33.251 --> 02:46:40.922]  Well they blow all three of them up in front of everybody, and then that day they're saying we're blowing it up, there's cops saying get back, we're blowing it up, and uh...
[02:46:42.304 --> 02:46:44.165]  And again, that's the mind control, the matrix.
[02:46:44.165 --> 02:46:45.886]  Those cops weren't involved in it.
[02:46:45.886 --> 02:46:48.587]  They were just told, and we've talked to the cops, there was a countdown.
[02:46:48.587 --> 02:46:50.728]  They were told for two hours before, we're going to blow it up.
[02:46:50.728 --> 02:46:55.231]  And the cops went, you know, they didn't think, well, how do you wire a building when it's on fire?
[02:46:55.231 --> 02:46:56.932]  It takes weeks to do this right.
[02:46:56.932 --> 02:46:58.072]  And then they blew it up perfectly.
[02:46:58.072 --> 02:47:00.474]  And the cops were like, get back, they're blowing it up.
[02:47:00.474 --> 02:47:02.735]  And then Silverstein comes out and says, we blew it up.
[02:47:02.735 --> 02:47:04.075]  People say, well, how did you blow it up?
[02:47:04.075 --> 02:47:05.776]  He says, well, I didn't mean that.
[02:47:05.776 --> 02:47:10.359]  And then we have a Fox News reporter go, yeah, no, Silverstein was talking about blowing it up that day.
[02:47:10.859 --> 02:47:11.819]  Yeah, of course not.
[02:47:11.819 --> 02:47:13.060]  I mean, this is what's so crazy.
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:15.501]  Of course they're going to say that, you know?
[02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:18.362]  Yeah, exactly, because they can't... It's on shifting sands.
[02:47:18.362 --> 02:47:20.743]  You see, the rock of truth, it's built on a rock.
[02:47:20.743 --> 02:47:21.503]  And it never changes.
[02:47:21.503 --> 02:47:22.023]  2 plus 2 is always 4.
[02:47:22.023 --> 02:47:22.603]  It's never, ooh, maybe 5.
[02:47:38.982 --> 02:47:40.203]  I mean, that's the perfect story.
[02:47:40.203 --> 02:47:41.683]  You know, did you ever watch the movie 1984?
[02:47:41.683 --> 02:47:42.524]  Oh, yes.
[02:47:42.524 --> 02:47:49.687]  Yeah, so you remember, like, when John Heard is in the Ministry of Love, which is a torture chamber, and Richard Burton's holding up four fingers?
[02:47:49.687 --> 02:47:51.007]  He says, how many fingers am I holding up?
[02:47:51.007 --> 02:47:53.028]  He says four, and he gets tortured.
[02:47:53.028 --> 02:47:54.929]  The camera goes back, it comes back up.
[02:47:54.929 --> 02:47:56.350]  He says, he holds up four fingers.
[02:47:56.350 --> 02:47:57.670]  He says, how many fingers am I holding up?
[02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:58.591]  He says, I don't know.
[02:47:58.591 --> 02:48:01.672]  He says, that's better.
[02:48:01.672 --> 02:48:03.113]  And that's the whole thing.
[02:48:03.113 --> 02:48:04.173]  They just want to wear you down.
[02:48:04.173 --> 02:48:07.595]  If you're terrified and tortured, then you just don't want to be killed.
[02:48:08.556 --> 02:48:10.297]  You know, and that's what happened on that day.
[02:48:10.297 --> 02:48:12.138]  It was a shock and awe of 9-11.
[02:48:12.138 --> 02:48:13.799]  Everyone stared to death.
[02:48:13.799 --> 02:48:15.820]  It's just, you know, I do believe in spooks.
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:16.741]  I do, I do, I do.
[02:48:16.741 --> 02:48:18.822]  Just don't kill me, you know what I mean?
[02:48:18.822 --> 02:48:20.283]  And here's the biggest tell.
[02:48:20.283 --> 02:48:26.506]  Not just all the evidence and the drills and the Northwoods and the PNAC documents and the hijackers trained at U.S.
[02:48:26.506 --> 02:48:30.589]  bases on and on and on forever and the lies about WMDs.
[02:48:31.926 --> 02:48:36.209]  The biggest issue is within about 15-20 minutes, I'm watching the channels live.
[02:48:36.209 --> 02:48:42.273]  I'm in the shower, my wife, girlfriend at the time, wife now, comes and says, get out, get out, something's happened.
[02:48:42.273 --> 02:48:47.197]  And I come out, and I'm sitting there toweling off, and one tower's been hit.
[02:48:48.646 --> 02:48:48.726]  Yeah.
[02:49:05.842 --> 02:49:07.223]  And they were all saying the same thing.
[02:49:07.223 --> 02:49:08.063]  It's a new world order.
[02:49:08.063 --> 02:49:09.624]  You're going to have to give your rights up.
[02:49:09.624 --> 02:49:11.204]  We're going to have to attack Iraq.
[02:49:11.204 --> 02:49:13.345]  And it was all the same script.
[02:49:13.345 --> 02:49:15.246]  And if you're in the media, you understand the script.
[02:49:15.246 --> 02:49:16.086]  I mean, you're an actress.
[02:49:16.086 --> 02:49:17.507]  You understand a script.
[02:49:17.507 --> 02:49:19.307]  And you can do the same play in L.A.
[02:49:19.307 --> 02:49:26.990]  that you can do in San Francisco, or you can do in New York City on Broadway, and you know the script.
[02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:28.251]  You're like, oh, that's Othello.
[02:49:29.031 --> 02:49:31.952]  Or, that's Romeo and Juliet.
[02:49:31.952 --> 02:49:35.012]  Or, you know, that's whatever play it is.
[02:49:35.012 --> 02:49:37.933]  I mean, I'm watching them reading scripts.
[02:49:37.933 --> 02:49:39.093]  Yeah.
[02:49:39.093 --> 02:49:43.854]  Well, what about when they told you early that Welding 7 was coming down?
[02:49:43.854 --> 02:49:46.715]  They said it at 5 o'clock and it didn't come down till 5.25.
[02:49:46.715 --> 02:49:47.375]  No, exactly!
[02:49:47.375 --> 02:49:49.755]  And it was an exact script on three different networks.
[02:49:49.755 --> 02:49:50.755]  Whoops!
[02:49:50.755 --> 02:49:53.536]  A little early!
[02:49:53.536 --> 02:49:54.596]  It's so transparent.
[02:49:54.596 --> 02:49:55.876]  You see, that's the way lies are.
[02:49:55.876 --> 02:49:58.457]  You have to keep changing the story in order to keep it going.
[02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.194]  You know, with the truth, you just have to tell it once.
[02:50:01.194 --> 02:50:02.738]  It's so much easier.
[02:50:02.738 --> 02:50:08.432]  Well, Mark Twain said, if you tell the truth, you never have to remember anything.
[02:50:09.813 --> 02:50:11.895]  And that's what's so easy about my job.
[02:50:11.895 --> 02:50:18.020]  I mean, as soon as I get facts and figures and numbers backwards, but it's rare.
[02:50:18.020 --> 02:50:23.764]  In a four-hour show, maybe once a day, I'll listen back to the show, and I'll hear something isn't exactly right, and I'll come back and correct it.
[02:50:23.764 --> 02:50:33.352]  But these guys are... I mean, it's like Fox News saying there was never a plan to blow up Building 7, and then now one of their senior people goes, okay, we were there, they were talking about blowing it up.
[02:50:34.355 --> 02:50:35.576]  And it's just incredible.
[02:50:35.576 --> 02:50:37.637]  Christine Ebersole, thank you for standing up.
[02:50:37.637 --> 02:50:45.241]  Thank you for empowering people through the suppression, through this brainwashing, for breaking the spell and helping others break the spell.
[02:50:45.241 --> 02:50:46.222]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:50:46.222 --> 02:50:47.002]  It was great talking to you.
[02:50:47.002 --> 02:50:48.443]  And I'll say bye to you during the break.
[02:50:48.443 --> 02:50:49.924]  And thanks for everything you do.
[02:50:49.924 --> 02:50:50.324]  Thank you.
[02:50:50.324 --> 02:50:51.745]  We appreciate you, Christine.
[02:50:51.745 --> 02:50:56.467]  Christine Ebersole, standing up against the New World Order and helping others break out of the matrix.
[02:50:56.467 --> 02:50:59.569]  We'll be right back with the good news on climate change.

[02:52:01.531 --> 02:52:03.914]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.914 --> 02:52:06.257]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:06.257 --> 02:52:09.461]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.461 --> 02:52:14.568]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.568 --> 02:52:18.773]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.073 --> 02:52:21.536]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.536 --> 02:52:23.959]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.959 --> 02:52:27.222]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.222 --> 02:52:34.831]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.157 --> 02:52:40.539]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.539 --> 02:52:42.859]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.859 --> 02:52:47.080]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:48.141]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:48.141 --> 02:52:49.501]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:13.010 --> 02:53:17.053]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[02:53:17.053 --> 02:53:21.655]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:53:21.655 --> 02:53:25.678]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[02:53:42.577 --> 02:53:44.078]  Every stitch guaranteed.

[02:53:51.063 --> 02:53:51.443]  Others don't.
[02:54:03.391 --> 02:54:08.032]  Okay, Judge Andrew Napolitano is on in the last 30 minutes of the next hour on key issues.
[02:54:08.032 --> 02:54:10.454]  I want to congratulate him.
[02:54:10.454 --> 02:54:12.414]  I can find nothing wrong with this guy.
[02:54:12.414 --> 02:54:17.757]  I wish I could say that about everybody at Fox, but we're just really excited to have this constitutionalist on with us.
[02:54:17.757 --> 02:54:19.357]  Congratulations to him.
[02:54:19.357 --> 02:54:26.560]  He is getting, I knew about this months ago, but couldn't talk about it, he is getting the show on the Fox Business Network that goes out worldwide.
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:27.541]  So not just a
[02:54:27.981 --> 02:54:33.483]  Contributor to Fox TV, but now his own TV show destined to be very successful.
[02:54:33.483 --> 02:54:35.063]  And so we're excited about that.
[02:54:35.063 --> 02:54:35.943]  We've got him coming up.
[02:54:35.943 --> 02:54:38.884]  I want to go to Tim, Tim, Jason, Tim.
[02:54:38.884 --> 02:54:43.725]  Sometimes you just get a bunch of the same name, Mark and others that are patiently holding.
[02:54:43.725 --> 02:54:45.106]  In fact, I'm just going to go to your calls now.
[02:54:45.106 --> 02:54:52.488]  And then when we eight after second segment, the next hour, I'm going to get into the Copenhagen falling apart completely.
[02:54:52.488 --> 02:54:56.169]  I mean, this this news is so good, so wonderful.
[02:54:57.005 --> 02:54:58.766]  We're going to be talking about it.
[02:54:58.766 --> 02:55:00.726]  Right now, let's go to Tim in Nevada.
[02:55:00.726 --> 02:55:02.607]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:55:02.607 --> 02:55:03.827]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[02:55:03.827 --> 02:55:05.528]  It's good to be back in the United States.
[02:55:05.528 --> 02:55:09.329]  I call your show quite a bit from South America.
[02:55:09.329 --> 02:55:11.349]  I'm touring in the United States on a wrestling tour.
[02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:20.472]  I had to come through Washington, D.C., and I had a similar experience to my fellow performer there.
[02:55:20.472 --> 02:55:26.194]  I can't believe when I was listening to what she went through, it sounded like a typical criminal molestation.
[02:55:26.849 --> 02:55:39.131]  I mean, I couldn't believe what they put her through, but they made me take my championship belt out of my bag because they said it was blocking the view of my carry-on.
[02:55:39.131 --> 02:55:40.031]  So that was embarrassing.
[02:55:40.031 --> 02:55:42.772]  I had to take my belt out in front of everybody.
[02:55:42.772 --> 02:55:47.873]  And then after that, I did everything they told me to do, going through the scanners.
[02:55:47.873 --> 02:55:55.394]  And then they wanted me to go into the full-body scanner at the Customs after I scanned my passport, scanned my visa, everything from Brazil.
[02:55:56.463 --> 02:55:58.585]  They wanted to get your biometric body scan.
[02:55:58.585 --> 02:55:59.905]  What happened next?
[02:55:59.905 --> 02:56:01.426]  Well, I refused.
[02:56:01.426 --> 02:56:04.629]  I told them I was afraid of the radiation.
[02:56:04.629 --> 02:56:05.709]  I didn't want to go through it.
[02:56:05.709 --> 02:56:10.673]  I told them I felt that it was against my Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.
[02:56:10.673 --> 02:56:15.596]  And that I did have a lawyer and that if they wanted to give me a problem, I said, take a look at my belt.
[02:56:15.596 --> 02:56:16.717]  I'm not a nobody.
[02:56:16.717 --> 02:56:17.978]  I do have lawyers.
[02:56:17.978 --> 02:56:19.539]  And so what happened?
[02:56:19.539 --> 02:56:25.363]  Well, they basically asked me to step over behind... It wasn't a room, but it was like a glass.
[02:56:26.095 --> 02:56:26.435]  I don't know.
[02:56:26.435 --> 02:56:31.357]  It looked like one of the cubicles, but it was see-through glass.
[02:56:31.357 --> 02:56:34.698]  And they basically wanted me down, and then they wanted to pat me down.
[02:56:34.698 --> 02:56:36.899]  And I said, you know, I'm not a criminal.
[02:56:36.899 --> 02:56:39.520]  I'm not being suspected of anything.
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:40.981]  You have checked my bags.
[02:56:40.981 --> 02:56:43.662]  I've been very, very cooperative.
[02:56:43.662 --> 02:56:45.262]  You have no right to do this to me.
[02:56:45.262 --> 02:56:47.723]  I don't want you touching me.
[02:56:47.723 --> 02:56:51.265]  I then reiterated again that I do have legal representation.
[02:56:51.265 --> 02:56:51.925]  And then what happened?
[02:56:52.580 --> 02:56:59.922]  Well, they basically told me that I was allowed to go, but then the TSA security, he looked like a kid younger than me.
[02:56:59.922 --> 02:57:03.982]  He was at least 21 years old.
[02:57:03.982 --> 02:57:06.603]  He took my suitcase and he threw it on the ground and broke it.
[02:57:06.603 --> 02:57:07.743]  It was a 70-pound suitcase.
[02:57:07.743 --> 02:57:10.684]  I had my laptop and all my belongings in it.
[02:57:10.684 --> 02:57:12.744]  So now they smash your goods.
[02:57:12.744 --> 02:57:13.685]  Yeah.
[02:57:13.685 --> 02:57:20.426]  And I tried to report it to a supervisor, and the supervisor, you know, I love it when they try to say, sir, sir, sir, like they're being polite.
[02:57:21.414 --> 02:57:27.197]  But what they're really trying to do is just be, you know, like a polite way of saying, uh, you're going to do whatever we want.
[02:57:27.197 --> 02:57:28.838]  Period.
[02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:29.919]  Or don't get excited, sir.
[02:57:29.919 --> 02:57:31.900]  Don't get excited as they get in your face.
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:32.320]  Exactly.
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:36.162]  And then they tried, uh, you know, I'm in my, my prime right now as a professional wrestler.
[02:57:36.162 --> 02:57:42.106]  And, uh, as, as the great Jesse, the body Ventura, I'm a pretty big guy myself.
[02:57:42.106 --> 02:57:47.909]  So they try to, they tend to try to flip the card on you and they try to pick on you and make you seem like,
[02:57:48.633 --> 02:57:52.534]  Um, you're a violent person for sticking up for yourself because you're a big person.
[02:57:52.534 --> 02:57:53.815]  You're bigger than everybody else.
[02:57:53.815 --> 02:57:55.835]  Also, they said, oh, you're a big tough guy.
[02:57:55.835 --> 02:57:56.615]  Oh, you're big.
[02:57:56.615 --> 02:57:57.116]  Exactly.
[02:57:57.116 --> 02:57:58.556]  And then, oh, you're picking on us.
[02:57:58.556 --> 02:58:01.397]  You're picking on, oh, this big guy's giving us problems.
[02:58:01.397 --> 02:58:03.398]  And then they call the other people over.
[02:58:03.398 --> 02:58:09.019]  I said, look, you have no right to pick my personal belongings up off the belt and then throw it on the ground.
[02:58:09.019 --> 02:58:13.941]  He broke the, uh, the handle that folds out.
[02:58:13.941 --> 02:58:16.561]  And it totally broke off the suitcase from the scene.
[02:58:16.561 --> 02:58:17.602]  And I was pissed off.
[02:58:17.602 --> 02:58:18.022]  I was like,
[02:58:18.908 --> 02:58:22.210]  You know, what the heck?
[02:58:22.210 --> 02:58:27.733]  Well, I got away with just, you know, basically telling the boss off and I didn't get a SWAT team after me, thank God.

[03:00:15.622 --> 03:00:18.282]  I'm going to go over a whole bunch of important news.
[03:00:18.282 --> 03:00:30.765]  Texas is now, we have lawmakers now calling for the Arizona-style law saying if they run into illegals during regular traffic stops for drunk driving or whatever the case may be, and you're here illegally, they're going to charge you with that as well.
[03:00:30.765 --> 03:00:32.145]  They're going to bring you to the feds.
[03:00:32.885 --> 03:00:36.586]  The media is spinning it like it's going to be checkpoints in Nazi Germany.
[03:00:36.586 --> 03:00:40.768]  No, that's for citizens with the blood-taking checkpoints and the body scanners.
[03:00:40.768 --> 03:00:45.830]  The illegals, and I've seen it and it's been on the news, they're allowed on the airplanes without any IDs.
[03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:48.611]  Okay, see I want the rights they got.
[03:00:48.611 --> 03:00:50.172]  I want to be left alone like they are.
[03:00:51.252 --> 03:00:52.552]  Get right down to it.

[03:00:53.073 --> 03:00:53.473]  citizen.
[03:00:53.473 --> 03:00:54.953]  That doesn't mean I'm total trash here.
[03:00:54.953 --> 03:00:55.874]  Come on.
[03:00:55.874 --> 03:00:58.394]  But we're taking your phone calls right now.
[03:00:58.394 --> 03:01:00.675]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim.
[03:01:00.675 --> 03:01:02.016]  Tim in Georgia.
[03:01:02.016 --> 03:01:03.836]  Tim, you're on the air.
[03:01:03.836 --> 03:01:04.457]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:04.457 --> 03:01:16.141]  I just wanted to tell you what a great witness you gave the other day when you had the degenerate atheist comedian guy on, and to hear the contrast between your approach to life versus his.
[03:01:18.162 --> 03:01:29.808]  It really meant something when you heard it and you could just see the difference in what it means to have a purposeful, meaningful life and to just be dilly-dallying around and say, oh, I'm just having a great time and blah, blah, blah.
[03:01:29.808 --> 03:01:34.070]  Well, I mean, Doug Stanhope, I don't think is a bad person and he's a talented guy at certain levels.
[03:01:34.730 --> 03:01:36.893]  But it's, you know, just look at the bad in the world.
[03:01:36.893 --> 03:01:39.497]  Some people accuse me of being negative because I'm pointing out the bad.
[03:01:39.497 --> 03:01:49.911]  No, I'm going after the bad to protect this wonderland we live in of beauty and this creation and hundreds of billions of galaxies spinning around us.
[03:01:49.911 --> 03:01:51.573]  I mean, it's every moment.
[03:01:52.034 --> 03:01:52.174]  Yeah.
[03:02:14.113 --> 03:02:16.416]  But it matters to hear the difference.
[03:02:16.416 --> 03:02:31.815]  To have you and him talking at the same time and to be able to actively compare the difference between two people with entirely different views on life was very nice to hear and it was uplifting to hear that
[03:02:34.258 --> 03:02:38.163]  You can just see the difference, the contrast, it was just amazing to see.
[03:02:55.762 --> 03:02:59.325]  But that's really the spirit of the world.
[03:02:59.325 --> 03:03:03.289]  I mean, the attitude he has about everything is just so sad.
[03:03:03.289 --> 03:03:10.615]  And even if you don't believe in God or a creator of the universe, I mean, who made the hundreds of billions of galaxies that Hubble has photographed?
[03:03:10.615 --> 03:03:13.798]  Hundreds of billions, with each galaxy having
[03:03:15.069 --> 03:03:19.011]  Between tens of millions of stars, tens of billions and tens of trillions.
[03:03:19.011 --> 03:03:21.151]  They're all different sizes and combinations.
[03:03:21.151 --> 03:03:30.195]  And to look at those giant gas clouds forming billions of stars, you know, inside galaxies, and to see black holes, and what is it?
[03:03:30.195 --> 03:03:30.975]  Where does it go?
[03:03:30.975 --> 03:03:31.716]  Where does it end?
[03:03:31.716 --> 03:03:32.916]  You know, what made it?
[03:03:32.916 --> 03:03:35.897]  I mean, what is reality?
[03:03:35.897 --> 03:03:36.558]  I mean, it's so...
[03:03:37.638 --> 03:03:42.141]  Unbelievable to be able to just to be conscious and to have this gift.
[03:03:42.141 --> 03:03:44.742]  It makes me want to fall flat on my face to the Creator.
[03:03:44.742 --> 03:03:45.843]  I can feel the Creator.
[03:03:45.843 --> 03:03:47.023]  I can feel it in the universe.
[03:03:47.023 --> 03:03:49.144]  I know what good and evil is.
[03:03:49.144 --> 03:03:54.647]  And I just can't imagine people that just think humanity is a bunch of trash.
[03:03:54.647 --> 03:03:55.548]  That's what the elite think.
[03:03:55.548 --> 03:03:58.209]  They think we're all a bunch of trash and they want to kill us.
[03:03:58.209 --> 03:03:59.610]  And I'm just, I'm not for it.
[03:03:59.610 --> 03:04:00.971]  I mean, and then I'm the bad guy.
[03:04:02.233 --> 03:04:03.114]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:03.114 --> 03:04:10.278]  Like, to hear that attitude, you just hear the elite working through individuals like that.
[03:04:10.278 --> 03:04:13.721]  Just like, it's coming out of their eyes and their mouths.
[03:04:13.721 --> 03:04:17.323]  Like the puppet master just saying, here say this, here say that, here say this.
[03:04:17.723 --> 03:04:20.665]  And it'll spread, and it's an easy sell.
[03:04:20.665 --> 03:04:22.186]  They sap our life force.
[03:04:22.186 --> 03:04:23.948]  They sap our will to resist.
[03:04:23.948 --> 03:04:25.289]  They sap our will to live.
[03:04:25.289 --> 03:04:27.230]  They sap our will to procreate.
[03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:29.592]  They sap our humanity.
[03:04:29.592 --> 03:04:39.038]  Being humans means you love, you fight, you stand up against evil, you have children, you struggle to raise them right, you struggle to keep them from falling to the world.
[03:04:39.038 --> 03:04:41.240]  That's what makes us strong.
[03:04:41.240 --> 03:04:45.163]  And the moment you just jellyfish out and roll over like a dead whale,
[03:04:46.003 --> 03:04:47.104]  It's just sickening.
[03:04:47.104 --> 03:04:48.465]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[03:04:48.465 --> 03:04:50.687]  More calls straight ahead and a ton of news.
[03:04:50.687 --> 03:04:51.408]  I'm Alex Jones.

[03:05:00.395 --> 03:05:01.956]  Humanity is strong!
[03:05:01.956 --> 03:05:04.038]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[03:05:04.847 --> 03:05:06.268]  Now what am I going to do?
[03:05:06.268 --> 03:05:08.428]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[03:05:08.428 --> 03:05:09.329]  Okay.
[03:05:09.329 --> 03:05:10.389]  Here's a site.
[03:05:10.389 --> 03:05:12.110]  ReplacementRemotes.com.

[03:05:14.791 --> 03:05:17.612]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[03:05:17.612 --> 03:05:19.353]  Thanks, Max.
[03:05:19.353 --> 03:05:20.173]  Wow!
[03:05:20.173 --> 03:05:21.594]  They have my original remote!
[03:05:22.276 --> 03:05:24.879]  And an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[03:06:01.755 --> 03:06:04.778]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.778 --> 03:06:10.105]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:10.105 --> 03:06:12.147]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:12.147 --> 03:06:17.153]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:17.153 --> 03:06:18.334]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.334 --> 03:06:19.075]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.455 --> 03:06:21.336]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.336 --> 03:06:22.417]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.417 --> 03:06:24.598]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.598 --> 03:06:25.939]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.939 --> 03:06:27.479]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.479 --> 03:06:32.742]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.742 --> 03:06:36.324]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.324 --> 03:06:39.786]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:40.146 --> 03:06:41.367]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.367 --> 03:06:42.267]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.267 --> 03:06:43.368]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.368 --> 03:06:44.309]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:45.389]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.389 --> 03:06:48.451]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.451 --> 03:06:50.653]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:50.653 --> 03:06:51.653]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.882 --> 03:07:02.183]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:02.183 --> 03:07:07.766]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:07:07.766 --> 03:07:12.788]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:07:12.788 --> 03:07:17.831]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:07:18.351 --> 03:07:23.595]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:07:23.595 --> 03:07:30.701]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:07:30.701 --> 03:07:31.822]  And here's the best part.
[03:07:31.822 --> 03:07:38.187]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:07:38.507 --> 03:07:41.689]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:41.689 --> 03:07:43.911]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:43.911 --> 03:07:44.791]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:07:44.791 --> 03:07:45.052]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:07:45.052 --> 03:07:48.494]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:07:48.494 --> 03:07:50.255]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:08:06.465 --> 03:08:11.288]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:11.288 --> 03:08:12.889]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:14.430]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.430 --> 03:08:18.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.632 --> 03:08:22.694]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.549 --> 03:08:37.650]  All right, we are now into the fourth and final hour, second segment here.
[03:08:37.650 --> 03:08:43.092]  Judge Andrew Napolitano coming up in about T-minus 25 minutes.
[03:08:43.092 --> 03:08:51.614]  I want to run over some news and we're going to go right back to your phone calls, those of you that are patiently holding, Jason, Tim, Mark, Quentin, Tony, and others.
[03:08:51.614 --> 03:08:54.835]  We should at least get to those calls before our guest joins us.
[03:08:54.835 --> 03:08:55.055]  Okay.
[03:08:57.376 --> 03:08:58.177]  Schwarzenegger
[03:09:15.925 --> 03:09:20.449]  At the top of that are JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, criminals, at the top.
[03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:23.912]  It doesn't mean all their employees, but the system committing all these crimes.
[03:09:23.912 --> 03:09:28.176]  And they said, we're going to pay all these taxes and value-added taxes and VAT.
[03:09:28.176 --> 03:09:31.579]  Financial taxes will be paid to the IMF World Bank.
[03:09:31.579 --> 03:09:32.720]  That has gotten in a lot of trouble.
[03:09:32.720 --> 03:09:36.263]  So now they're calling it world financial reform, the exact same taxes.
[03:09:37.245 --> 03:09:41.671]  And they'll come back with some new reason, you know, an anti-terror tax, a security tax.
[03:09:41.671 --> 03:09:48.740]  But it's the same system, global governance, and that's been called for all week long by Obama, by Gordon Brown, and by others.
[03:09:49.810 --> 03:10:02.876]  But the good news is, some of the biggest stalwarts supporting this, Germany, France, Australia, and others, in the last week, have completely pulled out of it.
[03:10:02.876 --> 03:10:09.960]  And I'm reading what Sarkozy said, because in a parliamentary election he almost lost control of the country.
[03:10:10.980 --> 03:10:13.581]  Merkel's in trouble because of this.
[03:10:13.581 --> 03:10:16.322]  The Prime Minister of Australia is in trouble.
[03:10:16.322 --> 03:10:20.863]  And they're saying, in a concerted effort, okay, it's off the table for at least three years.
[03:10:20.863 --> 03:10:31.846]  Now, they're waiting for our movement to expose them as criminals, bringing in this carbon tax to control our entire economy and shut down our industrial base.
[03:10:31.846 --> 03:10:34.027]  And that's the UN's own statements.
[03:10:34.027 --> 03:10:37.108]  Quote, destroy an industrial society so they can control us.
[03:10:38.479 --> 03:10:41.341]  But here is Der Spiegel today.
[03:10:41.341 --> 03:10:42.562]  Copenhagen fallout.
[03:10:42.562 --> 03:10:46.306]  Merkel abandons aim of binding climate agreement.
[03:10:46.306 --> 03:10:55.193]  Frustrated by the climate change conference in December, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is quietly moving away from her goal of a binding agreement on limiting climate change.
[03:10:55.193 --> 03:10:57.535]  And it continues.
[03:10:57.535 --> 03:11:01.398]  Here is another article out of the National Post.
[03:11:02.759 --> 03:11:16.869]  Seeing countries around the world back away from their climate change commitments and seeing his own electoral support crumble, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced today that Australia will be shelving its cap and trade program for at least three years until after the next election.
[03:11:16.869 --> 03:11:25.475]  That will provide the Australian government at the time with a better position to assess the level of global action on climate change, he told the Australian press.
[03:11:26.701 --> 03:11:30.732]  So what's happening there is they're publicly backing off.
[03:11:30.732 --> 03:11:33.018]  Now, Gordon Brown and Obama, they're not.
[03:11:34.591 --> 03:11:35.952]  And Schwarzenegger isn't.
[03:11:35.952 --> 03:11:38.293]  In the U.S., they've still got it in the Senate.
[03:11:38.293 --> 03:11:40.193]  Obama has implemented it two weeks ago.
[03:11:40.193 --> 03:11:44.735]  The EPA is going after factories, coal-powered plants, coal mines.
[03:11:44.735 --> 03:11:53.039]  They're now, outside of law, just creating new fines and fees and expanding other regulatory fees against our industrial base.
[03:11:53.039 --> 03:12:01.723]  Remember, China, India, Mexico, and 100-plus, it's over 160-plus, nations are making zero cuts.
[03:12:01.723 --> 03:12:03.464]  So our industry will just leave and go there.
[03:12:04.304 --> 03:12:04.464]  I think?
[03:12:19.464 --> 03:12:23.286]  It isn't true that polar bears are dying, it isn't true the ice caps are melting, they're getting bigger.
[03:12:23.286 --> 03:12:24.426]  It just doesn't matter.
[03:12:24.426 --> 03:12:29.508]  They think the public are a bunch of morons, and they're not morons, they're just not focused on real issues.
[03:12:29.508 --> 03:12:31.569]  We're gonna get them focused on real issues.
[03:12:31.569 --> 03:12:35.851]  We're gonna slap them upside the head with an intellectual 2x4.
[03:12:35.851 --> 03:12:40.913]  That's what we're doing with the films and the radio show and the activists, and we're not gonna stop.
[03:12:40.913 --> 03:12:42.214]  So that is very exciting news.
[03:12:42.214 --> 03:12:44.455]  The problem is, Schwarzenegger
[03:12:46.553 --> 03:12:48.354]  In fact, let's Google this for people right now on air.
[03:12:48.354 --> 03:12:49.774]  Let me try to call it from memory.
[03:12:49.774 --> 03:12:51.655]  It's a memory game, one of the exact headlines.
[03:12:51.655 --> 03:13:01.799]  Schwarzenegger organizes Council of Governors and Mayors to fight climate change.
[03:13:04.722 --> 03:13:11.250]  And he said we're going to go to the cities and counties and levy these taxes and California's now done it.
[03:13:11.250 --> 03:13:17.858]  Austin was seized in a vote last week.
[03:13:17.858 --> 03:13:22.323]  On Earth Day, $2.6 billion in taxes on our power and on our gas.
[03:13:23.703 --> 03:13:25.783]  And it's just all going to the banks.
[03:13:25.783 --> 03:13:32.585]  And so it's going to be a pitched guerrilla info war now, where we're not fighting the big death star of the UN at this point.
[03:13:32.585 --> 03:13:37.005]  They've got their minions working for the banks at the local levels doing this as a guilt trip.
[03:13:37.005 --> 03:13:40.086]  Oh, open the borders up or you're racist.
[03:13:40.086 --> 03:13:42.286]  Oh, you don't want to keep your wages.
[03:13:42.286 --> 03:13:44.567]  Oh, Naftingat is good or you're racist.
[03:13:44.567 --> 03:13:47.927]  Oh, carbon taxes are good or you want to kill the earth.
[03:13:47.927 --> 03:13:51.028]  Oh, guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt.
[03:13:51.869 --> 03:13:53.871]  But the good news is it's not working anymore.
[03:13:53.871 --> 03:14:06.541]  And on the subject of what Arizona has done, saying that, and I've read the bill, I've covered it here on air, it does not say they're going to set up checkpoints and arrest people with brown skin.
[03:14:06.541 --> 03:14:08.322]  Close to half of Arizona is Hispanic.
[03:14:08.322 --> 03:14:09.663]  They're great Americans.
[03:14:09.663 --> 03:14:09.923]  Okay?
[03:14:12.898 --> 03:14:13.718]  They know what's going on.
[03:14:13.718 --> 03:14:20.081]  That's why in Gallup polls, and some of them are over 80%, most are in the low 70s, of Hispanic Americans want to control the borders.
[03:14:20.081 --> 03:14:25.543]  They don't buy the lie that, well, Hispanics don't want there not to be amnesty.
[03:14:25.543 --> 03:14:26.344]  That's not even true.
[03:14:26.344 --> 03:14:34.947]  That's like a mind control thing where everybody agrees man-made global warming's real, the science is settled, no one disagrees.
[03:14:34.947 --> 03:14:36.928]  Well, it's settled.
[03:14:36.928 --> 03:14:38.629]  All Hispanics want open borders.
[03:14:38.629 --> 03:14:40.310]  Yes, they all want the country overrun.
[03:14:41.144 --> 03:14:48.211]  With poor people that will bankrupt the welfare system and who will drive down the wages.
[03:14:48.211 --> 03:14:52.875]  I mean, there's 6 plus billion people who want to come to the United States.
[03:14:52.875 --> 03:14:55.017]  There's 6.5 plus billion people.
[03:14:55.017 --> 03:14:56.218]  There's 300 million here.
[03:14:56.218 --> 03:14:59.461]  So there's 6.2 plus billion people that want to come here.
[03:14:59.461 --> 03:15:01.343]  I mean, have you been to a third world country?
[03:15:01.343 --> 03:15:03.325]  Do you know what it's like?
[03:15:03.325 --> 03:15:06.828]  Believe me, all you people that want open borders, just go to Mexico City.
[03:15:09.531 --> 03:15:12.093]  Go to Mexico City and then come back.
[03:15:12.093 --> 03:15:13.154]  I mean, it's scary, folks.
[03:15:13.154 --> 03:15:20.159]  25 to 30 million people, dust storms of human feces in the sky, just absolute hell on earth.
[03:15:20.159 --> 03:15:22.281]  The country is completely collapsing.
[03:15:22.281 --> 03:15:28.906]  And I feel sorry for those poor people down there who are desperate for jobs, who've been driven off their property by the UN biosphere movement.
[03:15:28.906 --> 03:15:29.247]  Oh, yes.
[03:15:30.370 --> 03:15:33.952]  They were promised they could move north and get Mckiela Doris jobs on the border.
[03:15:33.952 --> 03:15:38.995]  Almost all of those have been shut down, over 90 percent, because Mexico can't compete with China.
[03:15:38.995 --> 03:15:41.556]  Nothing can compete with the billion slaves.
[03:15:41.556 --> 03:15:44.518]  So it's a giant implosion.
[03:15:44.518 --> 03:15:52.303]  And so Schwarzenegger says that he is now going to have the cities and the counties and the states do it as an act of treason.
[03:15:52.303 --> 03:15:54.404]  The UN coming in to our
[03:15:55.802 --> 03:16:01.863]  country and circumventing the federal government because we're about to gain control of the federal government.
[03:16:01.863 --> 03:16:09.405]  Now, what we have here is something similar, but it's done to defend the Republic under the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[03:16:09.405 --> 03:16:14.286]  If the federal government won't carry out its duties, it's left to the states to defend themselves.
[03:16:14.286 --> 03:16:22.028]  And I agree with Andrew Napolitano that this is going to get shot down in court when Arizona's done, but at least because it is the Fed's purview.
[03:16:22.028 --> 03:16:23.849]  That's one of the few things they've got the jurisdiction on.
[03:16:26.203 --> 03:16:37.531]  But the bigger issue here is that, I'm going to ask the judge about this, former federal judge coming up, a real constitutionalist, constitutional scholar, what do you do though when the feds won't do their job?
[03:16:38.413 --> 03:16:39.713]  So how do you respond to that?
[03:16:39.713 --> 03:16:43.675]  Representative wants Arizona immigration law in Texas.
[03:16:43.675 --> 03:16:46.196]  And this is out of NBC Dallas.
[03:16:46.196 --> 03:16:51.038]  Republican Texas lawmaker plans to introduce a tough immigration measure similar to the new law in Arizona.
[03:16:51.038 --> 03:16:53.819]  A move state Democrats say would be a mistake.
[03:16:53.819 --> 03:16:57.720]  But at least this is showing people that the power is at the state level.
[03:16:57.720 --> 03:16:58.280]  Here's another one.
[03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:01.761]  Arizona cities consider fighting immigration law.
[03:17:01.761 --> 03:17:02.622]  Sanctuary cities.
[03:17:03.556 --> 03:17:06.680]  At least, now look, the state is above the city.
[03:17:06.680 --> 03:17:08.563]  The city is chartered by the state.
[03:17:08.563 --> 03:17:11.086]  That's none of their stinking business.
[03:17:11.086 --> 03:17:15.853]  And the cities, it's unconstitutional for them to go challenge at the federal level.
[03:17:15.853 --> 03:17:16.113]  Okay?
[03:17:16.113 --> 03:17:17.735]  And they're a bunch of criminals when they do this.
[03:17:18.496 --> 03:17:22.078]  It's questionable what the state's doing, but they're doing it out of necessity.
[03:17:22.078 --> 03:17:27.041]  And that's in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, that they have some precedent here.
[03:17:27.041 --> 03:17:29.123]  This is out of control.
[03:17:29.123 --> 03:17:32.325]  They have the cities of Arizona bucking the legislature.
[03:17:32.325 --> 03:17:34.646]  That legislature is elected by the people.
[03:17:34.646 --> 03:17:36.367]  That's your boss, okay?
[03:17:36.367 --> 03:17:38.589]  Your city was chartered under the state legislature.
[03:17:39.369 --> 03:17:40.610]  State Constitution.
[03:17:40.610 --> 03:17:44.692]  At least three Arizona cities are considering a lawsuit to block the new immigration enforcement bill.
[03:17:44.692 --> 03:17:47.313]  The cities include Phoenix, Tucson, and Flagstaff.
[03:17:47.313 --> 03:17:48.453]  And it goes on there.
[03:17:48.453 --> 03:17:51.014]  Just absolutely disgusting.
[03:17:51.014 --> 03:17:54.576]  Continuing, here's another headline out of NBC.
[03:17:54.576 --> 03:17:56.557]  Deport children of illegals.
[03:17:56.557 --> 03:17:58.498]  And that's what a representative is saying out there.
[03:17:58.498 --> 03:18:00.379]  Well, I mean, what do you do when the illegals come across
[03:18:01.857 --> 03:18:08.404]  And they have ads in the newspapers on both sides in California, especially in Texas, and it says, they call anchor babies.
[03:18:08.404 --> 03:18:20.456]  And they wait, they'll even wait until their water breaks, they'll rush across, go into an emergency room, it's all paid for by taxpayer money, and then immediately the whole family goes on welfare, and we get to pay for it.
[03:18:20.456 --> 03:18:24.961]  Absolutely, we need to change the laws where we deport these people.
[03:18:25.836 --> 03:18:26.977]  I mean, they need to be deported.
[03:18:26.977 --> 03:18:30.319]  You can't turn away from the hospital.
[03:18:30.319 --> 03:18:31.780]  But we're all paying for this.
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:33.241]  This is why we're going bankrupt.
[03:18:33.241 --> 03:18:34.442]  Folks, you want to lose your job?
[03:18:34.442 --> 03:18:36.183]  You want to lose your country?
[03:18:36.183 --> 03:18:37.844]  You want to go bankrupt?
[03:18:37.844 --> 03:18:39.746]  You want to be like Latin America?
[03:18:39.746 --> 03:18:42.387]  I mean, listen, this is put-up-or-shut-up time.
[03:18:42.387 --> 03:18:45.129]  The country is being butchered right now.
[03:18:45.129 --> 03:18:46.450]  Okay?
[03:18:46.450 --> 03:18:48.131]  And the globalists are doing the same thing in Europe.
[03:18:48.131 --> 03:18:50.293]  They're doing the same thing worldwide.
[03:18:50.293 --> 03:18:53.335]  They bring in outside groups to then be a voting bloc against the nation.
[03:18:56.690 --> 03:18:58.874]  So, absolutely, we have to change that.
[03:18:58.874 --> 03:19:04.424]  I mean, does Mexico let you go down there and have a baby and get free healthcare?
[03:19:04.424 --> 03:19:05.927]  I mean, can I, as a U.S.
[03:19:05.927 --> 03:19:08.311]  citizen, let's put the shoe on the other foot, okay?
[03:19:09.807 --> 03:19:11.749]  Walk a mile in our shoes, Mexico.
[03:19:11.749 --> 03:19:17.593]  Can you go to Mexico and walk in and have your water break in a hospital and have them pay for everything?
[03:19:17.593 --> 03:19:18.734]  No.
[03:19:18.734 --> 03:19:22.757]  And then your baby gets Mexican citizenship and then you all get welfare?
[03:19:22.757 --> 03:19:23.597]  No.
[03:19:23.597 --> 03:19:27.680]  You will pay for it all if the police can find something you've done wrong.
[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:31.643]  They're going to arrest you, take your kid, and suck a hundred grand out of your family in the U.S.
[03:19:31.643 --> 03:19:32.584]  as extortion artists.
[03:19:33.004 --> 03:19:34.605]  That's what's gonna happen in Mexico.
[03:19:34.605 --> 03:19:48.169]  So, oh, Mexico always playing this guilt, using the goodness of the American people to do this, because what Wells Fargo takes about 30% of the money that's wired back down to Mexico, billions of dollars a year, it's all the big banks.
[03:19:48.169 --> 03:19:54.751]  It's all about using the illegals, using the citizens of America, using us all for the globalists.
[03:19:54.751 --> 03:19:58.972]  So, no, I can't hightail it to Mexico and have everything paid for by the Mexican government.
[03:20:03.301 --> 03:20:05.804]  And you're subject to other police action.
[03:20:05.804 --> 03:20:07.065]  Tyranny is here.
[03:20:07.065 --> 03:20:10.789]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:10.789 --> 03:20:13.231]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:13.231 --> 03:20:19.097]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:20:19.097 --> 03:20:25.323]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:20:25.763 --> 03:20:31.726]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:20:31.726 --> 03:20:35.927]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:20:35.927 --> 03:20:40.209]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:20:40.209 --> 03:20:46.171]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:20:46.171 --> 03:20:49.713]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:20:49.713 --> 03:20:51.694]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:20:51.694 --> 03:20:52.134]  It's here.

[03:22:00.563 --> 03:22:03.524]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:22:03.524 --> 03:22:07.686]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:22:07.686 --> 03:22:09.927]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:09.927 --> 03:22:15.109]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:22:15.109 --> 03:22:16.930]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:22:16.930 --> 03:22:18.471]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:22:18.471 --> 03:22:19.951]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:22:19.951 --> 03:22:23.333]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:22:23.333 --> 03:22:28.355]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:22:28.775 --> 03:22:28.935]  I think?
[03:22:58.815 --> 03:23:02.157]  Hi, this is Steve Shank, eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:02.157 --> 03:23:07.579]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[03:23:07.579 --> 03:23:08.900]  Congratulations!
[03:23:08.900 --> 03:23:15.342]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[03:23:15.342 --> 03:23:20.405]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:23:20.405 --> 03:23:21.205]  Now something fun!
[03:23:21.505 --> 03:23:22.466]  It's springtime.
[03:23:22.466 --> 03:23:30.411]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[03:23:30.411 --> 03:23:31.292]  Here's the plan.
[03:23:31.292 --> 03:23:40.218]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[03:23:40.218 --> 03:23:42.539]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[03:23:42.539 --> 03:23:49.143]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[03:23:49.143 --> 03:23:51.365]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you wait for your
[03:23:51.425 --> 03:23:53.186]  Supplemental Garden to Grow.
[03:23:53.186 --> 03:23:54.587]  Call 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, slash Alex.
[03:24:05.179 --> 03:24:09.122]  Alright, we're going to your calls, and then Judge Andrew Napolitano is scheduled to be on in the next segment.
[03:24:09.122 --> 03:24:10.383]  I want to tell you about a new sponsor.
[03:24:10.383 --> 03:24:11.103]  You're going to love them.
[03:24:11.103 --> 03:24:13.845]  It's Weapons-Universe.com.
[03:24:13.845 --> 03:24:15.886]  Weapons-Universe.com.
[03:24:15.886 --> 03:24:18.128]  Banner's up on Infowars.com.
[03:24:18.128 --> 03:24:23.272]  They've got some of the best prizes and the biggest selection out there of knives, swords, you name it.
[03:24:23.272 --> 03:24:25.533]  Look at this one they sent us, and this sucker's dangerous.
[03:24:25.533 --> 03:24:26.794]  I mean, I want this out of the offices.
[03:24:26.794 --> 03:24:29.176]  It's the most possible thing to fall over on somebody.
[03:24:29.736 --> 03:24:34.263]  I'm a big fan of Conan the Barbarian, the first movie, and the Robert E. Howard books.
[03:24:34.263 --> 03:24:41.774]  I can't stand the second one, but this is the sword from that movie, and a replica made in Spain.
[03:24:41.774 --> 03:24:45.058]  I mean, this is a fine, fine product, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:47.978 --> 03:24:49.919]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:24:49.919 --> 03:24:56.442]  Give me a wide shot on that camera for Prison Planet viewers so I can really... The sword's so big I can't even show them that.
[03:24:56.442 --> 03:25:00.884]  Weapons-Universe.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:00.884 --> 03:25:02.665]  Just amazing stuff.
[03:25:02.665 --> 03:25:06.387]  High quality stuff at Weapons-Universe.com.
[03:25:06.387 --> 03:25:08.948]  Okay, enough of Conan the Barbarian.
[03:25:08.948 --> 03:25:11.689]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in California.
[03:25:11.689 --> 03:25:12.470]  Jason, you're on the air.
[03:25:13.522 --> 03:25:15.384]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:25:15.384 --> 03:25:19.608]  I have a Second Amendment call to action for the citizens of the state of California.
[03:25:19.608 --> 03:25:27.696]  Right now it is illegal to open and carry a firearm in the state of California, and there's been a movement recently where people have been exercising this right.
[03:25:27.696 --> 03:25:29.938]  And you know why they want to pass a law now?
[03:25:29.938 --> 03:25:37.766]  Because they were making everybody think guns were illegal with TV ads and PSAs, but now everybody's open carrying and people are going, what, it's not illegal to own a gun?
[03:25:38.925 --> 03:25:44.829]  Yeah, Assembly Member Solanda is sponsoring this bill actually in response to this movement.
[03:25:44.829 --> 03:25:47.291]  It's Assembly Bill 1934.
[03:25:47.291 --> 03:25:55.236]  And again, why would the illegal aliens supporting politicians and the illegal aliens, why would they want to take the guns?
[03:25:55.236 --> 03:25:56.577]  They can't own guns in Mexico.
[03:25:56.577 --> 03:25:59.839]  Why is it always the pro-illegal alien groups that want our guns?
[03:25:59.839 --> 03:26:03.181]  That's the number one reason I say shut it down and deport the illegals.
[03:26:03.181 --> 03:26:04.202]  You're not getting my guns.
[03:26:04.202 --> 03:26:05.663]  Go ahead.
[03:26:05.663 --> 03:26:08.765]  Yeah, I'm a little off topic from the illegal issue, but
[03:26:09.224 --> 03:26:17.111]  I basically want to call on all the listeners in California to respectfully contact their assembly members and implore them to oppose this bill, Assembly Bill 1934.
[03:26:17.111 --> 03:26:25.979]  If you need more information on this bill or open carrying in California, go to www.californiaopencarry.org.
[03:26:26.909 --> 03:26:31.010]  And if possible, I was wondering if we can get the judges' take on this type of legislation.
[03:26:31.010 --> 03:26:31.990]  Sure, absolutely.
[03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:34.171]  I appreciate your call.
[03:26:34.171 --> 03:26:38.332]  Yeah, they're moving at the state level everywhere to get our guns, and it's despicable.
[03:26:38.332 --> 03:26:43.874]  And if they get a big enough illegal alien population voting, they'll get our guns, and they'll arm them as the police to take our guns.
[03:26:43.874 --> 03:26:44.954]  That's the game plan.
[03:26:44.954 --> 03:26:46.394]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[03:26:46.394 --> 03:26:46.815]  Go ahead.
[03:26:46.815 --> 03:26:48.955]  Hey, Alex.
[03:26:48.955 --> 03:26:50.075]  Hey, buddy.
[03:26:50.075 --> 03:26:51.516]  Hey, what's up, man?
[03:26:51.516 --> 03:26:51.856]  Listen.
[03:26:52.953 --> 03:27:00.378]  You know, I never got a chance to really illiterate on some of the stuff that we had talked about, and I've talked to you a few times.
[03:27:00.378 --> 03:27:04.502]  First off, I'd like to thank you for Invisible Empire and Police State 4.
[03:27:04.502 --> 03:27:06.383]  I've watched both of them.
[03:27:06.383 --> 03:27:08.025]  Very informative.
[03:27:08.025 --> 03:27:10.006]  Very well presented.
[03:27:10.006 --> 03:27:21.996]  And I wanted to tell you about, when we were talking about the Michigan Militia, you talked to me a few weeks ago, I wanted to tell you about some woman named Anna.
[03:27:22.574 --> 03:27:46.376]  Who had been emailing somebody from the other Michigan militia to, she was climbing down a creek with her 12-year-old son to escape the FBI because they were kicking down doors and taking people's children on the basis of that they were speaking anti-government language.
[03:27:47.233 --> 03:27:48.013]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:27:48.013 --> 03:27:49.734]  That happened in Williamson County.
[03:27:49.734 --> 03:27:58.915]  They came and took Barry Cooper's son and they put on the CPS form because they were teaching their children that you can't trust the government.
[03:27:58.915 --> 03:28:00.236]  I appreciate your call.
[03:28:00.236 --> 03:28:06.357]  On the question of the Hattari, that's a whole other subject, but it's now come out what I said before the raid and what I said after.
[03:28:06.357 --> 03:28:08.917]  They had an FBI agent and an informant in there.
[03:28:08.917 --> 03:28:10.298]  They provocateured.
[03:28:10.298 --> 03:28:11.598]  They basically made it all up.
[03:28:12.458 --> 03:28:19.604]  And now it's been confirmed that different Michigan militia groups are the ones that call the FBI on Hattari.
[03:28:19.604 --> 03:28:22.226]  And that's because those groups are full of feds.
[03:28:22.226 --> 03:28:24.128]  That isn't criticizing the militia.
[03:28:24.128 --> 03:28:25.909]  It's not criticizing the Michigan militia.
[03:28:27.779 --> 03:28:34.521]  Feds and Fed-controlled dupes in those militias attack me when I picked out Hattari in August of last year.
[03:28:34.521 --> 03:28:38.643]  We're talking ten months ago or nine months ago.
[03:28:38.643 --> 03:28:42.804]  Months before this happened and I said, that Hattari looks like they're being set up.
[03:28:42.804 --> 03:28:49.327]  And I interviewed Pale Horse or aka Sickles and I warned him that he was being set up if he wasn't a Fed.
[03:28:49.327 --> 03:28:52.428]  And so, you know, we've covered that.
[03:28:52.428 --> 03:28:54.669]  We've gone over it and I've warned militias.
[03:28:55.689 --> 03:29:05.699]  Anybody that starts calling for violence in your ranks, 95% of the time they're fed and you better rebuke them and expose them immediately or they are going to set you up.
[03:29:05.699 --> 03:29:10.744]  And then you notice the groups that rebuild a straw man and say, I'm criticizing the militia.
[03:29:11.621 --> 03:29:12.442]  That's not what I've done.
[03:29:31.380 --> 03:29:34.822]  And we'll also try to jam a few phone calls in with him as well.
[03:29:34.822 --> 03:29:40.304]  On the other side of this break, and talking about the films, we released two films the last three weeks.
[03:29:40.304 --> 03:29:46.687]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, both available on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:46.687 --> 03:29:49.949]  They're informative films, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[03:29:49.949 --> 03:29:51.930]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:51.930 --> 03:29:53.310]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.310 --> 03:29:55.852]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.852 --> 03:29:58.533]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.100 --> 03:30:07.061]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:07.061 --> 03:30:15.924]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:30:15.924 --> 03:30:20.545]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:30:20.545 --> 03:30:31.369]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:30:31.989 --> 03:30:41.511]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:41.511 --> 03:30:46.933]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:30:46.933 --> 03:30:54.414]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:54.414 --> 03:30:57.175]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:31:05.203 --> 03:31:06.464]  Tyranny is here.
[03:31:06.464 --> 03:31:10.347]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:31:10.347 --> 03:31:12.628]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:31:12.628 --> 03:31:18.512]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:31:18.512 --> 03:31:24.757]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:31:25.157 --> 03:31:31.140]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:31:31.140 --> 03:31:35.321]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:31:35.321 --> 03:31:39.603]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:31:39.603 --> 03:31:45.545]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:31:45.545 --> 03:31:49.107]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:31:49.107 --> 03:31:51.088]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:31:51.088 --> 03:31:51.528]  It's here.

[03:32:54.249 --> 03:32:56.430]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:12.421 --> 03:33:12.622]  Yeah.
[03:33:17.992 --> 03:33:19.013]  We are back live.
[03:33:19.013 --> 03:33:24.036]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest for the rest of the hour, rest of the broadcast.
[03:33:24.036 --> 03:33:25.697]  I want to say congratulations.
[03:33:25.697 --> 03:33:31.561]  He's going to be starting in the next few months his show on the Fox Business TV Network.
[03:33:31.561 --> 03:33:35.664]  And that'll definitely get the highest ratings on that channel because he is a constitutionalist.
[03:33:35.664 --> 03:33:38.886]  And I agree with Judge Andrew Napolitano on almost every issue.
[03:33:38.886 --> 03:33:44.290]  In fact, I've never really found anything I disagree with him on, but it caused quite a stir this week.
[03:33:44.290 --> 03:33:45.771]  I'm sure most of you know about it.
[03:33:45.771 --> 03:33:47.212]  We played a clip of it at the start of the show.
[03:33:47.892 --> 03:33:48.112]  I don't
[03:34:06.378 --> 03:34:13.021]  My issue is I've seen the Gallup polls as high as 80% of Hispanic Americans want to control the borders because they know it's driving down wages.
[03:34:13.021 --> 03:34:23.264]  I mean there's a six plus billion people that want to come here and if we didn't have the big welfare system that would bankrupt us, then I would be for the type of totally open immigration we had a hundred years ago.
[03:34:23.264 --> 03:34:24.345]  But even a hundred years ago...
[03:34:25.385 --> 03:34:32.008]  Those numbers per capita are much smaller than they are now, but here to talk about this out of the gates is Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[03:34:32.008 --> 03:34:32.889]  Judge, good to have you here with us.
[03:34:32.889 --> 03:34:34.150]  Well, Alex, it's always a pleasure.
[03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:49.878]  Now you can say that there isn't anything that we disagree on, because that's the key, is the social benefit welfare system we have here, which draws good, hard-working people, but lazy people that want the government to take care of them, cradle to grave.
[03:34:49.878 --> 03:34:52.479]  In the break, we were talking about how my grandparents came here.
[03:34:52.879 --> 03:35:00.442]  I mean, they came here, they registered at Ellis Island, they got the vaccinations to make sure they didn't have any communicable diseases, and that was it.
[03:35:00.442 --> 03:35:13.547]  They didn't have to meet a quota, they went to school, they learned English, they became productive members of society, they didn't have to carry any ID, they became citizens as children when their parents became citizens.
[03:35:13.547 --> 03:35:17.568]  But that was before the dictatorship of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[03:35:18.103 --> 03:35:30.492]  Which, of course, changed the relationship of the federal government to individuals by taxing from A to give to B. I always like to tell this story.
[03:35:30.492 --> 03:35:31.692]  There's a knock on your door.
[03:35:31.692 --> 03:35:32.453]  You open the door.
[03:35:32.453 --> 03:35:33.834]  There's a guy with a gun.
[03:35:33.834 --> 03:35:35.975]  And the guy says, give me your money.
[03:35:35.975 --> 03:35:37.957]  I want to distribute it to other people.
[03:35:37.957 --> 03:35:39.358]  I want to be charitable in your name.
[03:35:40.114 --> 03:35:41.396]  You call the police.
[03:35:41.396 --> 03:35:43.178]  You find out he is the police.
[03:35:43.178 --> 03:35:45.801]  I mean, that's basically what the government does.
[03:35:45.801 --> 03:35:47.743]  You can't be charitable with other people's money.
[03:35:47.743 --> 03:35:53.269]  You can only be charitable with your own, but it forces us to give money away to people that we would choose not to give it away.
[03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:55.672]  There's no authority for that in the Constitution.
[03:35:55.672 --> 03:35:58.335]  FDR cowed the Supreme Court.
[03:35:58.915 --> 03:36:09.061]  FDR used all kinds of political favors to get a Democratic Congress to start giving money away, and every president since then, even Ronald Reagan, added to that.
[03:36:09.061 --> 03:36:11.543]  The worst, of course, was LBJ.
[03:36:11.543 --> 03:36:18.026]  As a result, you could come here, legally or illegally, and be taken care of, cradle to grave, by the federal government!
[03:36:18.026 --> 03:36:19.447]  That's what draws people here.
[03:36:19.447 --> 03:36:20.648]  Now, back to what you talked about.
[03:36:21.405 --> 03:36:27.468]  Yes, I was on with Neil Cavuto talking about whether or not Governor Blagojevich can subpoena the President.
[03:36:27.468 --> 03:36:29.188]  Answer, yes, and I hope he does.
[03:36:29.188 --> 03:36:40.713]  I would love to see the President under oath in a federal courtroom in Chicago explaining how the corrupt system of Democratic politics, probably Republican politics as well, but here it's Democratic, under scrutiny works.
[03:36:40.713 --> 03:36:43.935]  As sort of a throwaway question, meaning we had about 40 seconds left,
[03:36:44.475 --> 03:36:51.085]  Neal says to me, by the way Judge, Governor Brewer just signed this piece of legislation in Arizona, what do you think about it?
[03:36:51.085 --> 03:36:54.670]  And of course I said, you know, I believe in state sovereignty.
[03:36:54.670 --> 03:36:58.816]  I believe in state sovereignty so much that I think that the states can take back
[03:36:59.514 --> 03:37:06.143]  The agreement they made with the federal government that they can nullify what the federal government does, that they can secede from the union.
[03:37:06.143 --> 03:37:14.374]  However, the one legitimate power that the feds do have is the power to regulate foreign affairs and to regulate foreign people.
[03:37:14.374 --> 03:37:16.217]  The state of Arizona doesn't have any power there.
[03:37:16.457 --> 03:37:25.884]  Moreover, the state of Arizona does not have the power to say to its cops, you can stop people on the basis of the way they look and ask them to prove a negative on the spot.
[03:37:25.884 --> 03:37:28.225]  The negative is that they're not here illegally.
[03:37:28.225 --> 03:37:36.691]  We fought a cold war against countries in Eastern Europe that thought they had the power to stop people on the basis of the way they looked and demand to see their papers.
[03:37:36.691 --> 03:37:42.735]  If this law is enforced, a federal judge might say, you know what, Alex, it's unfair
[03:37:43.656 --> 03:37:47.321]  To only make the immigrants carry ID cards.
[03:37:47.321 --> 03:37:51.867]  So the only way to do this, here's the slippery slope, is for everybody to carry ID cards.
[03:37:51.867 --> 03:37:52.929]  You think I'm making this up?
[03:37:52.929 --> 03:37:54.952]  But Judge, let me interject.
[03:37:54.952 --> 03:37:56.414]  But that's not the slippery slope.
[03:37:56.414 --> 03:37:58.416]  That's indeed what's happening, as you know.
[03:37:58.416 --> 03:37:59.137]  Exactly, Charlie.
[03:37:59.938 --> 03:38:08.043]  Obama and Bush's amnesty plan makes everybody have a worker ID card and basically just legalizes all the illegals.
[03:38:08.043 --> 03:38:10.624]  So I go back to the previous point.
[03:38:10.624 --> 03:38:22.291]  If people come across the border an hour before their water breaks, everything's paid for, the kid becomes a citizen, the parents are there, I've got to pay for it in a democracy, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:38:22.611 --> 03:38:29.097]  This is a giant voting bloc that generally votes to take my guns, take my private property, and make me their slave.
[03:38:29.097 --> 03:38:32.299]  They're being used as a client of the big federal government.
[03:38:32.299 --> 03:38:33.160]  Exactly.
[03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:33.601]  Exactly.
[03:38:33.601 --> 03:38:35.682]  I agree with everything you... So what do we do then?
[03:38:35.682 --> 03:38:39.866]  What do we do when the feds won't carry out one of their only legitimate powers?
[03:38:39.866 --> 03:38:46.552]  Doesn't it fall back to the 9th and 10th Amendment that the states are... I mean, I guess the legitimate way would be then for Arizona to secede.
[03:38:47.591 --> 03:38:52.073]  Yes, that would be the constitutional way for Arizona to do it.
[03:38:52.073 --> 03:38:57.495]  The better way would be to elect a federal government willing to enforce federal law.
[03:38:57.495 --> 03:38:59.295]  And here's the conundrum, Alex.
[03:38:59.295 --> 03:39:07.138]  From Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, from a conservative Republican to a liberal Democrat, everything in between, the two Bushes, Clinton and Carter.
[03:39:07.818 --> 03:39:15.962]  No American president since Richard Nixon has been willing to enforce the immigration laws.
[03:39:15.962 --> 03:39:16.762]  I'll repeat it.
[03:39:16.762 --> 03:39:21.424]  No American president since Richard Nixon has been willing to enforce the immigration laws.
[03:39:21.424 --> 03:39:31.808]  And every American president since Richard Nixon has added to the social safety net for people who can't work, or don't want to work, or want to be taken care of by the government.
[03:39:31.808 --> 03:39:33.289]  Yeah, your grandparents didn't get any welfare.
[03:39:33.289 --> 03:39:34.930]  They broke their back to build the country.
[03:39:35.490 --> 03:39:36.291]  Correct.
[03:39:36.291 --> 03:39:36.772]  Correct.
[03:39:36.772 --> 03:39:40.417]  The welfare started with FDR and every president has made it worse.
[03:39:40.417 --> 03:39:45.544]  So this is not a problem that can be resolved by interfering with constitutional liberty.
[03:39:45.544 --> 03:39:52.894]  I love the idea of hard-working people coming here and experiencing and enjoying the American dream.
[03:39:53.454 --> 03:39:58.437]  But I do not love interfering with their constitutional liberties and mine.
[03:39:58.437 --> 03:40:14.085]  Because if they can stop somebody on the basis of the way they look, which the Constitution prohibits, in order to find out if they're here legally, then they could stop somebody on the basis of the way they look to find out if they ate too much salt, or ate too much sugar, or whatever else the government wants to regulate.
[03:40:14.767 --> 03:40:26.257]  Sure, and we know these checkpoints 50, 75 miles in all over the country, even in places like Vermont and Maine, they are using it to harass citizens and they let the illegals go right through.
[03:40:26.257 --> 03:40:31.382]  So we know that all these things you're warning about are actually already manifesting themselves.
[03:40:31.382 --> 03:40:34.645]  So here's the big question.
[03:40:34.645 --> 03:40:39.589]  Looking at the legislation, the way I see it, it's as if they have suspicion, probable cause.
[03:40:39.589 --> 03:40:41.370]  You see 10 guys at a day labor site.
[03:40:42.191 --> 03:40:42.451]  I don't
[03:41:02.785 --> 03:41:08.287]  As a constitutional law scholar, and you're saying you believe it's unconstitutional, then what should they have crafted?
[03:41:08.287 --> 03:41:15.590]  Because Texas is about to get on board, according to NBC, and other states are flocking to do this.
[03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:27.135]  They should curtail the social benefits that they provide, but in fairness to Arizona, this is all part of the big problem that you and I talk about all the time, which is the micromanagement of all government by the federal government.
[03:41:27.663 --> 03:41:32.165]  Much of what Arizona spends on social welfare is mandated by the federal government.
[03:41:32.165 --> 03:41:33.985]  They have no choice but to do it.
[03:41:33.985 --> 03:41:49.771]  The only way not to do it would be to nullify the federal law, or to secede from the union, or to persuade the electorate to elect people to Congress that will get rid of the social welfare state that actually started with Abraham Lincoln, but in a direct way
[03:41:50.451 --> 03:41:51.611]  Uh, with Franklin Roosevelt.
[03:41:51.611 --> 03:41:54.192]  Now that's not going to happen overnight, but I've got to say two things.
[03:41:54.192 --> 03:42:01.454]  One, I did not know about the internal checkpoints 50 miles in until you told me about that.
[03:42:01.454 --> 03:42:03.915]  And it is my job to know these things.
[03:42:03.915 --> 03:42:06.256]  So I am deeply grateful to you for that.
[03:42:06.912 --> 03:42:14.994]  My great fear is that this immigration issue in Arizona will be used by people like Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham.
[03:42:14.994 --> 03:42:16.434]  And I'm not just picking them out of the blue.
[03:42:16.434 --> 03:42:23.816]  They've proposed the legislation which basically says, you know, all these immigrants, legal and illegal, they have to have an ID card.
[03:42:23.816 --> 03:42:27.377]  But since the federal courts won't let us discriminate between Americans,
[03:42:27.817 --> 03:42:30.659]  And immigrants, we're gonna make everybody have an ID card.
[03:42:30.659 --> 03:42:33.461]  So you can't do anything without showing that ID card.
[03:42:33.461 --> 03:42:37.164]  Then East Germany is here, and maybe even the antebellum South.
[03:42:37.164 --> 03:42:38.304]  Why do I say that?
[03:42:38.304 --> 03:42:41.907]  Because this Arizona law lets you stop people on the basis of the way they look.
[03:42:41.907 --> 03:42:43.548]  Now you know what I look like, Alex.
[03:42:43.548 --> 03:42:49.052]  If I don't shave for two days, and I fall asleep in the sun, and I wake up in Phoenix, they're gonna stop me.
[03:42:52.458 --> 03:42:53.839]  And that's not going to be fun.
[03:42:53.839 --> 03:42:55.179]  That's going to create a lot of angry people.
[03:42:55.179 --> 03:42:55.820]  No, it's not going to be fun.
[03:42:55.820 --> 03:42:58.861]  I'm making fun of myself and my own looks.
[03:42:58.861 --> 03:43:13.389]  We live in a society where the government can't do that, where the government can't demand your papers, where the police can't stop you unless they have objective evidence of crime called probable cause or a search warrant signed by a judge to whom they presented probable cause of arrest.
[03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:14.510]  Let me tell you a story.
[03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:17.932]  Driving around in his Monte Carlo, he's been dead for years,
[03:43:18.692 --> 03:43:23.195]  My grandfather was out in the Texas Hill Country, 200 plus miles from the border.
[03:43:23.195 --> 03:43:25.457]  He was pulled over by the Border Patrol.
[03:43:25.457 --> 03:43:30.961]  And I'm going to print the article and give you the name of it right now, but it's up on screen.
[03:43:30.961 --> 03:43:38.166]  But yes, sir, there is a 100-mile, but they normally only go in 75, buffer zone around the entire country.
[03:43:38.166 --> 03:43:42.469]  It's an internal border, 100 miles in.
[03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:47.192]  And it's basically a Constitution-free zone, is what the ACLU calls it.
[03:43:47.692 --> 03:43:54.320]  I agree with the ACLU, and from the reports of it that I have learned about, because of your exposure of it, you are correct.
[03:43:54.320 --> 03:44:02.891]  It is patently unconstitutional, it may not exist, and I'm waiting for a federal judge to comply with his or her oath to uphold the Constitution and invalidate it.
[03:44:03.331 --> 03:44:05.635]  Have you seen the video of the Pastor Anderson?
[03:44:05.635 --> 03:44:06.816]  No.
[03:44:06.816 --> 03:44:13.987]  Who owns a construction company and he has to drive through these every day and he said stop searching my car so they beat him within an inch of his life?
[03:44:13.987 --> 03:44:15.288]  I did not know that.
[03:44:15.288 --> 03:44:16.991]  Did he bring an action against them?
[03:44:16.991 --> 03:44:18.193]  Did he get their videotapes?
[03:44:18.553 --> 03:44:20.034]  We need to get him back on about that.
[03:44:20.034 --> 03:44:25.820]  You know, we cover this stuff and then, you know, it's in the rearview mirror and we never look at it again.
[03:44:25.820 --> 03:44:30.164]  I want to shift gears into some other issues here in a moment with the limited time we have with Andrew Napolitano.
[03:44:30.164 --> 03:44:32.166]  His new book is out, doing quite well.
[03:44:32.166 --> 03:44:36.229]  Why, as the government told you, Myth, Power, and the Deception in American History.
[03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:39.693]  Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, forwarded by Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:44:41.434 --> 03:44:44.855]  Just in closing, the states are going to move to protect themselves.
[03:44:44.855 --> 03:44:51.617]  They are going bankrupt predominantly because of the illegals and the way they draw on the welfare.
[03:44:51.617 --> 03:44:53.177]  We have sanctuary cities.
[03:44:53.177 --> 03:44:59.739]  We have Austin cops that have told me they won't arrest illegals for drunk driving because they just get released and they're basically told not to do it.
[03:44:59.739 --> 03:45:06.181]  My issue is the illegals now have more rights than citizens in these sanctuary cities.
[03:45:06.181 --> 03:45:06.401]  Wow.
[03:45:07.472 --> 03:45:10.198]  You know, it's the world turned upside down.
[03:45:10.198 --> 03:45:11.781]  You and I talked about the census.
[03:45:11.781 --> 03:45:12.964]  Again, I'll give you an example.
[03:45:12.964 --> 03:45:15.449]  Knock on the door, it's a census taker and an FBI agent.
[03:45:15.831 --> 03:45:17.632]  The FBI agent is there to arrest you.
[03:45:17.632 --> 03:45:19.874]  The census taker is there to ask you questions.
[03:45:19.874 --> 03:45:22.956]  The census taker says, how many people live here and how many toilets do you have?
[03:45:22.956 --> 03:45:26.718]  The FBI agent says, you have a right to remain silent.
[03:45:26.718 --> 03:45:34.163]  So you have more rights as a person being arrested than you do as a person being visited by a bureaucrat from the census taker.
[03:45:34.163 --> 03:45:45.711]  The federal government has succeeded in turning the world upside down in terms of where freedom should be, in terms of where rights should be, and in terms of who can do what with their property.
[03:45:46.452 --> 03:45:47.353]  How do we stop this?
[03:45:47.353 --> 03:45:49.415]  We stop this by the things that you and I do.
[03:45:49.415 --> 03:45:51.778]  Exposing what the government does.
[03:45:51.778 --> 03:45:53.680]  The camera is the new gun.
[03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:55.842]  Filming what the government does.
[03:45:55.842 --> 03:46:01.288]  Filming the negotiations away of our liberty and our property.
[03:46:01.288 --> 03:46:06.714]  So that everybody can see how those who work for us have betrayed us and the Constitution they've sworn to uphold.
[03:46:06.874 --> 03:46:20.286]  Judge, how about starting with getting our counties and cities back and making our police chiefs have equal enforcement of the law when they catch illegals without insurance, without driver's license, they arrest a citizen, they let the illegals go.
[03:46:20.286 --> 03:46:26.312]  When they catch an illegal drunk driving, we're just going to have to keep them in jail as long as we keep an American citizen in jail.
[03:46:26.312 --> 03:46:31.577]  But Americans are seen as the big fat milk gals, regardless of what color we are, to this system.
[03:46:33.598 --> 03:46:41.506]  Well, I don't know of these cases of which you speak, Alex, in which Americans have been punished for longer than illegals.
[03:46:41.506 --> 03:46:49.214]  Are you telling me that the states have been forced to let illegals go who should be incarcerated because only the feds can incarcerate them?
[03:46:49.214 --> 03:46:50.075]  That's ridiculous.
[03:46:50.075 --> 03:46:54.720]  If an illegal breaks a state law, that illegal can be prosecuted.
[03:46:55.240 --> 03:47:03.049]  And if found guilty, fairly, in a court of law, because the Constitution protects persons, the illegal has the same due process rights as the rest of us.
[03:47:03.049 --> 03:47:10.758]  And when they get out of prison, you can pull this up in the Houston Chronicle, in fact, pull up, I believe that the headline was, 200,000 felons released
[03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:20.153]  200,000 illegal alien felons released in Texas, and I think that was 2004.
[03:47:20.153 --> 03:47:21.854]  I remember that headline.
[03:47:21.854 --> 03:47:23.375]  Here it is, ACLU.
[03:47:23.375 --> 03:47:25.036]  Two-thirds of U.S.
[03:47:25.036 --> 03:47:34.323]  population lives in Constitution-free zone, and then it goes over the map of the 100-mile border zone, and you can pull that up.
[03:47:34.323 --> 03:47:43.931]  But certainly this is a constitutional crisis that we're going into, because I understand you're a pure libertarian, a pure constitutionalist, and I respect that.
[03:47:44.691 --> 03:47:54.374]  And I understand the issues you're raising here and they're all valid, but what do you do when the federal government's been seized by offshore banks and is at war against the Constitution?
[03:47:54.374 --> 03:48:02.337]  What do you do when the illegals are coming in and being forged into a political weapon of the collectivist?
[03:48:02.337 --> 03:48:05.278]  The states formed the federal government and not the other way around.
[03:48:05.278 --> 03:48:06.478]  Reagan reminded us of that.
[03:48:06.963 --> 03:48:19.168]  In the second paragraph of his first inaugural address, the states gave limited, specific, precise, delegated, discrete powers, only 16 of them, to the federal government in the Constitution.
[03:48:19.844 --> 03:48:27.170]  Now, when I say this to gatherings all over the country, I say the following, and nothing gets a bigger applause than this.
[03:48:27.170 --> 03:48:31.513]  Power given by the states can be taken back.
[03:48:31.513 --> 03:48:33.095]  That's what you do.
[03:48:33.095 --> 03:48:45.185]  And when the Chuck Schumers and Lindsey Grahams of this world realize that their empire is shrinking, they will either comport themselves as those who love freedom, or they will have no empire over which to reign.
[03:48:45.976 --> 03:48:49.399]  And that brings me to our next issue, but I did want to give you the federal statute.
[03:48:49.399 --> 03:49:01.809]  Federal Statute HCFR 287.1A1-3 defines the border zone for enforcement purposes as encompassing an area within 100 miles of the actual border.
[03:49:01.809 --> 03:49:07.394]  And they're now all over the country building hardened checkpoints in the last two years where they search everyone.
[03:49:07.394 --> 03:49:13.359]  There's literally hundreds of YouTube videos of this, and you're an important and influential guy, so I'm glad that you're on the case.
[03:49:13.639 --> 03:49:17.222]  Ask me if I know how members of Congress voted on that statute.
[03:49:17.222 --> 03:49:18.222]  I know the answer.
[03:49:18.222 --> 03:49:19.183]  I don't know.
[03:49:19.183 --> 03:49:20.044]  How did they vote?
[03:49:20.044 --> 03:49:21.064]  Nobody voted.
[03:49:21.064 --> 03:49:21.965]  It's CFR.
[03:49:21.965 --> 03:49:24.047]  It's the Code of Federal Regulations.
[03:49:24.047 --> 03:49:24.967]  It's not the U.S.
[03:49:24.967 --> 03:49:25.348]  Code.
[03:49:25.348 --> 03:49:31.232]  That means Congress authorized a group of bureaucrats to promulgate these rules.
[03:49:31.232 --> 03:49:34.214]  Congress never even voted on the rules themselves.
[03:49:34.741 --> 03:49:39.403]  The Code of Federal Regulations is ten times as long as the U.S.
[03:49:39.403 --> 03:49:39.623]  Code.
[03:49:39.623 --> 03:49:40.004]  The U.S.
[03:49:40.004 --> 03:49:41.924]  Code are the statutes Congress votes on.
[03:49:41.924 --> 03:49:48.528]  For whatever political, or moral, or immoral, or legitimate, or illegitimate reasons, it's what Congress debates on and votes on.
[03:49:48.528 --> 03:49:49.928]  The health care law is in the U.S.
[03:49:49.928 --> 03:49:50.649]  Code.
[03:49:50.649 --> 03:49:52.810]  The CFR is the insidious one.
[03:49:52.810 --> 03:49:55.091]  That's the one that the bureaucrats have created.
[03:49:55.811 --> 03:49:59.274]  Yeah, it's their own little code that they can just add whatever they want to.
[03:49:59.274 --> 03:50:02.397]  We're about to go to break, but I want to start getting into this now.
[03:50:02.397 --> 03:50:07.802]  Bill Clinton came out and said, gee, I hope there doesn't have to be another Oklahoma City bombing for UT parties to shut up.
[03:50:07.802 --> 03:50:09.864]  The mantra is, we're going to cause violence.
[03:50:11.545 --> 03:50:29.610]  When there's no evidence of that, I'm really concerned about them creating a provocation or hyping something, because clearly, the things they've done politically are political suicide, and now they're demonizing you and Ron Paul, calling you both harbingers and enablers of extremism and violence.
[03:50:30.430 --> 03:50:43.419]  I am a harbinger and enabler of individual freedom, of the primacy of the individual over the government, the indispensability of the free market to human prosperity, and of our natural rights, which most governments don't give a hoot about.
[03:50:43.419 --> 03:50:48.463]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest for a final segment straight ahead after this quick break.
[03:50:48.463 --> 03:50:49.004]  His new book,
[03:50:49.824 --> 03:50:54.408]  Lies the Government Told You About is available at Better Bookstores Everywhere and Amazon.com.
[03:50:54.408 --> 03:50:59.512]  My two new films are available at Infowars.com and Amazon.com.
[03:50:59.512 --> 03:51:00.093]  We'll be right back.

[03:52:11.656 --> 03:52:13.958]  It really says that the state is God.

[03:53:01.710 --> 03:53:03.030]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:08.612]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:53:08.612 --> 03:53:13.633]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:53:13.633 --> 03:53:19.195]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:53:19.195 --> 03:53:24.416]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:53:24.416 --> 03:53:26.297]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:53:26.744 --> 03:53:31.528]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:53:31.528 --> 03:53:32.649]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:32.649 --> 03:53:35.731]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:53:35.731 --> 03:53:39.354]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:53:39.354 --> 03:53:42.536]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:42.536 --> 03:53:44.758]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:44.758 --> 03:53:45.639]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:53:45.639 --> 03:53:45.879]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:53:54.468 --> 03:53:58.391]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:53:58.391 --> 03:54:00.773]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:54:07.253 --> 03:54:08.174]  We are back live.
[03:54:08.174 --> 03:54:10.256]  Final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:10.256 --> 03:54:17.321]  Retransmission starts in T-minus six minutes at Infowars.com and the audio streams on AM and FM's everywhere.
[03:54:17.321 --> 03:54:24.487]  Judge Napolitano, we're seeing massive demonization from MSNBC, CNN, Southern Poverty Law Center, all these groups.
[03:54:24.487 --> 03:54:27.229]  Now they're even saying Ron Paul's bad, you're bad.
[03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:33.334]  They're claiming that we're going to stir up violence with our First Amendment right, criticizing corrupt government.
[03:54:33.334 --> 03:54:34.455]  I mean, this is pretty dangerous.
[03:54:34.875 --> 03:54:40.500]  It's dangerous if they think that they can interfere with our freedom of speech.
[03:54:40.500 --> 03:54:53.230]  It's dangerous for Bill Clinton to say that those who question the government, that those who think taxes are too high, that those who think that life begins at the moment of conception, and that the right to keep and bear arms is a natural right, are dangerous people.
[03:54:53.230 --> 03:54:59.996]  We are traditional Americans who are defending our freedom and will not be silenced by those who are attempting to do so.
[03:55:01.906 --> 03:55:03.346]  But I think it's backfiring on them.
[03:55:03.346 --> 03:55:07.087]  I mean, people are really seeing through this race card.
[03:55:07.087 --> 03:55:08.588]  You know, I've been to many Tea Parties.
[03:55:08.588 --> 03:55:09.108]  You know that?
[03:55:09.108 --> 03:55:15.629]  Many in the state of Texas, in Ohio, in Arizona, in Florida.
[03:55:15.629 --> 03:55:25.852]  I've not detected a hint of racism, of homophobia, of any of the nonsense that these people that dislike the Tea Partiers claim is there.
[03:55:25.852 --> 03:55:27.612]  What they dislike is the fact
[03:55:28.072 --> 03:55:46.724]  That the great middle class has finally been awakened, and has finally agreed to read the Constitution, and has finally recognized that we have a government that doesn't respect the Constitution, doesn't honor it, doesn't read it, doesn't even know what it means, thinks it can write any law, regulate any event, tax any behavior, whether it's in the Constitution or not.
[03:55:46.724 --> 03:55:47.445]  And let me tell you,
[03:55:47.705 --> 03:55:49.046]  Is that why Lindsey Graham
[03:56:07.925 --> 03:56:12.227]  Is now caving in on open borders and caving in on carbon taxes?
[03:56:12.227 --> 03:56:14.467]  And caving in on ID cards?
[03:56:14.467 --> 03:56:15.047]  Absolutely!
[03:56:15.047 --> 03:56:16.488]  Because he's part of the establishment.
[03:56:16.488 --> 03:56:20.889]  He's not a lover of freedom like you and me and most of the people listening to us.
[03:56:20.889 --> 03:56:28.112]  He's more interested in his own power than he is in the constitutional liberties and natural rights of those he represents.
[03:56:29.261 --> 03:56:30.942]  We've only got a couple minutes left here.
[03:56:30.942 --> 03:56:34.185]  I wanted to bring up the Goldman Sachs situation.
[03:56:34.185 --> 03:56:40.289]  I see them picking some of the smaller things that Goldman's done so they can then derail a real investigation.
[03:56:40.289 --> 03:56:42.130]  I see it as a big whitewash.
[03:56:42.130 --> 03:56:43.191]  Where do you stand on that?
[03:56:43.191 --> 03:56:44.052]  I agree with you.
[03:56:44.052 --> 03:56:48.035]  I think that Goldman will cave on this litigation brought by the SEC.
[03:56:48.888 --> 03:56:51.330]  Which is bogus and which is frivolous.
[03:56:51.330 --> 03:56:53.291]  I can tell you why if you want to go into that.
[03:56:53.291 --> 03:57:03.919]  I think that Goldman will cave on it in order to avoid more serious investigations like, how could the chairman of Goldman Sachs also have been the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve at the same time?
[03:57:03.919 --> 03:57:07.422]  That's the kind of stuff that they don't want investigated, so they'll cave on this one.
[03:57:07.622 --> 03:57:16.727]  Yesterday, when Lloyd Blankfein appeared before Carl Levin, he said, yes, I'm in favor of the financial regulation the President wants.
[03:57:16.727 --> 03:57:24.591]  Nobody on Wall Street in their right mind is in favor of it, unless you want to curry favor with the establishment, so that after they enact this legislation, they'll leave you alone.
[03:57:25.404 --> 03:57:27.806]  Well, that's the word from the Texas Banking Association.
[03:57:27.806 --> 03:57:32.971]  They say the mega-banks are going to be given new power to go and consolidate their competition.
[03:57:32.971 --> 03:57:39.156]  The worst part about this is that more power is going to the most insidious entity among us, the Federal Reserve.
[03:57:39.156 --> 03:57:49.446]  And if the administration thinks that they're going to be transparent, above board, fair, and respecting of freedom, they have disregarded the past 100 years of human history.
[03:57:50.051 --> 03:57:52.273]  What's the word on the financial takeover bill?
[03:57:52.273 --> 03:57:53.755]  Is it going to pass?
[03:57:53.755 --> 03:58:01.443]  You know, I talked to some Republicans today who told me that they expect the filibuster to succeed and that it won't pass as long as there's the too-big-to-fail in it.
[03:58:01.443 --> 03:58:06.828]  That is, as long as the government can force you to sell them your shares of stock against your will.
[03:58:06.828 --> 03:58:11.993]  That's pretty gutsy of Republicans, who I'm generally critical of, if they'll stick to that.
[03:58:12.899 --> 03:58:14.580]  All right, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[03:58:14.580 --> 03:58:17.423]  There's a new TV show on Fox Business coming up in the next few months.
[03:58:17.423 --> 03:58:18.383]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:58:18.383 --> 03:58:19.844]  We're always appreciative of the time.
[03:58:19.844 --> 03:58:20.905]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:20.905 --> 03:58:21.566]  God bless you.
[03:58:21.566 --> 03:58:22.907]  God bless you.
[03:58:22.907 --> 03:58:24.528]  And we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:24.528 --> 03:58:30.352]  At the end of the show, I'm going to tell you again, the truth is what can counter the new world order.
[03:58:30.352 --> 03:58:33.094]  We got two new films that have come out in the last three weeks.
[03:58:33.094 --> 03:58:36.877]  Get them both at Infowars.com, Police State 4 and Invisible Empire.
[03:58:36.877 --> 03:58:37.778]  God bless you all.
[03:58:37.778 --> 03:58:39.759]  Retransmission starts now, Infowars.com.
[03:58:39.759 --> 03:58:40.300]  Great job, crew.
