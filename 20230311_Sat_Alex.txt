[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]  There's a time to pray, and there's a time to stand, okay?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  So, it doesn't mean that you can't pray while you're standing, but there now is the time to stand.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  And that time, and when I say stand, I mean, I want people, and this is everybody,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  and there's a, you know, I'm trying to hit a target of people in this country that represent probably 50 million people
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  that are sort of left of center, and they look at everything and they go,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  I don't know, this is politics as usual. This is not politics as usual.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  This is the existence of America as we know it is at risk. We are in a moment of peril.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  It's Saturday, March 11, 2023. General Flynn's going live with us, and bank runs have begun worldwide.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  Stay with us. This is an important transmission.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  Let's take a look today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  Bank runs have begun in the Middle East, in Asia, in Europe, and the United States, in New York, in D.C.,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  in Silicon Valley, in the Bay Area, and many other areas.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  I called several bankers that I know that are presidents and vice presidents of large banks,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  and they said undoubtedly this is going to cause a domino effect. Will it be as big as Lehman Brothers in 2008?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  We don't know. It could be bigger, but when we talk about tomorrow's news today,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  I'm going to have the archivist, I'm going to call him after this live show today.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  We're live 12 noon in one minute, nine seconds, and I'm going to tell the archivist,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  go back to the last six months and just grab four or five, because I know I said it about a hundred times,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  times that I said next they'll start collapsing regional and lending banks to consolidate them into the big six globalist banks
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  that own the private and federal reserve and the European Union bank and the rest of it,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  and then out of that they will call for central bank digital currencies to be rolled out.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  Just on Wednesday, Biden, the third administration of Obama, put out his big new national directive.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  In fact, I forgot to re-pull that from Wednesday stack, the big quote new cybersecurity initiative,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  and you read it, it's really to roll out a central bank digital currency that tracks and controls everything you do.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  Then they'll try to ban all the normal cryptocurrencies that are actually independent and decentralized power.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  That's all announced in there, and I said on Wednesday, look for them to crash the regional banks
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  to bring in total control. We know the enemy's playbook.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  I said, will it be a banking collapse and the central bank digital currency casual society rollout?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  Will it be a cyber attack to bring that in? Will it be both?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Will it be a massive new terror attack, an escalation of the war?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  These are all cards, because I've been looking over the enemy's shoulder, what they got in their hand.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  I don't know exactly how they're going to play the cards.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  I don't know when they're going to play the cards, but I know what cards they got, and that's a lot.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  General Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former top national security advisor to President Trump, and a true patriot,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  will be joining us here in about 57 minutes from now.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  We're going to cover the waterfront with the general commercial free for an hour straight once he gets on with us.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  So we're going to hit the bank runs and what that means.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  We're going to hit the latest huge developments with Russia, China and Iran.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  We're going to hit the huge weaponization of the deep state censorship hearings they're having.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  We're going to hit the latest World Health Organization information with their global treaty that literally takes control of every major nation's health care.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.000]  We are going to look at the gigantic developments that have come out, the dam breaking on January 6 with Elon Musk demanding Q Shaman be released from prison.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  And I can tell you, I'm in contact with the Q Shaman's lawyer and his family,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  and you should look for them to be on the show Monday or Tuesday at the latest, maybe even tomorrow night.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  But now the footage of him saying, get out of the Capitol, the police want us to leave.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  The footage of him being led in by the police into the Capitol and into the Senate chambers.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  That is all really educated people, thanks to Tucker Carlson and others.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  We've released a lot of other video that's been unseen on Thursday and Friday as well.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  That is just as bombshell.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  And we also broke the news that thousands of pages, 300 plus documents.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  The FBI thought they deleted out of a file that they gave to the defense, the Proud Boys, but they were able to restore the file.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]  It's not up to throw a file in the trash.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  Got to go in and then remove it out of the trash itself.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  It's like on your iPhone, you think you delete something.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  Those are the trash for a month, folks.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  Got to get out of the trash.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  And the real truth is, forensically, the FBI has tools where they get a phone or a device in almost every case.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  They can still restore it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  That's like with a HD video cameras going back 25 years.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  Sometimes we'd accidentally thought that we'd erased a stick that we hadn't got everything off of.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  And then we would go online and research the tricks.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  And if you hadn't turned the camera off.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  You can do things like stick the stick back in, pull it back out, and it would actually still be there and other little tricks.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  But that's what the FBI did, just like they did in Michigan.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  That is ultra massive and now hit mainstream news.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  We are truly tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  And I'm very thankful to all of you for keeping us on the air.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  So here's what I need.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  Listeners and viewers are the most hardcore, the most dedicated, the cared enough to tune in today at noon central time.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  When I told you I'm having a special transmission.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  If the hundreds of thousands of you because there's millions in the weekday shows.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  If the hundreds of thousands of you right now.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  Decide to take the live link from Mad Max World TV.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]  You just go there and it says live Alex Jones and click that link and share that link.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  That's the new link.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  They're not censoring currently.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  They probably will soon love another link.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  But right now it's Mad Max World TV and share it on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  Or just share Infowars.com forward slash show or Infowars.com.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]  It's around the front page on your email, on your text message, on your human intelligence word of mouth.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  And tell folks massively important news is taking place right now.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  There it is.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  Saturday emergency broadcast banking collapse has begun.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  Next phase in New World Order takeover.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  But we know their plan.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  We've laid out their plan.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  We know how to beat their plan.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  And the learning curve is parabolic.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  Overhead shot please.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  If you look at the last 20 years, let's say 2002 to 2023.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  Back in 2002, Congress had almost no understanding of the Internet and tech and how it works.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  And there was almost no understanding in the last 20 years.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  They say just as ignorant until the last two or three years.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  And now the learning curve has gone straight up.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  So they've gone from having basically no understanding to very little understanding.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  To the last two years, absolutely turbocharged explosive awakening.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  There's more awakening happening right now in government and in other sectors of the economy outside big tech of this giant big tech coup.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  Through the deep state intelligence agencies and private corporations.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  In a month, people are learning more than they learned in a year previously.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  And they call that a quickening or a singularity is the modern parlance.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000]  I don't believe in one big singularity, but lots of cascading little singularities that together make a massive mosaic that you can call towards a singularity.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  But God is the ultimate singularity.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  We'll never reach that until we've merged fully with God's consciousness.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  But this is a big, big, big moment to be alive.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  The entire New World Order system is in deep trouble.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  And I said two weeks ago, a week ago and on Wednesday, the archivist I know is obsessed with the show.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  So am I obsessed with you. I love the crew.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  And so he'll he'll know where I said it when I said he'd go grab maybe he'll even get it today and put it on video while we're live.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  But I said they're going to do a cyber attack or they're going to do a bank run.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  In the next month, I mean, they've got to divert or I said maybe just a power outage and they'll claim it's a solar flare.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  But they got to do something to get off of the January six inside job coming out.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  The giant collusion of big tech and intelligence agencies, other corporations and dinosaur media with think tanks and NGOs.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  Surveilling, controlling, censoring, bullying, deplatforming, harassing.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  This is high tech Nazi Germany type stuff.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  What Hitler did to his domestic populations in the build to World War Two, but to the next level.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  And that was described as that in the hearings on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, that none of the big networks cover, but nobody watches them anymore.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  Basically, it was number one story all over the Web with hundreds and hundreds of millions of views in the United States alone.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  And the quotes by Michael Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi were this.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  The censorship industrial complex combines established methods of psychological manipulation,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  some developed by the U.S. military during the global war on terror with highly sophisticated tools for computer science, including artificial intelligence.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  The complex's leaders are driven by their fear of the Internet could and social media platforms empower populist,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  alternative fringe personalities and views which they regard destabilizing.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  While the globalists themselves are the ones destabilizing everything, and of course, I mentioned a lot of the big things going on.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  I didn't mention the biggest enchilada and why I said.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  Imminent new destabilization, imminent new false flag, imminent new crisis, bank runs, financial crisis, stock market plunging, cyber attack, maybe all together, false flags.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  And once he launches more missiles into Poland, blames it on the Russians or they blow up more pipelines, blame on the Russians, which they now admit the Russians didn't do it.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  But Biden on blame the Russians for the Nord Stream and the rest of them.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  But we all know who really shuts off the pipelines like Keystone on the rest of them.
[00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:46.332]  Because of Redfield, the head of the CDC under the last three years of hell, a lot of people
[00:10:46.332 --> 00:10:47.572]  said, well, why did he speak out then?
[00:10:47.572 --> 00:10:51.212]  He actually said two and a half years ago, no, I think it might've come out of a lab
[00:10:51.212 --> 00:10:53.492]  and I think there is gain of function being done.
[00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:58.652]  Well, he knew all the files and all the training and all the symposiums called in favor of
[00:10:58.652 --> 00:11:02.332]  gain of function and defense of gain of function led by Fauci and all the gain of function
[00:11:02.332 --> 00:11:07.572]  going on basically everywhere, developing new viruses, weaponizing new viruses, making
[00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:10.572]  them more communicable, making them more deadly.
[00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:12.932]  So he actually did plant breadcrumbs early on.
[00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:18.612]  I said, it looks like Redfield's the one that went down the ship, but Fauci and the outside
[00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:24.052]  UN group, they're actually quarterbacking with Bill Gates and the club of Rome 2.0, Bilderberg
[00:11:24.052 --> 00:11:26.892]  Spokesperson, Klaus Schwab, World Economic Forum.
[00:11:27.093 --> 00:11:33.012]  They were running the operation.
[00:11:33.012 --> 00:11:38.793]  And so Redfield, in multiple days of testimony, destroyed them and said, look, I'm not against
[00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:39.793]  our soldiers.
[00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:40.793]  They didn't do it.
[00:11:40.793 --> 00:11:42.533]  But the Pentagon's run by these people.
[00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:43.772]  It created the virus.
[00:11:43.772 --> 00:11:45.313]  It created the shot.
[00:11:45.313 --> 00:11:50.333]  It was getting orders from the big pharma complex, but it ran the operation.
[00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:53.533]  Moderna and Pfizer just took the orders.
[00:11:53.802 --> 00:12:00.122]  This is the worst gain of function in history, the most communicable thing, that is what
[00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:03.502]  it is, ever, and it's a toxic spike protein.
[00:12:03.502 --> 00:12:09.062]  And Fauci lied to Congress, and it is gain of function, and Fauci put out fake reports,
[00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:16.082]  and Fauci kept Redfield out, and so that is a gigantic individual leaving the sinking
[00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:17.082]  ship.
[00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:17.582]  Look at that.
[00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:26.150]  But it's gonna be people like Dr. Huff, who was the Vice President of the EcoHealth Alliance,
[00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.310]  that was the group running all this that's gone public in the last three years, to people
[00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.030]  like Redfield, Dr. Redfield, that are gonna change the tide.
[00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.189]  There's over 10,000 FBI whistleblowers right now, but they're suppressed from going public
[00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:41.189]  who don't like what's happening.
[00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:46.470]  So I'm not lionizing the FBI and saying there are hope, but the rank and file men and women,
[00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.830]  even senior ones, do not want to be complete criminals and destroy the country.
[00:12:51.830 --> 00:13:00.069]  And they can see, like the Hitler general staff, by 1942, 43, that hey, we work for
[00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:04.790]  the system, we were all for the Reich, we thought we were gonna win, but we're losing,
[00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.750]  we better sue for peace before we get totally destroyed.
[00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.310]  And we're reaching that point, and I'm not saying that Redfield's like that or Huff's
[00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.910]  like that, certainly Huff's a hero, what I'm saying is, is that now people like that
[00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.110]  in the system can see that they're not gonna get away with it, and that the globalists,
[00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.310]  as I said on Wednesday, over and over again, we're gonna find the clubs, and Thursday,
[00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:37.430]  are gonna pull out the stops now with gigantic crises to overturn the chessboard, to divert
[00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.030]  with a story and a crisis even bigger than what we're in, it's hard to think of something
[00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.670]  bigger, but they'll do it, massive escalations in war, cyber attacks they launch and blame
[00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.950]  on Russia or China, and I'm not saying China's not guilty, I'm just saying, we know the deep
[00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.150]  state globalists created the virus, they got caught in 2015 with Obama doing it, the military
[00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:01.230]  was upset about it as well, they moved it to Wuhan, Bill Gates and them developed it,
[00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:06.230]  they brought it back to the military in 2017, said let's release this virus in China, and
[00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.190]  the military said you're insane, that's illegal, so it's a bunch of different groups trying
[00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.790]  to frame each other and manipulate each other, but at the top it's the same basic managers,
[00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.450]  it's the mid-level folks that are corrupt, that are jockeying for power, but interspersed
[00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.490]  in all those levels is good people that were compartmentalized, that now can see what's
[00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:30.430]  going on and don't wanna be part of it, so we're in a very dangerous crossroads, inflection
[00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.829]  point.
[00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:40.649]  Call it what you will, ladies and gentlemen, but I can't wait to talk to General Flynn
[00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:43.088]  in about 45 minutes about this.
[00:14:43.088 --> 00:14:46.809]  So we're going to cover whether I'm on air two hours or five hours today.
[00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:49.348]  It's live, commercial free, but commercial free.
[00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:55.529]  We air documents and reports and interviews and I'll take a few breaks and maybe we should
[00:14:55.529 --> 00:15:00.509]  run a few ads here and there to fund ourselves, but very commercial light and I intend to
[00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:04.869]  not break when General Flynn is on with us for at least an hour, so that will be commercial
[00:15:04.869 --> 00:15:05.869]  free.
[00:15:05.869 --> 00:15:08.829]  So let me just get this out of the way.
[00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:11.629]  Infowars is barely paying the bills.
[00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:12.629]  We're more influential than ever.
[00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:14.389]  We're having a bigger effect than ever.
[00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:18.149]  We're almost becoming passe or obsolete or redundant because people are really getting
[00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:19.149]  how it works now.
[00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:20.149]  That's been my ultimate mission.
[00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:21.869]  So I say my primary mission has been complete.
[00:15:21.869 --> 00:15:26.629]  We've got so much more to do and God's laying new missions on me, but we have had a great
[00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:28.669]  success together, but I can't do it without you.
[00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:30.709]  Plus we have products you need.
[00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:32.309]  So what we need is action.
[00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:36.549]  We need people that take part in defending their immune systems, having better stamina,
[00:15:36.549 --> 00:15:43.789]  better libido, better quality of life with great top line products and fund the InfoWarp.
[00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:49.049]  And so we have great products like ultimate bone broth with all the chaga mushroom and
[00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:52.949]  bee pollen and turmeric and just so good for your joints, your bones, your brain, your
[00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:53.949]  immune system.
[00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:57.709]  You can't do better than the super concentrated chicken bone broth with all these other amazing
[00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:58.709]  ingredients.
[00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.309]  It's hands down the best bone broth formula out there.
[00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:05.069]  It's the same price as premium only chicken or beef concentrated bone broths and chicken
[00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:07.549]  is the best when it comes to bone broth and all the studies.
[00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:12.229]  Ours is the best hands down, same price as quality ones that are out there.
[00:16:12.229 --> 00:16:13.229]  You can buy crappy ones.
[00:16:13.229 --> 00:16:16.029]  They're still good for you, by the way, so whatever you can afford.
[00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:20.909]  We've also got our prebiotic, not probiotic, but a prebiotic that puts the enzymes and
[00:16:20.909 --> 00:16:26.829]  amino acids and compounds through concentrated blueberry is equivalent to like each scoops
[00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:30.269]  like a whole thing of blueberries, but with no calories.
[00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:37.868]  It's got all the vitamins and minerals and trace elements and the dried desiccated blueberries
[00:16:37.868 --> 00:16:41.549]  concentrated in it and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:44.509]  It's amazing back in stock, 40% off.
[00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:45.829]  And this is very popular.
[00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:50.709]  This is my dad's fourth toothpaste he's put out, retired dinosaurial surgeon.
[00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:51.709]  He's not really retired.
[00:16:51.709 --> 00:16:54.549]  He still has his license and still takes care of family, fixed a broken tooth amount a few
[00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:55.549]  weeks ago.
[00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:58.949]  When I retired, he came out with this turmeric toothpaste.
[00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:03.549]  It's really a vitamin mineral toothpaste, tea tree oil, a bunch of other essential oils,
[00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:06.188]  a bunch of key amino acids.
[00:17:06.188 --> 00:17:10.829]  It's just so good for your gums, so good for gingivitis, so good to rejuvenate your mouth.
[00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.829]  It works really well.
[00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:12.829]  It's concentrated.
[00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:13.829]  It's a big tube.
[00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:22.109]  It's our new product at infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.188]  And there's so many other great products and look, we've got a lot of complaints.
[00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:27.269]  Hey, where's Turbo Force?
[00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:28.269]  Where's X2?
[00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:29.269]  Where's X3?
[00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:33.349]  Where's, over half our products have been sold out for a long time in the bankruptcy.
[00:17:33.349 --> 00:17:37.149]  We didn't have the money to get them, anything we're selling, we got in stock, but we clawed
[00:17:37.149 --> 00:17:42.089]  out of the red and now we're becoming a little bit profitable.
[00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:47.549]  But since we don't operate on outside sponsorship except for a few, 95% internal funding with
[00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:52.909]  these products, we have to put all that money forward to buy product and we did it.
[00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:58.188]  X3 is in at the end of the month, X2 a few weeks later, Turbo Force, middle of next month
[00:17:58.188 --> 00:18:05.629]  and over seven other products will be almost fully stocked in except Bazzo Beats Ultra
[00:18:05.629 --> 00:18:12.729]  12, Fizzy Magnesium, Vitamin D3 gummies and a bunch of other stuff that we have had in
[00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:14.829]  stock, it's going to be sold out.
[00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:19.789]  But a lot of our top sellers will begin in the next couple of weeks to the next month
[00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:20.789]  and a half.
[00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:24.909]  So the cavalry is here and we should have a good funding then for all our legal battles
[00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:28.789]  and to have the reporters actually be able to go out on the road and cover Bilderberg
[00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:34.069]  or cover Deimos or cover elections or cover riots and get back and hire more people on
[00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:35.069]  again.
[00:18:35.069 --> 00:18:36.069]  I don't want to just stay the same.
[00:18:36.069 --> 00:18:38.509]  I think you want us in this fight swinging for the fences.
[00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:40.729]  Well, you are the info war, I am you.
[00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:43.029]  We are only as strong as our listeners are.
[00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:44.029]  So thank you for your support.
[00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:45.509]  Thank those that have supported.
[00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:48.949]  But just ask those that have sat there on the fence for some reason, ever gone info
[00:18:48.949 --> 00:18:53.869]  war store dot com, even if you just go make a donation, you can't lose because you're
[00:18:53.869 --> 00:18:54.869]  fighting info war.
[00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:55.869]  You want to fight?
[00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:56.869]  That's the way to it.
[00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:57.869]  So support the top.
[00:18:57.869 --> 00:18:58.869]  Make a donation.
[00:18:58.869 --> 00:18:59.869]  Five dollars.
[00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:00.869]  Ten dollars.
[00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:01.869]  One hundred dollars.
[00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:02.869]  Do a recurring donation.
[00:19:02.869 --> 00:19:03.869]  Cancel any time for free.
[00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:04.869]  One click on your profile.
[00:19:04.869 --> 00:19:05.869]  But that way you give ten dollars a month.
[00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:06.869]  You know, you can give that.
[00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:07.869]  You got more money.
[00:19:07.869 --> 00:19:08.869]  One hundred dollars.
[00:19:08.869 --> 00:19:11.229]  That way you get ninety five percent of it after credit card fees.
[00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:15.309]  Because listen, this is what we do as our sales tactic.
[00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.309]  Most people don't do this.
[00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:19.069]  Most supplements are marked up five times to medialize as we mark them up more.
[00:19:19.069 --> 00:19:20.069]  It's not true.
[00:19:20.069 --> 00:19:22.188]  You can check these and know that outside groups have analyzed it.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:34.280]  We mark something up usually about 200% separate expenses and everything else you got to get that much and then we lower it in sales at least 75 to 100% because people want to buy something that's discounted.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:47.280]  So if there's anything we do like the tactic of 1995 people buy more of you say 1995 instead of 20 all right if you'll buy more I'll do that but that's about as manipulative as we get folks that's what you want so we do that.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:56.280]  We'll do the 1995 thing and we'll do the thing up here you know and then sell it on sale it's just that product cost has gone up supply chain breakdowns.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:10.280]  We can't do that like with the Dr. Jones Naturals there's not that much markup in it or with the new line that's excellent Infowars MD you do 50% off that you're losing money.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:22.280]  We can't go below 35-40% on that because literally there's not even at the price we sell it 100% markup there's not even 30% markup if we have 50% off.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:36.280]  In fact there's no markup because it's not just the cost the product it's the warehouse the crew the infrastructure the legal all the licensing fees just believe me anybody that's in business knows it for people that aren't it's quite a struggle.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:51.280]  So please go to InfowarsStore.com you'll see right up on the left-hand corner the second link right there says donate that's really what's put us into the black after everything is those of you that are given on average about $5,000 a day.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:58.280]  Man if we had $10,000 a day being donated our underage is a couple hundred thousand dollars a month that would fix it right there.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:05.280]  We've now filed officially in the bankruptcy court our last year's history like I guesstimated million dollars in the hole last year.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:13.280]  So that means we've got to have a hundred thousand or eighty thousand dollars extra each month this year just to buy the product to get out of that hole.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:25.280]  I'm done doing an analysis I'm just telling you how it works I was never really a business guy I use selling things to stay on air and I'm an information warfare person and a lover of liberty but I've learned all about business actually gotten pretty good at it.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:37.280]  Being squeezed and attacked and deplatformed and sued and all the rest of it that which has not killed us has only made us stronger I guess until they actually kill us so I'll never give up.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:45.780]  I'll never sell out but I could give out like a horse that ain't getting water or
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:52.820]  fed or you know rode hard and put away wet anybody knows about horses you ride them all
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:58.500]  day and you better feed them and kiss on them and dry them off and give them some good food
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.220]  and give them water you'll come out there in the morning that horse is gonna be dead
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.020]  and let me tell you this horse has been I'm equivalent like a Clydesdale that's been
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:13.380]  in a coal mine you know 200 years ago hauling up giant giant sleds of coal and I'll never
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.060]  quit till my heart goes out but I need to be fed I need to be taken care of so is this crew
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.860]  we've lost so many people they've harassed so many of our crew members it's been a it's been
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.380]  a fight with the CIA and I used to tell you that folks now it's all over the news
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.700]  and I know it's in the twitter files I've talked to folks have seen them I wish Elon
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.260]  Musk would release my twitter files but hey whatever at least he's releasing the other ones
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.940]  so I'm not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth to continue on with the horse analogies all right
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.140]  enough of that now let's move into the main transmission
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:53.460]  the globalists need to destroy local and regional banks and credit unions
[00:22:55.379 --> 00:23:02.820]  and savings and loans and systems like that and state banks and so they've created a massive massive
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:09.060]  debt bubble they know the general public can't pay its loans whether it's in cars or houses or
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:14.980]  businesses and so up to 30 to 40 percent hell i've seen some numbers of 67 percent
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:21.540]  65 percent on average of major credit card holders can't pay their credit card bill so that's another
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.419]  form of banking and a lot of people have local credit cards or regional credit cards or smaller
[00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:32.659]  bank credit cards but this is the second largest private lending bank in the country that actually
[00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:36.820]  lends money to businesses and people the big mega banks don't do that they just get federal
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.260]  reserve money and then loan it out to everybody else and then get real assets when you can't pay
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:49.139]  so just like in 1913 you know just like we saw in 1929 just like we've seen in 2008
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.540]  and in 1987 and in other parts of the world different times sorrows the specialty is this
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.020]  get economies way extended give them a bunch of credit get people massively into debt
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:07.940]  yeah it's a wonderful life explains it and then you cause a big bank run but notice they didn't
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:15.379]  do it against the jp morgan or a bank of america or a city bank or any of those they did it against
[00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:24.340]  the second largest in the united states lender to the private general public and they did it
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.500]  right as they're preparing and rolling out their central bank digital currency where oh your money's
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:33.379]  not good we can't get your cash your bank isn't gonna have money but we're ready to give you an
[00:24:33.379 --> 00:24:40.899]  app on your phone if you lost more than 250 000 which 80 plus percent of these folks were not
[00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:47.139]  insured they're now reporting at silicon valley bank in california but it's all over the country
[00:24:47.139 --> 00:24:51.700]  in the world but it's based there so it's the exact same pattern it's exactly how they do it
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.260]  over and over again it's how they do it the third world why do you think in mexico it's 10 to 1 to
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.980]  the dollar or 17 to 1 to the dollar let's be technical
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.440]  because the mexican elites decided the 80s again in the 90s to screw their people and put a bunch
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.600]  of dead off on them to control them so this is what's going on here this is the exact pattern
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.040]  they follow they're doing the big banks that actually
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:28.260]  do business with the public instead of just getting Federal Reserve bailouts and so it's
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.860]  a big deal now it's not like we just predicted they would pull this next or this is one of
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.899]  the main things that would probably do that it was ripe for that to collapse independent
[00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:41.220]  banking systems to consolidate control this has been going on for hundreds of years but
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:46.580]  it's accelerating we specifically because I collaborate with the great Greg Reese put
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:53.240]  out three reports since January that I'm going to air the newest and then the one in
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.300]  between and the oldest somebody are the one from January then I'm going to air the one
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:04.639]  from February and then I'm going to air the one from today that just went up today at
[00:26:04.639 --> 00:26:09.680]  man dot video so first we're going to air SP ones the name of it the banking collapse
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.520]  has begun we're going to air that first then we're going to air the one from February European
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.840]  central bank preparing for bail ins and banking collapse then we're going to air the oldest
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:25.420]  one from January the big banks the IMF plan on stealing your money we're going to show
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:33.240]  you clips of them saying in the US and the EU we don't just sit here and LeGrand and
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.679]  all of them the EU heads the bank heads have all said the last two months we got to get
[00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:44.179]  our strategic bank reserves set up in central bank digital currencies centralized digital
[00:26:44.179 --> 00:26:49.700]  currencies we've only got a few months we got to do it now or we'll be destroyed those
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.700]  are quotes I've played here it's very cryptic the public doesn't know what that means he's
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.940]  talking about the elites they're about to collapse their bubble blame the local and
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:08.020]  regional banks and then say hey we got a pilot program for people that weren't insured because
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.399]  you got more than $250,000 in any one bank account you don't get it and remember they've
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.840]  only got about 500 billion dollars in the federal depositors insurance corporation set
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.920]  up after the Great Depression
[00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:26.129]  and it used to only go up to 10,000 and 100,000 and then about 10 years ago 250,000.
[00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:33.490]  So if this bank just sucked between 150 and 179 there's different numbers out there out of the
[00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:40.689]  Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation bank account that means they've only got 300 something
[00:27:40.689 --> 00:27:45.250]  billion and a bunch of other banks are now having runs and going under and suspending
[00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.449]  stock trading not just here but around the world I'm about to go over that right now
[00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:52.370]  after we play the Gregory's reports but so think about that they only got 500 billion
[00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:59.970]  150 plus billion some estimates are 200 million but most numbers are 156 you know 178
[00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:04.129]  this is what the FDIC saying they don't even really know we're not really even being told
[00:28:04.129 --> 00:28:08.770]  but they could have propped this up when they knew it was melting down the last month and they
[00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.610]  couldn't get outside funding and they couldn't get a stock split and they couldn't get all the things
[00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:20.530]  they wanted the bank regulators refused to prop up Silicon Valley bank even though they know the
[00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:25.490]  losses of not propping them up to be much worse so when it all starts going down they'll get
[00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:32.530]  quadrillions trillions upon trillions to prop the whole thing up and get more power for themselves
[00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:38.370]  so when the boat sprung a little leak they didn't plug it they're gonna wait till the boat sinking
[00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.169]  panic us all and then have a pilot program that started being rolled out in Europe and other areas
[00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:49.250]  up for those that lost more than 250 000 or those that had more more money in there so you got
[00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.090]  millions of millions of dollars you only got quarter million back we're gonna give you this
[00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:59.409]  new digital currency good with the federal reserve good with the treasury that'll be good everywhere
[00:28:59.409 --> 00:29:04.929]  that as long as you just use it on this app and through our system it's all tracked and controlled
[00:29:04.929 --> 00:29:11.730]  you will get your money back with a small bail-in fee for administrative cost the average person if
[00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:19.250]  they're not warned of this ahead of time will immediately sign on to this now if that's their
[00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.010]  plan that's what i think they're probably doing there's a couple different battle plans with what
[00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.210]  they've launched but i think that's their main plan right now no one else is saying that you're
[00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:33.250]  getting in here first they will then stabilize in a month or two once people accept the central bank
[00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.330]  digital currency in a quote pilot test that are already rolling out around the world including
[00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:42.050]  here that's now biden's new main initiative on wednesday when this is about to go down on friday
[00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.649]  big national reports finally put out then
[00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:51.890]  then once the pilot is set up and working and you accept it six months a year from now
[00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.730]  maximum two years they drop the complete hammer get rid of cash entirely you'll still have little
[00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:03.410]  coupons that print out that say it's tied to an sdr but it'll all be tracked and controlled by that
[00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:09.250]  and scanned in so all cash as you know it'll be gone the true reign of terror will begin where
[00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.450]  they can delete money out of your account tell you how much it's worth tell you where you can
[00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:18.450]  spend money i mean if you want to be a slave i've asked people that speak spanish what it means and
[00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.850]  i just because i've been asked a cuban uh because you know the spanish speaking is like anywhere
[00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:30.370]  like english it's different variants around the world but he's being picked up at the immigration
[00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:35.090]  facility after floating on a boat he's a fictitious character but a composite of real characters
[00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.890]  and the guy that wrote the script um oliver stones been five years researching it steven
[00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.130]  bryant said it was a composite real people real things that happen just like the godfather is
[00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.770]  and he's picked up by the board patrol and he's in there and they say hey what's this you get that
[00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:53.490]  scar eating pussy and all the rest of it he said listen you cannot do anything that castro's already
[00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:58.530]  done to me he said i don't care what you do what where you put me i've already been through more
[00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:04.290]  hell than you can imagine and he says listen you want to be a sheep you want a chivana or chivano
[00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.490]  and that's mexicans i don't know what that means i don't know what a chivano is
[00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.770]  that made me look at what does Tony Montana mean by you want a guy on every corner watching you
[00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:18.370]  telling you where to work where to live how to speak when you can go to the bathroom you only
[00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:24.850]  get you know one thing to eat all day long i got squid coming out of my ass that's what it's like
[00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:30.930]  folks but a digital system of that a digital system tracking everything you do controlling
[00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:41.330]  every aspect of your life do you want that you want to be a sheep like tony montana says because
[00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:46.770]  ladies and gentlemen that's what this is you want to put chains on and handcuffs on and be put in a
[00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:51.090]  dungeon but there's an excellent graphic i'm going to show you before i play these videos
[00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:58.770]  these reports this is a put out by rise melbourne out of australia
[00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:04.290]  couldn't have surmised it better myself couldn't have summarized it better myself
[00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:09.730]  this is exactly what's planned and for radio listeners i'll describe it it shows a nice town
[00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:16.930]  house 20 minutes city shows some smaller apartment blocks still decent 10 minutes city
[00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.570]  shows these 250 square foot coffin apartments they're building even in austin texas
[00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.610]  and all over the world they just talked about five years ago now they're here
[00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:28.770]  five minutes city and then it's super max prisons you're one minute city
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.240]  and this is the digital system
[00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:40.770]  to enforce absolutely all of it and then when you've got your digital social credit score
[00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.810]  your universal basic income on your central bank digital currency what's on the menu you
[00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:52.450]  can only buy what they say like bug meal and bug meat hamburger but don't worry they don't call it
[00:32:52.450 --> 00:33:02.290]  bugs they call it e120 and e904 they're now making codes on the food not just here
[00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:09.250]  but around the world so they know exactly what they're doing so let's hit some of these headlines
[00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:16.770]  and i'll play these reports from the newest to the oldest silicon valley bank shutters have been

[00:34:42.919 --> 00:34:47.879]  Then we got Jim Cramer a week ago saying it's the best thing ever to own if he says something if he says go

[00:34:52.170 --> 00:35:13.630]  He's there to suck around as many people as he can when something's imploding so the big money can get their money out But hey, they love it So if you want to be a really big sucker Go along with what's about to happen. We've been warning about you telling it's imminent Let's go ahead and just air these all back to back
[00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.650]  You
[00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:23.810]  SP 1 SP 2 and SP 3 all these reports. I'm gonna have Jamie who's working here on the weekend update all of these
[00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.050]  to the live show feed under my
[00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:32.270]  Live show feed. I'm gonna have it post all of those you can see how we nailed it
[00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:39.970]  Myself and Gregory's doing the analysis Gregory's doing the great work put these videos out here are these reports share them to everyone
[00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.290]  You know, they're in the Gregory section of band-aught video
[00:35:43.650 --> 00:36:12.650]  This week Tucker Carlson exposed the masses to the January 6th hoax. In the Proud Boys trial, leaked chat logs from FBI Special Agent Nicole Miller revealed that she was ordered by her boss to destroy 338 items of evidence. Once this news broke days ago, the trial was halted.
[00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:21.650]  The investigation into Twitter has revealed that moderators were instructed to censor true posts which could fuel hesitancy.
[00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:32.650]  Former CDC head Robert Redfield has just testified that the NIH was conducting gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab in China.
[00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:40.650]  Politically, the tide is turning and people all over the world are now rejecting the New World Order.
[00:36:40.650 --> 00:37:01.650]  The Central Bank of Nigeria launched their CBDC a little over a year ago, but the people rejected it. So early this year, the Nigerian banks emptied the ATM machines and closed their doors. This resulted in angry protests. The people attacked ATMs and blocked roads in multiple cities.
[00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:16.650]  The Bank of Lebanon has crashed. The Lebanese pound has fallen to an all-time low of 80,000 against the U.S. dollar. The people have taken to the streets. Banks have been set on fire.
[00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:33.650]  The rise in Fed rates has officially killed America's biggest lender, Silicon Valley Bank. The FDIC shutters Silicon Valley Bank. $152 billion of uninsured deposits are destroyed.
[00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:46.650]  The rise in Fed rates also killed Silver Gate Capital. Several regional bank stocks have plummeted as a result of the Silicon Valley Bank and the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
[00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:59.650]  The housing market is collapsing as well. The majority of commercial real estate loans are lent by small banks. Massive short bets are now happening in the commercial real estate market.
[00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:10.650]  The Federal Reserve Bank is taking down the housing market along with all regional banks, leaving only its vassals who will be distributing CBDCs as a solution.
[00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:18.650]  The financial experts are now recommending that people have food, gold and silver, and cash in their possession.
[00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.650]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reiss.
[00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:41.650]  After publishing my video report on bank bail-ins, a contractor for the European Central Bank, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons, contacted me with the following information.
[00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:54.650]  Shortly after the FDIC meeting that went viral, my source was assigned an urgent project related to bail-in capability for the European Central Bank, or ECB.
[00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:03.650]  Bail-ins is when the bank steals money directly from people's accounts, just like we saw in Cyprus in 2013.
[00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:14.650]  The project goal is to build a data infrastructure for the financial market infrastructures, which are the networks that allow financial transactions to take place,
[00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:27.650]  to report to the ECB about the capability of banks and capital markets to absorb losses and to execute bail-ins as quickly and efficiently as possible.
[00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:37.650]  This urgent project makes it clear that the ECB is expecting a system collapse, and that they know it is uncontrollable and unforeseeable.
[00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:45.650]  The current security requirements do not legally compel the banks to provide information to the ECB.
[00:39:45.650 --> 00:40:00.650]  If a bank is insolvent, they have no incentive to tell the ECB, and so the ECB is not targeting banks directly, but rather financial intermediaries like SWIFT and large settlement houses.
[00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:10.650]  The purpose of this contractor's job is to provide a way for the ECB to pinpoint which banks are insolvent and where the collapse will stem from.
[00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:24.650]  This is being done by creating large data lakes, which an engineer can analyze and find meaning at a graphical level, how much bail-ins each bank has to execute, and how much of a loss they can take.
[00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:32.650]  This is evidence that the ECB is definitely planning on bail-ins as a means of surviving an imminent collapse.
[00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:45.650]  And when this occurs, we can expect multiple banks to close and stock markets around the world to shut down, as the banks steal as much money from the people as they deem necessary.
[00:40:46.650 --> 00:41:02.650]  Most of this work is being done in private, but there are pieces of information available to the public on the EU's SRB website, including operational guidance on bail-in implementation and the operational guidance on bail-in playbooks.
[00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:29.650]  The ECB contractor has also pointed out that the latest directives for the European Union's digital service providers states that governments shall appoint trusted bodies for internet domain registry, meaning that the government will have the sole authority on who is able to have a website, and that these new security directives allow a gaping hole for a major cyber attack, which official commentators are ignoring.
[00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.650]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:50.650]  Canadian veteran and political activist Jeremy McKenzie, known as the raging dissident, was just notified that he can no longer do banking in Canada.
[00:41:50.650 --> 00:42:15.650]  But it doesn't matter if you are a political activist or an obedient sheep, because the banks are planning on taking all of your money to pay off their debts.
[00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:44.650]  The FDIC currently has less than $200 billion in assets to insure over $9 trillion. That's just 1.3%. They know that a system collapse is coming, and they are already planning for bail-ins.
[00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:54.650]  As trust begins to fail, the people will begin to withdraw their funds, which will only guarantee a banking collapse. This is known as a bank run.
[00:42:54.650 --> 00:43:13.650]  In 2012, the International Monetary Fund, known for their reputation of coercion, violence, and extortion, published staff discussion notes entitled, From Bailout to Bail-In, Mandatory Debt Restructuring of Systemic Financial Institutions.
[00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:30.650]  After the 2008 crisis, the world learned what a bailout is. Trillions of taxpayer dollars printed out of thin air to pay off the banker's bad habits. It was hugely unpopular, but pales in comparison to a bail-in.
[00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:56.650]  So what exactly is a bail-in? It is officially obfuscated with elaborate equations, but to put it simply, it is when the bank steals your money directly from your account. They called it haircuts when they did it in Cyprus back in 2013, which the courts later ruled was legit. And a recent video on TikTok shows that the new bail-ins may have already begun.

[00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:30.650]  I can tell you how many outside groups go and test the products we sell. Mike Adams is famous for his big testing lab where he tests all sorts of products, pulses, supplements. And I didn't even know this happened with a family member.
[00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:43.650]  He was given by a family member that had some neurological issues, CBD oil, because in all the studies, it's really good CBD oil. It really helps all sorts of neurological things, Parkinson's, epilepsy, narcolepsy, list goes on and on, joint pain, you name it.
[00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:54.650]  And he went and tested ours in his testing lab, checked his degrees, and said, this is the highest quality we've seen. We've seen another brand that's good, but this is the very top. This should be $160 a bottle for the 1000 milligram that he puts out.
[00:45:54.650 --> 00:46:05.650]  And that's true. They recommended we sell it for 150. I went to these folks that own a big company that's one of the top distributors in the country of wide spectrum CBD, and they said, we recommend 150 retail, then discount it 100 bucks.
[00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:20.650]  Well, I'm not going to do 200% market. So at $67, there's a hundred percent markup to find ourselves. You're getting the best CBD 1000 milligram, 25 milligram and 10 milligrams in the one you want at over 50% what you're going to get this anywhere else.
[00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:39.650]  That's what the discounted it's about 35% after the discount. So I bet if you look at a retail, it's like a 70% discount. The point is, is that point blank, everybody knows CBD is great doctors are prescribing and everywhere, even though it's not prescription.
[00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:49.650]  This is the best you're going to get info war store.com and it funds the info or a total 360 win. Only way we fail is we don't take action. And I know less than 1% of the viewers who I love and I think I'm not bitching.
[00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:58.650]  If just one more percent would just do it. We wouldn't just be good. We could expand. So we're not going anywhere. Those of you that have bought the products, you know who you are. Those who haven't, Hey, keep spreading the word, keep praying for us.
[00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.650]  And if you want to experience great CBD, try it out, get a bottle. And I think you're going to be a repeat customer by the product.
[00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:15.650]  All right, again, I'm going to have all three of these reports from January, February, and today that we just aired posted under the live show feed of the show today.
[00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:24.650]  I'm begging you for myself. I'm begging you for my family. I'm begging you for your family. I'm begging you for everybody to get the story out ahead of them.
[00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:33.650]  Now I'm not at liberty to talk about this yet, but soon I will be able to documents that came out in the federal lawsuit, high level against big pharma.
[00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:45.650]  Have communications with the most powerful private foundation on earth. This is bigger than Bill and Melinda Gates. It's who really runs that who set up Bill Gates saying the number one enemy is Alex Jones.
[00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:55.650]  Now, when I learned that it's like a punch in the stomach has already know it. And I don't like powerful enemies. The flesh is weak, the spirit strong, but I'm also at a very level, very satisfied.
[00:47:55.650 --> 00:48:07.650]  And the satisfaction of having the enemy hate me the most, knowing that I'm basically full spectrum, the most informed person, at least on air, who's for our team, not their team.
[00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:12.650]  They got a lot of folks know what's going on their team. My job is to get enough of the public to understand what's going on.
[00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:20.650]  And there they are saying, this man knows our plans. And I've been under investigation for over a decade. They don't know how I know all this stuff.
[00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:28.650]  I know I was under investigation after the Vegas attack and also on 9 11 because they didn't know how I knew all this.
[00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:34.650]  I mean, I knew it from research. And then there's that final step that it really is the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:42.650]  I mean, we're all connected to God. They call it psychic power. It's not something I can control. It's when God gives it to me.
[00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:58.650]  And I just know I just know I immerse myself. I do constant studying. And then I'm just immersed in this and then God's the oracle that gives me the information.
[00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:06.650]  But a lot of this is just sussing it out and basic political analysis and what I call political mathematics are really adding together history.
[00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:10.650]  What's currently happening, what's coming in the future, their white papers, their plans and all of it.
[00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:16.650]  But the reason they don't like my broadcast, sorry, my earpiece came unclipped is.
[00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:25.450]  I'm the most effective and all glory goes to God and our guests and our crew and everybody
[00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:30.270]  at getting people decompartmentalized that work in the government corporations.
[00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:37.850]  And so many times they track back whistleblowers having their minds touched, their hearts touched
[00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:44.130]  because of this show and our guests and our college and our reports and our analysis.
[00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.370]  And so we really are a precious operation.
[00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:50.730]  And I wanted to say this today, we're going to go into very hard times.
[00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:54.370]  They're going to really put the economic squeeze on where they bragged and said, we'll do carbon
[00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:58.130]  lockdowns where there's no fuel and no gas and no money.
[00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.970]  We're going to train you to stay in your house one way or another.
[00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.810]  And I know during what's coming, you're going to have trouble.
[00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:08.170]  Most of you putting food on your table and getting fuel for your car.
[00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:14.810]  And I know in that crisis, they think you'll be so worried about food and water and transportation.
[00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.250]  You'll become politically disconnected.
[00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:21.890]  In fact, I remember from multiple sources, I can name one of them because he's on record.
[00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:26.570]  Daniel Estelin really does have sources in Bilderberg that actually don't like what's
[00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:27.570]  happening.
[00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.850]  And I actually got some sources a little bit later as well and was given a lot of secret
[00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.710]  documents that we did publish that, of course, there were so huge, no one paid attention
[00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:40.090]  to them back in like 2009 in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:49.690]  But they said in the meetings 15 years ago and 14 years ago in Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:56.520]  The globalists said, we have to make them so poor they don't even have money to worry
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520]  about what we're doing.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.720]  And they don't have money to put gas in a car to come protest us.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.040]  And that's a lot of the discussion is just that's what feudalism is.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.520]  Feudalism is the oldest system of government.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:11.480]  It's the most common system of government in recorded human history 7,000 years.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:15.400]  And you just make the general public so poor 98% of them.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:24.880]  And then you've got 1.9% that are the manager class that work for the 10th of 1% and that's
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.520]  how it works.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:34.080]  And so feudalism is the natural default position of the software that tyrants run.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.840]  And so if people are aware of their plan and aware of their operation and aware that each
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.160]  step they walk us into tyranny is a step that makes our lives worse and that submission
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:50.800]  is death, resistance is victory, then we can win and we can win big.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.480]  But that's what I'm getting at here with you today is that you're going to have to decide
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.160]  what is most essential.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.560]  Maybe you got to have a crappy car and not go on vacation so your child goes to a private
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.480]  Christian school.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.260]  Maybe you've got to get rid of that big job.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.520]  You've got to move the country and live on 40 acres and work at a gas station or whatever
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.120]  and live subsistence so your child's not brainwashed.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.240]  And you're going to feel like the smartest person on earth in a couple of years when
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.160]  everybody's trying to get to the countryside.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.600]  If I was a selfish person and had my druthers and didn't think we could win this, I'd already
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.400]  be gone, folks.
[00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:28.550]  So, I believe we can beat this.
[00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:29.550]  I know we can beat this.
[00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:33.910]  You see all the evidence everywhere, but I'm asking listeners and viewers, you should sit
[00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:39.270]  down with your wife, with your husband, with your parents, with your kids, but family should
[00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:44.390]  get together and in friend groups and say on a piece of paper, everybody write down
[00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:48.110]  what's most important and then talk about what you wrote down and decide what you're
[00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:49.830]  going to make essential.
[00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.470]  What you're going to decide is most important.
[00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.070]  First is your relationship with God.
[00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:58.830]  Number two is a bodily autonomy over your body, not let them put these poison injections,
[00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:01.430]  these gene therapies into you.
[00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.210]  And the next is obviously going to be trying to help your neighbors, your community around
[00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:09.670]  you and not compromise your soul because they want to put you in an economic position so
[00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:14.190]  bad with a social credit score and the universal basic income that you will do anything to
[00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:18.490]  be able to, quote, thrive and still have fun.
[00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.370]  You're going to have fun only in the first level.
[00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.370]  You sell out.
[00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:25.410]  When this goes down for a while, you'll get money and still be able to go to the movies
[00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:30.330]  and rock concerts and vacations, but they're going to slowly shut that down over the next
[00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:36.010]  few years after that's in their plans and the greatest analogy of this is that Walt
[00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:41.810]  Disney, great Pinocchio, and it's an archetype where Pinocchio can be a real boy.
[00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:51.970]  The guardian angel sends, God sends the guardian angel to give Geppetto, the old cobbler,
[00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:56.970]  the old shoemaker, what he always wanted, a child, because you don't know if his wife
[00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:00.730]  died, you don't know what happened, he's a very sad old man, he wants a child, and he
[00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:03.810]  builds his little wooden children and he loves them.
[00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:08.490]  But God just can't give him a new soul, God just can't give him that, that has to prove
[00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.410]  it's alive, that's an archetype of proving we love God.
[00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:18.930]  We're all wooden dolls made out of clay, we're all not really human until we go through the
[00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:24.170]  process and choose God, then we become really human, we become a real boy, a real girl.
[00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:32.970]  And so Pinocchio, when his dad goes to work, goes out and first he runs into scammers and
[00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:37.490]  robbers and people and they teach him how to pickpocket, run scams, then they sell him
[00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:46.570]  as a slave to the gypsy that's gonna put him on display, then he gets away from that,
[00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:52.610]  gets picked up by some other scammers, he commits crimes, he commits vandalism, he drinks,
[00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:57.570]  he smokes, he parties, and then that turns him into a jackass.
[00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:01.530]  Not just from the wooden boy that could be evil or good, now he's evil, now he's lost
[00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.730]  God's protection, now he's a slave.
[00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:11.569]  But the ship gets destroyed by the whale, you know all the rest of the story, he selflessly
[00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:19.410]  stands up, gives over his life to save others, just like Christ did, and God says, now you're
[00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.210]  a real boy.
[00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:25.330]  And that's really what this is all about, folks.
[00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.950]  I want to be a real boy.
[00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:33.310]  And I can tell you, after 28 years of fighting, 20, 30 years in the fight, 28 years on air,
[00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:38.790]  I am just now going from wood to flesh, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:45.049]  I am just now experiencing what it's like where evil isn't even a temptation anymore,
[00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:49.569]  but it's just some long lost thing in the rear view mirror.
[00:55:49.569 --> 00:55:53.109]  So that's what they're trying to do to us.
[00:55:53.109 --> 00:56:00.250]  So everybody has to decide, is being a real soul that chooses God, is that what you want
[00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:02.330]  to be or do you want to be part of the system?
[00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:04.490]  So I'm asking listeners to commit.
[00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:15.490]  Today, to make info wars, the priority of your word of mouth and your prayer, I'm not
[00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:19.370]  saying don't pray for your grandma, your family more than me, I'm saying in the world, I'm
[00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:24.370]  asking you to pray for him for us because I know it's the ultimate power for our protection
[00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:30.090]  and our and our and our intelligence and that God lead God and direct us I need that I'm
[00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:34.590]  asking you humbly to intercess with God and pray for us because we're an important operation
[00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:35.590]  and you're part of this operation.
[00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:36.590]  I need your help.
[00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:37.590]  I need you to intercess with God.
[00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:40.910]  I need you to pray for us and pray for your family and yourself as well that you have
[00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:44.810]  great discernment and empowerment in God's will.
[00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:47.230]  And I need you to spread the word even if we have no money.
[00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:48.230]  You can do that.
[00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:53.130]  It's paramount about the show any way you can that the forbidden truths and info wars.com
[00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:58.550]  and band out video and share the link right now that's not banned Mad Max world.tv.
[00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:03.410]  And I need you to empower yourself anyways and get amazing products at info wars store.com
[00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:07.930]  if you have the money and I'm so upset to know that so many blue-collar hard-working
[00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:12.890]  people get these great products but that so many of the middle class and rich people listen
[00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:18.250]  have a guess a massive bunch of money because you're a tight-ass that's fine and dandy but
[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:23.290]  you better bet your money on what's been working when you're about to lose it all anyways and
[00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.290]  be a total slave.
[00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.770]  So I'm saying go to info wars store.com and decide when you have that meeting with yourself
[00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:33.090]  or your wife or your husband or your neighbors or whoever about what is a priority the priority
[00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:37.570]  is to warn people about the global agenda to stop it and to support those that are fighting
[00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.050]  it the hardest.
[00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:43.150]  That's why we're a platform to support all the other people that are under attack the
[00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:47.370]  General Flynn's the Roger stones the Tucker Carlson's the list goes on and on and I've
[00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:51.210]  been so blessed to be part of it but I'm just asking you because I want to spend all my
[00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:52.490]  time fighting the globalist.
[00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:56.250]  I don't want to spend five hours a day trying to find the money and cutting this and cutting
[00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.970]  that to stay on air.
[00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:03.050]  You could fix it all by bailing info wars out and info wars just needs extra money to
[00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.570]  buy all the products we used to have that are popular and then we'll have all of them
[00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:09.730]  and we'll have plenty of money but we got caught in a loop of never having the products
[00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.050]  we don't have t-shirts we don't have hardly any books we don't have water filters we don't
[00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:17.170]  have anything we've got the supplements and that's it but finally we're getting money
[00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:21.690]  to buy a few books and a few water filters and building back up we're we're we're almost

[00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:22.230]  hour that's so important so we understand the crises they're creating to push us into

[00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:39.170]  and tell them tune into info wars.com forward slash show and bypass big tech
[00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.490]  one of the things that I would recommend for people to go look at
[00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:50.930]  and I don't care what you think about this guy who I'm about to mention but I was sent a a video
[00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:56.690]  yesterday I said it's basically a documentary and late in the afternoon so I watched it last
[00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:04.290]  night and it's and it's by Alex Jones info wars and the media has tarnished him with all sorts
[01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:09.890]  of name calling conspiracy theorist bomb thrower the one thing that I know about this gentleman
[01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:18.050]  Alex Jones is that is that he loves this country he is as smart as a whip he he absolutely believes
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:25.170]  in what he believes in and he also does his research and his homework and so I sat because
[01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:30.530]  a close friend of mine said you've got to watch this I just finished watching it he actually put
[01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:35.330]  it out yesterday and it's called an emergency broadcast and it's based on info wars and it's
[01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:42.930]  based on the whole COVID lie and uh and Alex takes his audience through an hour and a half worth of
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:52.050]  just incredible level of detail of a of a war game that our government did back in the 2016-2017
[01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:58.130]  time frame with with you know under a different name and they called it spars instead of SARS
[01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:04.850]  COVID right and it's this incredible runs parallel to everything that's going on today
[01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:12.130]  even in the war game that they did almost five years ago now four years ago now in the war game
[01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:18.690]  they even put out social media things like tweets and such and in the tweets that they use in the
[01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:25.170]  war game they use the exact same tweets over the last year I mean the exact same words the exact
[01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:31.090]  same hashtags and it's like it's one big setup so let me so that's just this thing that this thing
[01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:37.410]  that Alex Jones put out yesterday it needs to get out in a bigger way because Alex walks through
[01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:42.050]  and again whatever I don't care what people think of him he's incredibly
[01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:48.210]  detailed in his research he loves this country he is a patriot and he's somebody who we better
[01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:52.370]  listen to or others in this country better listen to and read there's a reason why the
[01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:57.570]  mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy theorist because they're
[01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:02.370]  they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out and in this particular
[01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:08.930]  documentary that he does did yesterday is fascinating and it there's an awful awful
[01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:14.770]  lot of parallels in it from what was done in a war game so to speak quote unquote and then
[01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:19.650]  what we what the reality is that we're facing there will be a surprise outbreak there's no
[01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:25.170]  doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were
[01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:36.610]  faced with
[01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:45.170]  and by the way thank you for your support the cbd product from info war store.com is truly
[01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:50.450]  outstanding i've got one of my family members on it and it's working wonders it is highly potent
[01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:54.690]  it's very effective we've tested it in the laboratory and it's an extraordinary value
[01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:59.730]  info war store.com check out the cbd oil i think that's the 1000 milligram bottle
[01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:03.410]  that i'm referring to there but there are some other formats that are available as well
[01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:16.530]  if uh if russia invades that means tanks or troops crossing
[01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:25.730]  the border of ukraine again then uh there will be uh we there will be no longer
[01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:31.410]  a north stream 2 we we will bring an end to it but how will you do that exactly
[01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.650]  since the project and control of the project is within germany's control
[01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:41.570]  i promise you we'll be able to do it tonight sabotage at sea that's what president biden
[01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:47.490]  is calling the leaks and explosions on the north stream pipelines like a boiling cauldron
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:54.130]  the busy baltic sea bursting with gas from ruptured russian north stream reinforced pipelines
[01:03:54.130 --> 01:04:00.450]  first on cnn sources telling us that european security officials observed russian navy ships
[01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:05.890]  earlier this week in the vicinity of those leaks in the north stream pipelines that were likely
[01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:11.490]  caused by underwater explosions here's what we know we know that russian support ships russian
[01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:17.250]  navy support ships were spotted in the vicinity of the leaks on these pipelines we were also told
[01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:21.330]  by a source familiar with the intelligence that russian submarines were spotted in the general
[01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:28.290]  area last week i think this is uh clearly a an active sabotage of some sort and russia is
[01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:34.610]  certainly the most likely suspect it's incredibly uh alarming president vladimir putin has blamed
[01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:41.010]  the united states and its allies for blowing up the undersea north stream pipelines it was a
[01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:47.010]  deliberate act of sabotage and now the russians are pumping out disinformation lines if russia
[01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:50.850]  wanted to shut off the pipeline they would flip the button they would twist the knob they they
[01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:55.410]  don't need to blow it up it's theirs it starts in russia so it's pretty obvious to us the biden
[01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:59.730]  administration was involved in this they have been lying to us all along about this there's no
[01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:06.370]  way the united states was not either involved or knew about this or at the very minimum approved
[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:12.290]  it today a senior u.s government official rejected a new claim by russia's defense minister he claimed
[01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:19.010]  that ukraine is preparing to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb with western help on its own territory
[01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:25.010]  this is the first time the 101st airborne division has deployed to europe since world war II the idea
[01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:29.970]  that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in
[01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:36.370]  with american pilots and american crews just understand and don't kid yourself no matter
[01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:45.330]  what you all say that's called world war three the u.s will have to send their sons and daughters
[01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:52.690]  exactly the same way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war and they will have to fight
[01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:53.890]  and they will be dying
[01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:03.170]  air sirens blaring across much of central and eastern ukraine today as putin's forces ramp up
[01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:08.690]  washington has placed more than 8 000 u.s-based troops on a heightened state of alert today the
[01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:15.330]  u.s sent in the cavalry bound for romania right along the ukrainian border if we continue down
[01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:18.370]  this path we may end up with a nuclear holocaust
[01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:36.850]  cnn has learned that the u.s is developing contingency plans for possible russian escalation
[01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:42.930]  in its war in ukraine including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons russian president
[01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:47.170]  vladimir putin today making it official he just formally suspended russia's involvement
[01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:51.810]  in its last remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the united states the prospect of nuclear
[01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:59.010]  conflict once unthinkable is now back within the realm of possibility every actuary every
[01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:04.210]  historic war game every analysis shows this leads to total thermal nuclear war
[01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:19.490]  it's saturday march 11th we're now into hour number two and general flinn a combat veteran
[01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:26.850]  former head of defense intelligence agency and of course the top advisor to president trump as
[01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:33.250]  the national security advisor joins us commercial free for the next 55 minutes he's a very busy man
[01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:38.610]  we appreciate him coming on we're an inflection point a crossroads of crossroads i asked him
[01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:43.410]  before he went live just minutes ago what he wants to hit first he said it's all interconnected and
[01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:49.810]  so he's got understanding of this from perspectives that really very few do on our side the bad guys
[01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:53.890]  have lots of command and control experience but this guy they're definitely scared of him
[01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:58.930]  if they weren't able to remove him trump would still be in office today everybody even our
[01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:03.170]  enemies agree with that so we're gonna look at russia in the escalation there we're looking at
[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:06.850]  the bank runs that have begun uh we're going to look at the open borders we're gonna look
[01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:12.370]  at the january 6th bombshells coming out the huge gain of function uh dr redfield coming out saying
[01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:17.810]  no it was basically run by obama through fauci it was all illegal it was gain of function uh the
[01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:23.170]  deep state's in trouble but they will strike back so he's a very polite and humble man but the time
[01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:28.770]  we've got him i'm gonna try as much as possible to just let him talk uh because if i jump in he'll
[01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:34.210]  let me go forever so general flinn of general flinn dot com we salute you and your family and
[01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:38.370]  all your supporters what we've gone through together but you particularly we thank you for
[01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:43.810]  never backing down and uh you we had a lunch a few years ago and then met again about a year ago
[01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:48.530]  and you kept saying if we don't totally push we're gonna lose in the next two years but i think it's
[01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:54.370]  safe to say we haven't won we haven't lost but it looks like a lot of really good signals right now
[01:08:54.930 --> 01:09:00.290]  everywhere that there's a huge meltdown in the deep state all their operations are being blown
[01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:05.250]  right now but that concerns me because they're not going to give up without a fight and i just
[01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:10.210]  said last week i bet they do bank runs or a cyber attack to bring in their central bank digital
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:14.610]  currencies looks like we're there so you've got the floor sir if you give us your overview and
[01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:19.250]  then we can drill into these different subjects thank you for joining us well two things um
[01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:25.250]  immediately uh this year and i've been saying this for quite some time now i've been probably
[01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:31.410]  talking about this for the last year that this particular year 2023 uh i've been saying that
[01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:39.170]  it is going to have two transitions one of those transitions is the financial transition of the of
[01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:44.770]  the global economic system okay and i'll describe that here in a second the second transition
[01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:52.210]  is the health system the global health system and and alex and one of your uh in your lead into
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:57.010]  you know in the break when you were talking about some of the things that you were showing a clip
[01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:02.210]  of me there you know it's really i i'd been you know watching you off and on but one of the things
[01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:09.010]  and i and i think it was like 2010 it may have even been before that maybe 2007 where you were
[01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:16.050]  talking about uh you know the health uh the scares that they were that they were bringing forward and
[01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:21.650]  maybe at the time that we might have had some bird flu or some ebola but i think the the intuition
[01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:28.290]  that you had then to talk about where we are now uh is was really prescient i mean it was really
[01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:35.570]  really uh you know talk about visionary and understanding what was possible by our own
[01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:40.290]  government and frankly you know the deep state is not just these unelected bureaucrats i mean
[01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:43.890]  we'll and we need to talk a little bit about that for your audience today you know who this deep
[01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:51.170]  state is so we clearly define who the globalist elites are and and where they exist on the planet
[01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:56.210]  because it's not just in washington dc they're they're all over the world and uh and they and
[01:10:56.210 --> 01:11:03.490]  honestly at uh the the big push behind all of this alex and for your audience is coming from the uh
[01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:10.130]  the chinese communist party so there's no doubt about that and i i know what their uh their 100
[01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:15.810]  year plan is which essentially started in 1949 and uh they're executing it and they're actually
[01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:20.850]  speeding it up that's number one and then and then the other part of that is that this idea this
[01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:29.010]  notion of unrestricted warfare in 1998 uh 99 time frame i was in a military school at that time for
[01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:35.170]  one year and i had the chance to meet the authors of the uh of the of the manual called unrestricted
[01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:40.450]  warfare two chinese colonels that came over to the united states of america on a bit of an exchange
[01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:46.690]  and i i sat in and and and listened to them speaking about how they were going to fight
[01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:51.010]  this thing they called unrestricted warfare and it's their doctrine people can go find it online
[01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:57.410]  but before we go into some of that at the very tail end of the of the video that you showed prior
[01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:04.050]  to me coming on you showed a nuclear explosion and one of the things that is it is a major it's a
[01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:08.850]  falsehood and i want your entire audience and anybody that that gets this piece of that gets
[01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:16.210]  this clip to understand there is no such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon we will describe
[01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:20.050]  nuclear weapons and people will say that's a tactical nuclear weapon we're going to use
[01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:25.650]  tactical nuclear weapons there's no such thing that explosion that you showed right prior to
[01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:32.210]  me coming on that's it yeah there you go that's the result of a tactical nuclear weapon okay so
[01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:37.090]  don't think for a second that a tactical nuclear weapon is only going to blow up the hillside
[01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:42.210]  of a mountain we can do that with a lot of other munitions that we have but when we start to use
[01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:47.010]  tactical nuclear weapons which which are our administration has already talked about and i
[01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:51.970]  actually think when i when i look back if we really did the research we were probably the
[01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:56.850]  ones first talking about the use of nuclear weapons and not necessarily the russians although
[01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:01.890]  now both of us both sides are talking about the use of nuclear weapons once we go to nuclear
[01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:06.210]  weapons and once that sort of you know when you when you talk about strategic bombers which they
[01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:12.770]  which the the russians have already moved to four operating bases and they start to strategically
[01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:18.210]  move them around to protect them you know as a security measure we know that they that the
[01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:26.290]  russian submarine fleet uh is inside of the uh the the uh the black sea and uh and probably in
[01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:31.090]  parts of uh of the mediterranean and i can tell you one other piece there that somebody one of
[01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:36.770]  the media experts talks about was you know there was russian submarines spotted in the area where
[01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:43.490]  the north stream pipeline was uh was blown up you know excuse my irish you know to your audience but
[01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:49.490]  that is total bullshit the russian the russian submarine fleet up in the baltic seas there
[01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:56.130]  they they are they are so secret and uh they know how to sneak in and out of there because they know
[01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:59.090]  they're they know they're always being tracked in and out of there so they're not going to do
[01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:05.890]  something as dumb as uh what we are trying to say that they did just like i think one of the guys
[01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:10.050]  from your show one of your members of your team said all they gotta do is just turn the spigot off
[01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:13.970]  and and once they do that you know because they're not suffering from it it's going to
[01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:19.250]  be europe that suffers from it so so there's there's so many things to unpackage here but
[01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:24.930]  one of the things i want to i want to start with is i want to start with uh because this is the
[01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:29.570]  here and now and you know this show on a saturday you do these shows on saturday sometimes and
[01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:36.450]  they're they're so important i mean and and this particular one because of what happened yesterday
[01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:42.050]  with this silicon valley bank so let's just spend a little bit i'm not a i'm not an economic
[01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:51.250]  expert but i i have i have enough expertise in financial warfare right and then the the idea of
[01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:58.290]  of what we do with uh with our country and how we manipulate the the various things going on
[01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:03.970]  our country and i i clearly paid very close attention in 2008 to the collapse and like i
[01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:08.770]  said i joked with you guys off camera before we came on about you know you have some real
[01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:14.050]  experts with you but i really think that people need to understand a couple things this is this
[01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:19.730]  is mike plin talking number one i actually think everybody needs to take a step back and take a
[01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:27.650]  deep breath and i mean take a deep breath and you know to a degree i want to see how this particular
[01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:32.130]  administration responds to this because the way that the obama administration responded to
[01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:39.090]  um the 2008 collapse was they basically they basically paid everybody off and they let
[01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:46.690]  everybody off okay and right now like just as an example the ceo the cfo and the cmo i guess the
[01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:50.930]  chief management officer the chief financial officer and the chief executive officer for
[01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:57.570]  silicon valley bank they were selling their stock within you know within only a last couple of weeks
[01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:03.650]  i understand and maybe at last couple of months those three days before the head of the arrested
[01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:07.730]  they ought to be arrested they ought to be thrown in the in the same clink that we're keeping these
[01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:12.850]  poor j6ers in that's what they ought to do right now throw them in the throw them in jail let them
[01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:18.850]  go get their high price lawyers and try to uh and try to you know try to get get them out on on bail
[01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:24.850]  or bond but those three people if they did that and then they allowed their customers you know
[01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:29.809]  and they're we're talking the numbers that i'm hearing the numbers that i'm here and i'm gonna
[01:16:29.809 --> 01:16:35.410]  i'm gonna get us back to where i want people to take a step back because because i you know if
[01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:40.290]  people all of a sudden show up monday or tuesday and start to freak out it's not going to help any
[01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:45.730]  of us what i want to do is i want to put pressure we need to put pressure on this administration
[01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:49.330]  right now and by putting pressure on this administration we're putting pressure on the
[01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:53.650]  deep state we're putting pressure on the the unelected bureaucrats we're putting pressure on
[01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:58.770]  the institutions that handle this economic situation this economic crisis that we are
[01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:04.210]  going through we're not in a military crisis right now you know and again we can we can spend a
[01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:08.290]  little bit of time on on the military side because i do believe that we need to talk about what's
[01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:12.530]  happening in europe we need to talk about what's happening in the south china sea we need to talk
[01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:17.570]  about what's happening in north korea but right now the the american people like i'll tell you i
[01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:22.130]  just i you know i'm one of these guys that goes around the streets here in my own hometown and
[01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:27.970]  and i'm just i'm in a regular hometown of america i'm down in florida but i i'm asking people so
[01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:31.250]  what do you think what do you think what do you think i'm at the gas station i'm at the you know
[01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:36.050]  the wawa station i'm at a i'm at a 7-eleven i went into an office to go talk to some other people
[01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:43.330]  today and i met and just asked so i'm trying to get a just a basic feel a anecdotal feel if uh if
[01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:47.330]  nothing else what do you believe and they're all talking to me about how they're going to go take
[01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:53.650]  their money out of the bank i'm like let's wait a second let's just wait and see come monday tuesday
[01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:59.170]  wednesday because we're all going to be in this together and what i want is i want the the exposure
[01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:06.210]  because the way we beat this globalist elite crowd the way we beat the deep state is we continue to
[01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:11.330]  expose them i mean one of the one of the beauties of info wars and one of the one of the the the
[01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:17.250]  great the greatness of your show and you in particular and you know and i get all kinds of
[01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:23.730]  grief or say even saying that alex but the what the great thing is is is you expose things good
[01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:32.130]  bad or ugly you expose things and that's how you you you know that's how we we bring evil out into
[01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:36.770]  the into the light right well general flan let me just back you up because we didn't talk before
[01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:40.370]  he came on today we haven't talked in you know months in person but we're talking here live on
[01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:46.770]  air one of my notes was to ask flint how do we how do we not let them stampede us into bank runs
[01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:50.210]  because they could have propped this one bank up i said that you weren't watching probably the
[01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:54.450]  start of the last hour i said right they could have propped this one up they're letting this
[01:18:54.450 --> 01:19:00.450]  create a domino and create fear to bring in their whole new system so how do we thread that needle
[01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:05.890]  and you already addressed that before i asked it yeah so okay so and really what you're talking
[01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:11.809]  about is you're talking about and for the people that don't know so to bring it to a source i want
[01:19:11.809 --> 01:19:18.770]  people to go read executive order one four zero six seven executive order one four zero six seven
[01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:27.250]  signed by uh uncle joe the eighth of march of 2022 and it went into effect 13 december 2022 so just
[01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:33.250]  this past december and there are already uh corporations and elements of our u.s government
[01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:38.130]  that are already beta testing what's called central bank digital currency central bank
[01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:43.809]  digital currency that's what that executive order is all about now the central bank digital currency
[01:19:43.809 --> 01:19:50.130]  there you go and the central bank digital currency is already a global system so there's
[01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:57.570]  it's already in effect so to speak the chinese use it they use this you know their e yuan uh system
[01:19:57.570 --> 01:20:02.690]  but this is a way to control whether or not you can spend the money that you actually earn
[01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:08.930]  so you know and i'll just give a basic example of how far this could go so you could go down to the
[01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:15.650]  gas station to fill up fill up your car a second time in a month and you go to you put your card
[01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:21.490]  into the gas pump there and the gas pump comes back and says denied and the reason is that is
[01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:26.850]  not because you don't have money in the bank it's because the this this environmentalist crowd this
[01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:33.090]  this nazi common commune social whatever this you know and i say communist you know and the
[01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:36.530]  hardcore of them are marxists and there are marxists and the white house it's a cult of
[01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:43.010]  power well it's there are marxists in in in the world economic forum there are marxists in the
[01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:46.770]  intelligence community and there are marxists in the department of defense and the department of
[01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:52.130]  state especially the department of state and and one other element there because i do want to
[01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:56.370]  maybe spend you know a few minutes talking about the department of just us or the department of
[01:20:56.370 --> 01:21:01.170]  injustice however you want to call it but this central bank digital currency alex and i know you
[01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:07.170]  you have spoken about this at times many others in the media they know the the the i would say
[01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:12.050]  others who wouldn't touch this in the past are now starting to talk about this the mainstream media
[01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:17.410]  is not talking about it they won't talk about it but because they're they're all in but they but
[01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:22.530]  the other the other uh you know fox i think uh you know there's been a one or two other guests
[01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:27.570]  there that have talked about it i know that glenn beck has talked about it but only recently
[01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:31.809]  and i would say glenn probably in the last couple months this is something that i know you've been
[01:21:31.809 --> 01:21:35.970]  talking quite a bit about and i know i've been talking about this for the last couple of years
[01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:43.090]  because once you control the the economic system you know the global economic system where where
[01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:49.330]  now the the u.s currency uh is no longer the currency of choice for for global trade around
[01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:54.130]  the world because right now the u.s currency is the is the currency of choice for global trade
[01:21:54.850 --> 01:22:01.650]  and the uh english language is the language of choice for global trade so that has been shifting
[01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:06.450]  now how do we so how do we defeat it well you know what's going to have to happen this is really to
[01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:11.410]  to the people right back to the people of not only your audience but of this country
[01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:17.570]  a couple of states right now are putting into into uh bills and i know that there's going to
[01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:21.330]  be at least one or two states that are going to have it as law where you're where they're not
[01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:28.930]  going to accept this form of currency so so the way to fight it back is expose it understand it
[01:22:28.930 --> 01:22:31.809]  make sure that we're talking about it and make sure that we're talking about it in the right
[01:22:31.809 --> 01:22:36.370]  in the you know with the right facts the right formats the right process the right ideas and
[01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:41.490]  then we have to talk about how do we how do we stop how do we block and tackle because will it
[01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:46.210]  last forever i don't know i don't know how long we can last in in this battle but in this particular
[01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:53.170]  battle we can block and tackle a lot by making sure that we push not only uh those those in
[01:22:53.170 --> 01:22:58.210]  washington dc but i i kind of i've said a lot of times quit worrying about them if you can't worry
[01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:02.370]  about them worry about what you can do at your local level and definitely worry about what you
[01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:07.090]  can do at your state level so i know of a couple of states oklahoma is one of them who has who has
[01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:11.970]  got a bill going into their uh into their governor and once that happens and it's going to happen
[01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:16.450]  here pretty soon because because this transition is not going to happen on monday and that's my
[01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:20.850]  point about taking a deep breath not going to happen on monday this is going to happen over
[01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:25.730]  a period of time they are trying to move it faster they are trying to now i'm talking about
[01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:32.850]  the chinese in in coordination with the world bank and in coordination with claus schwab and team at
[01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:38.210]  the world economic and general let's quantify that in layman's terms i agree there's a giant alliance
[01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:42.610]  of traders in our government the majority at the top who are chai common want to end the dollar
[01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:47.410]  they're using this bank fear and they've said and biden on wednesday put out his new plan
[01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:51.970]  for a central bank digital currency that removes the english language from the communication
[01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:56.450]  which removes the dollar and makes it all digital when right now communications in english which is
[01:23:56.450 --> 01:24:01.010]  a human intelligence program what you're saying is very sophisticated i don't want to be lost on
[01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:06.130]  people we don't want them to stampede us with these bank runs into accepting the central bank
[01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:11.890]  digital currencies we want to prosecute the people that actually did this and control the contagion
[01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:17.410]  yeah so and now i'm speaking to the american people so if the american people all of a sudden
[01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:22.690]  go on a bank run then they then this government is going to turn right around and go see everybody's
[01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:26.930]  afraid we have to transition okay and this is what we're going to do and here's our plan and
[01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:32.450]  we've already got it in place you know we it's just like covid folks i mean some of the patents
[01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:37.809]  for covid were back in 2015 some of the stuff that that was developed in order to be ready
[01:24:37.809 --> 01:24:43.809]  and when they wanted it to use it which was in early 2020 late night 2019 early 2020 the patents
[01:24:43.809 --> 01:24:48.450]  for some of that stuff was back in 2015 you can't have a pad patent doesn't take you know it takes
[01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:54.290]  like 10 years to get a pad they already had them so now they already have this this idea in place
[01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:58.770]  i just mentioned the executive order they're already doing some some what we call beta testing
[01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:05.730]  so if the american people can remain rock steady and i mean remain rock steady and place demands
[01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:11.010]  be prepared play start placing demands i'm gonna tell you if we start to raise our voices up and
[01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:15.410]  we raise them through shows like info wars we raise them through some of these other people
[01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:20.530]  that are actually now getting it and now talking about it believe me that there i agree so what are
[01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:26.450]  the demands we don't want the fdic deposit or insurance corporation is already saying this to
[01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:32.770]  pay people above 250 000 in central bank digital currency they're already rolling that out we have
[01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:39.490]  to say no we have to pay it back uh via the treasury so so no no no no central bank digital
[01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:47.490]  currency response to this crisis yeah i mean so this this government our government can they can
[01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:54.930]  use they can use uh bonds they can use gold they can use silver they can back everything right now
[01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:59.410]  without saying we're going to go to a you know some type of digital currency right
[01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:05.330]  we're going to accept a global system which is total bullshit i mean it is i'm you know and i'm
[01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:12.290]  sorry it is total bullshit it is and so so what the other thing is so that's number one the second
[01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:19.490]  thing is we must we must demand accountability and i want to see i want to see these that ceo
[01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:25.730]  that cfo that cmo these people have to be held to account they must be brought in because he
[01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:29.890]  knew it was coming he jerked his money out hey they knew it was coming and there's many more
[01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:33.970]  those are just three that have popped up on the screen right that was those are just three that
[01:26:33.970 --> 01:26:38.050]  have popped up on the screen you know that are they're going to be the faces of this thing but
[01:26:38.050 --> 01:26:43.730]  there's many many more faces and names and so what we have to do is look at look at the totality of
[01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:48.530]  this and let's not have any bailouts if this government starts to bail things out that means
[01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:54.930]  that that means that that we probably have lost this particular battle folks okay that's why i
[01:26:54.930 --> 01:27:00.050]  say it's like you know when somebody early on we have something in the military called rules of
[01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:04.930]  engagement and it comes it comes out of the very famous phrase you know don't shoot until you see
[01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:09.010]  the whites of their eyes right and there's a ranger manual and there's all this kind of stuff
[01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:13.250]  about rules of engagement on the battlefield well i'm giving you a rule of engagement that rule of
[01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:20.210]  engagement is stay steady and let's let's see let's see what this enemy is about to to attempt
[01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:26.850]  to do and even when that happens stay steady because what will happen is they will take total
[01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:32.930]  control of our lives our government so let's just jump for a second too because that's that's
[01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:37.570]  financial and you know unless you want to jump in on add anything else let's go to the health side
[01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:46.210]  because in the in the in december they had what's called the g20 summit and in this particular uh g20
[01:27:46.210 --> 01:27:51.809]  summit there was only g19 because russia decided to give them the you know the russian salute and not
[01:27:51.809 --> 01:27:58.610]  show up and there's a reason why one of the main reasons was because the keynote speaker at the g20
[01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:02.530]  summit which is a big deal and i don't expect your audience to have paid too much attention to it but
[01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:07.170]  the keynote speaker there was claus schwab you know here claus schwab this is a real council
[01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:15.330]  of global governance this is key yes this is key and so when we talk about so what is there what
[01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:20.050]  is their cabinet right what does their staff look like well their staff is somebody like a like a
[01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:25.809]  claus schwab their their global staff looks like the world bank the world health organization the
[01:28:25.809 --> 01:28:31.490]  world trade organization international monetary fund organizations like the united nations
[01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:37.010]  organizations like the european union now all those people in the media will go oh this is all
[01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:40.930]  blowing these you know that's that's their tools of state power they don't have world government
[01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:49.650]  summits and that is how they function so so the world health organization claus schwab g20 summit
[01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:55.170]  claus schwab during the during the g20 summit back in december so only a couple of months ago
[01:28:55.170 --> 01:29:00.050]  he made this you know this big statement about the direction that the world needs to take he was
[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:05.650]  he was almost like it like a finger in their chest of the most powerful countries in the
[01:29:05.650 --> 01:29:11.330]  world this is one of the reasons why why the russians didn't go because putin and and i because
[01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:17.650]  i do want to touch on elon musk here in a little bit putin has has made a decision a very conscious
[01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:23.090]  decision and he's no longer going to be part of this idea of the world economic forum he's just
[01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:29.090]  he's done with it he's done with it and he's done with it because he sees that his civil his you
[01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:34.290]  know that russian society is threatened but one of the things that came out of this bali summit
[01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:41.170]  and our government just did a just did a little a little quiet kind of signatory of it is this world
[01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:47.330]  health organization global vaccination card okay so all those nations that attended the
[01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:53.570]  g19 summit they all signed off on we're going to have a global vaccination identification card so
[01:29:53.570 --> 01:30:00.130]  what does that mean what does that mean is that is that a stamp on your passport is it a is it a
[01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:06.210]  is it a plastic card that every single human being on the planet has to carry around and so if i want
[01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:11.010]  to travel to a state let's say i'm in the united states and i'm i want to travel to a blue state
[01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:16.610]  but i want to travel to a state that's currently controlled by uh by a democratic governor democratic
[01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:20.690]  leadership and let's just take the state of michigan as an example so if i want to go into
[01:30:20.690 --> 01:30:25.490]  michigan is michigan gonna now stop me or stop me from buying products or stop me from visiting
[01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:30.770]  my relatives in michigan or my relatives in whatever state that is because i can't cross
[01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:35.330]  the border or i because i don't have my full vaccination and what i'm telling you folks
[01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:40.450]  is don't get that damn vaccination don't do it and so now i'm going to be you know labeled again
[01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:46.930]  a vax denier i'm telling you there's no there's or there's very very few people in your audience
[01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:51.490]  and you have millions across the world that listen to you there's very few people that have
[01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:57.889]  had as many vaccinations or shots stuck in their arms or their rear ends as i have i have a i have
[01:30:57.889 --> 01:31:05.090]  a you know a list of shot i've shot record that goes probably 12 feet long so i'm not denying
[01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:13.010]  vaccinations what i deny what i'm in against is i'm against this this murder weapon that we have
[01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:18.690]  called uh these these uh these vaccinations that these quote unquote vaccinations these jabs that
[01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:24.530]  they've been giving everybody i mean it's undeniable it is undeniable so i don't want to
[01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:28.690]  argue you know that particular well that's a whole nother subject i want to get to that because that's
[01:31:28.690 --> 01:31:33.570]  a whole right what about the total vindication of all of us from the beginning three years ago
[01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:37.570]  it's all come out it doesn't work it hurts people you got the former head of the cdc coming out
[01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:41.250]  saying it's gain of function bouncy and all them are running it's a gain of function which means
[01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:46.610]  a gain of function means weaponization weaponization so one of the commands is so people
[01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:52.130]  know you know i'm not just some guy yapping one of the subordinate commands that i had was the
[01:31:52.130 --> 01:32:00.210]  national intelligence medical command nimc and it's up and it's on the east coast okay and one
[01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:05.170]  of the one of the missions of them so i i went and visited these folks because they were they
[01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:09.809]  were a subordinate command of mine they were they were an organization that i was responsible for
[01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:14.450]  and one of the things that they were responsible for was examining biological
[01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:21.010]  capabilities of other countries and how they would use them to weaponize them so so i have
[01:32:21.010 --> 01:32:27.809]  that that background as well as other background on just an intelligence aspects of my life that i
[01:32:27.809 --> 01:32:34.690]  got involved in that look at nuclear chemical radiological and biological warfare okay so
[01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:41.889]  i have a fair background in this uh more than i want to have when we say gain of function and
[01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:47.250]  when we talk about what what was happening between different labs right in in the different uh
[01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:52.130]  undergraduate and graduate level programs here upenn or pennsylvania harvard was doing some
[01:32:52.130 --> 01:32:57.970]  stuff mit's been doing some stuff and there's been there's been other uh uh you know universities
[01:32:57.970 --> 01:33:02.130]  particularly down north carolina that have been doing some things in coordination with
[01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:08.130]  the chinese government so so we can't that's not deniable anymore and we have people that
[01:33:08.130 --> 01:33:15.010]  must be held accountable so the the world health organization is imposing a global vaccination
[01:33:15.889 --> 01:33:21.490]  card our government is all for this this digital central bank digital currency our government is
[01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:29.809]  all for this so this is why i say we have to push back so much when i tell people they go they say
[01:33:29.809 --> 01:33:33.650]  to me what what should i do what can i do so i don't want you to go do a run on the bank i don't
[01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:37.090]  want you to go take a vaccine i don't want you know i don't want you to go run out and say i
[01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:42.290]  gotta go get a vaccine because somebody says we have the you know an h5n1 virus now breaking out
[01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:47.090]  in west africa and it's gonna you know jump over the ocean to the united states right now i mean
[01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:53.809]  they're gonna they're gonna try to put fear into us okay and and you said a little bit in the in
[01:33:53.809 --> 01:34:00.850]  the tail end of your last segment one of the things that they fear and and they being this
[01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:07.330]  globalist elite they fear what they cannot control and so for your audience you're listening to
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:12.610]  somebody that they cannot control and now now how would how might they deal with me maybe they'll
[01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:19.170]  just go boom and i'm done i've had enough threats in my life i you know i know what sacrifice can be
[01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:26.130]  and i know what the sacrifice is to a to a degree because i've experienced uh you know combat
[01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:30.530]  operations and such i i will tell you that you know we have people that have given their lives
[01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:35.250]  for this country you know over the years of the the history throughout the history of this country
[01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:39.010]  and so we have to understand that the point is generally to interrupt you you've made the
[01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:43.889]  commitment and people need to make the commitment that if you submit to this things are far worse
[01:34:43.889 --> 01:34:47.490]  the children deserve to stand up we gotta take action and listen you're on fire day you're
[01:34:47.490 --> 01:34:52.610]  always on fire but i've never seen you like on like this this is amazing well i'm not you know
[01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:59.809]  i mean i want a lot of stuff but i hope you'll do an overview because i agree with you that
[01:34:59.809 --> 01:35:04.770]  the globalists set up china as their laboratory control it was then used to infiltrate us now it's
[01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:08.610]  taking over the globalists to a certain extent there's a little bit of our military and government
[01:35:08.610 --> 01:35:14.130]  waking up but i'd say that's a minority i agree with you who was the guy that went to trump before
[01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:20.450]  that went to obama and they admit was responsible for the pivot towards china so you warned you're
[01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:24.530]  the guy they admit even the establishment does that was right about china years before they
[01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:28.530]  double crossed us that warned the globalists you're not as a traitor you're like warning the
[01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:33.889]  government which was run by globalists they know you were right you tried to get them to stand up
[01:35:33.889 --> 01:35:39.410]  you've been vindicated long before trump got in and so you're a world expert on china and their
[01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:46.050]  hundred-year plan that we're now 60 years into so if you please please in the time you talk about
[01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:50.290]  the overview the the hundred thousand foot view because i think that's critical to understand
[01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:56.130]  what's happening yeah so so there is a there is a no kidding hundred-year plan that the Chinese have
[01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:04.370]  had started by Mao Zedong you know and and and now with with Xi who's leading china now he's only the
[01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:10.850]  he's only the really the sixth leader that they've had in in that 60 years right so they keep these
[01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:16.290]  guys you know they're they have leaders in there for a long time and and so they're able to do
[01:36:16.290 --> 01:36:26.050]  things as a dictatorship as a communist dictatorship to their society to move their economy to move
[01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:33.490]  their people and to and to take things and do them over a longer period of time instead of
[01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:39.250]  the madness that we you know that we currently go through with with back and forth back and forth
[01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:44.770]  with our with the you know everybody's you know democrats come in and they're they're you know
[01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:48.450]  they're going after the republicans republicans come in they're going after the democrats i mean
[01:36:48.450 --> 01:36:54.930]  we have got to stop because we right now we're in a we're in a crisis period and the and the Chinese
[01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:59.570]  and you might have shown it either a little while ago or on the on an earlier clip where you showed
[01:36:59.570 --> 01:37:05.650]  the south china sea so let's talk first of all alliances okay because i think this is really
[01:37:05.650 --> 01:37:12.130]  important one of the things that's part of the hundred year war for the Chinese is to put put
[01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:19.010]  is to divide those who are allied with the United States of America divide those alliances and then
[01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:25.570]  build trust with the other side right so divide us from some partner that we had and then and then
[01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:31.410]  they become their part their new partner right so how do they do that they do that very very shrewdly
[01:37:31.410 --> 01:37:37.250]  they do that over time and they do that uh they've done that economically you know i i don't want to
[01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:42.610]  get into too much detail about the belton road initiative which is a which is a huge economic
[01:37:42.610 --> 01:37:48.850]  plan it goes all the way from really from the south china sea the the east china sea uh from
[01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:54.050]  the you know the the port city and doesn't the ukraine war energize the belton road big time
[01:37:54.690 --> 01:37:59.889]  and bingo so so the so the northern part of that goes all the way into europe it actually goes
[01:37:59.889 --> 01:38:04.130]  through through ukraine it goes all the way into europe and when i say into europe not just the
[01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:08.850]  mainland but it also goes into places like london and then you have the southern these are these are
[01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:14.210]  big deals and and these are things that the Chinese have been putting together for a long time
[01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:19.410]  okay a long time and now they're moving it much faster so the so the southern route from china
[01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:24.610]  yeah you have a great picture up there the southern route is really a a a blue water route
[01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:31.330]  but then it connects into uh it connects into africa and it actually now that those those
[01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:35.889]  blue lines now go all the way around africa and they tie into places like nigeria and the west
[01:38:35.889 --> 01:38:41.090]  coast of africa which are filled with resources filled with commodities that the chinese need
[01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:46.290]  to sustain their own people right now one of the key points here one of the big connectors because
[01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:52.290]  you have a beautiful map up there right now that line that goes from the arabian sea and it goes
[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:58.370]  up through the suit you know the red sea into the suez canal and into the mediterranean okay that's
[01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:05.410]  a big big deal the united states of america we built the suez canal you know decades ago right
[01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:10.930]  we built it well guess who built a second suez canal and and you know nobody will talk about
[01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:15.490]  this but the chinese went up there years ago during the obama administration and they actually built
[01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:22.530]  a second suez canal there is a second canal there with locks that allow allow ships to go up and up
[01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:28.210]  and through that that very critical choke point into the mediterranean so so that's those are
[01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:34.050]  alliances in order for the china the chinese to gain a foothold is they had to break alliances
[01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:38.850]  away from the united states and they had to then gain those alliances and they did that through
[01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:43.250]  africa they've done that through the middle east they've done that through europe in a in a huge
[01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:50.370]  way and and of course the two big alliances and one that just recently came starting to to show
[01:39:51.889 --> 01:39:56.770]  its skin so to speak there's a new alliance that's starting to grow and that's the alliance
[01:39:56.770 --> 01:40:02.690]  this is a dangerous one for us the alliance between uh china and the south and saudi arabia
[01:40:02.690 --> 01:40:06.690]  okay and i was going to ask you that question that's in my list and saudi arabia suddenly
[01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:13.010]  making an alliance with iran yeah so yes so now so you have these alliance these are you know
[01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:18.690]  remember you're right i mean the enemy of my enemy is my friend so china and saudi arabia just
[01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:25.809]  affected really an economic alliance that's not good for us china and russia already have
[01:40:25.809 --> 01:40:31.250]  an economic alliance china and iran have an economic alliance russia and iran have an
[01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:38.210]  economic alliance russia and many parts of south of southwest asia which is basically the arabian
[01:40:38.210 --> 01:40:44.850]  peninsula have economic alliances many of the north african countries have economic alliances
[01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:51.490]  hell the chinese just built the largest mosque in the world in uh on the on the coastline of algiers
[01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:59.809]  in algiers i actually saw i was i actually visited there years ago on a military uh visit
[01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:04.530]  and i said who the who the hell is building this thing it's giant it's giant it's a giant
[01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:10.210]  mosque and they told me the chinese and i said really and that was that was almost 10 years ago
[01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:16.370]  alex so so the chinese have been very shrewdly and they've been doing this over time so let me do a
[01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:22.370]  quick minute on what's called the bricks because this has to do with economic conditions it has to
[01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:28.130]  do with alliances and it has to do with everything else going on globally uh particularly when we
[01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:32.850]  talk about world war iii which we are we are smack dab in the middle of world war iii right now
[01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:42.290]  so the bricks brazil russia india china and south africa those five nations have have created a a
[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:48.610]  basically a coordinating body an economic coordinating body for trade and such there you
[01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:53.170]  go beautiful and those four nations right there leave that picture up those four nations right
[01:41:53.170 --> 01:42:01.410]  there they represent 47 percent of the global population so half the damn planet is represented
[01:42:01.410 --> 01:42:09.490]  in those people right those five leaders right there right brazil russia india china and uh and
[01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:16.370]  south africa there have been another i would just say another 10 countries that have recently
[01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:24.050]  moved shifted over to join these this element this bricks element one of the more important
[01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:28.050]  countries that i paid attention to is which way the saudi's were going and why why is that
[01:42:28.050 --> 01:42:34.610]  important because in the world of of the in the arab world you know the the egyptians have a
[01:42:34.610 --> 01:42:40.690]  historic leadership role and i wish uh al-sisi would play a bigger role and he he does and i and
[01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:46.850]  i i have given al-sisi the leader of egypt a lot of credit but the saudi's have a have an even
[01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:52.050]  greater role particularly now with the way that they're they're with the way that they exist in
[01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:59.570]  the world their access to the old petro dollars their uh ability and their not only their their
[01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:04.370]  the the relationship that they have within the arab world sort of sort of the ideological
[01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:10.450]  underpinnings but they also have a critical geostrategic position on the planet okay so
[01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:15.970]  where they sit arabian sea persian gulf red sea as i as i mentioned as you showed in that other
[01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:23.410]  that other map so there's been a new move by the saudi's to align with uh with china so when that
[01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:27.410]  happens when that happens now we're talking about not just the saudi's but there's a couple of other
[01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:33.889]  nations venezuela's one iran we are we already mentioned and there's a couple of others this
[01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:41.650]  these couple of other nations with the bricks they now represent about 75 of the planet and
[01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:48.370]  all of this has happened so when i say 100 years right so there's been this this has been going on
[01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:55.090]  for decades and at the same time there's been this infiltration into our our body like a cancer
[01:43:55.090 --> 01:44:00.770]  right i mean our body like is like a is is right now has a cancer like in our education system in
[01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:05.650]  our in our in you know a lot of our institutions our department of justice right so there's a
[01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:11.570]  cancer in there and that cancer is part and parcel to the infiltration of of people in the democratic
[01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:18.050]  socialist party of america in the communist party of america and how they are how they are influenced
[01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:24.930]  and supported by frankly the ccp the ccp i i believe made a very conscious decision back in
[01:44:24.930 --> 01:44:30.370]  the late 80s and and the uh in the early 90s that the tail end of the cold war when it looked like
[01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:36.450]  when russia was basically the loser in the cold war china made a big decision to basically that
[01:44:36.450 --> 01:44:43.010]  they were going to rise they that they then took that as their opportunity to say now is our chance
[01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:50.130]  and and i could go through so many examples that are that are publicly available examples of how
[01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:56.850]  the chinese have infiltrated every single institution of our of our society since the mid
[01:44:56.850 --> 01:45:04.210]  90s okay and in particular our education system and they started at the highest level of graduate
[01:45:04.210 --> 01:45:10.130]  degrees and undergraduate degrees to the tune of no less than 100 000 a year and they got they got
[01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:15.650]  up to at least 500 000 a year sure and if we look at the 500 000 if we look at the ideology general
[01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:20.450]  flinn of the left it's very malice how they're executing attacks against the u.s
[01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:28.530]  so there's a you know and and uh there's a uh you know different types of communism right there's
[01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:34.370]  the chinese version russia has a has a version america is going to be imposed if we're not smart
[01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:41.970]  there you go if we're not smart um you know there is a there is an imposition of a type of socialism
[01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:46.930]  being brought into america's society and frankly because people have asked me well jesus you know
[01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:51.330]  these people are already there they already have power they're already wealthy what the hell more
[01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:56.210]  do they want they want more power particularly power and they want more wealth and they want
[01:45:56.210 --> 01:46:03.170]  your wealth so this is why we have to continue and again i want people to you know like me i mean i'm
[01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:08.290]  i'm and i appreciate your team uh and the patience that you guys have had with me you know coming on
[01:46:08.290 --> 01:46:14.050]  today but this is important i mean this is a you know this is exhausting and alex you know how
[01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:18.610]  exhausting this can be this is exhausting and i want your because i'm being brutally honest with
[01:46:18.610 --> 01:46:23.970]  your with you your audience and and anybody else that listens to this this is exhausting but we
[01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:30.610]  have to do this i do what i do you do what you do those people that are sitting in hometown usa
[01:46:30.610 --> 01:46:34.930]  right now that are listening to this or that will see this in the next couple of days i want you to
[01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:41.330]  start thinking about what more can you do what more can you do and i'm telling you i attended
[01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:47.490]  because i do stuff locally because i want to lead by example so i attended a a hospital a community
[01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:52.050]  hospital board meeting because it just so happens that in the county that i live in there's only two
[01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:56.050]  in this in the state of uh only two county hospitals in the state of florida that are
[01:46:56.050 --> 01:47:01.250]  owned by the taxpayers i happen to live in one of those counties so we we tried to fill the
[01:47:01.809 --> 01:47:05.970]  the hearing up when they were trying to tell us about how they you know everything's wonderful
[01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:10.130]  and there's no problems here folks nothing to see here you know nothing under the carpet right
[01:47:10.130 --> 01:47:15.090]  and but and we know that people went in there and died and the hospital made a ton of money
[01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:19.809]  we're going to continue to put pressure at the local level on that hospital that's just that's
[01:47:19.809 --> 01:47:25.410]  the sarasota memorial hospital i was about to ask you what are solutions you're saying get informed
[01:47:25.410 --> 01:47:29.490]  locally engaged because that's what the war is happening and i want to have a few other issues
[01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:33.650]  the time we have left general flickers you've done a great job so much to cover here but but
[01:47:33.650 --> 01:47:40.770]  but bottom line how do we quantify this we we know that the global the angle american establishment
[01:47:40.770 --> 01:47:44.530]  allied with china in 49 they gave them all the rarest minerals they gave them all the jobs they
[01:47:44.530 --> 01:47:49.889]  gave them internal tariffs against america they set them up we know that you briefed obama and
[01:47:49.889 --> 01:47:55.250]  others and told the truth and said china's about to take over they're gonna double cross you you
[01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:59.730]  were proven right you were vindicated it's why they're so scared of you so there's kind of a
[01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:04.690]  schizophrenic thing with the elite where they've invested in china they're in bed with china but
[01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:10.210]  china's now pushing them around how do we get western elites that are even still globalist
[01:48:10.210 --> 01:48:14.850]  to finally get the american people aren't the enemy get off our backs let's deal with china
[01:48:14.850 --> 01:48:19.170]  but as you said they have this communist inclination there's so much chicom influence
[01:48:19.809 --> 01:48:23.970]  hollywood is literally trying to tear the country apart we know four of the big six
[01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:30.450]  hollywood uh big production houses are owned by the chicoms how do we get off the chinese communist
[01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:38.450]  poison okay so part of this is what you know again because you talked about it earlier in your
[01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:44.850]  previous segment i i really appreciate that there is a time to pray and there's a time to stand
[01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:49.970]  okay so doesn't it doesn't mean that you can't pray while you're standing but there now is the
[01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:56.130]  time to stand and that time and when i say stand i mean i want people and this is everybody and
[01:48:56.130 --> 01:49:02.610]  there's a you know i'm trying to hit a target of people in this country that represent probably
[01:49:02.610 --> 01:49:08.370]  50 million people that that are sort of left of center and they look at everything and they go
[01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:15.490]  this is politics as usual this is not politics as usual this is this is the the existence of
[01:49:15.490 --> 01:49:21.970]  america as we know it is at risk we are in a moment of peril we are in a moment of historic
[01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:28.290]  peril so if you you know like people i ask if you can't do anything else say a prayer if you if you
[01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:34.290]  if you can pray you don't pray but if you can't do anything other than that and maybe or maybe what
[01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:39.330]  you can do is you you know you can send money into these different organizations that are fighting
[01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:44.530]  for us right fighting for for those that are that can't that don't want to put their
[01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:49.570]  their head into the breach right that don't want to jump over the wall and say follow me i mean
[01:49:49.570 --> 01:49:55.090]  there's going to be those of us and frankly we'll never outspend the the enemy in this case but we
[01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:59.570]  but we certainly can use the help so i i just i throw that out there because that's important
[01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:03.170]  that's a that's an important aspect of being able to do the things that we need to do
[01:50:03.809 --> 01:50:09.889]  the third thing is is i want people to start and i want them to take a you know let 24 hours sink
[01:50:09.889 --> 01:50:14.530]  in and start to think you know talk to your neighbor talk to your family and start to think
[01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:19.570]  about what more can you do right where you're at maybe you pick up you know you pick up the
[01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:24.610]  telephone you get on your phone you start calling you start email i mean go to these meetings don't
[01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:29.490]  sit there and say ah it's just all baloney now those politicians are all corrupt crooked and
[01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:33.970]  corrupt they're there because we put them there and we have to change that we have to change that
[01:50:33.970 --> 01:50:39.570]  we have to go and get involved i'm i have talked to so many people over these last couple years
[01:50:39.570 --> 01:50:44.210]  and i say to them why aren't you running because they're telling me how what needs to be fixed and
[01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:47.730]  this you know this and that and they're and i'm looking at it and i'm saying geez you're a
[01:50:47.730 --> 01:50:51.970]  business per you're a businessman businesswoman why don't you get in there and run and and i have
[01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:57.010]  been able to convince a fair number of them to run for school boards to run for county commissioners
[01:50:57.010 --> 01:51:02.610]  to change the nature of the kinds of things that we are up against because i want i want our federal
[01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:07.889]  government to know that we the people we're not going to put up with it when they start to impose
[01:51:07.889 --> 01:51:12.690]  things they're going to feel a tension coming from we the people and they need to feel that
[01:51:12.690 --> 01:51:16.930]  tension they need to feel that in military parlance general that in military parlance
[01:51:16.930 --> 01:51:21.490]  you're explaining everything is boots on the ground everything is every square mile
[01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:24.770]  and so they'll never get away with this general public's mobilized
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:54.980]  And I'm telling you, you know, what would I like? I would like to know this would be done peacefully. I would like to pick a date on the wall sometime in the next couple of months. Maybe it's a 4th of July because it's a it's a good date. Maybe it's a flag day or maybe it's Memorial Day and say I want rallies at all 50 state capitals. I want I want is thousands and thousands of people to go rally and just basically say we've had enough, you know, fix these problems. But now that I
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:52:24.980]  And so I say that I say that because this is what they tried to do. That's why the January 6th happened, because they wanted to put the fear of God into every single red blooded American out there that ever felt like they wanted to just go to the nation's capital and see it and peacefully protest. You know, and they went around trying to arrest grandmas. Right. I mean, this is insane. So so they put that they did that purposely. So these kinds of things, like I just said, won't happen. But if we go there and we do that, people are going to realize and the governors we have still
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:54.980]  I think I think 26 Republican governors. I mean, none of these Republican governors. I mean, some some I shouldn't say none, but but few of them are really not changing the narrative on our elections. They really aren't. I mean, they're starting to push some of these systems out and stuff like that. But the bigger the bigger issue is we we have to create tension at the bottom to those at the top. And that when I say those at the top, the top might be county commissioners. The top might be, you know, clearly are your state
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:53:24.980]  legislatures who are probably in some cases, some of the people that are going to put the mass on the ground with the issues and the info. I totally agree. General, total genius interview today. We've only got like 15 minutes left. Let me then move into some of the areas listeners really want to know about. You've got this incredible information as a former top army general, a guy that actually ran things. A lot of the generals just kind of sit around. You were a doer and a guy that actually warned the world about China. We got Obama to recognize it and actually change U.S. policy. That's
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:54.980]  a huge thing you did right there. That's why they respected you so much because you predicted they would double cross and they did. You did it as a loyal American, even though the globalists thought they controlled China. They literally feared you because you were over the horizon seeing it. What about Russia? Where do you see that going back moot falling to the Russians? Sure, the Russians have lost hundreds of thousands are fighting NATO, but they keep pouring more in the threat escalation ladder keeps going up and up and up and up. You've got Zelensky and you've got his adjuncts, his defense minister saying, will you
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:10.980]  use nukes? You've got other European leaders saying nukes are OK to use. They're clearly trying to push this. Where did Biden go from six months ago saying we can't put in front line battle tanks? That's World War Three and the escalation ladder to doing it. Where is that going? What's your overall view on the Russia situation?
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:38.980]  Well, first of all, the war is a failure of politics, right? It's a failure of policy. And so that's number one. Number two, the Russians know how to know how to sacrifice. But believe me, I mean, as I've studied Russian history, I've studied, you know, the history of warfare. I've studied the Europeans. I mean, the Russians know how to sacrifice. And they're not losing right now.
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:55:08.980]  And the the West, the West, particularly the United States, we're supporting a fascist, a fascist regime in Ukraine. And I always I always say this, you know, let's just say it's one hundred billion dollars that we have given to the Ukrainian government. God knows where it's going. We know that there's weapons in that that we left in Afghanistan that are now finding their way into Ukraine. So I mean, this is insane. One hundred billion dollars. If you divided a hundred billion dollars,
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:38.980]  a hundred billion dollars by four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country, that equals two hundred million dollars per congressional district. Do you think that there's that there's two hundred million dollars that could have been spent in every single congressional district instead of spending it over in Ukraine? Nobody cares about the no American, even though this president is going to say, oh, Americans are all behind this war in Ukraine. No, we're not. We're not behind this war. Joe Biden has yet to stand in front of the American people and say, here are our three or four
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:56:08.980]  national security interests that we have. Not not one time has done that. And war has not been declared. So should Biden, how do we stop it? Do we impeach Biden there? And as you said, The New York Times did a big study and said, oh, my God, the Russians now are behind the war. They were against it. As more Russians die, they get more pro war. Well, I mean, anybody that studies anybody knows that the British in World War Two or the Russians. I mean, the Russians are only getting more pissed. So, yeah. Well, plus if the
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:38.980]  Russians were losing so badly, which is the narrative that we're being told, why do we have to keep flowing money and troops and all kinds of act and intelligence and everything into into Ukraine? I mean, it's because the Russians aren't losing. This is this is a this is a loser's war. OK. This is this is a loser's war. And everybody's going to lose. And we're going to lose big time. We are going to use this as an example. We now the United States government, this administration, specifically those
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:57:08.980]  in the White House are going to use this war as an excuse to do this, this financial transition and this health transition this coming year. That's what I believe. And they're going to and they're going to use war to do it because war is a great excuse when when everything else around you is failing. And right now, the exposure of of the sort of the globalist elite and what they are attempting to do to take over the world. I mean, I'm not just you know, I'm not kidding when I say this. And
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:38.980]  and don't think for one second, folks, that they're going to wake up tomorrow morning and go, you know what? We've just simply we've screwed the American people too much. Let's turn on our energy. Let's close the border. Let's hold people accountable. No, they're going to triple down. They are going. Well, General, that was my first question to get to. Let me ask you that. When in history have you seen an elite that runs a powerful, world dominant country undermine its dollar, undermine its borders, undermine its people,
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:49.839]  create race war, cut off its pipelines so that the globalists are at war with America, that they've gotten a war with Russia? Why are they attacking their own power base?
[01:57:50.050 --> 01:57:59.130]  Yeah, and so I just, you know, I'll say that no country that lost its character ever kept
[01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:06.570]  its liberty, okay? And so the character of the United States of America is in the DNA
[01:58:06.570 --> 01:58:11.390]  of every single American, and I want every single American to understand that, that in
[01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:18.630]  our DNA is the idea of freedom, and the idea of respect, and the idea of what my father
[01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:23.750]  taught me, right? Treat others like you like to be treated. That's called the golden rule.
[01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:27.810]  And until you treat me differently, that's the way I'm going to treat you. And once you
[01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:31.790]  start treating me differently, especially as an American, we know how to fight back.
[01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:37.510]  We might get bloodied, you know, in the first battle. There's a very famous book called
[01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:43.150]  America's First Battles, where the blood runs from Americans first until we, you know,
[01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:47.670]  get off our knees and stand up and realize we better get into the fight. And when we
[01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:54.750]  do, you know, Katy bar the door because we're going to win. And so what I do know is that
[01:58:54.750 --> 01:59:01.630]  we have not lost our character as a nation yet. They are trying their damnedest by flooding
[01:59:01.630 --> 01:59:07.430]  the country with illegals, by stuffing down the throats of our children, this fentanyl
[01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:12.390]  and some of these other drugs. I mean, they're trying their damnedest to destroy the fabric
[01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:17.470]  of our society, to destroy our culture. And I want people to understand, again, that no
[01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:21.950]  country that lost its its character ever kept its liberty. And they're going to try to
[01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:27.070]  destroy that. So we have to we have to take a stand. We have to understand that, you know,
[01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:32.950]  the idea of nothing. Don't believe for a second that that you're that anything is going to
[01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:38.270]  be handed to you. Right. People know that people that work hard, they know that nothing
[01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:44.150]  is going to nothing comes without sacrifice. Right. And so it's going to take sacrifice
[01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:50.310]  for us to be able to elevate ourselves and to push back and to get healthy. It's like a
[01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:54.350]  body. Right. We've got to get back into shape. I want America to get back into shape. And the
[01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:58.470]  way that we're going to get back into shape is by more and more people standing up and
[01:59:58.470 --> 02:00:04.710]  speaking up and standing firm and never giving up. I mean, you know, I if I want to be an
[02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:10.350]  example of anything, because I always looked at what was happening to me in the persecution
[02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:15.230]  that I went through. This was really not about me. This was about America. I mean, yeah,
[02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:20.750]  they attacked Mike Flynn, but they were attacking the country. They they were getting rid of
[02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:25.190]  they were getting rid of somebody who knew a lot about what was going on and could have
[02:00:25.190 --> 02:00:29.830]  stopped a lot of what happened over the four years of the Trump administration. And in
[02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:33.550]  fact, that could be Trump's worst nightmare. But I'm not because he didn't really know.
[02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:39.390]  He really even even he is as smart as he is. He was naive to think that what these people
[02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:44.350]  were doing, they were actually going to do. And they did. And they did. So, General Flynn,
[02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:48.070]  let me say this. Yeah. In the five, six minutes we have left, I know you're busy, but it's
[02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:53.630]  an amazing interview. You mentioned January six earlier. Elon Musk calls for Q Shaman,
[02:00:53.630 --> 02:00:58.830]  who it turns out they let in, let in the Senate. He told people leave. He's spending four years
[02:00:58.830 --> 02:01:03.590]  in jail. Elon Musk says release him. We got documents four days ago. There are now all
[02:01:03.590 --> 02:01:08.110]  of the news that the FBI suppressed documents, the Proud Boys trial. They were actually running
[02:01:08.110 --> 02:01:13.190]  the attack on the Capitol. They're so scared of January six because they're branding the
[02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:17.230]  American people as terrorists and then trying to turn the whole national security apparatus
[02:01:17.230 --> 02:01:21.510]  against us. That's falling apart. The head of the CDC, as we mentioned earlier, but then
[02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:25.070]  you said, I'll get back to that later. Can you speak to that? I mean, they have Redfield
[02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:30.990]  saying gain a function. This happened. I want to explain this. He's saying, look, leadership
[02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:36.350]  of the military, but that's under globalist control because we know Obama, even when Trump
[02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:41.190]  got in, never got full control. So I'm not saying China isn't involved in the attack,
[02:01:41.190 --> 02:01:45.310]  but it's one level. First they say it's China, but it's globalist. But above that, it's globalist
[02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:50.270]  with China looking at that because now Congress has bills saying China launched the attack.
[02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:54.110]  I hate the Chi comms and I know they want to attack us. And I know they wrote papers
[02:01:54.110 --> 02:02:00.190]  about bioweapons against us, but their allies are going to pose inside the government as
[02:02:00.190 --> 02:02:04.430]  if that was the Chi comms doing. And I think the globalists are just as guilty as the Chi
[02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:11.150]  comms and that Chi comm globalist combine must be identified so that the general American
[02:02:11.150 --> 02:02:15.290]  people don't think our government did this. I think we have to educate people that a criminal
[02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:20.590]  group with China released the virus and the shots to collapse our civilization. So how
[02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:25.790]  do we explain that complex issue? Yeah. So first of all, don't, don't allow anybody,
[02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:30.430]  and I'm talking to your entire audience, don't allow anybody to call you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:34.110]  And I'm not talking about you, Alex Jones. I'm talking about you as an individual who I'm
[02:02:34.110 --> 02:02:39.190]  speaking to right now. You know, don't allow anybody to label you as anything other than who
[02:02:39.190 --> 02:02:43.870]  you are as a person. You define yourself. Number one. The second thing is, is there is a
[02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:48.510]  relationship. It is a clear, a clear relationship between the Chinese Communist Party
[02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:55.310]  leadership, particularly Xi and his team. He's got a very small team of individuals who
[02:02:55.310 --> 02:03:00.670]  support every single thing that they're doing. And this globalist group of people, you know,
[02:03:00.670 --> 02:03:05.710]  sort of by the face of them is the World Economic Forum. That's Klaus Schwab. And that's people
[02:03:05.710 --> 02:03:10.030]  like George Soros. Bill Gates is involved in this. I mean, there's, there is a body of them.
[02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:14.590]  You can go look at their website. They're so public about it. It's insane. And they have this
[02:03:14.590 --> 02:03:19.310]  other advisor, Yuval Noah Harari, who they float around this country and they float around the
[02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:23.950]  world talking about how how people are going to be machines and that God is something in the
[02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:29.390]  clouds. And now God is in Silicon Valley. I mean, these people are psychopaths, all of them.
[02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:33.230]  And the other thing is that you're going to hear people in our own government,
[02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:38.430]  particularly the State Department. Oh, China is not our enemy. China is our competitor. Bullshit.
[02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:43.630]  China is our adversary. China wants global domination. They see this century back to the
[02:03:43.630 --> 02:03:49.470]  hundred year war. They see this century as this as the Chinese century. You know, last year might
[02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:53.710]  have been the American century. This year is going to be the Chinese century. And they have already
[02:03:53.710 --> 02:03:58.910]  begun to dominate. Right. I mentioned relationships with Saudi Arabia. I mentioned. And these are
[02:03:58.910 --> 02:04:02.270]  economic relationships. These are real things. People can go read them. Read about them. Don't
[02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:07.310]  don't just. So the shift is happening. How do we stop that? How do we stop that mass awakening
[02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:15.630]  political awareness? Yeah, I mean, this honestly, I don't want to think of I don't want to think of
[02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:23.150]  the worst case, because I'm as an intelligence officer in my my years of being on the battlefield,
[02:04:23.150 --> 02:04:28.750]  we would go worst case, best case, you know, most likely most probable, the kinds of things happening
[02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:34.670]  in the middle. The most probable right now for me, what what we really need to be doing right here
[02:04:34.670 --> 02:04:40.670]  in our country is as I and I keep going back to it is I call it local action will have a national
[02:04:40.670 --> 02:04:47.070]  impact. And people go, ah, it's not because the people in Washington, D.C., I mean, the weaponization
[02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:51.470]  subcommittee should have already issued 500 subpoena. No, it's just let me stop. Let me leave
[02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:57.150]  back. It was it was doctors and scientists and others. It was locals, nurses, doctors saying no.
[02:04:57.150 --> 02:05:02.270]  It was people at city council saying no. The feds are so scared of people at school board saying no
[02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:07.790]  to critical race theory and drag queen pedophile time and all the rest of it. It really is us not
[02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:15.630]  submitting is what defeats the system. It's the one mom, it's the one mom that stands there for
[02:05:15.630 --> 02:05:21.230]  and gets her three minutes in front of a school board and dresses them down. OK, it's the father
[02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:26.750]  who goes in front of a school board or a committee and dresses them down because his daughter was
[02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:34.190]  just raped by a by a boy who was allowed to go into the girls room. I mean, this and that that
[02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:39.950]  actually happened up and up in Virginia. So, I mean, these were the kinds of women.
[02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:41.470]  He raped two girls in Virginia.
[02:05:41.690 --> 02:06:11.690]  Yeah, there was two assaults that I'm aware, but it's it's it's that one mom. I look at a crowd of 5000 people when I when I'm out speaking in different places and I look around and I as I'm as I'm trying to, you know, get my points across to the audience. And I say to the audience, look, I don't need all of you to go out and do that. I just I'm looking for one. I'm looking for one. Because sometimes that's all it takes. It takes one. But what if, what if, what if 20 percent? What
[02:06:11.690 --> 02:06:41.690]  if everybody just mobilize? Exactly. It's over. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, like I say, I mean, I would I would love to have leaders in all the states that we have in all, you know, I mean, in all 50 states. But certainly maybe there's some more important states politically, you know, from an election perspective. But maybe we have, you know, maybe we have giant rallies. I mean, we've got to mobilize the, you know, we the people. Right. And you can mobilize when there's a school board hearing. You can mobilize when there is a county commission hearing. You can when there's an
[02:06:41.690 --> 02:07:11.690]  open seat. I can tell you that there are there are hundreds of thousands of volunteer positions that are still unfilled because the American people. And I hate to say it, folks, but we've been lazy and apathetic as a society over the last 20, 30 years. And we've let the you know, all this gripe. And I've heard all this, you know, B.S. about all those politicians are all corrupt. Well, it's our fault. We've been putting them in there. So we've got to stop that. General Flynn, I totally agree. In the few minutes, General Flynn dot com, few minutes we have left.
[02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:41.690]  Big picture, though. I'm optimistic. I see a huge awakening. I see all these talk show hosts that were scared now telling the truth. I see all these hearings were gain of functions coming out and illegal spy combined with all these agencies. I mean, things are a lot better than they were two years ago. It seems like the awakening curve, the educational curve is going straight up right now. In closing comments, you get the last five minutes. You've got the floor. Other key points you like. I really want to thank you for your time. Yeah, thank you, Alex. And thank you to your great
[02:07:41.690 --> 02:08:11.690]  audience. And thank you for just being you know, I say courage is a decision. It becomes contagious after you make a decision to be courageous. And I appreciate the decision that you made to continue to be courageous for this country. So it kind of big picture. I actually see things in a very you know, very like lit or lighted way. I have my path is lighted. And part of it is because I have a very strong basis of faith.
[02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:41.690]  So I you know, like God wins. Right. And I believe that I wear it on my sleeve. But I that the path in front of me is a very bright path. And it's bright because of what I try to address earlier. What is in the character of each one of us. And I think I believe strongly. In fact, what's in the character of every American is we're just not going to we're not going to allow this country to be stolen from us, you know, in plain sight. And
[02:08:41.690 --> 02:09:11.530]  now we're going to do that. We're going to create alternative ideas. We're going to create alternative paths. We like like a lot of these doctors have already started to stand up other alternative medical capabilities. I think this banking system is banking crisis that we're involved in right now. I actually think that we're going to see a lot of good come out of this. But part of what the government and we need to demand this. We need to demand that people are held accountable. Don't start closing banks. Don't start making a run. Take a deep breath. Be steady. There's got to be accountability.
[02:09:11.690 --> 02:09:41.690]  But the all these things are going to start to happen. And they're going to happen even more so because we're going to continue to expose these bastards. And they need to be exposed. And the more we expose them like guys like Fauci. He's the face of this disastrous murderous you know COVID nightmare that the world went through. Right. So we have to hold these people accountable. And we have to we have to demand that to be held accountable. And I think that that exposure the the the education the understanding of who these
[02:09:41.690 --> 02:10:11.690]  globalist elites are who they are are really important. And I think you know I'm going to put a plug in here for because you're showing my my Twitter site there for Elon Elon Musk. I actually think you know I know you got to stop. This is incredible. My last question was what do you make of Elon Musk. I mean I judges rebounds for it. I don't trust him. But man is he kicking their ass. I was about to ask you will you call on Elon Musk to take. What would General Flynn say to Elon Musk. We should get you guys together. Sorry. This is
[02:10:11.690 --> 02:10:28.969]  incredible. My next thing was was Elon Musk. Yeah. Well I actually think that Elon Musk is doing a service for the world. Now you know I've met Elon Musk briefly a number of years ago. Whether or not he would he remembers that meeting. But it was it was a good meeting actually.
[02:10:28.969 --> 02:10:29.969]  So what Elon Musk is doing for the world right now is he's opening up and exposing like I mean like we've never seen exposed the the deepest of it and darkest of the of the state that exists. Right. This deep state. And this is not just America. We're learning a lot of things about America. You know one of the things and you could put it on there. This Schellenberger report. Schellenberger is one of the guys that did the Twitter Twitter files. This is I read
[02:10:58.969 --> 02:11:28.969]  I read excerpts from his about a 60 some page document or maybe longer. I read excerpts of it from it. You know what. What Elon is doing. Yeah. This is another one. This guy right here. Kramer he Kramer says there you go. You've got to go invest in in Silicon Valley Bank only a couple of weeks ago. And they're in their collapse. That guy right there. He did the same thing in 2007. So I'm sorry. I'm I'm on a tangent. But what. I was going to play that club too. It's insane. He obviously when groups about to
[02:11:28.969 --> 02:11:33.990]  go down he tries to get new investors in. So the big guys can get out. He should be. He should be investigated.
[02:11:36.110 --> 02:11:58.589]  He should be thrown off the team. Whatever the station is he should be booted off. He should be hard and feathered. Right. I mean so anyway. But what Elon Elon is doing a service for the world. And he definitely doing a great service for this country because what he's showing is he showing how the federal government has weaponized every single aspect of our government.
[02:11:58.969 --> 02:11:59.969]  To go against the American people. That's what's. That's what this is. I mean and that's part of World War 3. You know I talk we we have my Web site General Flynn dot com. We have a book called The Citizens Guide to Fifth Generation Warfare. I can have a whole show on that. I mean we are we are in this this moment of time where our overreaching institutionalized and weaponized federal government is is at you
[02:12:28.969 --> 02:12:50.170]  know it's like World War 1 trenches trench warfare. And they're against us. But they know that they can't beat us. They know that they we overwhelm them. We overwhelm them in every other aspect of all the things that I've already talked about. And we have to keep doing that. We have to keep placing demand. And you agree right now. Right now General General would you say right now we are starting to win.
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:13:20.380]  Oh absolutely. Absolutely. There's it's like it's like you know it's like it's like a fourth and one going into the end zone. We're going to get into the end zone and we're pushing because we're bigger we're stronger we're we're smarter. You know there's wisdom in the crowd. We are going to push forward. And frankly you know back to Elon and back to what Twitter has has done what he's done is he's just basically said hey look you know in this country there's there's a bill of right. You know the First Amendment gives us the freedom to speak.
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:50.380]  You know how about it. And from that the exposure that we have been able to put a spotlight on of our federal government is so egregious. It's so disgusting actually. And and now you know I mean I am I am engaged with some of these committees up on in Washington D.C.. So I want people to know that I want people to know that I'm letting the I'm letting some of these people up there know who they should prioritize in terms of who they impeach. Right. I mean there should be that kind of
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:14:20.380]  activity going on. And I think we should be clear right now. We just worked our tails off to win that. They have a record level ten thousand plus FBI whistleblowers. A lot of great former Defense Intelligence Agency people that I know you work with are up there educating Capitol Hill. That's why the educational curve because the good guys have woken up gotten off the bench and are engaged. And that's why we're actually winning right now. General Flynn you're a very humble guy. We appreciate your time. Very honored to have you. This is the best interview we've ever done. One of the best interviews I've ever seen you do. We're very honored to
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:37.500]  have you. People should visit your site. They should bookmark it. They should share it. General Flynn dot com. They should share your Twitter. They should get it out to everybody out there. Thank you so much for the time in 60 seconds. Search your mind. What else do you think you should impart to this audience of millions of people are going to watch this.
[02:14:37.530 --> 02:15:07.530]  Well I would just say never give in. And I tell I counsel young people when I talk to young kids young soldiers who I talked to over the years and of course any young people. We we define ourselves. We define ourselves. Nobody else defines us. Nobody defines who Alex Jones is. Nobody defines who General Mike Flynn is. I define who General Mike Flynn is. I look at myself in the mirror and I'm the same person that goes out on the street and starts to work my tail off to try to do the things that I'm
[02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:37.530]  doing. That's the same thing that you do. I don't care. You know like my mom used to say sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me. I care less about those things. What I care about is I care deeply about this country. I care about the future of my children and my grandchildren. And I know that you feel much the same way. In fact exactly the same way. And that's the way I want people to feel. I want people to believe that America is still that shining city on the hill that true beacon that
[02:15:37.530 --> 02:16:07.530]  that North Star that everybody else around the world is going to follow. And they will follow us. Believe me they're looking for leadership there. And they want the leadership of America. And they're going to find them in in various people here in this country. So Alex you're one of them. Thank you to you. Thank you your team for for let me come on here and the patience that they had to get me organized and and put on at the right time. And and definitely to your
[02:16:07.530 --> 02:16:37.529]  audience. You have a terrific audience. That's that's deeply patriotic. And I want that audience to know that that we're we're on track. We are on the path of light. That's what you need to understand. Beautifully said let me say bye to you before you leave a couple of promos and some reports come back and finish some news. But I mean it's absolutely true. You study history. Most people like yourself and President Trump and so many others don't get to see the success in their lifetime. Our enemy
[02:16:37.529 --> 02:17:07.529]  is being defeated. They will be defeated. And we're just blessed to even see the success right now because everything's kind of compressed. Everything's accelerated. And so everything's really sped up. So now what evil does has a bigger effect. What good does has a bigger effect. But most importantly apathy energizes our enemies. We have to stop having that apathy. And if just those get excited there won't be a million viewers of the show guaranteed a million people will see this conservatively. The clips will have five million views but the show get a million views. If
[02:17:07.529 --> 02:17:37.529]  people get excited it gets 10 million views. Will this one show save the world. No. But our will with God working through us of not backing down and telling the truth will beat this whole thing. General Flynn General Flynn dot com. People can find you on Twitter. They should follow you. They should magnify you. They should get the Citizens Guide and put that back up real quick because you will not. I told you years ago write a book. Do something fun yourself. The Citizens Guide to Fifth Generation Warfare
[02:17:37.529 --> 02:18:07.529]  Production 5G W. Tell us. Tell us. You're such a humble guy. Tell us about this. This is amazing. It's the bestseller. It's the second bestseller that I've had out of four books I've written. This is a terrific. This is a handbook. This is a guide. I myself and my co-author Sergeant Boone Cutler we we did. We wrote this in layman's terms in citizens language. We created a military manual for fifth
[02:18:07.529 --> 02:18:34.150]  generation warfare but we did it in citizens language so people can understand what it is that we are facing what kinds of actions you need to take. And then how. And in there we have appendix one is is the rules for victory. OK. Well I want to watch this. I want to read this. I want to see this. But this is so classic how you are. I've asked you for years to write a book. Now we're seeing this and you won't even promote it. I've got to make you promote it. Everybody's got to get this. Where do they get this.
[02:18:34.170 --> 02:19:04.170]  They can go to my Web site General Flynn dot com and from that Web site they can. It takes you either to to Barnes and Noble which is a it is a best seller right now. Amazon dropped us but go to my Web site General Flynn dot com and they can get copies. But again I have a best selling book which got blocked a bunch of places and I talked about it. That was number one. Here you are on with me. And I like for an hour and a half or hour 50 minutes you're not even promoting your book which I haven't read yet. I've got to read this.
[02:19:04.170 --> 02:19:12.550]  Folks I mean the battle plan for quick. I know you got to go but quick. It is explain to people what fifth generation warfare is.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:42.560]  The generation warfare is a combination of irregular unrestricted and and and what we call hybrid warfare. It permit it primarily is a war of narratives. So war of information. And this is what we're we are facing. Believe me when you read this guide you're going to go holy shit. This is exactly what we're facing. And and then what we do is we take you through steps. It's a it's written in a military style with different
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:20:12.560]  sections and sort of how to do things. And we actually at every at the end of every section we have a we have a short test that the reader has to take. It causes you to dive back into the section that you just read or answer things based on it. You know to make you critically think it is a fascinating style in terms of giving it to two civilians so to speak because because we felt when we looked at what was happening and we looked at the war that we were involved in which is a war of narratives.
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:42.560]  This is a massive war of narratives. And that's why I believe we're winning and we're winning because a lot of people have actually bought this book which has been good. And I appreciate you plugging it. But it is a layman's guide to the war that we are in. And it will it will walk you through. This is not a war of neighbor against neighbor or friend against friend or family member against family member. This is a war of the globalist elites against those of us who love and cherish freedom. And what's incredible
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:21:10.680]  is the people are ready. So literally this is a blueprint for victory. I'm going to order the book. Yeah. And after I read it please come on in a month or so because this is what we need. People need that confidence. They understand it. They know it. Incredible job. General Flynn I salute you. I thank your whole family for your sacrifices. We're starting to turn the tide. I'm worried about how the enemies will strike back panic us into a bank run. I agree with you. But we are we are definitely in the fight. General Flynn God bless you sir.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:16.160]  God bless you. Thank you. Let's go to these promos. I'll come right back. I want to say bye to General Flynn.
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:36.439]  Jordan ranking member Plaskett members of the committee thank you very much for inviting my testimony. In his 1961 farewell address President Dwight Eisenhower warned of quote the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military industrial complex.
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:51.600]  Eisenhower feared that the size and power of the complex or cluster of government contractors and the Defense Department would quote endanger our liberties or democratic processes. How did he mean that through quote domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money.
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:22:06.279]  He feared public policy would become the captive of a scientific technological elite. Eisenhower's fears were well founded. Today American taxpayers are unwittingly financing the growth and power of a censorship industrial complex run by America's scientific and technological elite.
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:16.439]  Which endangers our liberties and democracy. I'm grateful for this opportunity to offer this testimony and sound the alarm over the shocking and disturbing emergence of state sponsored censorship in the United States of America.
[02:22:17.039 --> 02:22:30.439]  The Twitter files state attorneys general lawsuits and investigative reporters have revealed a large and growing network of government agencies academic institutions and non-governmental organizations that are actively censoring American citizens often without their knowledge on a range of issues.
[02:22:30.439 --> 02:22:45.080]  I do not know how much of the censorship is coordinated beyond what we have been able to document and I will not speculate. I recognize that the law allows Facebook Twitter and other private companies to moderate content on their platforms and I support the right of governments to communicate with the public including to dispute inaccurate information.
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:55.840]  But government officials have been caught repeatedly pushing social media platforms to censor disfavored users and content. Often these acts of censorship threaten the legal protection social media companies need to exist. Section 230.
[02:22:56.320 --> 02:23:06.240]  If government officials are directing or facilitating such censorship there's one law professor it raises serious First Amendment questions. It is axiomatic that the government cannot do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly.
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:17.519]  Moreover we know that the U.S. government has funded organizations that pressure advertisers to boycott news media organizations and social media platforms that refuse to censor and or spread disinformation including alleged conspiracy theories.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:28.560]  The Stanford Internet Observatory the University of Washington the Atlantic Council's digital forensic research lab and graphical have all inadequately disclosed ties to the Department of Defense the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:34.960]  They work with multiple U.S. government agencies to institutionalize censorship research and advocacy within dozens of other universities and think tanks.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:40.480]  It is important to understand how these groups function. They are not publicly engaging with their opponents in an open exchange of ideas.
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:51.119]  They aren't asking for a national debate over the limits of the First Amendment rather they are creating blacklists of disfavored people and then pressuring cajoling and demanding that social media platforms censor de-amplify and even ban the people on those lists.
[02:23:53.119 --> 02:24:02.519]  The censorship industrial complex combines established methods of psychological manipulation some developed by the U.S. military during the global war on terror with highly sophisticated tools from computer science including artificial intelligence.
[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:09.840]  The complex's leaders are driven by the fear that the Internet and social media platforms empower populist alternative infringed personalities and views which they regard as destabilizing.
[02:24:10.279 --> 02:24:18.359]  Federal government officials agencies and contractors have gone from fighting ISIS recruiters and Russian bots to censoring and de-platforming ordinary Americans and disfavored public figures.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:30.000]  Importantly the bar for bringing in military grade government monitoring and speech countering techniques has moved from quote countering terrorism to quote countering extremism to countering simple misinformation otherwise known as being wrong on the Internet.
[02:24:30.359 --> 02:24:35.840]  The government no longer needs a predicate of calling you a terrorist or an extremist to deploy government resources to counter your political activity.
[02:24:36.119 --> 02:24:40.439]  The only predicated needs is simply the assertion that the opinion you expressed on social media is wrong.
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:44.439]  These efforts extend to influencing and even directing conventional news media organizations.
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:55.039]  Since 1971 when the Washington Post and New York Times elected to publish classified Pentagon Papers about the war in Vietnam journalists have understood that we have a professional obligation to report on leaked documents whose contents are in the public interest.
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:04.680]  And yet in 2020 the Aspen Institute and Stanford Cyber Policy Center urged journalists to quote break the Pentagon Papers principle and not cover leaked government leaked information to prevent the spread of disinformation.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:13.960]  Government funded censors frequently invoke the prevention of real world harm to justify their demands for censorship but the censors define harm define harm far more expansively than the Supreme Court does.
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.880]  Increasingly the censors say their goal is to restrict information that de-legitimizes governmental industrial and news media organizations.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:26.160]  That mandate is so sweeping that it could easily censor criticism from any part of the status quo from elected officials to institutions to laws.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:30.439]  Congress should immediately cut off funding to the censors and investigate their activities.
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:37.279]  It should mandate instant reporting of all conversations between social media executives government employees and government contractors concerning content moderation.
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:43.400]  And finally Congress should limit the broad permission given to social media platforms to censor the platform and spread public propaganda.
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:53.800]  Thank you very much to be accessible when people need to know but I don't think you have much hope of reaching a public that doesn't have a professional need to know.
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:59.680]  I completely agree that I almost think you'd scare the public.
[02:26:00.439 --> 02:26:03.039]  If you put this out like why are they telling me this.
[02:26:03.199 --> 02:26:13.680]  Should I be concerned about my bank like my insurance company doesn't tell me what they're doing with my assets if they just assume they're gonna pay my claim right.
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:25.720]  I think you've got to think of the unintended consequences of taking a public that has more full faith and confidence in the banking system than maybe people in this room do that.
[02:26:26.519 --> 02:26:28.680]  We want them to have full faith and confidence in the banking system.
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:30.439]  They know the FDIC insurance is there.
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:31.279]  They know it works.
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:32.920]  They put their money in there to get their money out.
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:41.080]  So there's a select crowd of people that are in the institutional side and they want to understand this.
[02:26:41.119 --> 02:26:42.600]  They're going to find a way to understand this.
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:44.439]  There's a bunch of law firms representing this room.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:49.760]  There's a bunch of people who charge them by the hour a lot of money to explain this all to them and it's fine.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:58.400]  I don't have a problem with that and they all have huge staffs but I would be careful about the unintended consequences of starting to blast too much of this out.
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:04.240]  And the general public wondered whether there are some market tests of whether you're being heard.
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:17.439]  And I think about TLAC so TLAC should spread should respond to good and bad news about the institutions and it's really important.
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:19.640]  I mean it's a little bit conflicted right.
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:28.199]  I mean it's important that people understand they can be bailed in but you don't want a huge run on the institution but they have I mean they're going to be.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:39.920]  That's and it could be an early warning signal to the FDIC and the primary regulators when these things happen and there may be some other prices.
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:52.119]  This is similar to what Jay was saying in the market that you can tell whether people understand how the who's going to be protected who isn't going to be protected.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:28:04.160]  It would be I think an interesting study to look at the evolution of market prices in a situation like March of 2020 for example and see whether people understood what might happen.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:15.920]  When you have U.S. senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before what do you think that makes the Russians do.
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:17.599]  Well it makes them go into war mode.
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:30.279]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert only one level above that on their death con just like our system and that's fire the weapons.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:37.760]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.599]  Think of their ignorance.
[02:28:40.119 --> 02:28:59.560]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average are being launched sea launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach five land launch systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach nine and cannot be shot down.
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:01.880]  And yes the United States has those two.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:06.080]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[02:29:06.359 --> 02:29:07.560]  It's on record the U.S.
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:08.279]  has those systems.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:18.000]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:29.960]  And you know I'm on the side of not have a nuclear war especially when Russia is not starting a fight with us and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.160]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[02:29:36.359 --> 02:29:39.279]  All right about a month ago and it got a lot of traction.
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:52.599]  Jack so many others put out I said my mission my primary mission was complete and that's informing everybody about the new world order and having a giant global effect and we did that all glory goes to God.
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:57.480]  When I talk about myself I mean the crew the listeners all of us together what we did.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:05.640]  I know I've got important work to go on now but the main message in what I said is the ball is in your hands now.
[02:30:06.599 --> 02:30:15.240]  You as a viewer and listener that was called to this broadcast you are going to have to decide what you are going to do with this information.
[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:26.320]  We just had the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who was responsible for the pivot against China 10 years ago who they listened to smart guy very smart.
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:36.000]  I want to fake generals tell you what was currently happening you just got an hour and 15 minutes intelligence report for the former head of Defense Intelligence.
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:39.000]  Think about that.
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:53.920]  Now the question is will you share this video do you care enough and I'm not bitching at you I'm saying you can't just send your email list and tell a few friends about it you got to get aggressive in the info war if we're going to back this down and stop this.
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:31:01.680]  God gives us a chance just like he sent Jonah to Nineveh to give them a hundred year reprieve they were printed.
[02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:08.080]  We're being given that chance I love my three daughters I love my son.
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:15.439]  And I realized this is not some lovey cutesy liberal thing where I care about you.
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:27.039]  It's ingrained in me I have empathy for you because I don't have my head screwed on halfway it's screwed on all the way what are my children going to do.
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:33.119]  In a destroyed world, so if I love.
[02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:42.560]  Georgia and Veronica and Charlotte and Rex I love you.
[02:31:43.050 --> 02:31:53.689]  And I've used the analogy of people that get up in a public pool to go pee in the bathroom.
[02:31:54.330 --> 02:31:59.130]  I'm in a public pool I don't piss in the public pool even though I know a bunch of people are I
[02:31:59.130 --> 02:32:05.929]  don't want to swim in their piss but everybody knows people pee in the pool. What the globalists
[02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:11.130]  are doing is crapping in the pool one person craps in the pool the pool's closed there's a
[02:32:11.130 --> 02:32:18.810]  big turd floating around in it like Caddyshack. The globalists have put a thousand turds in the pool
[02:32:18.810 --> 02:32:25.689]  they're the ones doing it they're the enemy. So this is not some that's why I don't hate it but
[02:32:25.689 --> 02:32:31.050]  it's annoying because I love the callers I love you keeping us on air I love you supporting us
[02:32:32.410 --> 02:32:38.410]  but it's a it's it's asked backwards when you call in and say oh thank you for caring about us
[02:32:38.410 --> 02:32:48.890]  thank you for caring about you my children live in this world with you what's done to you will be
[02:32:48.890 --> 02:32:56.650]  done to my children when Jesus said do unto others as you've had done unto you it's not some candy
[02:32:56.650 --> 02:33:03.289]  ass thing if you treat people good and they treat you good we have a civilization but Jesus went
[02:33:03.289 --> 02:33:10.650]  more further before he was killed and rose again he said the ultimate love is to lay down your life
[02:33:10.650 --> 02:33:14.730]  for someone else because it's further than just treating people like you want to be treated
[02:33:14.730 --> 02:33:20.730]  it's going other people aren't awake they don't get it I gotta make this move or we lose everything.
[02:33:20.940 --> 02:33:30.220]  So what I do is not remarkable, what I do is not special, it's the default.
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:33.220]  I know God's real.
[02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:36.020]  I know the devil's real.
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:37.940]  And I've got to roll up my sleeves.
[02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:43.230]  And admit that fact and say, am I going to serve Satan?
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:50.560]  Or am I going to do what it takes to stand up for humanity and my children?
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:51.560]  And you know what?
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:54.680]  There's not a question in my mind about that.
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:59.720]  And the enemy uses fear, the enemy uses intimidation, the enemy tells you, just go along with us,
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:00.800]  we'll leave you alone.
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:04.320]  You're a winner if you make this decision to be a passive person.
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.160]  No, you don't.
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:07.120]  You become a slave.
[02:34:07.330 --> 02:34:13.330]  So I can pull back.
[02:34:13.430 --> 02:34:25.630]  And I can look at the success of this broadcast that has been preeminent, that has been paramount,
[02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:30.190]  that has been dominant, that has been world changing.
[02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:38.390]  And I look back at my life at 49 years old and I think, man, this is incredible.
[02:34:38.390 --> 02:34:41.030]  I've got a relationship with the creator of the universe.
[02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:43.990]  I've been given intelligence that I can't even decipher.
[02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:47.270]  It's so powerful, my little brain can't even read it, folks.
[02:34:47.370 --> 02:34:54.770]  I go to sleep at night and I love going to bed at like 10 or midnight.
[02:34:54.770 --> 02:35:00.050]  I lay my little head down for six, seven hours and I'm like teleported to the next level
[02:35:00.050 --> 02:35:05.770]  and I'm briefed and I'm shown and I'm war-gamed and I'm walked through everything and I just
[02:35:05.770 --> 02:35:10.550]  wake up and I go, oh my God, why wouldn't the public all want this?
[02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:19.170]  They do want this, but they have to make the decision to get this and you can get this
[02:35:19.170 --> 02:35:25.310]  and beyond and I knew this when I was debriefed when I was 18 years old by the Holy Spirit
[02:35:25.310 --> 02:35:30.910]  and when I was 22 years old and it happened again and a year ago and it happened again.
[02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:37.630]  I was shown what would happen and I was shown all of it and man, that just lets you know
[02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:41.110]  like we're dialed into the real deal here.
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:49.640]  But God's so honest, God said, this is gonna hurt.
[02:35:49.650 --> 02:35:52.609]  You ready for this?
[02:35:52.730 --> 02:36:02.730]  That's when I realized, my children's souls.
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:09.340]  Would be lost, before I even had them.
[02:36:09.450 --> 02:36:18.610]  God told me, you aborted all those children, but I'll forgive you with the children you're
[02:36:18.610 --> 02:36:19.610]  gonna have.
[02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:20.330]  You'll fight for them.
[02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:27.330]  And that's what this is really all about, ladies and gentlemen, choose God, choose Christ,
[02:36:27.330 --> 02:36:35.010]  choose it now, be part of the future, be part of infinity, dial into the creator of all of
[02:36:35.010 --> 02:36:40.730]  this, that sun you see in the day, that moon you see at night, Mars and Jupiter and Saturn
[02:36:41.610 --> 02:36:51.450]  all of it, Venus, Mercury, those are all just tiny little things, all the inanimate matter,
[02:36:51.450 --> 02:36:58.250]  all the dead stone and rock and mountains of the moon mean nothing compared to what God loves
[02:36:58.250 --> 02:37:05.290]  about you. God said in the holy scripture, you think the sparrow isn't loved by me?
[02:37:05.290 --> 02:37:12.890]  I love the sparrow so much, that little bird of the tree and think how much more I love thee.
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:23.320]  But you cannot be given this powerful free will and not be given the choice, or it's
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:24.160]  not free will.
[02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:30.140]  And that's the process, and that's what we're part of.
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:38.620]  And so even though we're contained and attacked and reviled by the Satanists and persecuted,
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:41.740]  that's because we're in the heart of the fight.
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:46.540]  That's because we're in the center of the war, and we're winning the battles together.
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:55.060]  And so that's why, as this live show ends, and it re-loops at Bandot Video and Infowars.com
[02:37:55.060 --> 02:38:00.780]  and Free to Air so many places, you take clips out and share them, please, in fact, I demand
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:06.660]  you do, because you're everything if you don't take action.
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:12.220]  Just know this, there is a God that created the universe, there is a God that loves you,
[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:17.780]  there is a God that gave you free will, and so in that free will is Satan.
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:23.820]  And know that you have a decision to make right now about the future of your soul for
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:26.680]  eternity.
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:27.680]  That's a beautiful thing.
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:33.020]  I want this show today to have 10 million viewers.
[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:39.699]  It should have 100 million viewers, but if all of you watching decide every way you can
[02:38:39.699 --> 02:38:43.539]  to share it with others, and tell them to share it, and tell those they tell to share
[02:38:43.539 --> 02:38:47.420]  it, to share it, and tell those they tell to share it, to tell those that they give
[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:52.500]  it to you to share it, here's this information, share it, and tell them to share it, we will
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:59.539]  override the AI, we will override the system, and we will develop a path to victory, which
[02:38:59.539 --> 02:39:02.100]  is already foretold.
[02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:09.500]  We'll go through the crisis, but in the end we'll win, and all we're doing is fulfilling
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:11.060]  holy prophecy.
[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:18.060]  But isn't it a blessing to not fear death, to not fear persecution, to not fear all the
[02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:24.340]  horrible things they can do to us, but to just commit to God, and that full commitment,
[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:31.260]  and that full measure, and say this is who I am, this is who I've always been, I'm with
[02:39:31.260 --> 02:39:39.740]  God, I'm a weak creature compared to God, but I give myself to God, and in that is transcendence.
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:49.000]  This is the transcendence, and the incredible trials, and the incredible tribulations that
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:57.240]  we will go through together, and obviously further in the future, I won't be here, many
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:02.320]  people you knew won't be here, that's okay, we'll be with you in heart and soul, we'll
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:07.000]  be with you in spirit, and we'll be here with you fighting, whether you're watching this
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.199]  in 10 years or 100 years, we are unstoppable in God.
[02:40:12.390 --> 02:40:28.390]  Alright, I did major preparation today, I covered 3 stacks out of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 stacks and I'll have more stacks tomorrow night at 4pm central for my Sunday night show.
[02:40:28.390 --> 02:40:38.390]  But I will cover all of this and more. I want to salute my amazing crew and I want to salute all you that tuned in tonight.
[02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:48.390]  You are the light, the dark of the night. You are the dog that hunts. You are the north star. You are the reason we are here. You are everything. You are not the tail, you are the dog.
[02:40:48.390 --> 02:40:56.390]  You are the decision on whether or not we stay on air. You are the decision on whether or not this broadcast continues.
[02:40:56.390 --> 02:41:05.390]  You can stand against Satan and you can break his will with your prayer, with your support, with your word of mouth. Do it now. Make the decision.
[02:41:05.390 --> 02:41:13.390]  We'll put this full show up, it's live right now. It'll restream soon. The General Flynn interview will be put up by itself at Banned Out Video.
[02:41:13.390 --> 02:41:25.390]  And who knows how long it'll be there. Take everything at Banned Out Video and archive it and share it because in the days and years to come, the information here will be more powerful than ever.
[02:41:25.390 --> 02:41:35.390]  Thank the crew, thank General Flynn, thank you all and thank God above all others. Thank you for watching this special Saturday Emergency Transmission.
[02:41:35.810 --> 02:42:00.449]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements
[02:42:00.449 --> 02:42:03.090]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:42:03.250 --> 02:42:09.490]  Support Infowars store. Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know,
[02:42:09.490 --> 02:42:14.449]  I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes and again,
[02:42:14.449 --> 02:42:20.210]  magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil. What I'm watching
[02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:26.930]  right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive
[02:42:26.930 --> 02:42:31.010]  and I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:36.210]  supplements, but the day will come. Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold. DNA
[02:42:36.210 --> 02:42:41.330]  force, absolutely imperative. Mineral fusion, absolutely. As you're drinking filtered water,
[02:42:41.330 --> 02:42:45.170]  a lot of it will become demineralized. You have to have these products.
[02:43:01.010 --> 02:43:05.170]  I can tell you how many outside groups go and test the products we sell. Mike Adams is famous
[02:43:05.170 --> 02:43:08.769]  for his big testing lab where he tests all sorts of products, all sorts of supplements and I didn't
[02:43:08.769 --> 02:43:11.890]  even know this happened with a family member. He was giving them a family member that had some
[02:43:11.890 --> 02:43:16.130]  neurological issues, CBD oil because in all the studies, it's really good CBD oil. It really helps
[02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:21.330]  all sorts of neurological things, Parkinson's, epilepsy, narcolepsy, list goes on and on,
[02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:25.650]  joint pain, you name it and he went and tested ours in his testing lab, checked it as degrees
[02:43:25.650 --> 02:43:29.570]  and said this is the highest quality we've seen. We've seen another brand that's good but this is
[02:43:29.570 --> 02:43:34.529]  the very top. This should be $160 a bottle or the 1000 milligram that he puts out and that's true.
[02:43:34.529 --> 02:43:38.769]  They recommended we sell it for 150. I went to these folks that own a big company that's one
[02:43:38.769 --> 02:43:43.090]  of the top distributors in the country of wide spectrum CBD and they said we recommend 150 retail
[02:43:43.090 --> 02:43:49.970]  and then discount it 100 bucks. Well, I'm not going to do 200% market. So at $67, there's 100%
[02:43:49.970 --> 02:43:55.330]  markup to fund ourselves. You're getting the best CBD, 1000 milligram, 25 milligram and 10
[02:43:55.330 --> 02:43:59.970]  milligram and then the one you want at over 50% what you're going to get this anywhere else.
[02:43:59.970 --> 02:44:10.050]  That's what the discounted. It's about 35% after the discount. So I bet if you look at retail,
[02:44:10.050 --> 02:44:16.449]  it's like a 70% discount. The point is, is that point blank, everybody knows CBD is great. Doctors
[02:44:16.449 --> 02:44:19.490]  are prescribing it everywhere, even though it's not prescription. This is the best you're going to
[02:44:19.490 --> 02:44:25.410]  get. Infowarestore.com and it funds the info or a total 360 win. Only way we fail is we don't take
[02:44:25.410 --> 02:44:29.010]  action. And I know less than 1% of the viewers who I love and I think I'm not benching. If just
[02:44:29.010 --> 02:44:33.250]  one more percent would just do it, we wouldn't just be good. We could expand. So we're not going
[02:44:33.250 --> 02:44:35.970]  anywhere. Those of you that have bought the products, you know who you are. Those who haven't,
[02:44:35.970 --> 02:44:39.570]  Hey, keep spreading the word, keep praying for us. And if you want to experience great CBD,
[02:44:39.570 --> 02:44:45.650]  try it out, get a bottle. And I think you're going to be a repeat customer by the product.
