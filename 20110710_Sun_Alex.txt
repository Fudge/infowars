[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:18.000 --> 00:32.000]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. It is the 10th day of July 2011. We're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday.
[00:32.000 --> 00:45.000]  4 to 6 p.m. Central, back weekdays 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central as well. Central because we are right here coming to you from Central Texas, the great Lone Star State.
[00:45.000 --> 00:56.000]  I want to thank everybody across the United States, North America, all the ships at sea and people listening and the other continents around the world and other sovereign nations battling the globalists for joining us today.
[00:56.000 --> 01:07.000]  A lot of people, and we have a huge broadcast lined up for you that I'll get to in a minute, a lot of people have marveled that we've started making more prisonplanet.tv video specials.
[01:07.000 --> 01:18.000]  I've started uploading 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 special video reports a day to the YouTube channel and soon that will be going to prisonplanet.tv. I'll be putting the reports there first.
[01:18.000 --> 01:29.000]  People are marveling that we're only increasing our output. Well, that's because the globalists are coming in like a flood against free humanity.
[01:29.000 --> 01:39.000]  And I realize that we are like it or not the tip of the spear. I never intended to have this big of an effect. I never intended to be reaching this many people.
[01:39.000 --> 01:52.000]  Certainly I wanted to and we are exponentially reaching tens of millions of people, many of them new every single week. It is an incredible, an incredible responsibility.
[01:52.000 --> 02:06.000]  Most of these people we're reaching have never come in contact with real information. They've never come in contact with full spectrum analysis where things are broken down historically with facts in a very easy to understand way.
[02:06.000 --> 02:21.000]  And it is having a huge effect when people are basically shown, not my opinion or my views, but what is admitted. And then suddenly they start making all the other connections for themselves, truly critically thinking.
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.000]  History, the present, the future opens up to them and they are off and running. And that is so incredibly exciting.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  You know, they talked about Obama as if he was going to be the second coming of Abraham Lincoln. And I said, folks, that's very cryptic.
[02:39.000 --> 02:49.000]  The financial implosion is going to accelerate under Obama. The states are going to try to use 10th Amendment remedy to not go into global receivership through fraud.
[02:49.000 --> 03:03.000]  And the president is going to come in and invoke dictator powers and the federal government is going to use as the precedent because I'd see some of their lawyers talking about this years ago, Civil War martial law rules.
[03:03.000 --> 03:16.000]  Well, guess what I have today from French news agency, Associated Press, Reuters, Washington Post, National Review.
[03:16.000 --> 03:30.000]  Guess what I have here? And this incredible bombshell information is just let out there like you pass gas in church. It's just quietly allowed, no fanfare.
[03:30.000 --> 03:42.000]  You just smell the stench of tyranny around you. And it's just, oh no big deal, obscure clause may help U.S. avert deficit and default.
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  And there's no mention of the fact that 90 plus percent of this debt is derivative that our government has been induced to sign on to.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  And hence the people have foreign banking debt that the vast majority of the bailout money went to foreign private families like the Rothschilds, the Queen of England and others.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  That's now been made public. We told you that three years ago, but it was made public three months ago.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  We just happen to know who the private shareholders of the Fed were when it was set up.
[04:06.000 --> 04:22.000]  Haven't gotten that intel since then, but we know who pulls the strings. And they say here, oh, powers used against the South will now be used against the Congress and the President controls the power of the federal personnel.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  And they're actually in the news calling people extremist. I actually have it here. I'm going to go over it coming up.
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.000]  Extremist, if you say Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit and the paying of debts.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  Now that's a fact in the Constitution. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows that Congress declares war.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's so well known I'm not even going to cite the area of the Constitution. Go look it up yourself.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  But now they say, oh, we don't need the Congress. We have the U.N. as Obama said in press releases.
[04:51.000 --> 05:00.000]  So this is all coming up. Stay with us. It's huge. We'll be right back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions.
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[05:41.000 --> 05:51.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[05:51.000 --> 06:15.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:29.000]  Thank you for joining us my friends in defense of liberty and resistance to tyranny.
[06:29.000 --> 06:49.000]  The private mafia interest that control the mega central banks, the large defense contractors and big pharma openly and publicly are setting up a tyrannical fascistic private corporate world government that wages war against the free market through corporate collectivism.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  Popularly known as crony capitalism but it really has nothing to do with that.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  We are here to shatter the controlled tiny box that people are in the left right paradigm.
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  We are here to show people the hidden truth that is hiding in plain view.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  Very important broadcast today on this July 10th, 2011 Sunday broadcast. Thank you so much for joining us.
[07:14.000 --> 07:27.000]  Let me give you a preview of what's coming up. First off, this whole fast and furious ATF shipping in 30,000 guns into Mexico has now come to a head.
[07:27.000 --> 07:44.000]  And the attorney general has been accused by the head of the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Farms and Explosives of lying to Congress when he said that he knew nothing about the ATF plan to ship guns into Mexico.
[07:44.000 --> 07:58.000]  Now, it's now been ferreted out that even a year and a half ago, Holder gave speeches basically alluding to what he was doing. And now it's even in the Associated Press and other major publications that the FBI and DEA were involved as well.
[07:58.000 --> 08:11.000]  And yes, it was a Justice Department operation. Who believes the ATF would ship 30,000 guns to major cartels like Los Zetas if they were not given authorization.
[08:11.000 --> 08:19.000]  And the attorney general has been caught lying Eric Holder. This is huge, but I want to give you the full rest of the story.
[08:19.000 --> 08:30.000]  And as usual, we don't give you the rest of the story after the fact. Now you're ready to hear the information we covered six years ago, five years ago, four years ago, three years ago.
[08:30.000 --> 08:45.000]  And with total precision, and the videos have been reposted on infowars.com, two years ago we laid out everything that would transpire with absolute, complete and total precision.
[08:45.000 --> 08:53.000]  Not because we're smart, but because we know how the crime syndicate that sees control of our government in 1913 operates.
[08:53.000 --> 09:03.000]  We know every one of the plays in their playbooks. Just like if you got your favorite football team and you watch them every year and you know the coach, you know what is in their playbook.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  Once you see the players go into motion. And we're going to lay all of that out today.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  And I put up a video that I shot on my iPhone 4 up to our YouTube channel with 125 million views.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  And it's the two parts of it have had more than 70,000 views. That means you'll get about half million views. That's good.
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  Should get about 10 million views, we wish. But Obama caught staging terror attack part one and two.
[09:29.000 --> 09:41.000]  And I again shot that yesterday from my home. I couldn't even really sleep on Saturday being aware of all this coming to a head.
[09:41.000 --> 09:52.000]  Because you have to ask yourselves, why were the guns shipped into Mexico? And that's twofold.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  And we've written detailed articles breaking it all down with the proof.
[09:56.000 --> 10:09.000]  A, to blame the Second Amendment and say the violence in Mexico was caused by that and to call for assault weapons bans, the shutdown of gun shows, only allowed to sell one gun at a time at gun shops, total tracking.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  And just like you have a no fly list with no judge, no jury, don't know why you're on it.
[10:13.000 --> 10:22.000]  The White House now has announced, as of Friday, they want a no buy list for gun owners that they just magically put you on a list.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  You could never even had a parking ticket. Obama says you don't get a gun, you don't get it.
[10:27.000 --> 10:35.000]  You may remember two years ago, White House Chief of Staff gave speeches to the Violence Policy Center, the Victim Disarmament Center, and others.
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.000]  And we've played those clips many times. Now they're back calling it sensible restrictions everyone will agree on.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  And then you actually get into the meat and potatoes of what they're about to start promoting.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  So that's one of the things they did there.
[10:50.000 --> 11:03.000]  A, B, I of course have interviewed LAPD police officers who were there in the 80s watching the government ship in the cocaine.
[11:03.000 --> 11:13.000]  We have the 1997 Solicitor General CIA hearings in Congress where they admitted the CIA was shipping in tons of cocaine and cooking it into crack
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  to destabilize the United States and pack the private prisons that the megabanks laundering the drug money owned.
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  Also, I've interviewed people like Pulitzer Prize winner of Dark Alliance Gary Webb.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  He was about to come out with more information. I talked to him about a month before he was shot twice in the back of the head.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  The police in California ruled it was a suicide.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  And he'd been telling folks that people had been breaking into his house.
[11:37.000 --> 11:45.000]  I, of course, have interviewed Celica Stella, one of Gary Webb's main sources who was the top DEA agent in Central, South America and Mexico
[11:45.000 --> 11:56.000]  for more than a decade, an Army sniper from Vietnam, first he was an Army sniper, then he was what, board of patrol, then he was DEA.
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  And he came on my show six years ago, again, five, four, three, two, right to two years ago when the ATF set him up for a couple of shotguns
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  saying they were illegal and put him in jail because he was making the rounds dealing with the ATF and he was saying at the time,
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  that's why he's in prison, he was saying at the time that he'd been approached, this is as Calderon was about to be elected
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  and he said Calderon would steal the election as he did.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  And international groups that watched the election said clearly he stole most of the states in Mexico.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  He said that there would be a huge drug war in Mexico, that Mexico was going to be collapsed because the CIA and Fort Benning, Georgia,
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  and now that's been, that's now in mainstream news, was funding Los Zetas giving them automatic weapons, grenade launchers,
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  you name it, and that Los Zetas, what was going to defect from the U.S. government, the Mexican government,
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  was really working with the U.S. and Mexican government, once Calderon got in was the plan,
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  and that's why as soon as he got elected all this started to wipe out the other three to four major cartels
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  that would not launder all their money through U.S. and international banks.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  Now, by the way, that's in Bloomberg and AP, I'm going to go over all these headlines,
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  giving you the basics now, I'm going to walk through all of it.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  And so I watched all this unfold, exactly as he said it would unfold.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  Gary Webb was working on that, they went to his house, shot gun him twice in the back of the head.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  I want you to know I'm risking my life even giving this information.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  $500 billion a year in cocaine and heroin come into this country.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  It's all laundered by the big six banks on record.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  Private Federal Reserve has been caught repeatedly with hundreds of billions in cash, they're allowed to keep it all.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Doesn't matter.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  You're going to wait the cops go to big links to get the drugs.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  Drugs were legal till the 30s, you could buy heroin, cocaine, opium, anything you wanted to corner drugstore.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  Drug use was much lower even though Coca-Cola had cocaine in it.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  They had it all right down at the corner drugstore.
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  And the prohibition had ended, which the big establishment made illegal so they could make huge profits, corrupt the police,
[13:57.000 --> 14:04.000]  some cases 100 times what they were making before alcohol was legal, illegal, knocked out all their competition,
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  then only the insiders could bring in alcohol, some of the greatest fortunes ever, including the Kennedy Fortunes were made out of that.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  Kennedy's, of course, Joe Kennedy, head of the Irish Mafia on the East Coast.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  Chicago delivered the election to him through the dailies, other Irish.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  But the issue, this is all mainline history, go pull it up.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  They made alcohol illegal for a decade to take control of the market.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  There were hundreds of breweries then, hundreds of whiskey makers then.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  For decades after prohibition, there were only a few.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  Now, when that ended, they had to make narcotics illegal to have something new.
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  The big major international importers make it illegal, they control the major cities, the major distributors,
[14:46.000 --> 14:54.000]  now that massively rises the price of all of their commodities, heroin, cocaine, the list goes on and on.
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  They bring it in, they corrupt the police further, they control the criminal networks, they control the muscle,
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  they shut down all of their competition.
[15:04.000 --> 15:13.000]  They take the low level users and give them long sentences in privately owned banks, privately owned prisons,
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  go look at who owns the big main chains of mega prisons.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  We have more prisons anywhere else in the world, more drug use anywhere else in the world.
[15:21.000 --> 15:29.000]  Number one, the people then who get caught using the drugs that were shipped in at the top of the chain,
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  who go rob stereos and the rest of it that goes right back to the banks,
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  they then get put in a bank-owned private prison working as slave labor for 25 cents an hour,
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  displacing everybody else's jobs.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  I mean, you think the illegals drive down wages.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  And so the globalists are masters at making money on both ends.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  Now, I'm going to go over the total proof of this when we come back on the other side.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  Foreign banks run America and they run the drugs, they run everything including the white slaves.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  Saving means to make money.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  you have to do something you've never done before.

[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  I can't stress this enough.

[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  and they really are calling the shots.
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  who do we make the checkout to?
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  You know, I grew up in Rockwall, Texas.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  My last few years of high school were here in Austin.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  We had to move down here because the police threw a lawyer,
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  called and told my dad that if we didn't move out of town,
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  they were going to arrest me and hang me in the jail cell.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  Because I didn't use drugs.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  I did drink some, not a lot, but you know, at parties
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  and Chew Tobacco and things like that because I was more of a jock.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  But I saw the police at parties over the years.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  I saw police deliver drugs and I talked about it
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  when they would be at the school with their drug dogs.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  I'd say, hey, you're a drug dealer.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  What are you doing here searching people?
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  And they would take me in the office and slam my head into the desk
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  and tell me that they were going to send me to prison
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  where I'd be raped and given AIDS.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  I mean, all this happened.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  So I've always known this.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  And then later the sheriff of Rockwall was at Jack or John McWhorter.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  You can look it up.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  Went to even Rolling Stone wrote about this.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  They believed me at first.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  And then they went and looked it up and or was it New York magazine?
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  I forget which one.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  Yeah, they went and looked it up and then indeed find all that happened.
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  So now I know why they were threatening to kill me that.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  But that wasn't the sheriff's department.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  That was a police department doing that.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  And so see, I've lived.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  I've seen things early on.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  And I guess the other young people thought it was normal
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  to have the cops deal in the drugs and then also putting people in jail for using them.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  See, I didn't think that was normal.
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  I had common sense or logic and I didn't like it.
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  I didn't like driving out of the school parking lot.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  The cops want to search my car and looking at them and going,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  you care about my six pack of beer?
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  I actually did.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.000]  Did this once.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  Yeah, I got a six pack of beer in here.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  I hadn't had in a week.
[22:05.000 --> 22:06.000]  It's underneath the seat.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  You're going to search and take me to jail for that.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  You drug dealer.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  You see, I live in the real world, ladies and gentlemen,
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  not in some fantasy land and it's going to be reality,
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  not fantasy that's going to save this Republic.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  Now, on record, if you go research the big mega prison companies,
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  they are wholly owned subsidiaries of the big mega banks that are on record
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  shipping and narcotics.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  Let me just give you some proof of that since I raised it.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Oh, here's one.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  U.S. government openly admits arming Mexican drug gangs with 30,000 firearms.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  Los Zetas kingpin.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  We bought guns directly from U.S. government.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  Here's another one.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  Holder lied.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  DOJ news release shows Obama administration approved ATF Mexico weapons smuggling.
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.000]  They were so dumb.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  They put it out as a press release a year and a half ago.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  Lying to Congress.
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  Congressman says unlikely Holder did not know about operation fast and furious.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  Yeah, now it's come out in the Associated Press that FBI and DEA were involved
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  in the quote Justice Department operation.
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  Continuing at least 40 killed in Mexico in 24 hour period.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  Houston Chronicle.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  Oh, here it is.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  Bloomberg.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  Banks financing Mexico gangs admitted Wells Fargo deal.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  And it's admitted that in a two year period, Wells Fargo and its owner,
[23:28.000 --> 23:38.000]  Wacovi and its owner Wells Fargo laundered 376 billion dollars and leased and ran the
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  aircraft.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  Well, we already knew that old Reuters back in 2007.
[23:44.000 --> 23:51.000]  And you can pull up the headline CIA torture jet wrecks with four tons of cocaine.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  It was pure cocaine coming directly from the source national securities.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  A great way to operate and see when some other group.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  The Colombians don't pay their cut.
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  I remember in 1999 Richard Grasso, the head of the New York Stock Exchange at the time in Reuters.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  Again, Reuters went and met with the head of the fart gorillas in Colombia and quote encouraged
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  him to invest his money.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  And it said a little known loophole allows this.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  Oh, yeah.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  Just like the big banks write the loopholes where they pay zero tax.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  Google pays 2.4.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  General Electric zero.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  They ride all the laws.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  They tax you than pay the money themselves.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  Continuing.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  And they told the head of the fart you invest with us or we're going to invade.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  He said no.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  U.S. military invaded.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  Go look it up.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Wasn't called a war called drug interdiction.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  And they have GPS airplanes spraying the cocoa fields that aren't owned and run by their drug dealers.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  And then of course they bombed with some hellfire missiles and killed the head of the fart.
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  And they said, we taught you, boy, you invest with us or you die.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  And the American people are so gullible and so naive that it's just all admitted out in the open.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  Even of the children, that's how we're seen as cattle like children.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  We're to read that.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  We don't know what we're reading.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  We don't understand it.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  It's so funny.
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  Now, continuing here, Eric Holder should go directly to prison.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  He should be indicted for lying under oath to Congress.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  It's a felony.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  The head of the ATF got caught lying when the emails came out.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  They were running the whole operation.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  He was going to get burned.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  So he's saying, look, I was under the orders of Eric Holder.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  Now the FBI, it's admitted, is involved.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  DEA, of course they are.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  My DEA source told us this six years ago.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  They sent in Los Zetas on record.
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  They said, oh, thousands of Los Zetas, Mexican commandos, were trained at Fort Benning, Georgia.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  And then in mass, the week Holder-Rone was elected.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  We told you about this six months before.
[25:54.000 --> 26:02.000]  The week after he was elected, they defect in mass and start their own cartel on the Texas border with the US government arming them.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Now confirmed.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  We told you this six years ago.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  Told you it was coming six years ago.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  Happened five years ago.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  The videos are all posted on infoworks.com.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  And on the All Show and Channel on YouTube, we've reposted those.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  Well, they've never been removed.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  You can see the timestamp date, and there they are.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Interviewing Selik Stilo in studio and others.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Just told you everything that was happening.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  So the Pentagon trains these brigades of Mexican troops they defect.
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  And now the Mexican government's gotten second thoughts and is starting to arrest some of them because it turns out the people that run our government,
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  I don't want to say US government, the criminal banks that run our country through the military industrial complex,
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  started having Los Zetas kill even Mexican officials that were supposedly part of the deal.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  So there's a double cross there.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  The bankers always double cross.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  So it's now in the news in major Mexican newspapers and in US papers.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  And we've got it all boiled down. Larry Pratt gunners of America sent us all their intel on Friday.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  We put it in the article.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Los Zetas kingpin.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  We bought guns directly from US government.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  And I had the gunners of America analysis that they sent to us to publish.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  It's all right there.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  You want to go read a six page report with everything detailed.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  Reuters, AP, all hidden in plain view.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  Go read it. Go read it. Go read it. Go read it.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  It's right there for everybody.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  Now, I want to go over more of this, but we're going to break here.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  How long do we got to break a minute or two?
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  A minute and a half. Let's go ahead first and play an ABC news clip.
[27:37.000 --> 27:47.000]  Let's play an ABC news clip from a year and a half ago where they spin the fact that our troops are helping grow the opium in Afghanistan.
[27:47.000 --> 27:53.000]  Here it is.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  Computers are hiccuping. Here it is.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  So here's the question. Why are American troops now helping Afghan farmers grow that opium?
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  Nick Schifrin reports from Afghanistan on a controversial new policy.
[28:06.000 --> 28:17.000]  In Western Kandahar, poppy farmers score, pill, harvest their crop, and the Americans do nothing to stop them.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  They grow it.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  U.S. soldiers greet farmers.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Can you show me which poppy field it is yours?
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  They commiserate with farmers having a bad harvest.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  Tell them I'm very sorry for this field here and hopefully it's a better harvest next year.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  And in one case, they even paid a farmer $1,000 after U.S. and Afghan special forces burned his crop.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  If you can come down to the base on my next visit, I'll make a payment.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  All right, stay there.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  This is controversial.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  Stay there. We're going to come back. This is all a whitewash.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  I'm going to break down the facts for you in one moment.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  We're in Afghanistan for the 500 bill in Schmack coming to your daughter's veins.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  If they catch her using it, they'll put her in a private banker-owned prison.
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.000]  Stay with us.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091

[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[31:00.000 --> 31:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[31:07.000 --> 31:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[31:20.000 --> 31:28.000]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[31:39.000 --> 31:45.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[31:45.000 --> 31:50.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[31:55.000 --> 31:59.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  You may be arrested, and your subject is to other police action.
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  Tyranny is here.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:11.000 --> 32:17.000]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[32:17.000 --> 32:21.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[32:23.000 --> 32:29.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[32:33.000 --> 32:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  It's here.

[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  By the way, my friends, I haven't even gotten into the meat and potatoes news yet.
[33:25.000 --> 33:33.000]  But if you studied history, you'd know that the Roosevelt family, the Forbes family,
[33:33.000 --> 33:40.000]  the Rockefeller family, Rockefeller started out, the dad of the supposed big founder,
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  John D. Rockefeller, was a snake oil salesman who sold Lodnam in the backs of Buggies.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  You know, the guys would get up and say, this will cure all your ails, grow your hair back, fix a broken leg.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  He was the first guy to launch fleets of those under a company name.
[33:56.000 --> 34:04.000]  So the issue is the drug dealers just made the stuff illegal in the 30s to then jack up prices.
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.000]  And you, I mean, it goes back 300 years ago to the British couldn't get into China.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  And so the Chinese wouldn't allow them to sell Indian opium into the country.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  They only allowed the British to come into one port.
[34:17.000 --> 34:24.000]  It took them over 100 years to corrupt the police and take over most of the major cities by bringing in the illegal drugs.
[34:24.000 --> 34:32.000]  And they learned that by the government keeping it illegal, that allowed them to make even bigger profits and take over the criminal networks.
[34:32.000 --> 34:42.000]  And they had two wars in the 1900s or 1800s, 1840s, 1860s, called the opium wars or the Boxer rebellion.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  This is mainline history.
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  And the very same interest, the British East India Company that had a near world monopoly on it.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  The French had a little bit of their own operation, but nothing compared to it.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  That's why the French were in control of Vietnam.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  That's where they got their opium.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  The British got theirs out of Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
[35:02.000 --> 35:09.000]  That's why the British were the last major colonial power before the Russians to be thrown out of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  And they would ship it in to China.
[35:12.000 --> 35:21.000]  And so now they've just made it illegal here because they learned how much bigger their profits were when something was illegal.
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  The Chinese did them a favor by making it illegal.
[35:24.000 --> 35:34.000]  That was how they got in there, made huge profits for decade after decade and slowly took over town by town as they got people addicted.
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.000]  Now continuing here, remember you got 500 billion a year in opium coming out of Afghanistan alone.
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.000]  Total drugs coming into the US, heroin, cocaine and marijuana, 500 billion.
[35:45.000 --> 35:53.000]  The Justice Department estimates 500 billion dollar street value.
[35:53.000 --> 36:07.000]  That's how you can have Wacovi and Wells Fargo on record in a two year period, 376 billion dollars running the aircraft, everything.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  What happened when they finally got caught because whistleblowers kept going coming forward?
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  A 100 million dollar fine, that's 0.3%.
[36:16.000 --> 36:25.000]  And I've likened it to robbing a bank and you come out with a million bucks and the cops say, give me $3,000 and you can go free.
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  I mean, this isn't a slap on the wrist.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  This is nothing.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  And the other big banks have all been caught over the years.
[36:34.000 --> 36:42.000]  Stop being naive, stop being stupid, decriminalize all of it now.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Take the profit out of it now, but side issue.
[36:46.000 --> 36:57.000]  The point here is the attorney general has been caught lying and it turns out they're so dumb they even put a press release out admitting they knew about this program a year and a half ago.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  That's now in the news.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  Well, I had remembered this.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  I had told listeners last week, other news agencies, I said go do the research.
[37:02.000 --> 37:21.000]  I remember covering it a year and a half ago when the attorney general came to Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada and gave speeches calling to shut down gun show, shut down gun shops, ban semi-autos because of the crime wave in Mexico and blaming it on the Second Amendment when they have a total gun ban in Mexico.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  When you have that, the people can't defend themselves only the criminals can operate.
[37:25.000 --> 37:36.000]  Now these Los Zetas people, when they get caught, another got caught in Chicago a few months ago, Chicago Tribune, another top Los Zetas guy and he came out with documents in federal court saying I work for the U.S. government.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Release me.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  It isn't the U.S. government.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  It's the criminals working inside the national security state.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  And now they're coming after your guns.
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.000]  They're shifting the drug war to the gun war against our Second Amendment.
[37:53.000 --> 38:00.000]  So we can live like the poor slaves in Mexico who don't have a right to defend themselves and only the criminals have the guns.
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  There's been over 30,000 dead in the last two and a half years in Mexico.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's more than died each year in Vietnam.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  Over a decade in Vietnam, we lost 58,000.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  In just a couple years, 30 plus thousand and growing.
[38:13.000 --> 38:21.000]  And now it came out this week in the news, what in the Phoenix paper and others that cops have been killed with these 30,000 guns.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  The cops are stopping cars with these guns in them with criminal drug dealers driving them.
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  Of course.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I forgot to print this off.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  Guys, can you search it?
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  It was in a bunch of New Mexico papers but didn't make it nationally.
[38:34.000 --> 38:41.000]  U.S. attorneys to drop prosecution of officials running guns.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  Mayors of major cities in New Mexico.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  What was one of them?
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  Columbus police chiefs running guns.
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  And they've declared national security and the U.S. attorneys in West Texas and New Mexico.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  It's a whole bunch of towns involved are having to drop the prosecution.
[38:59.000 --> 39:07.000]  They cannot prosecute them because they went ahead and said, do you understand I'm running an operation for the U.S. government?
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  I mean, these people get away with blood.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  Folks, don't believe me.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Just look all this stuff up.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  Look it up for yourself.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  Somebody's got to call shenanigans on this.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  Somebody, because here's the deal, they're getting more and more bold.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  They're getting more and more crazy.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Okay, let's finish those video clips.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  Now, first ABC whitewash is that, oh, since they damaged their crop, they paid for it.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  Then they cut it into the fact that they're actually helping them grow it.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  Again, they're just going public with something that's always happened.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  But so many troops were coming home.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  Well, some tried to.
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  The NFL star wrote letters home about the opium when it wasn't known.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  We knew that, of course, he got killed. It's now come out executed.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  But let's go ahead and play this clip from ABC News.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  Here it is.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  The Taliban lend the farmers the money.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  They are indebted to the Taliban.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  They have to grow the opium.
[40:02.000 --> 40:12.000]  Now the Marines in their success are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population is, you know, they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it.
[40:12.000 --> 40:21.000]  We are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now, the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real security risk.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  Let me introduce Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  He's the commanding officer of the Third Marines.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  This is Fox.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Really, a wonderful group of Marines here.
[40:29.000 --> 40:38.000]  I know that you care deeply about this contradiction, the fact that here you have one of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  And in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  I know it grinds at your gut.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  How do you deal with it?
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  What are you doing about it?
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  Well, frankly, this is a part of their culture.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  So while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  We provide them security.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  We're providing them resources and we're providing them alternatives.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  The alternatives are different crops to grow.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  They're getting the seed and the fertilizer.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Let's stop right there.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  I got a bunch of these clips.
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  That's Fox News, Heraldo, and we're going to go back to the ABC here in a moment.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  We're done with Fox now.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  You can watch the full clip on YouTube.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  You just type in U.S. soldiers grow opium heroin poppy in Afghanistan and it'll pull up for you.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  Also have it up on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  Link there.
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  Now this one is U.S. military helps terrorists grow heroin, U.S. funding Taliban.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  Now let's stop right there before I go any further.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  The British invaded Afghanistan hundreds of years ago to control this stuff
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  because the Russians, ours, and others were getting ahold of it and breaking their global monopoly.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  People wonder how the British, this little bit of Allen could take over.
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  A lot of it was they were selling opium worldwide and had addicts working for them
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  and ready to do whatever they were told.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  But here's the idea.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  They provide security.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  They go on.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  They provide fertilizer.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  They help them ship it out and quote then, interdict it once it gets here.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, CIA aircraft and others are constantly crashing.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  There's been Esquire articles a decade ago where cops in Miami bust a plane full of heroin,
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  planes full of cocaine in Houston.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  State police busted an 18-wheeler full of cocaine years ago.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  It was in the Associated Press on the Texas border.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  National security was declared and the cocaine was let go.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  I know Texas State police listing, remember that.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  This is ongoing.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  Only the low-level dealers get busted or cowboys that haven't paid their cut.
[42:33.000 --> 42:39.000]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to finish this other ABC news clip.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  But see, this is how dumb they think you are.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  The troops are all standing around guarding opium poppies so they get upset
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  and the spin is, well, if we don't do this, the Taliban and al-Qaeda will get it.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  Well, here's the deal.
[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  Opium production went from 10% of world supply out of Afghanistan in 2001 to 90-plus percent.
[42:58.000 --> 43:27.000]  That's right.
[43:28.000 --> 43:54.000]  That's right.
[43:54.000 --> 44:20.000]  That's right.
[44:20.000 --> 44:46.000]  That's right.
[44:46.000 --> 45:12.000]  That's right.
[45:12.000 --> 45:36.000]  That's right.
[45:36.000 --> 46:02.000]  That's right.
[46:02.000 --> 46:28.000]  That's right.
[46:28.000 --> 46:54.000]  That's right.
[46:54.000 --> 47:20.000]  That's right.
[47:20.000 --> 47:46.000]  That's right.
[47:46.000 --> 48:12.000]  That's right.
[48:12.000 --> 48:38.000]  That's right.
[48:38.000 --> 49:04.000]  That's right.
[49:04.000 --> 49:30.000]  That's right.
[49:30.000 --> 49:56.000]  That's right.
[49:56.000 --> 50:22.000]  That's right.
[50:22.000 --> 50:48.000]  That's right.
[50:48.000 --> 51:14.000]  That's right.
[51:14.000 --> 51:40.000]  That's right.
[51:40.000 --> 52:06.000]  That's right.
[52:06.000 --> 52:32.000]  That's right.
[52:32.000 --> 52:58.000]  That's right.
[52:58.000 --> 53:24.000]  That's right.
[53:24.000 --> 53:50.000]  That's right.
[53:50.000 --> 54:16.000]  That's right.
[54:16.000 --> 54:42.000]  That's right.
[54:42.000 --> 55:08.000]  That's right.
[55:08.000 --> 55:34.000]  That's right.
[55:34.000 --> 56:00.000]  That's right.
[56:00.000 --> 56:26.000]  That's right.
[56:26.000 --> 56:52.000]  That's right.
[56:52.000 --> 57:18.000]  That's right.
[57:18.000 --> 57:46.000]  That's right.
[57:46.000 --> 58:12.000]  That's right.
[58:12.000 --> 58:38.000]  That's right.
[58:38.000 --> 58:50.000]  That's right.
[58:50.000 --> 59:18.000]  That's right.
[59:18.000 --> 59:46.000]  That's right.
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  That's right.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  That's right.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  That's right.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  That's right.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  That's right.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  That's right.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  That's right.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  That's right.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  That's right.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  That's right.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  That's right.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  That's right.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  That's right.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  That's right.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  That's right.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  That's right.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  That's right.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  That's right.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  That's right.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  That's right.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  That's right.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  That's right.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  That's right.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  That's right.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  That's right.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  That's right.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  That's right.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  That's right.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  That's right.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  That's right.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  That's right.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  That's right.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  That's right.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  That's right.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  That's right.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  That's right.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  That's right.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  That's right.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  That's right.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  That's right.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  That's right.
