[00:00.000 --> 00:24.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:24.840 --> 00:40.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:40.640 --> 00:46.840]  It's Monday, August 23rd, the year is 2021.
[00:46.840 --> 00:57.480]  A day that will live in infamy coming to you from the embattled Infowars headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:57.480 --> 01:01.080]  Literally, thousands of scientists are on record now.
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.360]  We'll play some of them here in the next segment.
[01:03.360 --> 01:12.360]  Respected Oxford epidemiologist, urologist, former chief scientist at Pfizer, let's go on and on.
[01:12.360 --> 01:21.640]  The so-called vaccines are not vaccines and are designed to kill slowly with a variety of weapon systems.
[01:21.640 --> 01:28.360]  Those that take them, but more importantly, they're designed to then breed new variants of the viruses in the body.
[01:28.360 --> 01:30.800]  That's not debated, and it's not debated.
[01:30.800 --> 01:41.600]  The Delta variant and all the rest of this has come out of the experimental vaccines that have been used in the public.
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.200]  And here we are on the heels of the FDA true criminal organization.
[01:46.200 --> 01:49.560]  Same folks that oversaw the Tuskegee experiment, the rest of it.
[01:49.560 --> 01:53.960]  Grants full approval to Pfizer COVID vaccine.
[01:53.960 --> 01:56.480]  And now they're coming after the children.
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.080]  So we're issuing a global genocide alert.
[02:03.080 --> 02:12.240]  Thousands of top scientists have confirmed that the COVID injections are bio weapons designed to depopulate the planet.
[02:12.240 --> 02:20.760]  How many prominent scientists and medical doctors and virologists and epidemiologists that we had on saying the same thing?
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.720]  I've probably talked to 10 doctors the last five or six days just off air, and they are all completely blown away.
[02:26.720 --> 02:35.400]  Because it's not just all that evidence, it's the surgeon general just saying that basically the sky is red when it's blue.
[02:35.400 --> 02:37.720]  Saying, oh, natural immunity is not good.
[02:37.720 --> 02:40.520]  It doesn't work.
[02:40.520 --> 02:44.320]  And now they've officially had the FDA come out and say, I've got the article right here.
[02:44.320 --> 02:47.880]  Oh, there is no immunity naturally.
[02:47.880 --> 02:51.840]  It's like saying Alex Jones is not wearing a blue shirt right now.
[02:51.840 --> 02:55.440]  It's just on its face, not true.
[02:55.440 --> 02:56.920]  You understand that?
[02:56.920 --> 02:58.440]  And they're saying it about everything.
[02:58.440 --> 02:59.400]  They just lie.
[02:59.400 --> 03:02.600]  The PCR test that this was all based on was a lie.
[03:02.600 --> 03:08.240]  The scientists looked at it and said, but your real problem will be six to eight months after everybody takes these shots.
[03:08.240 --> 03:10.640]  That'll make their bodies into these mutation factories.
[03:10.640 --> 03:18.560]  This is a live virus injection, just like with the polio, the main cause of polio being the vaccines.
[03:18.560 --> 03:19.840]  And that's real science.
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.120]  And you tell the public that and they just can't get that the social contract's broken.
[03:24.120 --> 03:31.400]  And the equivalent of Hitler on steroids runs the UN and runs the Davos group, even though I've got a stack here that I'm going to read to you today,
[03:31.400 --> 03:42.240]  of Klaus Schwab's own quotes about capturing democracy and taking over nation states and not letting the people have any power and ruling us to get rid of.
[03:42.240 --> 03:43.680]  I mean, he says it all.
[03:43.680 --> 03:46.920]  And I look, I've talked about all this this weekend.
[03:46.920 --> 03:53.560]  I thought I'd review some of Klaus Schwab's own statements again from his own books, his own statements.
[03:53.560 --> 04:03.360]  You know, when Prince Philip said, I want to come back as a virus to kill 80% of the world population, when Prince Charles, his son that helps run the Davos group,
[04:03.360 --> 04:05.040]  says he agrees with that plan.
[04:05.040 --> 04:11.120]  These people don't just pop off because they like to just talk about world government.
[04:11.120 --> 04:17.920]  They didn't just build Georgia guide stones with Ted Turner, but Prince Charles reportedly put in some money and do it as well.
[04:17.920 --> 04:23.040]  They're on some of Ted Turner's old family land out there in Georgia.
[04:23.040 --> 04:25.120]  Right there on the side of the highway, I've been there.
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.880]  They didn't just do all that to play games.
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.920]  They've been preparing this forever and it's here.
[04:30.920 --> 04:35.000]  And so here's the really bad news.
[04:35.000 --> 04:35.960]  I've researched it.
[04:35.960 --> 04:36.920]  I've talked to a virologist.
[04:36.920 --> 04:40.440]  We've looked at it when people take the third round of the Pfizer injection.
[04:40.440 --> 04:41.720]  Israel already did.
[04:41.720 --> 04:43.160]  Then a super strain.
[04:43.160 --> 04:45.240]  They've already tested this on the laboratory.
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.600]  Super strains we released.
[04:46.600 --> 04:50.680]  And that's the real weapon that is going to be so incredibly dangerous.
[04:50.680 --> 04:54.240]  So we had the first Delta that cooked up.
[04:54.240 --> 05:00.280]  We have the original COVID-19 and then they have the new one they're about to release on us.
[05:00.280 --> 05:09.480]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade.
[05:09.480 --> 05:14.720]  And we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.600]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.880]  But when it comes to media, info wars has been the tip of that spear.
[05:21.880 --> 05:30.120]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[05:30.120 --> 05:37.880]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.

[05:45.960 --> 05:50.240]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[05:50.240 --> 05:56.400]  And if you do it, it funds the info war, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.120]  Mypillow.com promo code Alex, take action now.
[06:00.120 --> 06:22.120]  Global genocide alert, thousands of scientists confirmed COVID vaccines are designed to slowly kill their victims.
[06:22.120 --> 06:30.440]  And Ellen Schreyer, the house in the war room has reported war on corruption.
[06:30.440 --> 06:36.240]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:36.240 --> 06:54.760]  Ellen Schreyer has reported to federal jail here in Austin, Texas was taken in to have his belonging stripped away from him in a jumpsuit put on him because he stood peacefully at the Capitol while the left burns down the nation and destroys the planet.
[06:54.760 --> 07:08.360]  And Larry elders under investigation by California now, because he dares to come out and say once governor, he will repeal the vaccine mandate. It's been like him that are the answer to this tyranny. It's repealing these illegal laws.
[07:08.360 --> 07:16.520]  It's recalling these criminal globalist. That's why free and fair elections are so critical.
[07:16.520 --> 07:27.440]  The globalists love to throw it in our face. Look at this advertisement. They put out by the Veterans Coalition for vaccination. It has a perfect double meeting of your radio. Let's turn all describe it to you.
[07:27.440 --> 07:48.960]  It shows a muscled man imitating the famous we can do it female factory worker pose from World War Two said it says stick it to the enemy. Don't wait vaccinate Veterans Coalition for vaccination. But who are you really sticking? They're telling you you're sticking the enemy.
[07:48.960 --> 08:03.120]  Sticking the enemy. The enemy is we the people doesn't protect you, creates deadly variants, destroys your immune system is not a vaccine.
[08:03.120 --> 08:18.800]  But you're pressured to do it. And Biden just said last week he thinks you should take the booster. He's your doctor now. Now they're saying, oh, that's going to be mandatory now to because the FDA finally came out and said all this experimental injection that we just tested on the public.
[08:18.800 --> 08:26.400]  That's caused that's caused more deaths.
[08:26.400 --> 08:34.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, then all previous vaccines combined on the government's own bears reporting system.
[08:34.120 --> 08:44.000]  And Europe has a similar system that shows the exact same type of numbers and the UK the same numbers and all the world in Russia and in China and in India.
[08:44.000 --> 08:57.920]  They won't take the vaccines. They won't take our so called shots. Australia is only 25% injected and their government says you're not going to leave your house till you take the shots.
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.400]  And now it's on the even Australian news. People try to get groceries delivered. There are no groceries.
[09:02.400 --> 09:11.320]  They try to order food in even if they're given a government check. There's no one to bring the food because no one can work. No one can go out. The society's breaking down.
[09:11.320 --> 09:17.880]  And now all over the Western world, who leaders say we like dictatorship like Trudeau.
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.120]  And if you don't take the vaccine, you can't have a job or go on a plane to leave your house.
[09:23.120 --> 09:29.320]  They're even saying, don't look at the sunset. Don't go in your backyard. Don't talk to your neighbors. They're beyond Jim Jones.
[09:29.320 --> 09:37.880]  Holt leaders. Oh, but he's a pretty boy wearing a letter jacket like he's the high school quarterback.
[09:37.880 --> 09:46.840]  Unbelievable. So here's the huge news. FDA grants full approval to Pfizer COVID vaccine and everything that means.
[09:46.840 --> 09:51.720]  The White House says boosters for all. Here's what you need to know. Oh, really?
[09:51.720 --> 09:57.640]  Oh, well, the other shots didn't work. So here's another. How did Bill Gates originally say he knew you'd need this one within eight months?
[09:57.640 --> 10:06.920]  He said that a year and a half ago because these aren't vaccines. This is a plan to infect us with prion disease and give us autoimmune disease.
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.080]  And then it doesn't matter if you don't take the shot because then they just infect you.
[10:11.080 --> 10:18.720]  And that's in all the literature, a big stack of Nobel Prize winners saying it would do this and now it has.
[10:18.720 --> 10:22.080]  But people go, well, why would the government corporations do that?
[10:22.080 --> 10:28.000]  Why would Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly ship out millions of aisles of factor eight that had HIV and hepatitis in it?
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.080]  Well, it was in corporate minutes. They even had stenographers recorded saying there's too many hemophiliacs.
[10:34.080 --> 10:40.520]  Let's just get rid of them. Look it up. I've been Bayer blood scandal.
[10:40.520 --> 10:44.560]  Imagine what it feels like to be sociopathic to actually enjoy killing people.
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.560]  You see, they say sociopaths don't have any feelings. No, they like it.
[10:49.560 --> 10:57.440]  And there it is. Bayer knowingly infected people with HIV. But that's OK.
[10:57.440 --> 11:05.960]  So that's all coming up here today. But I want to just start with medical doctors right up front. There's so many clips of them going to city councils,
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.560]  going to county commensure courts, going to legislatures where they can still speak because they know it's going viral there.
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.240]  And this shows a welcome place for these folks as well. I want to get him on.
[11:15.240 --> 11:21.680]  He's Dr. Sean Brooks, Oxford train PhD.
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.840]  Explaining that this is what's going to happen to people that have taken it. We know from the mouth studies.
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.800]  Depending on the study, 70 to 80 plus percent of the mice were dead within a year.
[11:31.800 --> 11:34.600]  These are young mice that should have lived five years.
[11:34.600 --> 11:41.520]  And they did other animal studies and we know just with one problem, it causes that it's a death sentence.
[11:41.520 --> 11:44.040]  So you got to ask, how do they get away with it?
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.960]  They're going to say new viruses did it. They're going to say the unvaccinated spread those.
[11:48.960 --> 11:54.720]  And that's why everybody's about to die, even though it's going to be mainly the vaccinated that are going to be dying.
[11:54.720 --> 11:57.800]  Here's what the doctor had to say to a city council and speak.
[11:57.800 --> 12:02.600]  I think we should be respectful of each other.
[12:02.600 --> 12:10.360]  The next person.
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.280]  Brother disappointed.
[12:14.280 --> 12:19.800]  My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, PhD, Oxford.
[12:19.800 --> 12:28.000]  I have 48 publications, including 23 books have studied health, medicine, anatomy and physiology for approximately 21 years.
[12:28.000 --> 12:37.520]  Dr. Robert Malone, who created the messenger RNA vaccine has said no one should ever take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever.
[12:37.520 --> 12:40.640]  He created it and he says, don't ever do it.
[12:40.640 --> 12:44.880]  So let me explain what's going to happen to the people who have taken it. Excuse me.
[12:44.880 --> 12:51.040]  The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six months to three to five years for three reasons.
[12:51.040 --> 12:57.520]  Number one, you have dramatically decreased your own immune system by 35%.
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.520]  The first jab did it by at least 15. The second did it by 35.
[13:01.520 --> 13:05.120]  Now, if you take any booster shot, you will die.
[13:05.120 --> 13:10.320]  That's it. You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[13:10.320 --> 13:18.880]  The second reason antibody dependent enhancement and antibody dependent enhancement is what is happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them.
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.160]  Unless, of course, you've taken a placebo, but there's no way that you would know that.
[13:23.160 --> 13:31.760]  So given that fact, antibody dependent enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that the cell that's eating the pathogen is eating it when it isn't.
[13:31.760 --> 13:37.880]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm, which causes organ failure.
[13:37.880 --> 13:42.760]  That will cause your death, and there's no stopping that. No amount of drugs will stop that.
[13:42.760 --> 13:48.280]  The third thing, blood clotting. Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.960]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out. Take what's called a de dimer test.
[13:53.960 --> 13:59.560]  What that does is that detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[13:59.560 --> 14:03.480]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now, as I'm talking to you.
[14:03.480 --> 14:12.800]  Millions have died from the jabs. In your last meeting, you advocated for people to take the jabs potentially in the future, along with wearing masks.
[14:12.800 --> 14:21.760]  And I heard parents say the same thing. So to the parents who are actually considering jabbing their own children, you're going to sterilize them permanently.
[14:21.760 --> 14:25.000]  People who have taken the jabs are sterilized.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.280]  80% of women who have been jabbed have lost their children in the first trimester.
[14:31.280 --> 14:37.560]  You can't have kids. You've also injected yourself with the equivalent of HIV.
[14:37.560 --> 14:45.320]  You can now no longer breastfeed, donate blood, donate organs, donate blood plasma, nor bone marrow.
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.720]  If you don't believe me, try to donate blood and blood plasma and find out what happens.
[14:50.720 --> 14:59.680]  You will be denied, unless of course you live in California, in which case they're allowing people to donate toxic blood with spike proteins in it.
[14:59.680 --> 15:05.440]  The jabs create spike proteins. They're in the jabs themselves.
[15:05.440 --> 15:13.720]  And they create it by snapping your RNA in half. You are no longer a human anymore. You are something else.
[15:13.720 --> 15:16.920]  And you are susceptible to countless diseases.
[15:16.920 --> 15:19.920]  Now, here's what's going to happen in the future very quickly.
[15:19.920 --> 15:21.440]  You have 15 seconds.
[15:21.440 --> 15:27.960]  Great. I don't know what percentage of your staff has taken the jabs, but your school is going to close. You will not stay open.
[15:27.960 --> 15:31.400]  You will close because they will fall ill and they will die.
[15:31.400 --> 15:34.480]  That will happen in all of your buildings. It's already happening.
[15:34.480 --> 15:35.680]  All right. Thank you, sir.
[15:35.680 --> 15:39.800]  I bet it is. It's already happening. Good luck. Nothing can stop us.
[15:39.800 --> 15:41.760]  Thank you, sir.
[15:41.760 --> 15:47.320]  Good luck. That's a real doctor, PhD from Oxford. He just told you. I'm telling you, this is it.
[15:47.320 --> 15:50.680]  They launched the attack. It's the equivalent of a nuclear war.
[15:50.680 --> 15:53.560]  You understand? Get ready, folks. Dig in.
[15:53.560 --> 15:56.840]  Society's going to collapse. It's all over.
[15:56.840 --> 15:59.160]  Stay with us.
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.040]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[16:04.040 --> 16:07.560]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.520]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.560]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:17.560 --> 16:22.760]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes,
[16:22.760 --> 16:26.600]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.600 --> 16:31.160]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid,
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.160]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.160 --> 16:41.240]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.080]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.160]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling,
[16:49.160 --> 16:55.480]  how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:55.480 --> 16:58.360]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:58.360 --> 17:03.560]  Hey, everybody. If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,
[17:03.560 --> 17:07.240]  I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.440]  Here's the thing. We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans,
[17:12.440 --> 17:16.520]  survival soup beans. These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious,
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.960]  and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:21.960 --> 17:27.880]  The best part? We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food
[17:27.880 --> 17:32.360]  prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:32.360 --> 17:37.400]  Gets even better. With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[17:37.400 --> 17:43.400]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood
[17:43.400 --> 17:49.960]  in the world, period. Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the
[17:49.960 --> 17:57.160]  real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.240]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds. I was overweight.
[18:05.240 --> 18:10.040]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a job, and I heard
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.200]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[18:14.200 --> 18:18.520]  shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that.
[18:18.520 --> 18:21.800]  Do you have, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[18:21.800 --> 18:28.200]  So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.320]  enlightened. You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again. And over the course
[18:33.320 --> 18:37.960]  of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[18:37.960 --> 18:42.760]  supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout.
[18:42.760 --> 18:46.680]  It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway,
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.320]  so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[18:51.320 --> 18:54.920]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[18:54.920 --> 18:58.280]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.560]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action. And there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[19:05.560 --> 19:10.040]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating
[19:10.040 --> 19:15.560]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[19:15.560 --> 19:21.080]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked
[19:21.080 --> 19:27.080]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken
[19:27.080 --> 19:32.280]  from the spell, we know this is all really happening. And it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.960]  But there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[19:37.960 --> 19:43.400]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually
[19:43.400 --> 19:48.520]  will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare,
[19:48.520 --> 19:54.440]  get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds,
[19:54.440 --> 19:59.320]  shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[19:59.320 --> 20:10.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:10.760 --> 20:36.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide here on this Monday,
[20:36.440 --> 20:44.520]  August 23rd, 2021 broadcast. Okay. So the globalists wrote all these white papers. They constantly
[20:44.520 --> 20:48.600]  talked about it. They prepared world government. They set up control systems. They said we'll use
[20:48.600 --> 20:53.240]  a virus to bring in world government. And then we'll use that as a pretext to depopulate people
[20:53.240 --> 20:57.880]  with the supposed treatments we give them. And the public will want to be victims. They'll want
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.440]  to think that we're their mommy and their daddy. And we'll come in and we'll induce Stockholm syndrome
[21:02.440 --> 21:07.480]  on them and then we'll slowly kill them while we suck the money out of them. And right now,
[21:07.480 --> 21:10.760]  they're just bullying the medical profession, the doctors and the nurses and the system
[21:11.320 --> 21:15.000]  to get them in line to cover this up. I've talked to a lot of medical doctors
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.960]  on air and off air who when their patients come in sick from the vaccines that aren't vaccines,
[21:20.520 --> 21:26.040]  they're told, don't talk about it or you're fired. Global genocide alert. Thousands of scientists
[21:26.040 --> 21:33.960]  confirm public vaccines are designed to slowly kill their victims. Now the criminal FDA has given
[21:33.960 --> 21:39.240]  approval to the experimental spike protein injection that each state moves to its next target,
[21:39.880 --> 21:47.400]  children and babies. And yes, Owen Schreuer has reported the federal jail to the left's
[21:47.400 --> 21:54.520]  incredibles happiness in Austin, Texas for trying to stop the riot at the Capitol
[21:54.520 --> 22:03.000]  that the left of the FBI ran and controlled. That is America in the middle of 2021. I just aired
[22:04.440 --> 22:12.600]  Dr. Dean Brooks, Oxford scientist, Southwest Ohio school board meeting,
[22:14.040 --> 22:19.080]  told them that the jabs are going to do to them. And he laid out in just three minutes with them
[22:19.080 --> 22:27.640]  interrupting exactly what's going on. I'm going to make that the featured video on band.video
[22:27.640 --> 22:35.160]  right in the middle section. And I want everybody to get it at band.video. Right now it's in the
[22:35.160 --> 22:42.120]  Titans of Liberty channel. You know the left hand corner, click on the left hand nav bar.
[22:42.120 --> 22:46.120]  You'll see all the different channels. It's in the Titans of Liberty channel. Great folks.
[22:46.120 --> 22:51.640]  Dr. Sean Brooks warns vaccinated will die soon. I want to get him on tomorrow.
[22:54.760 --> 22:59.320]  I want to call him now. I want to get him on because he crystallized in three minutes. I want
[22:59.320 --> 23:04.120]  to get him on for a full hour or two hours or a commercial free emergency special where we'll
[23:04.120 --> 23:08.120]  have all the evidence which we have right here already but he's a doctor and we'll go through
[23:08.120 --> 23:13.000]  each one of his claims for 20 minutes made four claims. They're all completely true.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.520]  So your future my future depends on the public fully awakening the fact
[23:19.560 --> 23:26.760]  that this is a biological attack viral video. Dr. Sean Brooks warns vaccinated will die soon.
[23:28.520 --> 23:32.600]  It's what happened to the rats but again they're going to claim new variants are doing it. They're
[23:32.600 --> 23:39.480]  going to claim new viruses are doing it. That's why they have to say oh sorry your vaccine didn't
[23:39.480 --> 23:44.360]  protect you because other people didn't take the shot. That's what Biden's saying. It's what
[23:44.360 --> 23:50.760]  Trudeau's saying. It's what Merkel's saying. They're all saying oh your vaccine didn't work
[23:50.760 --> 23:55.800]  which isn't a vaccine because other people didn't take it and so you got sick from them. Well I
[23:55.800 --> 24:01.240]  thought you were protected because you took it and they're on TV saying oh you get no immunity
[24:01.240 --> 24:06.920]  if you've ever had this and gotten over it from a vaccine even though that flies against science
[24:06.920 --> 24:13.480]  and virology and epidemiology and immunity and history and we have endless scientists to tell
[24:13.480 --> 24:19.400]  you that. It's not a debate like what temperature does water freeze at? What temperature does water
[24:19.400 --> 24:27.000]  boil at? We know that natural immunity is 10, 20, 50 depending times better
[24:29.560 --> 24:33.960]  than from an inoculation but this is an inoculation. This is a gene therapy
[24:33.960 --> 24:37.960]  and they've got incredibly good gene therapies that still have side effects.
[24:38.520 --> 24:43.320]  I mean Regeneron's got stuff that cures skin cancer. Confirmed. Regeneron,
[24:44.840 --> 24:51.160]  I know somebody got COVID, tested positive three times, went and got Regeneron in Austin,
[24:51.160 --> 24:55.640]  now available for the general public. Four hours later no symptoms, no coughing, just
[24:55.640 --> 25:03.640]  now that's cloned white blood cells from mice programmed and trained to go out and kill only
[25:03.640 --> 25:11.000]  COVID. You got emergency authorization. Is it going to have side effects? Who knows?
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.080]  Does it work? Absolutely. Does the science show that it's a gene therapy only putting into you
[25:17.080 --> 25:22.840]  artificial white blood cells? Does that sound something like it's safe? Well if I was about
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.640]  to die I might do it and that company's been around since the 80s. They got a bunch of proven
[25:27.640 --> 25:34.840]  products. Their business is not killing people like the UN and Pfizer and Moderna and Moderna is DARPA.
[25:38.280 --> 25:41.400]  Regeneron antibody cocktail offers COVID protection.
[25:43.080 --> 25:46.440]  Wow, you read it? M, WebMD there? Yeah, it's true. I know people taking it.
[25:46.440 --> 25:52.680]  The governor took it and a couple days later tested negative. This stuff puts in millions
[25:53.800 --> 25:57.960]  of cloned white blood cells into your body.
[26:00.600 --> 26:03.800]  And they got some versions that are from dead fetuses as well.
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.640]  Those are what they call immortal cell lines. Most cell lines don't last very long. There's
[26:10.200 --> 26:13.800]  a few human cell lines that basically never go away. They can just keep cloning them,
[26:13.800 --> 26:17.160]  keep growing them, but they have a bunch of immortal mice cell lines they use and
[26:17.160 --> 26:22.200]  provided a lot of research with the weekend. The current Regeneron is from mice.
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.640]  And I don't have a better feeling about putting mice white blood cells in me than some dead baby.
[26:29.640 --> 26:36.280]  What about you? But the point is, is that that's a real therapeutic. May have problems. You should
[26:36.280 --> 26:41.880]  research it. But in all the, so all these experts I talked to, they're like no Regeneron looks pretty
[26:41.880 --> 26:46.840]  safe. We're not 100% sure, but you know, it's a real thing. It doesn't program your body.
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.400]  It puts something else inside that goes around and kills everything. And then it basically dies
[26:51.400 --> 26:53.640]  and passes out of your body.
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.480]  All the experts, literally almost all of them, I'm actually proud of our medical community
[27:01.480 --> 27:05.640]  in the world. They come out and go, whoa, do not take these shots. It's not going to work.
[27:06.920 --> 27:10.040]  And it's going to lower your immunity, give you all these diseases and illnesses. And then it
[27:10.040 --> 27:17.800]  does that. And we're here. Everything, all those scientists, the Nobel Prize winner and the former
[27:17.800 --> 27:22.040]  head of Pfizer and the head of the EU advisory board, everything they said word for word, they
[27:22.040 --> 27:27.240]  said this will probably make women have menstrual cycles all the time and cause all sorts of bleeding
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.040]  and injury, endometriosis and the body will then attack the uterus and women will have to have
[27:32.040 --> 27:41.800]  hysterectomies and mass. Dr. Wolfgang Wundar, Dr. Michael Yedon. I mean, they both said that
[27:42.440 --> 27:47.880]  a year ago and exactly that happened because they're top scientists.
[27:50.200 --> 27:56.040]  So again, if I load a bullet in a gun, a 357 or a 45 or whatever and walk over and shoot you in
[27:56.040 --> 28:02.520]  the head, it's probably going to kill you. It's going to blow a hole in your head. It's going to hurt.
[28:02.520 --> 28:09.320]  And so it's not like we were speculating. That's what this does. That's what this does. And that's
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.520]  why I'm officially so freaked out. I had trouble doing the show. To just sit up and calmly talk
[28:14.520 --> 28:23.880]  about all this. You see that medical doctor speaking to these people and he's warning them.
[28:23.880 --> 28:29.640]  He's saying it's all over. Do you understand? And he knows they're laughing at him. He just shakes
[28:29.640 --> 28:35.400]  his head and puts his hands out and walks off because they're such sheep. They can't believe
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.120]  it was done to them. And now they want our children. Now they're coming for babies and the
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.480]  left's lining up to inject their children. And when their children are all dying in six months
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.480]  of years, two or three years, you know, we live longer than mice, the effects take longer.
[28:47.480 --> 28:52.200]  They'll blame us. The unvaccinated watch. That's the whole plan. They got this all figured out.
[28:52.200 --> 28:56.920]  You figured out how this works yet? Talk about how to stop it straight ahead.
[29:22.520 --> 29:28.040]  BASE substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.040 --> 29:33.400]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[29:33.400 --> 29:38.600]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research

[33:20.080 --> 33:28.200]  Bella's gone. I'm awake. When you wake up in the matrix, wow. The question is, is it
[33:28.200 --> 33:34.640]  too late? We're going to talk about Owen Schreuer delivering himself up to the federal
[33:34.640 --> 33:41.480]  jail in downtown Austin. Here in just a moment with his former co-host who's also been a
[33:41.480 --> 33:45.560]  political president, Roger Stone, in the next hour, I'm going to play on the actual studies,
[33:45.560 --> 33:49.440]  the actual documents of where this is going with the FDA now approving the experimental
[33:49.440 --> 33:53.920]  deadly Pfizer shot and saying they're going to try to force her by to take endless boosters,
[33:53.920 --> 33:58.600]  which each time lower your immune system even more. The mainline scientist is saying it's
[33:58.600 --> 34:04.960]  a death sentence. And we have the animal studies we know. I mean, it's hard to believe they
[34:04.960 --> 34:11.080]  actually did it. Even I can't believe it. I am completely dumbfounded. Most of me just
[34:11.080 --> 34:16.080]  wants to buy a small log cabin somewhere in the middle of nowhere, which I have. I'm
[34:16.080 --> 34:22.280]  just finishing up a little cheap trailer and getting the well in and stuff like that. But
[34:22.280 --> 34:25.680]  part of me just wants to completely disappear, but that's not going to happen. They've got
[34:25.680 --> 34:28.840]  a societal collapse plan here where we're going to have to face this out on and stop
[34:28.840 --> 34:33.920]  it. Or our fate is worse than what you see in Australia that is over the top stuff that
[34:33.920 --> 34:39.600]  I don't even believe we'll be covering that next hour separately. Please remember, as
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.640]  long as we can stay on air, we're going to. And as everything we talked about comes true,
[34:43.640 --> 34:49.560]  infowars is more important than ever. So please keep spreading the links from freeworldnews.tv
[34:49.560 --> 34:54.240]  and band on video, same site, but freeworldnews.tv is a URL that's not being censored as much
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.320]  and able to get out more freeworldnews.tv. And then infowarstore.com. It's been sold

[36:07.520 --> 36:11.800]  liquid extract out there, 50% off. And we have our hair and beard support. It's also great
[36:11.800 --> 36:15.520]  for women's nails in here. And it's just a really strong volt multivitamin, mineral
[36:15.520 --> 36:22.520]  as well. But specifically for that, that's our newest product. That's 50% off as well.
[36:22.520 --> 36:27.920]  Our call toll free triple a two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And that makes this
[36:27.920 --> 36:41.600]  entire transmission possible. All right, it is. It is surreal to have had the fed send
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.640]  me all these subpoenas on multiple issues in the last two years trying to indict me.
[36:46.640 --> 36:49.800]  It's been surreal to have them question so many people that have called me and said that
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.480]  the feds came to their house and asked about me. It's surreal to see Roger Stone set up
[36:55.480 --> 37:01.560]  and SWAT teamed and put through that whole kangaroo court trial for being a quote liar
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.360]  in a Congress. And then the media say he was convicted of being a Russian agent when the
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.680]  trial wasn't even about that. And then to see him pardoned by the president. And then
[37:09.680 --> 37:15.840]  again, it's surreal to see Owen Schreuer, who went to the Capitol with us, didn't even
[37:15.840 --> 37:20.280]  get on the bullhorn was with us trying to stop people on January six going into building.
[37:20.280 --> 37:26.200]  We have police authorization to do that on video. And the feds use the very videos of
[37:26.200 --> 37:33.280]  Alex Jones and crew try to stop riot of us doing that and charge him with breaking into
[37:33.280 --> 37:40.240]  the Capitol. I mean, it's a lie. And so Roger Stone's got a take on this of why on the same
[37:40.240 --> 37:45.800]  day Friday that Reuters had a big article of the FBI saying we were exonerated. Roger
[37:45.800 --> 37:51.880]  Stone, Trump myself. And then hours later in the afternoon, they have this thing on
[37:51.880 --> 37:56.080]  the shelf and they issue an arrest warrant for Owen Schreuer and call his lawyers, say,
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.480]  you know, call us and say, come turn yourself in or, you know, we'll basically come after
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.520]  you. So I guess they gave us that at least they didn't want the crazy image of SWAT teaming
[38:05.520 --> 38:12.040]  us over standing at the Capitol outside. So Roger, we have 600 plus political prisoners,
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.280]  many of which didn't raise a fist or do it. They were just waved into the Capitol, maybe
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.320]  20 of them actually attacked the police. We don't support that. But this is really dangerous.
[38:21.320 --> 38:25.080]  This precedent is now we learned it's not just Owen. They're now arresting other people
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.720]  that were just seen outside the Capitol. They're now moving out and expanding that.
[38:30.720 --> 38:37.960]  Well, let's kind of start at the beginning immediately after January 6 and four months,
[38:37.960 --> 38:43.680]  the mainstream media, particularly ABC News, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington
[38:43.680 --> 38:50.200]  Post and then the low rents like, you know, Seth Abramson and these other sub-stack lunatics
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.960]  have insisted over and over again that both you and I were somehow complicit or had advanced
[38:56.960 --> 39:05.400]  knowledge of the frankly boneheaded and counterproductive and illegal actions at the Capitol on January
[39:05.400 --> 39:13.160]  6. I put out as categorical a statement as I could, but that didn't stop the use of guilt
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.880]  by association in this constant drum beat that, you know, stone is about to be arrested.
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.120]  Stone, stone, you know, his pardon doesn't cover this. I think it's pretty clear. I've
[39:24.120 --> 39:31.040]  made it very clear. I never left the grounds of my hotel on the 6th. I have no knowledge
[39:31.040 --> 39:36.760]  either in advance or in real time other than what I saw on TV. And I immediately posted
[39:36.760 --> 39:43.540]  a denunciation of it. I've spent 40 years working in elections. I'm not in favor of
[39:43.540 --> 39:49.280]  mob rule. I'm in favor of winning elections. I'm committed to our democratic system. And
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.480]  in human psychology, past behavior is most indicative of future behavior.
[39:54.480 --> 40:00.000]  Well, but this is a continued campaign for harassment. Look, it's not a secret that the
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.560]  Mueller investigation put enormous stress on me and my family. Unless you're General
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.440]  Flynn or Paul Manafort or a handful of others, I don't think you can really understand it.
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.120]  They virtually bankrupted us. We lost our home, our car, most of our insurance, our savings,
[40:16.120 --> 40:21.800]  then to go from and then once I was pardoned and theoretically could get back on my feet
[40:21.800 --> 40:27.880]  economically, then the Justice Department who bankrupts me hits me with a completely
[40:27.880 --> 40:34.880]  bogus civil complaint regarding back taxes in which in all honesty, every single assertion
[40:34.880 --> 40:41.280]  by the government in their in their complaint is is provably incorrect. But it's written
[40:41.280 --> 40:47.560]  in such a sensationalized way that it implies that I evaded taxes. My wife and I know exactly
[40:47.560 --> 40:50.840]  Roger, but specifically you're giving them background. What do you make of why they did
[40:50.840 --> 40:54.880]  this Friday? Why they came out and exonerated us? Tucker thinks it's just they want to cover
[40:54.880 --> 40:59.000]  up that there was involved by the FBI staging it. So by saying it wasn't organized that
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.200]  they think that protects them and then they just burned Owen as a distraction from that.
[41:03.200 --> 41:08.600]  Well, see, I think this is a continuation of this same campaign of I to operation. So
[41:08.600 --> 41:14.080]  for with for months, I have lived with the allegation Blair on the front pages of ABC
[41:14.080 --> 41:20.880]  News and and these newspapers insisting using solely guilt by association that I and you
[41:20.880 --> 41:28.720]  had some involvement. This is to keep economic pressure on you. I'm not sure that that the
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.160]  quote in Reuters, which essentially said there was no evidence against us, was an authorized
[41:34.160 --> 41:41.520]  quote. I do know Mark Rosenbaal, the Reuters reporter who wrote that story, that story,
[41:41.520 --> 41:47.040]  and he is a tough customer. I mean, he is he is a scrupulously honest and I think generally
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.040]  speaking, fair journalist. Once in a while, I quibble with something that he has written.
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.320]  But by and large, I have a lot of respect for he's a unicorn. He's pretty rare. Well,
[41:57.320 --> 42:01.600]  I think I think he's trying to do his job as a journalist. And he has obviously a very
[42:01.600 --> 42:07.400]  solid source that told him no, Stone and Jones, you know, there's no evidence against them
[42:07.400 --> 42:11.880]  or anyone else connected with Trump. Now, we've been saying this for months, but that
[42:11.880 --> 42:17.920]  doesn't mean anything because the this this cloud that they've had over our heads is meant
[42:17.920 --> 42:25.160]  to further cancel and economically strangle us, not to mention doing away with our further
[42:25.160 --> 42:32.240]  justifying the suspension of our free speech rights. I think that this this confirmation
[42:32.240 --> 42:38.480]  by the government may not have been an authorized one may have been a leak doesn't make it any
[42:38.480 --> 42:45.120]  less accurate. And therefore, it occurred to me that they may have sped up the indictment
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.040]  of Owen Schroder. Now, I haven't read the indictment. It appeared to me like they charged
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.960]  him with violation. Stay right there. We'll come right back with
[42:53.960 --> 43:03.440]  under stone. I'm Alex Jones. I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid April 2021. And
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.800]  I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.600]  that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.560]  and thankful for all of you, the listeners of the show. I want you to know that I love
[43:15.560 --> 43:19.960]  you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black,
[43:19.960 --> 43:24.400]  it doesn't matter you got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.200]  our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together. And it has just been an
[43:29.200 --> 43:34.000]  incredible experience to work with you over the years. And as crazier things are, I want
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.040]  to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.520]  please, I hope God works through you and put some message in your heart and support
[43:43.520 --> 43:46.920]  us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.440]  you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done. And just ask you
[43:51.440 --> 43:56.080]  again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your
[43:56.080 --> 43:59.040]  heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[43:59.040 --> 44:01.960]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now. If you
[44:01.960 --> 44:07.520]  haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything.
[44:07.520 --> 44:10.600]  Sometimes you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a
[44:10.600 --> 44:14.360]  crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is
[44:14.360 --> 44:18.080]  my favorite and all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life,
[44:18.080 --> 44:23.560]  taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes
[44:23.560 --> 44:28.000]  up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.560]  I'm going to wake up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.320]  that guy over there healthier, happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari
[44:35.320 --> 44:38.440]  and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.880]  never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve
[44:41.880 --> 44:45.160]  your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and
[44:45.160 --> 44:48.760]  that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[44:48.760 --> 44:51.600]  I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to go to info wars.com, take
[44:51.600 --> 44:55.200]  control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing.
[44:55.200 --> 44:58.320]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force
[44:58.320 --> 45:04.320]  is good. The first time I heard the speech, the first
[45:04.320 --> 45:10.280]  time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade and we had this history
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.560]  teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena. And I just remember thinking
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.680]  about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena. But when it comes to media,
[45:19.680 --> 45:24.520]  info wars has been the tip of that spear. But Mike Lindell has come along and done just
[45:24.520 --> 45:29.400]  as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other
[45:29.400 --> 45:36.400]  issues. And that's why if you go to mypelo.com, use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off

[46:00.320 --> 46:05.120]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[46:05.120 --> 46:11.200]  from beta testing to operational. The globalist are out on the open with their planetary depopulation
[46:11.200 --> 46:15.480]  takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been
[46:15.480 --> 46:19.800]  working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[46:19.800 --> 46:24.520]  to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.760]  attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.120]  we will defeat it. So prayer is essential. Research is essential. Getting prepared is
[46:33.120 --> 46:37.880]  essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[46:37.880 --> 46:42.040]  info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're
[46:42.040 --> 46:46.520]  great products for you and your family. And they're also funding our operation info wars

[47:00.040 --> 47:14.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.440 --> 47:41.240]  The smell of Pfizer death.
[47:41.240 --> 48:00.520]  Roger Stone, the former political president pardoned by Trump is here. And he was building
[48:00.520 --> 48:06.120]  up to Owen going to jail. He hadn't read the United States court arrest warrant criminal
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.640]  complaint. I've got it right here for TV viewers. And I'm not joking. While Roger talks, I'll
[48:11.640 --> 48:17.480]  pull up the part here that I reread it, which says broke into the Capitol physically. I'll
[48:17.480 --> 48:21.880]  read the exact words. It's in here. And that that is a complete lie. And then Roger was
[48:21.880 --> 48:26.040]  saying, Yeah, that's like their latest civil suit against me, the IRS. They go, Oh, look,
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.200]  here he is at the Capitol. Alex Jones. That's a promo piece put out. So there he is at the
[48:30.200 --> 48:35.080]  Capitol protesting. He's arrested. That's their evidence. They go, Look, it's him. Okay.
[48:35.080 --> 48:40.920]  It's like it's like it's a cartoon characters created this. Look, here's Owen breaking into
[48:40.920 --> 48:46.120]  the Capitol. They say video Alex Jones tries to stop storming DC Capitol. They list. This is us
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.400]  at that's not even at the Capitol. That's on a grassy note. So just all of it is pure crap.
[48:52.280 --> 48:58.920]  Oh, look, there he is again, which begs the question, Well, why aren't arrested? So Roger,
[48:58.920 --> 49:02.600]  you've got the floor. We got 10 minutes left. But I while you're reading, I will or while
[49:02.600 --> 49:07.880]  you're talking, I will read this and pull that up. Go ahead. Look, this is this is part and
[49:07.880 --> 49:15.400]  partial of what we've seen in terms of the prosecution of all of those people involved
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.600]  in this. I mean, their civil rights are being violated. People as far as I can tell are being
[49:20.600 --> 49:28.440]  held without being charged. There is no evidence that there were any weapons in the in the Capitol
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.920]  other that saved the one that an officer used to shoot an unarmed woman. This is looks to me
[49:34.920 --> 49:42.760]  like it was a politically motivated effort to get the probably inadvertent admission that
[49:42.760 --> 49:49.640]  Jones and Stone are in the clear. So let's charge Jones is associate to try to muddy the
[49:49.640 --> 49:55.960]  water and change the narrative. I assume that Owen knowing him as I do will plead guilty at his
[49:55.960 --> 50:02.680]  arraignment this afternoon. And I can tell him he needs not guilty and not guilty. Pardon me.
[50:02.680 --> 50:08.920]  I misspoke will plead not guilty. And he needs a lawyer who understands the epic political nature
[50:08.920 --> 50:15.800]  of the court system in DC. You need a fighter. You really need somebody with a broad understanding
[50:15.800 --> 50:22.040]  of the constitutional law but who is not afraid to fulfill his obligation to give his client
[50:22.040 --> 50:29.480]  the most vigorous defense that he or she can. In the meantime, you know, I think we can do a
[50:29.480 --> 50:36.440]  land market business in Owen Shroyer did nothing wrong t shirts. I hope that Owen will authorize
[50:36.440 --> 50:41.720]  his friends including you Alex to set up an Owen Shroyer legal defense fund because I can tell you
[50:42.440 --> 50:48.120]  any lawyer who's going to be able to do this job, the lawyer that Owen ultimately has the right to
[50:48.120 --> 50:55.880]  select is going to be extraordinarily expensive. And it is essential that he have a vigorous trial
[50:55.880 --> 51:00.120]  and that he expose the falsity of the government's complaint.
[51:02.440 --> 51:09.240]  What do you make this in general of Afghanistan and the left and forced inoculations and
[51:09.240 --> 51:17.640]  everything's just out the open now and Harrison Biden having you know 25% approval
[51:17.640 --> 51:21.880]  ratings basically right now. I mean this is just untenable for all this is going.
[51:22.680 --> 51:28.760]  Well, let's take Afghanistan because an excellent point to start. I don't think President Biden
[51:28.760 --> 51:34.040]  made an error by continuing the withdrawal of American troops from all these Middle Eastern
[51:34.040 --> 51:39.480]  countries. That is the policy of Donald Trump. That's actually what he ran on bringing all of
[51:39.480 --> 51:45.720]  our soldiers home. He's taken US troops back from Syria. He's taken them back from Iraq. He's
[51:45.720 --> 51:52.840]  withdrawn troops from Afghanistan. The difference is the president used drone strikes and American
[51:52.840 --> 51:59.960]  air power to keep the Islamic radicals in those countries pinned down during the time that we
[51:59.960 --> 52:06.280]  were withdrawing our troops. This is kind of military strategy 101. You always cover your
[52:06.280 --> 52:14.120]  retreat. Those bombings by the way were numerous during the Obama administration. Obama used
[52:14.120 --> 52:21.160]  American air power in the Middle East and this drone technology. Biden stopped the drone attacks
[52:21.160 --> 52:27.160]  at the same time as I understand it that he lifted the embargo against the Iranians.
[52:27.880 --> 52:33.560]  Given the fact that he is exhibiting nothing but weakness, you see this reverberating around the
[52:33.560 --> 52:43.240]  world. Israel is raising missiles on Israel. The Russians have just hacked and given back
[52:43.240 --> 52:50.520]  our pipeline. The Russians have troops masked on the borders of Crimea. The North Koreans have
[52:50.520 --> 52:57.000]  restarted their nuclear weapons program. The Chinese are threatening our vessels in the South.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.920]  By the way, this just did. The Taliban is threatening to attack US forces and we don't
[53:00.920 --> 53:07.800]  leave by August 31st. So I mean, this is all the manifestation of weakness.
[53:07.800 --> 53:13.800]  Donald Trump had the same idea. In fact, he ran on this, was drawing from Afghanistan where we've
[53:13.800 --> 53:18.760]  been there too long and we've spent too much money and too much blood where our inherent
[53:18.760 --> 53:25.160]  national interests are not clear was the right instinct. But not doing it in a sound way that
[53:25.160 --> 53:33.800]  allowed you to do that yet maintain the status quo through the use of air power is unconscionable.
[53:33.800 --> 53:40.680]  It's the way he did it and the execution of the policy rather than the policy itself.
[53:40.680 --> 53:45.720]  The neocons, as you know, don't like the position of either Biden or Trump. They'd like us to say
[53:45.720 --> 53:50.520]  there for another hundred years. In fact, they'd probably like to send more soldiers. But I think
[53:50.520 --> 53:56.120]  the American people voted against that and I don't think that's what they want. But the skillful way
[53:56.120 --> 54:04.440]  to do this, as Trump did it, is the way that it should have been executed. Well, absolutely.
[54:04.440 --> 54:12.840]  Look, obviously, I think that this is the whole Clinton Obama globalist combine that kind of shares
[54:12.840 --> 54:17.800]  power wanting to get rid of Biden, wanting to set him up the way they did this whole thing.
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.080]  Just looks like it's designed for 25th Amendment. What do you think is really going on? What do
[54:23.080 --> 54:30.200]  you think comes out of this? Well, look, it is increasingly obvious that when the president
[54:30.200 --> 54:35.880]  speaks in public that he's got some cognitive problems. I suspect he has good days and bad days.
[54:35.880 --> 54:41.480]  I don't wish him any ill will. But this is the toughest job in the world. And I don't think
[54:41.480 --> 54:46.840]  he's up to it. I've said here before, I think Susan Rice is running American foreign policy. And I
[54:46.840 --> 54:53.560]  think Ron Klain is running U.S. domestic policy. And I think the most influential person in the
[54:53.560 --> 55:02.440]  Biden presidency is Barack Obama. In essence, I think this is Obama 3.0. But the swiftness in
[55:02.440 --> 55:09.640]  which they are moving, for example, to make this vaccination not only permanent, but mandatory.
[55:10.360 --> 55:15.480]  And it appears to me the FDA is going to approve it yet again without clinical trials.
[55:15.480 --> 55:22.760]  And then they're going to mandate the vaccination of all of our active duty military. This is
[55:22.760 --> 55:28.840]  potentially a disaster. And if you express your First Amendment right, just to question the safety
[55:28.840 --> 55:35.160]  of the vaccination, based on many, many, many case studies where people have had egregious
[55:35.160 --> 55:40.920]  side effects, well, that makes you some kind of a terrorist or a kook? No, it's fact-based.
[55:40.920 --> 55:46.760]  Under our U.S. Constitution, you have the right to believe what you want. As long as you're not
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.800]  fostering violence or hurting someone else, you have the right to believe what you want and say
[55:51.800 --> 56:00.120]  what you want. They are now defining questions about the legitimacy or just the anomalies and
[56:00.120 --> 56:05.560]  regularities in the 2020 election. Never mind this idea that Trump is going to return to the
[56:05.560 --> 56:11.880]  White House, which I have never subscribed to. I love Mike Lindell, but there's no legal precedent
[56:11.880 --> 56:18.520]  for that that I can see. Even if you were to find sufficient evidence of fraud in enough states,
[56:18.520 --> 56:23.640]  which I really believe they will find, I still don't see the election results being reversed.
[56:24.520 --> 56:30.200]  But to go back to the question of the election, you're entitled to think what you want. That
[56:30.200 --> 56:34.920]  doesn't mean you're violently advocating the overthrow of the current government.
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.320]  And then to say, well, questioning the lockdowns and the safety of the vaccination,
[56:39.320 --> 56:44.680]  that makes you a domestic terrorist, too. What happened to my body, my choice? What happened to
[56:44.680 --> 56:50.120]  health freedom as a constitutional principle? There's more than enough science that indicates
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.120]  that for many, many, many people, these vaccinations are problematic. I was not happy
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.720]  that the president pushed them again at his rally in Alabama, but I was happy that he made it very
[57:01.720 --> 57:09.720]  clear that it is up to each person that you have to have your freedom to decide that it cannot be
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.480]  mandatory. Well, that's right, Roger. Stay there. Let's do five more minutes. I want to ask you
[57:13.480 --> 57:19.320]  about that. We've got the clip coming up of Trump being booed two nights ago in Alabama on Saturday
[57:19.320 --> 57:23.480]  evening when he said, hey, the vaccine works, you know, take it. I'll tell you if it doesn't work.
[57:23.480 --> 57:28.520]  I took it. They had now admitted it's down to like 37 percent efficacy, even in their own fake
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.840]  numbers. We quote booster shots. Since when does this happen in eight months? Well, it was all
[57:32.840 --> 57:37.800]  predicted here. Hour number two straight ahead. I've got so much news to break down. The huge
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.120]  rebellion happening around the world and so much more is going to be a big broadcast, folks. Stay with
[57:42.120 --> 57:54.120]  us. You say you want to fight tyranny. You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.

[58:47.960 --> 58:54.280]  your support. So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds,
[58:54.280 --> 58:59.640]  I was overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I
[58:59.640 --> 59:04.120]  heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[59:04.120 --> 59:08.680]  shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[59:08.680 --> 59:11.880]  You have, you know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So
[59:11.880 --> 59:18.120]  I took it and then in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[59:18.120 --> 59:23.160]  enlightened. You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again. And over the course
[59:23.160 --> 59:27.880]  of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[59:27.880 --> 59:32.600]  supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout.
[59:32.600 --> 59:36.840]  It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the
[59:36.840 --> 59:41.400]  point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the
[59:41.400 --> 59:46.120]  only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said, brother.
[59:46.120 --> 59:48.120]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[59:53.400 --> 59:56.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.120 --> 1:00:14.120]  All right, folks, final segment with Roger Stone. And then I'm kicking off a huge hour. We're
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:19.000]  massively prepared with critical intel that I've got to give you, even though it's not very pretty.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:24.280]  It's good to at least know about the giant storm that's already beginning to hit. It's going to get
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:29.240]  much more intense. I was talking to my mother this morning. She said, you know, the devil's
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:35.560]  making his move again. The devil made it back in the 1930s, 40s. Is it making moves ever since?
[1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:40.760]  But this is the big move. Roger, let's play this clip. Here's Biden a few weeks ago saying,
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:46.120]  oh, the vaccine works. Take it, even though it doesn't work. And then here's Trump in Alabama.
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:53.960]  The the various shots that people are getting now cover that there. You're okay. You're not
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.680]  going to you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. Yeah, you know what? I
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:03.960]  believe totally in your freedoms. I do agree. You got to do what you have to do. But I recommend
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:09.880]  take the vaccines. I did it. It's good. Take the vaccines. But you got down. That's okay. That's
[1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:17.000]  all right. You got your freedoms. But I happen to take the vaccine. If it doesn't work, you'll be
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:25.080]  the first to know. Okay. I'll call up Alabama say, Hey, you know what? But it is working. But it's
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:29.320]  not working, Roger. So I know he pardoned you and we like him. He's a good guy. But that's just not
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:36.360]  true. It's down to 37% efficacy. Well, let's remember the president already had COVID-19
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:42.520]  then was vaccinated after it as well. I pray that he's right and that his health is not harmed.
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:48.840]  But there's more than enough evidence now to show that there are problems with the vaccination. It
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:55.400]  is also, however, not in Donald Trump's style to admit an error. It's just something he has never
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:02:01.960]  done. And frankly, I'm happy that he has made it very clear that it should not be mandatory. I
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:10.120]  consider that a victory in itself. I do think at the grassroots that his constant advocacy of the
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:17.480]  vaccination is hurting him. But when you look at the larger world situation and our collapsing
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:26.520]  economy and the growing censorship and control of our very lives, you know, the foibles of Joe
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:32.360]  Biden certainly outweigh the president's view on vaccinations, particularly since he says they
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:37.160]  shouldn't be mandatory. Now, I agree. That's the same in grace here. I just I hate seeing him hurt
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:41.800]  himself like this because this is not popular. And it's not good. And it's not true. In closing,
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:45.720]  oh, sure, we got to pray for him. We got to supporting. I actually found the section here.
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:50.680]  He's charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct of the Capitol. He didn't go in the
[1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:56.600]  Capitol, wasn't part of a violent entry, tried to stop it with me on record. This is false charges.
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:01.880]  This is criminal activity right here by the FBI, in my view. Well, he needs an excellent lawyer
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:07.720]  and he needs to understand the political nature of the DC court system. I mean, the DC Circuit
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:14.280]  Court upheld my sentence, even though it violated both the law and the Bureau of Prisons and
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:19.560]  Department of Justice regulations. We have two tiered justice in this country. We see it over
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:25.720]  and over and over again. We're essentially charging Owen Schreuer with trespassing while
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:31.800]  Hunter Biden makes billions of dollars and influence pedals. His father's influence doesn't
[1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:39.960]  pay taxes on that money, but is not prosecuted. They go after Owen Schreuer, but Tony Podesta
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:46.120]  took money from the same pot of Ukrainian money as Paul Manafort lobbied on behalf of the Ukrainians.
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:51.000]  Manafort was charged and went to prison for it. Podesta has not been charged. In fact,
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:57.240]  it was announced this week that Tony Podesta will represent Huawei, the largest telecommunications
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:02.760]  company in China, in front of the Biden administration. A lucrative deal, I'm sure.
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:07.800]  So again, the two-tiered justice system. Rod Rosenstein lied to Congress when he said he
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:12.600]  didn't authorize the investigation into Roger Stone. Absolutely not. Yet we have the document
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:16.920]  in which he did so. They charged me with lying to Congress. Why hasn't he been charged with lying?
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:20.200]  It's insane. Quickly, because I know you've got a lot of fake lawsuits against you,
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:23.320]  so do we, and I want to support you. The listeners do, and they really appreciate you,
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.800]  Roger. Give us the Stone Defense Fund for your legal.
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:30.920]  Yeah, look, I had really hoped that I was finished with this, but I have to defend not only this
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:37.000]  with tax lawyers, this Department of Justice attack on me in a civil suit, but I have,
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:43.880]  at this point, I think I'm down to nine friendless lawsuits filed against me by Larry Claimon.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:49.960]  Two of them have already been dismissed, and in both cases, the judge ordered Claimon to pay
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:55.960]  my lawyer's expenses, or my legal expenses. Mr. Claimon did not show up for his deposition.
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:04:58.920]  God bless him. God bless you. We'll be right back.
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:07.080]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:12.920]  I was in sixth grade, and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:17.320]  the arena. And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:22.600]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear. But Mike Lindell has come
[1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:28.520]  along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:34.200]  and other issues. And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up

[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:28.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:36.920]  All right, this is very important video. It's posted as the featured video
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:42.440]  at band.video and freeworldnews.tv. It's a life saving video. Everything this
[1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:51.080]  Oxford PhD scientist says is on record and documented only in three minutes at the Southwest Ohio
[1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:56.200]  School Board meeting Dr. Sean Brooks. But scientists and others are using every venue they can to get
[1:06:56.200 --> 1:07:05.000]  the truth out. Sean Brooks explains what will happen to the vaccinated because of ADE and other issues.
[1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:10.200]  Viral video Dr. Sean Brooks warns vaccinated will die soon.
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:16.040]  And again, this was all premeditated a year and a half ago. Gates said you'll need a third booster
[1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:21.080]  shot. It's not a vaccine. It lowers your immunity. It implants you with prions. Then it takes your
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:25.880]  body over with the second and third shot and makes you a factory that already pre-programmed
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:29.800]  this on human subjects in China. This is a bio weapon. They tested it all on animals and humans
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:34.920]  already. Oh, it's been tested. They just skip the testing because you know it would actually kill you.
[1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:38.760]  It's been tested. Approved, it'll kill you as a bio weapon. Developed in the US, given to the
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:45.800]  Chinese reposable liability by Obama. And it's colonizing your body. It's taking over. So when
[1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:50.200]  the quote booster shot start, if you thought you saw variants and mass illness and death at full
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:56.280]  hospitals from the first round of vaccines that aren't vaccines or gene therapies, wait until
[1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:02.120]  what you see next, that's the real science. And I want to get this guy on so he can then have time
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:06.040]  to go through each one of the claims he makes is everything he says. I've got stacks of articles
[1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:10.840]  right here admitting it. So we're going to be laying all this out. It's a big, big deal.
[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.560]  I got a ton of other news to cover coming up, but here it is.
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:16.840]  Let's speak. I think we should be respectful of each other.
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:24.280]  For the next person.
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:33.400]  I did, brother. Disappointed. My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, PhD.
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:41.640]  Oxford. I have 48 publications, including 23 books. I've studied health medicine anatomy
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:48.120]  and physiology for approximately 21 years. Dr. Robert Malone, who created the messenger RNA
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:54.600]  vaccine has said no one should ever take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever.
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:59.400]  He created it and he says, don't ever do it. So let me explain what's going to happen to the
[1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:04.840]  people who have taken it. Excuse me. The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:11.960]  months to three to five years for three reasons. Number one, you've dramatically decreased your
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:18.680]  own immune system by 35%. The first jab did it by at least 15. The second did it by 35.
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:25.240]  Now, if you take any booster shot, you will die. That's it. You take a flu shot in the future.
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:32.520]  You will die. The second reason, antibody dependent enhancement. Antibody dependent enhancement
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:36.600]  is what is happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them. Unless, of course,
[1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:41.480]  you've taken a placebo, but there's no way that you would know that. So given that fact,
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:46.440]  antibody dependent enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that the cell that's eating
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:51.800]  the pathogen is eating it when it isn't. It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm,
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:58.280]  which causes organ failure. That will cause your death and there's no stopping that. No amount
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:04.680]  of drugs will stop that. The third thing, blood clotting. Everyone who has taken the jabs is
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:09.240]  blood clotting. If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out. Take what's called a
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:15.960]  de dimer test. What that does is that detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:21.320]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now. As I'm talking to you, millions have
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:27.320]  died from the jabs. In your last meeting, you advocated for people to take the jabs potentially
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:33.240]  in the future along with wearing masks. And I heard parents say the same thing. So to the parents
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:38.120]  who are actually considering jabbing their own children, you're going to sterilize them permanently.
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:45.320]  People who have taken the jabs are sterilized. 80% of women who have been jabbed have lost their
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:52.840]  children in the first trimester. You can't have kids. You've also injected yourself with the
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:11:01.160]  equivalent of HIV. You can now no longer breastfeed, donate blood, donate organs, donate blood plasma,
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:06.920]  nor bone marrow. If you don't believe me, try to donate blood and blood plasma and find out what
[1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:12.760]  happens. You will be denied unless, of course, you live in California, in which case they're
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:18.920]  allowing people to donate toxic blood with spike proteins in it. The jabs create spike proteins.
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:27.240]  They're in the jabs themselves. And they create it by snapping your RNA in half. You are no longer
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:34.440]  a human anymore. You are something else. And you are susceptible to countless diseases. Now here's
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:39.640]  what's going to happen in the future very quickly. You have 15 seconds. Great. I don't know what
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:44.360]  percentage of your staff has taken the jabs, but your school is going to close. You will not stay
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:49.800]  open. You will close because they will fall ill and they will die. That will happen in all of your
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:55.080]  buildings. It's already happening. All right. Thank you, sir. I bet it is. It's already happening.
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:12:04.200]  Good luck because nothing can stop us. Thank you, sir. Good luck. And here's the deal. I've probably
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:08.440]  got 30 doctors just like him, and you can look them up. They're prestigious, saying the same thing,
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:15.400]  just this weekend. We only played five of their clubs yesterday. Medical doctors, women,
[1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:20.360]  OGBYNs that say almost every woman that's taken it now just has a period all the time and can't
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:25.400]  have children. So they say, we've got to cut your uterus out. I'm going to open the phones up and
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:29.080]  there will be 100 women will call who are bleeding and having and they're telling them
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:35.080]  how to hysterectomies. You're like, how would they get away with that? Because the sheeple,
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:40.040]  when they get hurt, don't ever admit they're being hurt. They lie and say, oh, I'm not being hurt
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:44.920]  because they're so cowardly. They can't admit it's happening to them. That's called Stockholm syndrome.
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:50.600]  That's called learned helplessness. There's a new study out, researchers identify a new
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:58.200]  personality construct that describes the tendency to see oneself as a victim.
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:04.040]  And as long as you give them the victim ideology, they will buy into it,
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:08.280]  that you're saving them. I'm not saying you're a victim. I'm saying you're an
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:12.520]  overcomer. I'm saying you're powerful. I'm saying you're amazing. I'm saying a globalist, evil,
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:16.200]  mad scientist, cabal, wants you out of the way, wants resources for themselves,
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:20.840]  and wants the power to kill whoever they want and have launched an attack designed to then
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:25.640]  blame those that don't take the injections as for causing the illnesses. And we're in a race to
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:31.720]  expose that before they get to that phase, but now we're already here. People are freaking out all
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:37.960]  over the world when they watch previous shows we did because and they're digging through the
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.320]  prison planet.TV archive that used to be subscription. I made it free like five years ago, and it goes
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:51.000]  back like 16 years, 17 years. And it's got hundreds of thousands of videos on it. And people are
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.840]  crawling through it. They're like, how did he predict this 20 years ago? How do you predict
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:01.720]  it 10 years ago? I didn't predict it. It's it's a plan. And so see, I'm not just living second
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:08.680]  to second like Dory in finding Nemo, the fish that can't remember things for 10 seconds.
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:13.960]  I remember it all. And I know they're playing. I know their goal. And we've been saying for the
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:19.800]  last 19 months, once we hit six to eight months after they've taken these shots, they're going to
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:23.880]  come out with a booster that then fully takes over your body because it takes two shots to
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:29.400]  get rid of your immune system. Then this thing colonizes you takes full control. And now it'll
[1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:35.240]  be able to create whatever's in this Pfizer shot. Pfizer's the lead dog lead devil lead horseman
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:41.240]  of the apocalypse. Whatever it is that's in this is all secret proprietary is going to be the main
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:47.080]  weapon. And they're going to say again, oh my God, none of these are working because of the
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:50.920]  unvaccinated. It won't matter. There's no science. It won't matter. They don't care. That's what they
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:55.720]  have the surgeon general going. There is no natural immunity. It doesn't exist. It's worthless.
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:01.480]  And all the scientists are like, that's a total lie. That's the opposite. They don't care.
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:09.640]  They don't care. They've made their move and they don't care. They charged Owen with assaulting
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:16.040]  people and breaking in the Capitol says it right here. He didn't do that. And the judge that did
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:25.080]  it is a judge that put nonviolent people in solitary confinement saying for just being in
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:32.040]  the Capitol, they never even get out. And the same judge has canceled trial dates. Trial dates are
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:35.960]  set for people that have been there eight months. Oh, sorry. For misdemeanors, you don't get trial
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:42.680]  dates. You just go right to a gulag and never get a trial. And they want to expand this nationwide
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:47.640]  and set up federal jails everywhere run by the Capitol. So the Capitol orders you drug into a
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:51.560]  dungeon. They just show up the SWAT team and you just disappear. They've got their own federal
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:57.720]  magistrates, everything. It's like North Korea. But they love the Taliban in turn over countries
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:02.840]  to them. What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning

[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:05.560]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s. And then imagine a science fiction movie set in
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:11.000]  the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of Congress and former
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.360]  presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:23.240]  grows blood plots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:28.840]  Think about that because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five
[1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:35.160]  years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening. But it is happening now. And then
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.480]  they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work.
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:43.240]  She got to take it every few months. And the people that have submitted say, great,
[1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:47.640]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:51.880]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID. And now there's record numbers of really sick people
[1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:56.840]  from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies. Bill Gates and
[1:18:56.840 --> 1:19:01.880]  Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now. So what's the most important part,
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:06.280]  let's say the bulldozer running over the globalist, the treads, the wheels, the engine,
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.080]  the scoop on the front, it's all very important. But the fuel is paramount. And that's my allegor.
[1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:17.160]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:21.960]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system,
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.400]  metabolism of a human. Some people get 15 hours out of this. Some people get about eight hours.
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:29.320]  But people take this, people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever
[1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:35.640]  had because it's not high. Nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts, their post
[1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:39.640]  workouts, you can call us whatever you want. It's a total solution all around the best you're
[1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:45.240]  going to find. Turbo force, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together. It's
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:49.240]  like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:52.440]  defeated. You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:58.920]  your mind. It's a win win 360 together info or store.com or triple A two five three three one three nine.
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:05.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:20.280]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to
[1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:25.720]  3 p.m. We're here live. I'm your host Alex Jones. Very honored to be here. Okay.
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:31.800]  We have an archivist, but then he's got a full time job trying to keep up with me. But
[1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:37.880]  I would like him and I was watching to just go back the last year. We already have a lot of clips
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:43.320]  where I predicted this, but find any others where I said specifically they'll give you one shot
[1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:46.600]  another shot. Then they'll say that still protects you somewhat, but
[1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:53.000]  that the unvaccinated are still going to get you sick. So they could still blame unvaccinated when
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.600]  it turns out the vaccine doesn't work as it's not a vaccine. And actually makes you ill and
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:01.400]  makes you produce the viruses and mutants. And then right before they have the booster shot,
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:04.680]  they'll finally announce actually it didn't protect you at all. In fact,
[1:21:04.680 --> 1:21:09.400]  it makes you more susceptible to COVID-19 because they already know that's coming out.
[1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:20.360]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please. Right on time within an hour of the FDA coming
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:26.520]  out saying, oh, we give authorization, skipped all the testing. You name it. It's an official drug
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:33.880]  for Pfizer. Bloomberg vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illness from the COVID
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:37.960]  Delta variant than previously thought. In fact, they might be more vulnerable than they have
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:46.120]  that. Oh my God, you better get out and get the new shot right now. That was so hard to predict.
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:51.080]  I want to air an extremely important John Bown report right now that's in the John Bown section
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:57.160]  of infowars.com. And it's in the John Bown section of band.video. It's so critical. Look at this
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:22:04.360]  out there, everybody. And it deals with the Nuremberg trial, Nuremberg 2.0 and Dr. Fauci and
[1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:11.160]  the crimes they're committing. This is a incredibly important report. It's again at
[1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:16.680]  freeworldnews.tv and band.video. And please, activists, get it and share it. I know you are
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:20.920]  doing a great job. Take clips out of it, whatever, but it's powerful and send it to all the local
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:24.680]  talk show hosts and others, you know, Nuremberg code punishable by death. Here it is.
[1:22:35.320 --> 1:22:41.000]  Are the petty tyrants who have recklessly mandated vaccines while refusing non-vaccinated
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:46.840]  people food, employment and basic freedom of choice, violating the internationally recognized
[1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:54.440]  Nuremberg code, which is punishable by death. Yes. Yes, they are. I will not bow. I will not
[1:22:54.440 --> 1:23:02.440]  surrender to this tyrant over this issue. I am not asleep. I am a free America. I have the Nuremberg
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:10.040]  code and the Constitution behind me. In fact, they are violating the set of research ethics
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:16.760]  principles for human experimentation created by the USA versus Brant Court as one result of the
[1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:23.320]  Nuremberg trials at the end of the Second World War with abandon. Dr. Fauci, as you are aware,
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:30.840]  it is a crime to lie to Congress. Section 1001 of the U.S. Criminal Code creates a felony and a
[1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:37.240]  five-year penalty for lying to Congress. You stated that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:43.960]  gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And yet gain of function research
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:51.160]  was done entirely in the Wuhan Institute by Dr. Sheen and was funded by the NIH. Senator Paul,
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:56.840]  I have never lied before the Congress. Now they want you to show a vaccine card. Good morning.
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:00.920]  And if you are caught with someone eating at your restaurant without a vaccine card,
[1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:07.720]  thousand bucks, two times 2,000 bucks. How do you feel about that? I feel that my liberties
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:15.960]  have been taken away from me. Nurses from Dignity Health took to the streets Friday to protest
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:21.320]  the California COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The mandate announced August 5th requires all health
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:26.920]  care workers in California to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 30th. Otherwise,
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:32.040]  they will lose their jobs. Any establishment that serves food or drinks like restaurants, bars and
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:37.720]  clubs, theaters, as well as entertainment venues will require that vaccination. And gyms like this
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:43.880]  one, as well as dance studios, also included those large events at those indoor venues.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:49.720]  The beginning of the Nuremberg Code reads, the voluntary consent of the human subject is
[1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:56.920]  absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:04.840]  should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice without the intervention of
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:18.360]  or coercion, and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:24.040]  matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:30.120]  An experiment is defined as a test, trial or tentative procedure, an act or operation for
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:38.040]  the purpose of discovering something unknown. So far, 237 candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:43.240]  are in development worldwide, of which 63 have been approved for clinical trials,
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:50.680]  and 27 are evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials. Six candidate vaccines have been authorized for
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:58.200]  emergency use based on their efficacy data in Phase 3 trials. The FDA's emergency authorization of
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:04.440]  the ineffective vaccine describes emergency approval as a mechanism to facilitate the
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:11.080]  availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines during public health emergencies,
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:16.840]  such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:22.440]  or life-threatening diseases when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:28.680]  no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. There are myriad of early treatment alternatives
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:34.600]  that could have already saved thousands of lives, had the doctors promoting them not been censored
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:41.160]  by Silicon Valley, which allowed politicians to pretend they were licensed in the Hippocratic Oath.
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:47.880]  You had a first shot and got away with it. Thank God, thank the Lord, but don't take the second
[1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:55.240]  shot, because when you take the second shot, you are going to be asking for big trouble once, because
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:04.120]  now, outcome the spikes, now the antibodies are there, as we know,
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:13.880]  then the complement system has no other way. It has no choice. It has no brain. It's going to riddle
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:19.960]  this vessel with holes. Natural immunity is much stronger and much broader and much deeper,
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:25.080]  and much longer lasting than vaccine immunity. And we have over and over now data showing how
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:32.840]  long natural immunity, having had COVID immunity, survives and lasts compared to the three to five
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:37.720]  or six months of vaccine immunity before you need booster, after booster, after booster.
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:43.240]  I want to show you a couple of these and tell you that your biggest red flag for propaganda
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:49.320]  from public health is experts say. They're not saying the data shows, they're not saying the
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:54.600]  study shows, they say experts say. I've already had COVID-19, so I don't need to be vaccinated.
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:28:00.760]  This is a myth, according to public health. Doctors know this is a fact. We have a broad
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:06.440]  and durable immune response to COVID, and there are multiple studies that document
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:11.240]  that we do not need to be vaccinated. And yet we have these statements, you should still get
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:17.640]  vaccinated, health experts say. While it may appear that the vaccine mandates are the only
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:23.960]  answer to a SARS coronavirus with strong ties to a lab in Wuhan, China, through the face of the
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:29.960]  rollout, Dr. Fauci and a preplanned readiness by the United Nations corporate industrial complex
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:36.920]  is the FDA destroying its credibility, approving the Pfizer vaccine, which has 42% efficacy,
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:42.360]  an experiment that will now carry the full weight of the FDA's approval. Every American
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:47.800]  household should have early treatment readily available instead of being forced into being
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:53.400]  vaccine guinea pigs. John Bown reported to believe we're already halfway into this insane year
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:29:00.280]  of 2021. All right, folks, that is a very, very powerful report. Attention radio listeners,
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:06.200]  if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections, this will be an extremely
[1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:11.480]  important message. Here's why, no matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:18.120]  upheaval is a very real possibility. Here's why this is important. Listen, we all know that silver
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:24.040]  and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable
[1:29:24.040 --> 1:29:29.640]  currencies. But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:35.640]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold? It's true, open pollinated
[1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:41.400]  seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead.

[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:05.400]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:10.600]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a job. And I heard Dr. Group on
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:15.000]  your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:18.680]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too. You
[1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:22.120]  had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:28.680]  it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:33.880]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:38.360]  couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:43.240]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout. It literally
[1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:47.240]  like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:51.720]  we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way
[1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:56.680]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so
[1:30:56.680 --> 1:31:02.840]  much for your call and Godspeed. We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:09.800]  Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:14.520]  breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years
[1:31:14.520 --> 1:31:20.120]  in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan
[1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:26.280]  legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme
[1:31:26.280 --> 1:31:31.960]  ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:37.400]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many
[1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:43.720]  who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:50.280]  not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, organic skull
[1:31:50.280 --> 1:31:56.040]  cap, and Balerian root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure
[1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:04.120]  yours by visiting infowarstore.com. Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal. Many of them
[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:07.960]  are synthetic. Many of them have fillers and additives. Many of them just pass right through
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:13.160]  the body and are absorbed. But that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:18.600]  so effective product that it's now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stone.
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:24.120]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion. All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,

[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:33.800]  it's great for children, it's great for adults, it's really important for folks that are older,
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:37.880]  because they don't absorb as well through their guts. So this liquid formula really,
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:41.880]  really does it. You mix up a picture of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator,
[1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:45.960]  keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:51.480]  It tastes great, it makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system, and it funds the

[1:32:56.920 --> 1:33:11.000]  limited time, 33% off in FullWareStore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:57.320 --> 1:34:05.400]  And all we want is our freedom and our humanity and our women and our men and our children,
[1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:13.480]  and we will have it. And the globalists will fail, they will fall, we will build the new
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:21.640]  Atlantis. We had Dr. Vladimir Zelinko on, who's a highly respected doctor in New York,
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:27.640]  and he pioneered the treatment set up and proven that I've seen in my own life with friends and
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.560]  family with the Delta variant going from super sick to within a day, basically well.
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:41.480]  And he was on and he said at the bottom of this is paganism. Now he doesn't just say that because
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:48.280]  he's a scholar of the ancient Jewish histories. He said he's a doctor, he's researched it,
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:53.480]  but when you boil it down to that, it's true in all other cultures.
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:35:03.160]  In world history, they would go through cycles where child sacrifice was demanded.
[1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:11.560]  And it wasn't until Abraham that there was a covenant to stop sacrificing children that became
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:18.440]  part of Jewish law was don't sacrifice children. Every other culture did it. In fact, Jews were
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:25.160]  doing it some before that. And pagans, if you even go back to Plato, you don't think he was a pagan,
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:33.000]  but he was a pagan, he wasn't a Christian, he wasn't a Jew. That was a pre-Christianity,
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:39.880]  pre-Christ. He said, there's too many humans, they crushed the breast of earth,
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:47.000]  we must save the goddess and call all the poor people. And then Malthus 2000 years later said
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:54.760]  the same thing in England. So this is all an extension of them they like to kill people.
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:03.560]  And always when humans get overpopulated, you can argue we do, they carry out the ritualistic death.
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:10.520]  It doesn't matter if you're in Tibet or whether you were in ancient Mexico or whether you're in
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:17.480]  ancient Europe or the Middle East, the fires of Moloch. This is the reality.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:26.120]  And so when you see Klaus Schwab and all them doing this, I covered in my film In Game 2.0,
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:35.480]  it's on prismplanet.tv with Dr. Kaufman. The actual battle plan for the UN said we will bring back
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:40.280]  gladiatorial gains, we will bring back human sacrifice, we will bring back depopulation of
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:47.160]  the pagans. And that's what extinction, rebellion, and all these groups say. Do you understand that?
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:55.960]  And they think it's their right and duty to do this to you. They think that because you're so
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:59.720]  gullible you deserve to die. They're predators. They're not trying to defend the innocent.
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:04.520]  And it's their world now, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.720]  So if you want to understand what's happening, look back in ancient times
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:17.320]  and then project it forward and then read what Klaus Schwab says. Next hour,
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:23.880]  I'm going to read you just from Wikipedia with the links to Klaus Schwab's own website.
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:31.800]  Hell, we have a capsidious entire planet. We will get rid of the democracies and the countries that
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:38.920]  control them. I mean, these are quotes. He says, we will take your body over and all this. And if
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:44.600]  we let this monster do it to us, he believes he has the right to do it. He's a stone-cold killer.
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:52.680]  And understand, this is all psychological warfare. They know the people that took the shots are
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:55.800]  going to get sick and start dying. It's already happening. They know they're going to tell them,
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:59.480]  oh, it was the people that didn't take the shots. It's their fault to enrage them more.
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:04.200]  And then when they take more shots and get even sicker, they'll never admit to themselves it happened.
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:09.000]  That's the programming. That's the conditioning. That's the mind control.
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:14.440]  And it's not like I'm just taking current events and saying that to make it make sense.
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:20.200]  I keep telling you years before because I know the enemy. I live this. I don't do anything now.
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:28.040]  Except take care of my children and take care of my family and research. I do nothing but work.
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.800]  I love it, by the way. Nothing but cook food. Nothing but take care of my family. Nothing
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:39.800]  but research. Nothing but prey. And I can barely hold it together. And when the general public
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:43.960]  finally figures out that everything's a lie and the social construct is broken and the social
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:48.360]  contract's over, hell is going to be released. And they're breaking society down. That's why
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:53.320]  I vacuum it up for next segment or next hour. I keep forgetting. Klaus Schwab had a bunch of clips
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:57.400]  this weekend I didn't get to. You guys will find the ones where he says the lockdown never ends.
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:01.800]  It's never going to go. It's never over. We're going to make the public angry. Oh,
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:06.120]  yes, so very angry. I want all those clips because already in Australia they're like,
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.120]  there's nothing at the grocery store. When we order food, even when we get a government check
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:17.560]  to stay in the house, it doesn't come because there's no production. You're being stalled out
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:23.640]  till there's a total collapse. And then by then they want enough of you inoculated because then
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:28.120]  you'll start dying. Then there's no hospitals. Then there's no food. Then the society collapse.
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:32.120]  This is a post-industrial world, which means a post-human world.
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:43.640]  This is real, folks. You understand? You think I like this? I'm staying at my post like a captain
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:47.640]  going down with a ship. I appreciate this crew doing it as well. Where are they going to run?
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:51.080]  What are they going to do? Same thing. The only way you beat this is fighting this. But
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:59.240]  I have a sickening feeling as well. I wish this wasn't real. I wish it would just remain theoretical
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:03.960]  and that we could have stopped it. But you know what? Depopulation and secret testing
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:08.200]  and all the rest of it has not been theoretical in Latin America and Africa and poor areas of the
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:13.720]  world with Bill Gates. He's been muscling his way into villages with his dad for 40 years killing
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:24.920]  people. And I've done all this for myself. People ask me, why do you risk your life?
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:34.520]  Why you're a hero? A hero? I know God. I have a spiritual connection. God doesn't like this.
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:40.360]  I do this because I want to be with God. I only fear separation from the Creator.
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:46.360]  And I understand that God gave us free will. This is our fault, not God's. But I want people
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:50.600]  to get that through their heads out there. The only thing you've got is your soul. That's all
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:56.360]  that matters. Nothing even has one percent value compared to it. I'll ask you the question. Would
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:03.080]  you give your eyes up for $10 million? The average person says, hell no. I probably would because
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:07.160]  I got to do so much good with the money to fight tyranny. But most people that would do it for
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:13.560]  their own selves, they realize, oh God, I wouldn't give my eyes up for a billion, 10 million dollars,
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:20.840]  a trillion. What's it matter? Well, if your eyes are so valuable, you wouldn't give them up for
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:27.560]  money. What about your soul? And you do have one and it is connected to the universe that God
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:32.360]  created. You are jacked in. And so you decide, are you with the Creator or are you with the Spirit
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:37.480]  of Death? Are you with Klaus Schwab or are you with Jesus Christ? You want to see the devil?
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:43.480]  It's Klaus Schwab. Slick, arrogant, openly evil, totally thinks he's God, bullying his way around
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:48.360]  to whatever the hell he wants. He'll be on the ash, heaps of history, just like his predecessor,
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:57.080]  Hitler. And the ADL and all the rest of these people. But this is damn serious. We're fighting
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:04.280]  classic pagans on steroids who are just so greedy and hateful and full of themselves
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:08.680]  that they see the public's weakness and like wolves just cannot help but attack.
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:15.720]  Their strength is because we've been weak spiritually. Their strength is because we've
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:19.240]  turned the world over to them. I'm going to go to break, come back with this huge news
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:23.960]  out of Australia next hour, this incredible Klaus Schwab news, so much other news, and I'll open

[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:04.680]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet. But the big corporations for 100 years have told
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:09.480]  us that humans are bad and evil, and a pest floats on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:13.880]  and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the
[1:43:13.880 --> 1:43:19.480]  planet. If you let a Klaus Schwab head of the Davis Group's own Wikipedia page, he brags on
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:24.840]  there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:30.520]  corporate dictatorship under the UN. They admit all of this. They plan the lockdowns,
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:35.880]  they release the viruses, they think you're stupid, and their plan is to slowly cut off
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:40.600]  the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:45.800]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it,
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:52.040]  word for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan. We cover it live
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:57.400]  weekdays, 11 a.m. at 3 p.m. at infowars.com for its last show. Tell everybody to tune in now and
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:44:03.000]  war the world. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell,
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.240]  I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you,
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:11.960]  the new world orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after
[1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:16.360]  us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:21.240]  air and please support the local station you're listening to as well. At the same time, go to
[1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:27.560]  infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements
[1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:33.240]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing. I need your help
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:38.280]  more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:43.960]  us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great

[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:12.520]  the writings of Teddy Roosevelt I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:17.160]  write a paper on the man in the arena and I just remember thinking about that and saying I want
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:22.200]  to be the man in the arena. But when it comes to media info wars has been the tip of that spear,
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:28.040]  but Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:33.000]  it comes to election fraud and other issues. And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use

[1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:54.680]  with promo code Alex. And if you do it, it funds the info war, it funds the election investigation
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:47:00.360]  and it stands up against the globalist bullies mypillow.com promo code Alex take action now.
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:28.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show I just talked to another very prominent
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:35.000]  well known medical doctor guy that goes on Fox news. And he was just telling me the hospitals
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:41.960]  are just being surged with sick people, particularly the vaccinated. But you see,
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:47.160]  I said two months ago on air, I said, Okay, they lied before the hospitals weren't full.
[1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:50.760]  Now they're getting full. Now people are really sick. And it's from the vaccinated. Here's the
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:55.320]  documents. And then now the numbers came out in Texas and Florida and Hawaii, which is the most
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:48:02.760]  vaccinated by the way. And it's just to the top way worse than last year. This is all planned out.
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:09.880]  But don't listen to me. Here's Bloomberg. Vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:14.440]  serious illnesses from COVID variant than previously thought. They go on to say, Oh,
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.720]  looks like you're actually in worse shape. Now you got to take more shots, which is what their
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:29.960]  head scientist already said. See how we give you tomorrow's news today. These people have been
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:34.760]  trapped, but they know their psychological profile. They can't admit they've been conned.
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:42.040]  There's Hawaii. That's the number of illnesses. That's the number right after the mask mandate
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:50.040]  and the vaccines way worse than a year ago. And the same numbers are everywhere.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:54.920]  Now we have a special guest joining us.
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:49:01.800]  Pilots seek restraining order against United Airlines, unlawful and life threatening vaccine
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:05.560]  mandate because if blood clots are already bad, the general public that all these so-called
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:12.280]  vaccines create, it's a death sentence for the pilots. We've got that special lawyer that's
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:18.600]  launched this. This is a big deal. Joining us 15 minutes to the next hour. And I just hope you'll
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:25.160]  pray for a global awakening and pray for the truth tellers and just pray that everyone
[1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:29.160]  have the strength to stand against this because this is so satanic. I mean, I haven't even gotten
[1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:33.640]  into all the world ID, world government news, how they've openly announced forced inoculations
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:39.640]  for everybody. It's just insane. I'm gonna get to all that at the start of the hour in a news
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:44.600]  place before we have a special guest on. But we need to talk about the front lines of this fight.
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:53.160]  And that's Australia. Australia is the globalist model. So is New Zealand. They chose it. They
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:58.040]  say, don't look at the sun. Don't go outside. Don't talk to your neighbors. It's a cult just like
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:04.680]  Canada, but worse. But it's because their people are good. Only 25% have taken it because they're
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:08.680]  great people. They have good instincts, probably the best in the world because they were taken
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:15.240]  there as prisoners. In old England, when they were taken there in the last 200 years, if you had
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:21.400]  debt or smarted off to somebody, you'd be sent with your whole family, including women and children
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:28.200]  on slave ships there. They've always had good people, but they've always had bad police in Australia.
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:33.960]  And so everything you see happening in Australia is the plan for here. And I hope you understand
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:40.040]  that. And I hope you know that. And that's why this report is so important. So here's the report.
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:44.520]  The rest of the world increasingly thinks Australia has lost the plot. Contrary,
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:48.440]  they've got the UN plot. They're following the exact globalist plot. Here it is.
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:55.320]  The rest of the world is increasingly thinking Australia has lost the plot. And frankly,
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:51:00.760]  who can blame them with some of the most draconian restrictions anywhere in the world right now?
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:07.240]  And police resorting to pointing guns with so-called pepper ball pellets at protesters
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:14.200]  in the streets of Melbourne. This isn't Australia, I know. What has happened to the lucky country?
[1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:20.280]  No wonder people overseas think we're barking mad. What else can you say about a country where
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:26.760]  dogs are shot dead in the name of COVID safety? Yes, as the Sydney Morning Herald reports,
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:33.160]  several impounded dogs due to be rescued by shelter have instead been shot dead.
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:39.640]  Berkshire Council killed the dogs to prevent volunteers at an animal shelter
[1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:45.320]  from travelling to pick up the animals. The rest of the world looks on with disbelief as we
[1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:52.680]  rationalise any manner of cruelty and craziness. Not letting loved ones visit their dying family
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:57.960]  members across borders. Making people travel further for emergency hospital care so they
[1:51:57.960 --> 1:52:04.520]  don't cross a state border. We've grown so used to this insanity. What seems mad to many around
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:11.080]  the world has been normalised here. Like a state premier scolding their constituents
[1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:15.480]  for watching a sunset. You know, there's a whole bunch of people down the right back
[1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:18.840]  beach last night who thought the best thing to do is to go and watch the sunset.
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:25.320]  I'm sure it was a beautiful sunset. But that's not in the spirit or in the letter of these rules.
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:33.480]  We even had Dan Andrews telling people not to enjoy yesterday's beautiful sunshine
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:39.240]  because you could end up in hospital. Sunday I think is going to be quite a nice day. Yep,
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:45.240]  at home. At home. Otherwise, it'll be lots of Sundays spent in hospital.
[1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:53.000]  The alarmist rhetoric of politicians, activists and some public health bureaucrats together with
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:59.720]  the relentless media scaremongering has left the public as scared and hopelessly uninformed
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:07.080]  about coronavirus in August 2021 as they were in March 2020. As the rest of the world, the advanced
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:12.120]  world with varying degrees of success learns to live with the virus, a number of state
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:17.320]  premiers in Australia talking about ongoing restrictions, border closures and even lockdowns
[1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:23.800]  once we are 80% fully vaccinated. So it was pleasing today to finally have the prime minister
[1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:31.160]  abandon his lockdowns will only stop when lockdowns work mantra and speak with clarity and purpose
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:36.440]  about learning to live with coronavirus once we reach a 70% vaccination rate.
[1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:46.520]  It is always darkest before the dawn and I think these lockdowns are demonstration of that.
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:52.280]  But the dawn is not far away and we are working towards that dawn and we are hastening towards
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:54:01.960]  the dawn. We should not delay it. We should prepare for it. We should not fear it. We should embrace it
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:11.000]  and we should move forward together. There will be those who will seek to undermine the national
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:17.560]  plan. There will be those who will seek to undermine confidence in it. I think their motives are clear.
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:25.400]  Predictably we already have Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan hitting back at the PM
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:31.960]  and of course the lockdown enthusiasts are already moving the goalposts. Now they want the entire
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:39.640]  population including children under 16 vaccinated for our 80% threshold to be met. Here is Labor
[1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:46.360]  Leader Anthony Albanese. And we know also that families, mums and dads are really worried
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:53.560]  about their kids and are worried about the implications of what plan we need in terms of
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:59.480]  vaccinating people who are under 16. And that is unclear at this point in time.
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:03.880]  And here is Greens Leader Adam Bant. He tweeted,
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:10.840]  understand the trick Morrison is trying to pull. His target of 80% vaccination rate
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:18.040]  is of 16 plus year olds. That's only 65% of the whole population. He's excluding kids from
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:23.160]  his targets to make the targets. Yeah, you can't allow that. It's a political decision that makes
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:30.440]  us less safe. To the left. That's what he tweeted. And it's utterly absurd. Most countries only
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:36.920]  include over 18s in their vaccination targets. We are using over 16s. The scare mongering around
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:42.440]  kids and COVID is hitting fever pitch among some activists, medics and politicians.
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:48.040]  Then there is Bill Boutel who despite having an arts degree is presented as a leading public
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:55.240]  health expert by the ABC and other free to air stations. And right at the moment, the plan is
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:01.160]  if you're under 15, you won't be vaccinated. Well, they're our kids. They're our grandkids.
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:06.920]  They're the people who will pay the price of what I find quite extraordinary. Why the rush?
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:14.360]  They're targeting our children, folks. These are monsters. The Satanists always target the
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:24.600]  children continue. Of our present situation, let's get these cases in New South Wales and Victoria
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:28.840]  back to approaching zero like Queensland did in South Australia and Western.
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.320]  Let's pause again. We look at the gold zero. They can have a fake test anytime they want.
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:37.640]  What we wake up, there can't be one case of something. They created a freaking lab and
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:42.680]  the very people that created it are now our bosses saying natural immunity doesn't exist.
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:47.800]  Lying to us. God, these people are cult members and they're all given a script to read by three
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:58.040]  people. Fauci, Gates and Schwab. Hitler, Stalin and Mao. Continue. Back to that position.
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:02.600]  Let's vaccinate everybody. And if we've got to put this off for a few months, well, what's the
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:10.920]  problem? What's the problem? We've been in a destructive lockdown cycle for 18 months. What's
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:15.720]  a few more months? It's not like there's any collateral damage like kids self-harming in
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:19.640]  record. Let's stop right there. But everybody always addresses it like the other side means
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:25.560]  well. It's the great reset. It's a premeditated psycho plan to overthrow free society. They know
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:31.640]  what they're doing. They're bought and paid for. Arrest them. Please support us to keep us on the
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:37.080]  air. infowarstore.com. Like I said, we're really fighting hard for everybody, fighting hard for
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:41.720]  our own futures, your futures together. infowarstore.com. Get there. Give out a mineral fusion
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.960]  back at stock 33% off. It'll sell out quickly and more. Get some t-shirts while you're there as
[1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:52.760]  well. We'll be right back. The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:58.840]  be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:04.360]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:09.880]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:15.880]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken
[1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:21.240]  from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:26.760]  there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:32.200]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually
[1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:37.880]  will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:44.760]  years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and
[1:58:44.760 --> 1:58:52.120]  lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.

[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:10.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the design collapse of civilization. It's designed to literally have
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:14.760]  society break down and end as we know it. Creating a worldwide disintegration will cover it next
[2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:19.560]  segment. We can stop it. There's not much time. John Bounds followed a new report on the situation
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:27.800]  in Afghanistan that's a microcosm. American citizens are trapped behind enemy lines. They can't
[2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:34.040]  reach the airport in Kabul that is surrounded by thousands of refugees in Taliban because they
[2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:38.920]  are being hunted. My direction, the State Department continues to reach out to the remaining
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:45.080]  Americans we have identified by phone, email and other means to ascertain their whereabouts and
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:51.240]  their plans. Showing their passports will only get them killed. These American citizens and
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:58.680]  American allies and residents are soon either going to be executed by Taliban regime because
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:04.520]  they're behind enemy lines or either they're going to be dying out of hunger and thirst because
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:11.400]  they cannot get out of their house to get food and get water. So these people are at really high
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:17.880]  risk. There's thousands of them. My sister, she's got two kids in America. She's an American citizen
[2:01:17.880 --> 2:01:24.040]  and it's been six days, seven days. She's attempted three times to go to the airport but
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:30.520]  they will not let them pass unless they show at their passports. If they show their passports,
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:36.680]  if they wave their passport at a Taliban, that this is made. This is an American citizen.
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:42.120]  That's a death call, death sentence for herself. She will be killed on the spot or she will be
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:49.240]  taken and executed. Other countries are sending in special forces to extract their citizens.
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:54.600]  Biden has essentially turned his back on the American citizens. His hasty pullout has trapped
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:02:00.760]  and with little over a week left to accomplish the impossible, Biden will fail on a massive scale.
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:08.360]  We're nine days away from the August 31st deadline. Will you extend that deadline or what is your
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:14.200]  thought process on extending the evacuation operation? There's discussions going on among us
[2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:20.520]  and the military about extending our hope is we will not have to extend but there are going to be
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:26.680]  discussions I suspect on how far along we are in the process. As an unmitigated disaster,
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:30.680]  hostages are already being taken, they're already being killed and the next step
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:37.640]  is to go in there and seize all the airfields across Afghanistan, create a safe corridor,
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:44.200]  go out and get our guy, our citizens, our allies, our Afghans and bring them back.
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:50.360]  Taliban is going to run, Al Qaeda is going to run, they can't face us, but this is probably six to
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:56.680]  eight months of additional time added to the timeline in my opinion. Biden's latest speech
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:03.320]  reveals that he refuses to grasp the full weight of what his administration caused,
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:08.040]  instead continuing to pat himself on the back. What we are doing is extraordinary.
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:14.280]  Paul also found that based in part what's transpired in the last week, the majority of Americans,
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:20.280]  and forgive me I'm just a messenger, no longer considering it to be competent, focused or effective in the job.
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:25.080]  I've never seen that pull.
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:38.840]  Look, I had a basic decision to make. I either withdraw America from a 20-year war
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:45.480]  that, depending on whose analysis you accept, cost us $150 million a day for 20 years,
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:50.600]  or $300 million a day for 20 years. Where do our national interests, where do they lie?
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:04:00.760]  And the idea that we are in a situation where we can not recognize that terrorism has metastasized
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:05.400]  around the world, and the need for us to focus on other parts of the world to create an even greater
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:12.760]  danger of an Al Qaeda-like operation beginning, can't be ignored. My job is to make judgments.
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.280]  My job is to make judgments no one else can or will make. I made them. I'm convinced I'm absolutely
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:25.640]  correct. Is the Taliban going to attempt to be able to unite and provide for the well-being of the
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:32.600]  people of Afghanistan, which no one group has ever done since before, for hundreds of years?
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:40.120]  And if it does, it's going to need everything from additional help in terms of economic assistance,
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:45.560]  trade, and a whole range of things. The Taliban has said we'll see whether they mean it or not.
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:52.040]  They're seeking legitimacy. I think that history is going to record. This was the logical, rational...
[2:04:52.040 --> 2:04:56.520]  And now the Taliban is starting to attack U.S. forces and they don't leave. Well, they're not
[2:04:56.520 --> 2:05:04.760]  back. Stay with us. Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal. Many of them are synthetic.
[2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:08.520]  Many of them have fillers and additives. Many of them just pass right through the body
[2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:14.200]  and are not absorbed. But that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective
[2:05:14.200 --> 2:05:20.280]  product that it's now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock. And that is vitamin,
[2:05:20.280 --> 2:05:25.080]  mineral fusion. All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of chiamino
[2:05:25.080 --> 2:05:30.040]  acids help it upload better into your body and your cells. It's in powder form. It's great for
[2:05:30.040 --> 2:05:34.200]  children. It's great for adults. It's really important for folks that are older because they
[2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:39.080]  don't absorb as well through their gut. So this liquid formula really, really does. It makes up
[2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:43.560]  a picture of it every couple of days. Put it in the refrigerator or keep it out in the kitchen.
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:47.480]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening. It tastes great. It makes your
[2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:53.800]  body healthy. It boosts your immune system. And it funds the info war. A true 360 wins.
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:05:57.720]  So vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for a month is back in stock for a limited time.
[2:05:57.720 --> 2:06:24.600]  33% off info war store.com the Pharaoh. On record, it's carbon on the sides of the
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:33.960]  pyramids. And the obelisk ordered the first born sons. The time of Ramses, the first,
[2:06:35.320 --> 2:06:42.280]  they put to the sword in a human sacrifice to their gods. And if you believe the Jewish story
[2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:51.000]  of Passover, then decades later as judgment, God sends the angel of death to kill the firstborn
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:58.120]  of the Egyptians. Well, we know that's the way the world works, right? It comes around, goes around.
[2:07:00.040 --> 2:07:05.080]  And if anybody is a pagan, if anybody is somebody promoting occultism, it's Klaus Schwab.
[2:07:05.960 --> 2:07:11.480]  So I've read four Klaus Schwab's books. We've had a bunch of guests on about it.
[2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:23.960]  But just this weekend, I was searching around and followed some links and I went to Wikipedia
[2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:31.640]  of all places. And I went through the links that went to articles and quotes he's put out
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:40.200]  where he says, I want a global dictatorship. I don't want the general public to have a say.
[2:07:42.520 --> 2:07:45.720]  Now, we already know all this, but even Wikipedia says it.
[2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:53.880]  And they got articles from 2015, 16 by major international think tanks saying the Deimos
[2:07:53.880 --> 2:07:58.200]  group is really the Bilderberg group with all the big money, all the big banks and the Chinese.
[2:07:58.200 --> 2:08:05.000]  And it's going to end up overthrowing the governments of the world. And
[2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:15.320]  we've got a big problem because
[2:08:19.720 --> 2:08:23.880]  Klaus Schwab wants to replace it with an authoritarian model.
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:27.480]  And you know, the crew is great. I sent them a bunch of clips this weekend, and I forgot
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:31.400]  during the break to get those clips lined up. Do you guys have the Klaus Schwab clips lined up?
[2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:38.440]  There's so many of them. Just maybe play the one that the lockdown never ends,
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:43.480]  that the great reset never ends, or the one where he wants us to be angry. Just play a few of those.
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:51.640]  Just play a few of those. Here it is. We'll play out in November, but what we know is that we will
[2:08:51.640 --> 2:08:59.480]  end up with many more unemployed, and particularly also people in the gray economy, which are not
[2:08:59.480 --> 2:09:07.800]  counted for who lose their jobs. So we will see definitely a lot of anger already now,
[2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:15.160]  but probably increased by the end of the year, because this crisis will be with us until we
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:24.280]  really have found remedy. So we have to prepare for a more angry world and how to prepare.
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:29.000]  It means to take the necessary action to create the fair world.
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:34.200]  Okay, so let's stop right there. The mega banks that don't pay taxes that are screwing everybody
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:38.520]  over. Big Tech has doubled and tripled its profits under what he's done the last two years.
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:44.200]  We have to prepare for more angry world. And he goes on in his writings to explain,
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:50.040]  we're going to blame the nation states. We own these presidents. We own these prime ministers.
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:53.080]  We're going to have them do all these horrible things and lock people down.
[2:09:53.720 --> 2:09:58.040]  And then the society will collapse because there's no food and water. We'll organize the third world
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:03.240]  to invade the first world, the UN will, and then we'll organize the public for a new communist system
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:08.440]  and a universal income because there's no jobs and no food when it's their order to lock down
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:11.640]  and the virus they released. That was the pretext of the whole thing.
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:19.320]  And he says it all the great reset, but this is Wikipedia, Cloud Schwab,
[2:10:20.440 --> 2:10:23.960]  head of the Builderberg group, world government, head of the UN sustainability project,
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:30.200]  calls for depopulation, all the foundations he runs. And you go read it. Look at this,
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:37.000]  capture of democratic structures and institutions. Schwab, as publisher of the World Economic Forum
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  2010 Global Redesign, which is just a coming out of the Builderberg group, postulates that a
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:48.760]  globalized world is best managed by a coalition of multinational corporations, what do you see
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:59.160]  happening now, governments, including through the UN system, a civil select society, organizations,
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:07.800]  CSOs, it argues that governments can no longer and are overwhelmingly dominant
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:15.000]  actors on the world stage and that the time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:24.040]  for international governance. The WEF's vision includes a public private UN in which certain
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:29.240]  specialized agencies would operate under joint state and non-state governance systems.
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:37.080]  According to the Transnational Institute, the forum is hence planning to replace
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:43.720]  a recognized democratic model with a model where a self-selected, that's called dictatorship,
[2:11:43.720 --> 2:11:48.600]  self-selected group of stakeholders make decisions on behalf of the world.
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:53.640]  A self-selected group of stakeholders make decisions on behalf of the people of the world.
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:56.360]  Doesn't matter what your doctor says, doesn't matter what you want, doesn't matter what your
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:02.120]  governor says, they say. The think tank summarizes that we are increasingly entering a world where
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:08.200]  gatherings such as Davos are a silent global coup d'etat to capture governance.
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:19.560]  Now, let's actually read an article written by the international trilateral institution
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:28.680]  admitting what's going on. Davos and its danger to democracy. Now, let me explain,
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:38.920]  Schwab explains this. They have the idiot, Trudeau, the moron, Joe Biden, the fool, Merkel, and the
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:45.720]  buffoon, Boris Johnson, and Macron, the little, he's been a pedophile slave since he was six years
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:51.960]  old on record. He was at a sex dungeon on record at 12 on record. So he's been in a slave brothel
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:59.880]  since 12 publicly, we're saying earlier. All these people you see up there are total puppets.
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:09.480]  And they're the ones saying, do not look at the sun. Do not, do not talk to your neighbor
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:15.640]  to make you hate them so you think the Australian government or the US government is this so you
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:19.720]  hate your institutions while the very globalists are above it manipulating the whole thing to
[2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:25.000]  destroy it. And of course, these low grade morons they put in don't even know they're destroying
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:31.320]  themselves when they say, do not look at the sun, do not talk to your neighbors. And Schwab jokes,
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:36.360]  he goes, we will make them very angry. And at the right time, they will abolish their governments
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:40.680]  and sign on to you and control. Once we have the new global currency over their phones,
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:45.320]  we will guarantee them a new income and direct them and forgive all debts, but then they will be
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:54.440]  under complete control. And they are so close to this. So again, I'm not defending our corrupt
[2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:59.880]  governments, but why would they have the FBI going around and engaging in such crime? Why would they
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:06.280]  have the CIA and in the news? Oh, the CIA supplied thousands of boys to Afghans to rape. Because the
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:13.400]  CIA was set up by Cecil Rhodes. The CIA was set up to bring down the US. It's always been there
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:19.720]  doing this. And that's why you have the collapse of Afghanistan. All of it is about destroying
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:23.560]  the nation state, because at least there you get some due process, some something.
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:32.120]  But under this, you get absolutely nothing. So it's on folks, and they just plan the collapse
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:37.960]  of society. And they've announced their new world ID won't just be a chip. Schwab says,
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:43.640]  we can transcend the chip. The heart is a highly powerful electromagnetic computer. Yeah, it puts
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:48.600]  off a lot of electricity. And the hair on my left side of my chest is grayed out on the other.
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:55.080]  That's about electricity. That's from that powerful beast. And it's flamethrowing. And
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:15:01.560]  they go, your new ID will be a hot scanners will control you. You will wear a bag over your head
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:07.160]  submission. No more meat. You owe nothing. And he knows we're under Stockholm syndrome. So the
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:10.840]  average liberal woman actually like worship and they go, Oh, God, I want nothing. I don't want
[2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:15.880]  to own anything. Kill me, Schwab is literally left. This is gonna kill me. Kill me, Schwab. He
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:21.720]  just I will kill you. I'm going to kill you. He's just slaughtering Africa mass murdering them and
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:27.720]  then just organizing who's left in giant armies to invade us. It's just it's just it's just absolute
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:33.000]  hell on earth. And I told you to come with force inoculations coming world government coming
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.160]  with open borders. Close the shots don't work. That's all admitted down. Bloomberg says, Oh, turns
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:41.480]  out you get sicker if you've got this vaccine. Oh, don't worry, we got more vaccines for him.
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:47.080]  So you're going to see it games are over. I'm kind of happy about it in a way. All these
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:51.960]  leftists will soon be dead on their own accord. Get ready folks and get close to Jesus because
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:54.280]  games are over from the red back.
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:02.600]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:08.600]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why we now
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:14.200]  have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:19.880]  life saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run
[2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:26.120]  quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:30.760]  Whether it's wildfires dangerous, whether power grid issues or just getting off the grid,
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:36.120]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again. Even better all this week,
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:42.840]  radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to

[2:18:00.680 --> 2:18:08.120]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that it's
[2:18:08.120 --> 2:18:13.800]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public. They do the same things over
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:20.280]  and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again. Well,
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:28.360]  guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenesis Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the
[2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:32.920]  mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:37.800]  they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:43.880]  T1 parasites in the body and create autoimmune disorders. The problem for them was the viruses
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:49.400]  would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road. That's why they need to roll out the
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:54.680]  COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[2:18:54.680 --> 2:19:08.760]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:19:25.640 --> 2:19:31.560]  of corporate dictatorship under the UN. They admit all of this. They plan the lockdowns,
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:36.920]  they release the viruses, they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:41.640]  the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:46.840]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it,
[2:19:46.840 --> 2:19:53.080]  word for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan. We cover it live
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:59.080]  weekdays 11 a.m. at 3 p.m. at infowars.com for a show. Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
[2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:21.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:39.080]  and we are back live on this monday august 23 worldwide transmission under host alex jones
[2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:43.400]  we've got this article out of life site news pilot secret training order against the united
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:48.120]  airlines unlawful life-threatening vaccine mandate will tell you what the judge has done
[2:20:48.120 --> 2:20:53.320]  with this and a new big suit that's being prepared to be filed we've got the documents right here
[2:20:53.320 --> 2:20:59.480]  joining us is one of the lead lawyers involved in this Ken Ferguson at the Ferguson law pa.com
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:04.280]  we really appreciate him standing up and taking action and so give us the latest there's a lot
[2:21:04.280 --> 2:21:08.920]  of big news here obviously and this is an unprecedented what's happening with the blood clot
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:14.760]  issue connected to these so-called shots and then what happens with pilots this is really scary
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:22.920]  it is alex so what we did is we petitioned the southern district of florida to basically ask
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:28.840]  them for a hard stop we have affidavits of highly qualified doctors who are saying that not only do
[2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:35.400]  these vaccines pose specific harms to the public generally but they pose specific harms to pilots
[2:21:35.400 --> 2:21:41.000]  who fly at 36 000 feet in the air and i think that we can all agree it doesn't matter provax left
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:45.880]  right it doesn't matter that at the end of the day this is about safety and these pilots are very
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:53.400]  concerned that if they were to be forced to be inoculated or if they're up in the air at 36 000
[2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:58.440]  feet and something happens to both the pilot and co-pilot we better pray that one of the
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:05.000]  300 passengers on board knows how to fly and land an aircraft this is a help and safety issue not
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:13.400]  only for the pilots but for the passengers and the public as well now looking at this before it
[2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:18.760]  wasn't an authorized shot which pilots in urmberg but but still the way they authorized it wasn't
[2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:25.400]  done properly so this is all a giant a giant fraud here i mean even most foreign countries
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:30.440]  aren't aren't going this far uh why do you think the airlines are doing this and where are you guys
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:35.960]  going from here alex is a good point i the one question we keep asking and the pilots want to
[2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:40.360]  know too is why are we doing this so fast why are we rushing this you know united claims it's all
[2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:44.760]  about it's safety for its all its employees but yet if you check veirs even according to veirs
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:51.480]  which as we know the info that they're putting out is suspect at best but even according to veirs
[2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:58.360]  there's over 12 000 reported deaths which is over which is double the amount of the last two decades
[2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:03.000]  so you know it's not safe for their employees but yet they're dictating
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:10.680]  their employees what to do with their bodies and again it is unconscionable to me to think
[2:23:10.680 --> 2:23:15.240]  that they are having to tell somebody to take an experimental vaccine i mean hey choose between
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:21.080]  your livelihood to feed clothes and house your families or take an experimental vaccine and i
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:27.560]  mean it is it's disgusting alex i'm very bothered by it um these are mothers these are fathers these
[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:35.720]  people are calling me hysterical that's not hyperbole this is real uh my phone i i can't
[2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:39.800]  keep up with the calls quite literally and i want the people who are listening and to watch
[2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:44.280]  to know that someone is out there fighting for you you're not alone and there's a lot of people
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:52.120]  like you uh alex on the toro i filed there was um 18 pilots there's getting ready to be exceedingly
[2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:58.040]  over uh 60 other employees that we're getting ready to file this lawsuit and it's going to be big
[2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:03.320]  and we're coming hard well of course i'm never good at announcing the big announcement up front
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:07.640]  you are filing a major lawsuit against these airlines please tell us about that
[2:24:09.240 --> 2:24:13.800]  sure i i hope you can appreciate this i don't want to tilt my hand too much but suffice to say
[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:20.680]  we filed a toro a temporary restraining order and the judge did deny it based on that he did
[2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:26.760]  not think that the facts were sufficient enough to establish a likelihood of success or that
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:32.520]  they would suffer irreparable harm which is frankly insulting basically the judge on one hand
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:38.680]  said that because they can wait until they're fired then they can then seek monetary damages
[2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:44.120]  is insulting at best because again the point of the of us seeking an emergency restraining order
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:50.360]  is because this is an issue of national security i that can't be overstated i mean we're talking about
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:58.440]  pilots who fly airplanes um they don't feel safe alex they are quite literally calling and doing
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:03.880]  all the protocols saying we are so stressed they're not they are calling in sick or they're doing the
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:11.480]  proper protocols in order to um because they don't feel safe flying much less uh you know
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:15.560]  wanting to get inoculated with some experimental vaccine that's by the way you see how this is
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:19.240]  already a lot of hospitals are shutting down because a lot of the doctors and nurses are
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:23.960]  quitting over forced inoculation a lot of the airplanes are flights are being canceled but
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:29.800]  this is already breaking society down and then they admit these so-called vaccines aren't even
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:36.680]  working the efficacy of the phisors down to like 30 or 40 some percent now yeah alex you know something
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:42.520]  else i want to point out is this is not just the airlines it's everybody i ever since um i've
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:48.440]  taken lead on this i have had calls believe it or not from pharmaceutical companies the actual
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:54.360]  companies are people saying i don't want to have to be forced to take this i'm having it from hospitals
[2:25:54.360 --> 2:25:59.560]  i'm having it from um fire departments i've you know i don't want to divulge the clients obviously
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:05.720]  but it is everywhere alex it's rampant and what i keep trying to tell people is you know and i and
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:11.320]  i encourage them to follow what their employers tell them to do but you can follow these uh eoc
[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:16.920]  exemptions but i mean i don't think that america was founded on the principles that you should be
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:21.400]  able to have to convince somebody how christian enough you are or how buddhist enough you are
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:27.960]  and then have the company decide whether or not that's that fits their uh reasonableness as to
[2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:31.640]  whether or not you should well sure i mean claus Schwab said all this up i covered it last hour
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:38.280]  even as wikipedia says he wants corporate governance and he says this whole force vaccine thing is a
[2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:44.440]  first test of global corporate governance yeah that's exactly what it is and and this is the
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:49.000]  other thing and i know uh i've heard you talk about this before but here's the thing at first
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:54.440]  the employee made at least this is for united it's you know you can take one shot of johnson
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:59.560]  and johnson or two shots of medurna okay but here's the thing right what happens when it's
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:04.520]  okay well now you got to get the booster and then it's booster one booster two booster three this
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:10.360]  isn't going to stop and that's that's the real concern here it's not going to stop with just
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:15.640]  just uh one shot or two shots it's going to keep going and it's going to be all in the name of well
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:21.960]  it's in your safety until it's obviously too late and i keep saying this um that i don't know what
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:27.800]  it's going to take to wake america up out of apathy this is not this is uh very serious and it's
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:33.080]  incredibly alarming and concerning as uh you know to our constitutional rights you should not be
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:40.760]  having to barter with our god-given rights as americans on a scale of one to ten historical
[2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:46.600]  turning wise we've never seen something this crazy vaccine passports global ids all the big tech
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:51.880]  running it censoring medical doctors censoring treatments uh you know announcing all this stuff
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:58.200]  i mean this is incredible absolutely and i actually just found this out today that believe it or not
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:03.640]  united is using a we're going to be of alleging this that united's using inconsistent data from the
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:10.680]  cdc and the nih um from a doctor who guess what worked with dr fouchy at the gain of function
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:16.760]  research in north carolina who is currently on the board of fiser i mean it's not they're not
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:24.280]  even hiding it anymore alex and it's uh i'm really pissed i'm i'm angry these people are good americans
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:27.960]  more than half of them have served our country in the military and they're pissed and they
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:37.880]  have a right to be well this is a genetic economic um financial biomedical takeover and we come back
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:42.040]  i want you to recap this and get into the suit how people support it and what's happening because
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:46.120]  this is the tip of the spear they're coming for everybody ladies and gentlemen and and there's
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:50.520]  never enough shots there's never enough as thomas jefferson said the level of tyranny you live under
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:29:00.200]  is what you will accept we'll be right back stay with us if you're concerned about the power grid
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:05.320]  and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most important
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:11.160]  message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:17.080]  stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:23.160]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an
[2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:28.360]  endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:33.880]  grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:39.560]  again even better all this week radio listeners get over seven hundred dollars in free off the
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:45.560]  grid bonuses too go to my solar backup dot com to learn more and check availability that's my solar

[2:29:59.880 --> 2:30:05.000]  so when i first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:10.360]  had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group
[2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:14.920]  on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:18.760]  and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you have
[2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:22.200]  you know with the deep version source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[2:30:22.200 --> 2:30:28.680]  and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[2:30:28.680 --> 2:30:33.720]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:38.200]  couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements
[2:30:38.200 --> 2:30:43.080]  they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it'll literally
[2:30:43.080 --> 2:30:47.160]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:51.560]  we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way
[2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:56.760]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much
[2:30:56.760 --> 2:31:04.360]  for your call and godspeed let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science
[2:31:04.360 --> 2:31:09.880]  fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of
[2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:14.600]  congress and former presidents are censured by big tech and where if you don't take an
[2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:21.240]  experimental injection that grows blood clots and and prions all over your body that you're not allowed
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:28.040]  to fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago
[2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:34.760]  tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now
[2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:39.320]  and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy and it doesn't really work
[2:31:39.320 --> 2:31:44.200]  she got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted say great i want to
[2:31:44.200 --> 2:31:48.440]  take it all the time so i can go outside and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick
[2:31:48.440 --> 2:31:53.400]  from covid and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of
[2:31:53.400 --> 2:31:59.000]  the virus and that's in mainline studies bill gates and foulsy did this need to go to prison for it right
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:05.240]  now you say you want to fight tyranny you say you want to fund the second american revolution
[2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:10.120]  i know you do that's why you're here so i'm encouraging all of you watching and listening
[2:32:10.120 --> 2:32:15.000]  right now to understand that there are really two places in the media that don't back down

[2:33:37.640 --> 2:33:44.920]  ken furgeson's a lawyer who's doing it out of florida furgeson law pa dot com smart guy

[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:54.920]  we know because this is just amazing experimental vaccines they admit don't work
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:34:00.840]  that aren't vaccines and now they're trying to make a mandatory and and now they've said oh
[2:34:00.840 --> 2:34:05.480]  now it's approved by the fda even though it skipped all the federal laws i mean this is a twilight
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:12.200]  zone event it is and right before the breakouts you mentioned the uh fiscal nightmare this is
[2:34:12.200 --> 2:34:18.680]  causing you know it's interesting the uh the united spends hundreds of millions of dollars
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:23.160]  training their pilots their flight attendants uh maintenance workers you know are they just
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:27.800]  going to write this off this is now a sunk cost to them i mean think about what might be really
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:33.480]  going on for them to want to write off all the experience of pilots and in fact um united actually
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:38.680]  announced i found this out recently that united announced a company-wide jobs fair where programs
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:46.040]  where they attend to hire 5 000 new pilots who have zero flight hours uh that is reckless at best
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:50.120]  so i always am thinking to myself these days it's like who's going to be paying for these
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:57.000]  sunk costs the the safety of the passengers the shareholders stockholders i mean what what's going
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  on here um so that again because i saw that and they they couched well they're going to be minorities
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:07.160]  but we're going to hire people that weren't even trying to be jet pilots i mean this sounds like
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:12.840]  a twilight zone episode again as i just said no that you got it and the thing is is you know these
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:18.840]  guys who my uh the the name plaintiffs and there's going to be a lot more i i'm not kidding you when
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:26.680]  i said that my phone was so full of of calls and um voice messages that i had to call my provider and
[2:35:26.680 --> 2:35:31.160]  get more memory because it was so overloaded people are scared and i want them to know i want to
[2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:35.720]  reiterate this that we're going to be fighting for you you're not alone and that is important to
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:40.360]  know alexis people are calling you know and just elated to know that someone's out there fighting
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:46.120]  for them so just let i want to let those who i haven't returned and those that um are listening
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:50.520]  that people are going to go to bat for you there are people who care and we're going to be fighting
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:55.560]  for this well can i mean this is the whole future that this is a corporate attempted world government
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:36:02.120]  pharmaceutical company takeover with things that don't work that have all these problems
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:05.960]  and now they want to make everybody take it but then have you seen the video of the ceo of
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:10.120]  fiser saying he's not going to take it and then the former chief scientist at fiser says don't
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:18.280]  take it i mean i mean this is just madness yeah again i without um divulging too much information
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:23.080]  there there's somebody from one of those companies who have actually called me concerned that they're
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:28.440]  going to impose a mandate and based on what i'm doing with united may want me to go forward with
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:33.000]  them i mean think about that there are employees at some of these companies who are reluctant to
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:40.040]  want to take the vaccine themselves i think that speaks volumes as to the the efficacy and the um
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:46.440]  how well these things work i guess to say at least but um you know alex going back to it the
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:51.720]  we follow the toro and again that's exactly what it sounds like it's a temporary restraining order
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:55.160]  we're going for a full-blown lawsuit it's going to be filed this week and i'll be sure to send
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:37:02.760]  uh your office a a copy of it and um it's going to hit hard we've got exceedingly over 50 people um
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:07.480]  could have more but it's just a matter of time and the urgency of this to get this thing out and
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:15.000]  filed um and while there will be um allegations uh there actually are some complex issues about
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:20.840]  violations of 1983 uh claims which are civil rights claims you have uh they kind of bridge into title
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:26.360]  seven claims uh they go into um you know other civil rights i was about to ask this is a lawyer
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:32.280]  i mean historically on its face nobody ever tried this it violates the nuremberg code federal law
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:39.000]  common sense hippo i mean it's just it's a bum rush of all of our rights you you know that's what
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:44.600]  i was just about to say alex um i have figured out a way to at least i believe enough i can get a
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:51.160]  judge to call balls and strikes i believe that um we're going to prevail on this um never guarantee
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:55.080]  anything but i all i'm looking forward to judge to look at this for what it is and you said it
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:37:59.880]  let's not check our common sense at the door here the only reason that discrimination exist
[2:37:59.880 --> 2:38:06.680]  is because there must be a set of rights that must be discriminated from so at at its core i keep
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:12.280]  saying that it's um whether it's eeoc title seven 1983 at the end of the day they all eliminate from
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:17.320]  the same source the constitution and i know you're a constitutionalist yourself and you know at the
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:23.160]  end of the day emergency does not create power i understand the the covid pandemic was uh it was
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:30.120]  scary uh people were forced to uh i mean it really was triage at that point i get it but here's the
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:37.080]  thing emergency doesn't create power and the constitution itself was uh we didn't suspend the
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:41.800]  constitution or didn't go on a sabbatical when we were in world war one world war two of korea
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:48.280]  cuban missile crisis uh cold war i mean no the cold the constitution is there so that we know
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:53.880]  that there's always something stable and i feel like and you're the historian uh but you know it's
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:39:00.040]  almost like that over the last 50 years it's almost like congress has whittled away our rights uh
[2:39:00.040 --> 2:39:05.240]  via legislation that's not being protected by that they've been signing it over to the un and
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:11.080]  multinational corporations who admit that's their plan so absolutely we don't just need your suit we
[2:39:11.080 --> 2:39:16.920]  need everybody to false suit and and and everybody just not comply because this is all about a war
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:22.280]  of wills it's not about an inoculation it's not about safety it's about a world id on your phones
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:27.000]  run by big tech to track where you go and what you do and swab and gates admit they want to
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:32.520]  carbon tax everybody and track what you do once you have the medical id that is the basis of this
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:39.800]  world id and going off that it's not just about united i mean i mean i can take this into section
[2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:45.960]  230 i know that's been a big topic and i've heard you talk about that here's the thing just common
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:50.600]  sense will tell you you know lawyers make things often way more complicated than they need to be
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:56.520]  let's just ask ourselves this we are in an era of trillion literally trillion dollar companies
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:00.840]  but the only reason that they're able to exist is because we the american people let that happen
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:06.600]  and i think we need to realize how much power we have so what i have a problem with and it does
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:13.080]  not take the proverbial or anecdotal astuteness of a philadelphia lawyer to appreciate that why would
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:22.280]  we as americans allow big tech big pharma united to strip away our constitutional rights and just
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:29.320]  because they have inc or llc behind their name no that's not the way this works okay we the only
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:33.720]  reason that they're able to make so much money is because the lifeblood of their profits come from
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:39.320]  the employees and i think it's important that we remember that we the people have that power these
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:44.920]  corporations you know what why don't they go incorporate and do all their business over in
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:49.000]  china why don't they go and do their business in germany well no because america is the greatest
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:56.280]  country on earth that they and they're profiting off us of our people so i do not again cannot
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:02.920]  emphasize enough it is the lifeblood of this suit that bothers me is the fact that these companies
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:09.960]  can say well um since we've been employing you for 25 years and uh you know um we're just going
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:14.680]  to let you go because you won't be inoculated with an experimental vaccine that one doesn't work and
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:23.880]  also against a disease that or a virus rather that has a 99 cure rate um it's it's it's it's
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:29.400]  disturbing at best we're being stampeded we're being stampeded into a worldwide medical tyranny
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:34.360]  based technocracy in their own words and that's i'm no lawyer but don't these judges what their
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:40.200]  children live in a free country don't don't people get that if it worked 100 it'd still be wrong
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:45.640]  plus the people running it foushee and gates we're running the luan lab and everything to stand to
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:50.760]  gain from this and control big tech and have been censoring us and blocking treatments it's so obvious
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:56.040]  it's a takeover plan and then we get operation lockstep from the raccofiller foundation 11 years
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:02.120]  ago predicting how they would use this for total control and that's the thing it's it bothers me
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:08.600]  because it's the pilots themselves this is i'm not overstating this they are legitimately concerned
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:16.920]  about flying the plane and i and i keep thinking to myself you know we need to stop with trying to
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:22.600]  find ways to throw lawsuits out okay um when there's a wrong there's supposed to be a remedy
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:27.560]  okay this goes back to a cold common law i mean that was the purpose of the court so as opposed
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:34.200]  to finding ways not to hear things we need to get this addressed and i pray to god that nothing
[2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:41.720]  happens uh between you know after the judge denied our suit or our tro and us filing the full lawsuit
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:47.240]  where we'll be seeking uh temporary and permanent injunctive relief because you know people's lives
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:53.480]  are at stake this is not um hyperbolic this is real life well sure putting untrained pilots in
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:59.560]  because they'll take the deadly shots sounds like deep water horizon when we pitted that it is through
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:05.640]  our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:11.640]  way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big
[2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:17.080]  problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:22.120]  and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:27.880]  the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:34.200]  third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:40.600]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:47.400]  essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:53.480]  will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal get them

[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:25.480]  it off humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening we
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:30.920]  have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:35.960]  research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential and at

[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:30.120]  what we're witnessing is a corporate bureaucratic coup
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:35.960]  against the planet i showed you earlier the writings of statements across swab
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:44.440]  saying that and so that's where we are that's what's going on here and we have to ask ourselves
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:47.800]  are we going to let these bureaucrats sit there and like chicken little scare us
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:53.400]  into taking injections that don't protect us that make us sick but more importantly tracking
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:58.680]  us with the apps as the new world ID card that they're setting up this is a corporate big tech
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:02.360]  revolution i've got the articles here we already told you this over a year ago it already been
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:08.360]  done in secret they got leaked by insiders but all the big tech companies that produce phones
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:16.040]  it's more than seven companies have agreed to this one id system for the new vaccine passport
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:21.320]  and all their software updates have it they're talking about even let you have a phone you better
[2:48:21.320 --> 2:48:25.240]  have it and you better follow it and you better obey it you see so you're gonna have to give up
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:32.440]  your phones soon anyways because they're going to make you submit to them to even have a phone just
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:39.160]  like pakistan uh did a few weeks ago biden's now calling the u.s companies to mandate cover
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:46.280]  19 vaccine for employees following fda decision so you see my friends it's on going back to ken
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:52.520]  ferguson the lower out of fort lauderdale florida representing the united airlines uh employees
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:57.480]  flight attendants and mechanics ken has e-filed a petition with the southern district of florida
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:49:01.480]  asking a judge to order temporary training order that's been denied now he's getting a
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:05.480]  full suit ready please continue with other important points for folks out there
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:12.840]  sure um you know and you had said it before but i mean we are um i'll feel comfortable saying this
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:18.120]  i mean bringing nuremberg as a civil cause of action and as you're familiar with the um the uh
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:22.760]  holinsky accords that's relevant here it's all about consent and these people are having to be
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:29.400]  forced into taking a experimental vaccine or keeping their livelihood it's disgusting to even
[2:49:29.400 --> 2:49:36.840]  think about frankly um you know within strictly guarded parameters all americans do have certain
[2:49:36.840 --> 2:49:41.960]  unalienable rights that we have whether that's um and they cannot be a bridge freedom of religion
[2:49:41.960 --> 2:49:47.320]  privacy the right to be left alone people aren't allowed to physically rape us but big pharma says
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:52.280]  we're going to put a gmo concoction with the immortal cell lines of dead women and children
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:56.360]  into your body we're going to control you we're going to take control of your genetics
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:50:00.600]  or we're not going to let you buy and sell i mean that's that's that's not just rape that's slavery
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:07.480]  exactly um that includes meaningful access to courts people secure in their houses persons um
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.600]  and unreasonable searches and seizures cruel unusual punishment that's what this is i mean
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:17.240]  you're saying hey either you could be i had a conversation with a woman alex who said
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:22.120]  i'm scared i'm going to be homeless i'm going to lose my health insurance maybe i should just
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:27.960]  take it it it's gut-wrenching to me and it's what i don't get is once you give in just like
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:31.640]  everybody the tip of shots oh now they don't work now you've got to take more oh now you're
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:39.640]  still locked down submitting does it get you out of it exactly and at minimum like i keep saying i
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:45.800]  mean there is ample evidence to suggest that the vaccines don't work and let's just say there's
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:50.440]  another opinion of course there's going to be they do the fact that there is a differences of opinion
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:56.840]  why can't we just take a hard stop and pause this is being it's all it's it's strangely no because
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:01.560]  we're being stampede we're being stampede well yeah i was going to ask you i mean it's isn't
[2:51:01.560 --> 2:51:05.800]  it strange i mean i don't have the answer to this but why are they trying to rush this so fast
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:10.440]  what is the what is the hurry because that's what a bloodstream is that's what hitler
[2:51:10.440 --> 2:51:15.800]  debony attacked you've got to get it done quick before people realize what hit them because the
[2:51:15.800 --> 2:51:19.640]  scientists are all on record i mean thousands of them that this is not a vaccine and it's
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:23.880]  going to cause a lot of illnesses and death and so they just want to get it all done ruin our immune
[2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:30.680]  systems and then control us we're going to have shots all the time to live well i i don't think
[2:51:30.680 --> 2:51:36.040]  it's um i think there's a reason why they call it the doctor's trials back in nuremberg i mean
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:42.440]  there was um of the of the those who um were put to death i believe it was 30 30 of the right the
[2:51:42.440 --> 2:51:48.280]  genesis of the nazis and their final solution didn't start in 1942 it started 1933 and it was the
[2:51:48.280 --> 2:51:56.840]  medical core that formed the heart of of everything hitler did yeah um and you know i again and there
[2:51:56.840 --> 2:52:02.040]  are certain causes of action that that that we're planning on bringing um you know because the
[2:52:02.040 --> 2:52:09.400]  information in which united has uh proffered in order to justify why they believe the vaccine is
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:18.120]  necessary is is it's suspect at best and quite frankly it is it's it's it's it's just not true
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:23.480]  it's just not true but you know at the end of the day what i want to hit on that is you know the
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:32.200]  crux or the the bedrock of this lawsuit is the constitutional rights that we have um you know
[2:52:32.200 --> 2:52:37.160]  this is the constitution at its core is is a is a social contract between the people
[2:52:37.160 --> 2:52:42.440]  and the government and we say we're willing to give up absolute freedom in exchange for these
[2:52:42.440 --> 2:52:48.600]  rights or these privileges and so what i find um i struggled to reconcile or how the courts don't
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:56.040]  see this is why would we as americans allow um you know the government we give up rights and we
[2:52:56.040 --> 2:53:01.960]  say government you promise us to not to infringe on our freedom of religion um cruel and unusual
[2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:08.200]  punishment um you know free speech etc and in exchange the government says well we promise
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:14.200]  to provide you health safety and welfare so why on earth would americans be okay with
[2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:19.640]  you know making those promises that with the government that help us why would we not why
[2:53:19.640 --> 2:53:26.440]  would we relinquish those same rights to corporations big tech big pharma whose sole purpose is to
[2:53:26.440 --> 2:53:31.880]  profit off of us it's um you know it's it's a rhetorical question because the answer is obvious
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:37.480]  is we shouldn't but yet it's somehow being let to happen and we've got to say no um i'm doing my part
[2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:42.840]  i'm gonna i'm gonna sue the hell out of them frankly um they they're doing so many things
[2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:50.280]  wrong predicated on misinformation or disinformation and you know it's it's time people stand up um i'm
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:58.600]  a lawyer doing my part doing what i can but i mean alex i'm really concerned i'm not i'm i'm
[2:53:58.600 --> 2:54:03.320]  rather i get it i mean on a scale of again a one to a hundred this is like a three hundred i mean
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:09.400]  what they're power grabbing for if they get across the goal line is a dystopic technocracy tyranny
[2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:14.200]  and the shots don't even work i mean like regeneran i've talked to a bunch of scientists this
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:18.040]  company's been around since the 80s it still might have side effects but it really works and the
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:22.840]  governor of texas is offering it for free and the company's passed on no profit they're doing good
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:27.720]  i know like four or five people have taken it in four or five hours they have no more symptoms
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:33.640]  but of course that's not being pushed and it's not mandatory at least that's a gene therapy that
[2:54:33.640 --> 2:54:39.400]  works this this other thing doesn't work i mean it's it's crazy but it does make you sick so i
[2:54:39.400 --> 2:54:45.960]  guess it does work like it's it's it's almost it's i genuinely find it hard to believe it it's such a
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:53.400]  surreal like you like i said the word is surreal i mean i mean it's like wow yeah and it's like
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:55:00.040]  you know and this is the thing too right um if if give people the option okay even if there's
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:05.800]  there's evidence out there that is you know that the vaccine you know is harmful okay but it should
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:10.200]  be people's choice to take it you shouldn't have to choose between your livelihood and experimental
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:15.320]  vaccine that goes for all your rights you know it shouldn't be up to a company to say how christian
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:19.640]  you are or how buddhist you are or you know we don't think that's a legitimate reason so we're
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:23.560]  going to fire you since you don't take this experimental vaccine sure absolutely i mean
[2:55:23.560 --> 2:55:27.880]  listen here's the way to stop them what you're doing legally everybody just saying no realizing
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:32.680]  the more you give in the more they're gonna want but also the fact that they cooked it up at wuhan
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:37.720]  they stand again fouching gates on the stock it doesn't protect you and and just go on the
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:42.200]  offense at city councils county commissioners everywhere you can get a speech call in to
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:46.760]  c span call and talk radio and everybody go to church speak up warn everybody and just don't
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:54.600]  shut up about it and and expose it and i and i found this uh this gym out today that um why you
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:59.640]  know it's a it's a question that um i'm hoping to find out soon and maybe your audience can would
[2:56:01.480 --> 2:56:05.960]  would like to ask themselves this as well why was united the only airline to receive federal
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:11.320]  authorization to pick up and deliver the vaccine on behalf of the u.s worldwide when these uh drugs
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:17.240]  achieve ua i mean it's the the conflicts of interest in the overlap between government and private
[2:56:17.240 --> 2:56:23.560]  interest is it's it's it's it's it's all it but and you know what alex you say it all the time but
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:29.960]  it's in our face and they don't hide it anymore and it's and it's almost like like what they thought
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:33.480]  you know it's almost like they're saying how much can we push the american people until they stop
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:38.680]  i think you just saw it this is all a giant test ken furgusson as your suit unfolds please

[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:04.360]  and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet

[2:58:22.680 --> 2:58:28.120]  you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total

[3:01:02.840 --> 3:01:09.720]  then making weird faces at each other i told you schumer helps write the show as they you know
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:17.720]  watch afghanistan collapse these are just a bunch of weird twisted nerds who are in power and are
[3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:24.120]  just violating every basic canon of medical rights and free speech and and privacy and now
[3:01:24.120 --> 3:01:28.360]  apple's announced that they're going to read all your messages and scan your photos because you
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:32.920]  might be a pedophile meanwhile the cia supplying little boys to the taliban and the german government
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:37.160]  has been caught in every major city supplying children on purpose two pedophiles to create a
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:42.680]  new family system based on pedophilia that's new yorker magazine we told you about it years ago
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.920]  the exact case so yeah go ahead and roll it with audio this is uh chuckie schumer uh with uh
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:56.600]  dancing and with steven cobert uh who again goes to martha's vineyard you know all the rest of it
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:12.520]  with obama these are a bunch of sick want to be elitist who we've allowed to run our lives here it is
[3:02:13.640 --> 3:02:17.320]  and it goes on there's a longer video i want the full video tomorrow it's like three minutes long
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:23.720]  and it's it's like schumer coming up and dancing provocative like the two men or women together a
[3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:30.440]  man and a woman and it's it's just and it's it's all just this worship of their power over america
[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:35.320]  while they run it in the ground it's totally a completely satanic imagery can we show the
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:41.400]  dancy polosi thing dancy polosi out there with hundreds and hundreds of people not wearing mask
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:47.160]  oh but the servants are all wearing masks which again we have to hold over i guess we'll do it
[3:02:47.160 --> 3:02:53.880]  later uh the the the the the the servants they all have to wear the mask because this is the sign of
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:03:01.080]  the social control that the underclass has to wear the mask but nobody else has to wear the mask
[3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:10.200]  and again it's all bs ladies and gentlemen they don't follow the same rules that they have for us
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:14.440]  oh and i love how the old liberal establishment hides behind you know how they're defending
[3:03:14.440 --> 3:03:21.000]  minorities but the most white areas in new york and london and everywhere are the liberal areas
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:26.600]  because they're not liberals these are the blue blood grandchildren of people that have stolen
[3:03:26.600 --> 3:03:32.200]  everything that of all the media and all the stolen money at their fingertips the white shoeboys
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:38.920]  dominating controlling society with the demonic crone polosi up there at the head of it yeah this
[3:03:38.920 --> 3:03:42.840]  is the video tomorrow we'll show this and there's one part where they get up to each other like
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:49.000]  in a snake dance and again this is a celebration of their dominance over all of us what a bunch of

[3:23:02.120 --> 3:23:09.080]  that story up we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal
[3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:13.480]  that they are endowed by they're created with certain inalienable rights
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:19.880]  that among these are a life liberty in the pursuit of happiness that to secure these
[3:23:19.880 --> 3:23:27.400]  rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just power from the consent
[3:23:27.960 --> 3:23:39.400]  of the govern got it the consent of the govern not your little piece of scum political crap

[3:24:06.840 --> 3:24:15.320]  a senator never worked a day in his life like his little boys that's right
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:25.240]  that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends
[3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:32.760]  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it that time has come
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:43.720]  that time has come to abolish this where are our rights i gotta listen to drug dealers telling
[3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:51.320]  me what to do drug dealers again not big pharma hey how about those opiates huh
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:56.840]  you know let's go through the whole long list look at those stupid ads on tv

[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:19.560]  abolished and to institute a new government laying its foundation on such principles
[3:25:19.560 --> 3:25:27.000]  and organizing its power in such forms as to them shall seem most likely to affect
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that government's long established
[3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:39.640]  should not be changed for light and transparent causes and accordingly all experience had sown
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:48.280]  that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to write themselves
[3:25:48.280 --> 3:25:54.680]  themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of
[3:25:54.680 --> 3:26:03.640]  abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evidence evidences are designed to
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:13.080]  reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty meaning we the people
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:24.040]  to throw off such government okay declaration of independence i didn't write this we have lost

[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:02.120]  borscht belt back in the old days is where the comedians used to go all the big acts up in gross
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:08.360]  injures and brown the most people are too young to remember that stuff like Jerry Lewis and all
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:15.880]  these people but this is the area so the borscht belt it was about beats you can't beat that
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:24.680]  as I said this is bigger than America what's going down it's global look what's going on
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:35.640]  on in Australia you saw the protests over the weekend this is how it was reported
[3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:43.960]  Australia now where an anti lockdown protest in Melbourne has turned violent police arrested
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:49.320]  demonstrators and used pepper spray as hundreds of people took to the streets protesters say the
[3:37:49.320 --> 3:37:55.080]  lockdown is authoritarian and a way to deflect criticism of a vaccination program that has
[3:37:55.080 --> 3:38:04.760]  fallen far behind those of other countries anger boils over in Melbourne these protesters want
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:11.320]  their freedoms back the city is in its sixth lockdown now the restrictions have been extended
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:20.680]  to the entire state frustration is also mounting in Sydney despite being more or less shut down
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:26.120]  for eight weeks the majority of Australia's coronavirus cases are being recorded there
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:36.040]  the health minister issued a stern warning there is no time now to be selfish it's time to think
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:41.640]  of the broader community and your families if you are actually spreading the virus you could be
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:51.720]  responsible for people's deaths all right look at that listen to that look at that little clown
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:39:00.440]  look at that sloppy little health minister look at this guy hazard that's his name
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:10.360]  look at this this clown shooting off his blubbery fat mouth spewing out the crap
[3:39:12.600 --> 3:39:22.600]  it's time to think on the broader community and your families if you are spreading the virus
[3:39:22.600 --> 3:39:30.280]  you can become responsible for people's deaths
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:41.560]  hey fat boy a fat sloppy chin boy hey you little moronic creep if everybody got vaccinated
[3:39:41.560 --> 3:39:50.520]  and they're wearing masks like you you're safe so for those people that choose not to get vaccinated
[3:39:50.520 --> 3:39:57.800]  that choose not to get wear masks they're responsible for their own lives so you're not
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:05.160]  killing anybody but that's an important line because as I said this keeps going it's going
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:17.560]  to be world war three think about it if you are spreading the virus you can be responsible
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:23.000]  for people's deaths therefore
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:33.080]  you must get on the train to Voxchwitz you are endangering other people's lives
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:43.720]  oh and the cowards will get on and they'll fight for a window seat on the train to Voxchwitz by

[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:23.800]  that here's the numbers 984 dead in australia 74 deaths this year at a 25 million people
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:30.360]  and the average age is 81 years old and look at these tough pieces of scum crap cops

[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:51.720]  the virus outside without wearing a mask are less than 1% according to the data but we'll forget

[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:10.840]  that has come together over the years it is truly an answer to prayer and i am so blessed and
[3:43:10.840 --> 3:43:15.080]  thankful for all of you the listeners of this show i want you to know that i love you and i
[3:43:15.080 --> 3:43:19.800]  appreciate you whether you are old whether you are spanish white black it doesn't matter you got
[3:43:19.800 --> 3:43:25.640]  red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children we are brothers
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:30.280]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:36.280]  years and as crazy your things are i want to keep working into the future but again that's really
[3:43:36.280 --> 3:43:41.960]  up to you and up to god so please i hope god works through you and and puts a message in your
[3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:46.040]  heart to support us but again that's up to you and your relationship with god i just want to thank
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:50.920]  you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:55.400]  pray to god and ask what god's vision is for you and hopefully god will touch your heart to
[3:43:55.400 --> 3:44:02.200]  continue to support him for worse god bless the world is awakening the world is beginning to
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:07.880]  understand the globalist paradigm they are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation
[3:44:07.880 --> 3:44:13.960]  the cfr the trilateral commission the bill de berg group the bohemian grove the club of rome
[3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:21.080]  and so even though it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out
[3:44:21.080 --> 3:44:27.480]  the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:33.800]  open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is
[3:44:33.800 --> 3:44:39.720]  winning you've got to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice that is
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:47.160]  invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in god to lead god and
[3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:51.560]  director sold and then take action against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment
[3:44:51.560 --> 3:44:57.240]  from alex jones and my crew to you we will never back down from the globalist and we will never
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:45:04.840]  surrender let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:10.200]  set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of congress and
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:15.640]  former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection
[3:45:15.640 --> 3:45:22.200]  that grows blood clots and and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly on an
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:28.360]  airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five
[3:45:28.360 --> 3:45:34.840]  years ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and then they
[3:45:34.840 --> 3:45:39.320]  tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy and it doesn't really work so you got to

[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:25.240]  here we go and among the fully inoculated israeli scientists have found growing evidence of waning
[3:51:25.240 --> 3:51:32.600]  immunity particularly among older population data published by israel's ministry of health
[3:51:35.560 --> 3:51:48.040]  suggested that the Pfizer shot was just 39 percent of effective against preventing infection
[3:51:48.040 --> 3:51:58.440]  in a country in late june and early july compared with 95 percent from january to early april
[3:51:59.800 --> 3:52:06.120]  all right and yet they're telling us to get vaccinated and now they're going through the
[3:52:06.120 --> 3:52:13.080]  third shot and now today the fda officially approved it oh yeah like all the other officially

[3:52:47.800 --> 3:52:51.960]  and they almost had what they called herd immunity that doesn't exist and we've been writing about
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:53:00.360]  that they're making it up we said back in april that they were going to require yearly shots and
[3:53:00.360 --> 3:53:10.040]  now you're having it they've sucked the joy out of life businesses are going to go down
