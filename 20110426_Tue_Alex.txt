[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.860]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.860 --> 00:35.980]  strap yourselves in my friends it is Tuesday the 26th day of April 2011 we're

[00:39.820 --> 00:43.660]  overdrive as we did for 30 minutes yesterday with Wayne Madsen in studio
[00:43.660 --> 00:49.600]  he's here visiting with us yesterday and today they'll be joining us again on a
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.100]  host of issues coming up co-hosting with me in the third hour today documentary
[00:55.100 --> 01:01.860]  filmmaker and author Bill still who has been all over Europe Iceland exposing
[01:01.860 --> 01:07.940]  the banker looting that's going on who back in the mid 1990s released and is
[01:07.940 --> 01:13.420]  now re-release and expanded the money masters how banks create the world's
[01:13.420 --> 01:17.980]  money I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes
[01:17.980 --> 01:21.420]  me to tremble for the safety of my country corporations have been enthroned
[01:21.420 --> 01:26.500]  and an era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will
[01:26.500 --> 01:30.660]  endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people
[01:30.660 --> 01:35.620]  until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed Abraham
[01:35.620 --> 01:40.940]  Lincoln so the maker of the money masters last year he put out the secret
[01:40.940 --> 01:45.380]  of Oz that deals with the problems and the solutions all available by the way
[01:45.380 --> 01:49.820]  at info wars.com if you want to support the makers of the film and also this
[01:49.820 --> 01:54.340]  operation and then he's got a new book out no more national debt bill still
[01:54.340 --> 02:01.860]  calls it the world's first interactive book and it's got URLs and also scan bar
[02:01.860 --> 02:05.500]  codes where you can scan it and it pops up on your computer the documents and
[02:05.500 --> 02:09.860]  videos that back up the entire book and like my film in-game blueprint for
[02:09.860 --> 02:14.300]  global enslavement has a full online bibliography with documents video links
[02:14.300 --> 02:19.140]  and news articles for every minute of the film everything we source is at what
[02:19.140 --> 02:23.180]  is the in-game.com so the new book now available just released today we have it
[02:23.180 --> 02:27.580]  in stock discounted out of the gauge no more national debt bill still world's
[02:27.580 --> 02:35.660]  first interactive book of this type and the Holsburg review Florida wrote
[02:35.660 --> 02:40.780]  excellent I like the fact you write like a normal person and not as though you're
[02:40.780 --> 02:44.140]  trying to impress anyone with your knowledge this is very easy to understand
[02:44.140 --> 02:49.060]  and so we're going to be going over this book today because knowing the
[02:49.060 --> 02:53.380]  globalist in their activities is one thing but understanding solutions to it
[02:53.380 --> 02:59.380]  is another so we'll be debating different solutions to basically put out
[02:59.380 --> 03:03.060]  for the general public who is now awakening to the private fellow
[03:03.060 --> 03:09.580]  reserve banking cartel the author of our financial and of course political
[03:09.580 --> 03:15.460]  enslavement and it's a legitimate it's oppressive it's authoritative it's
[03:15.460 --> 03:19.700]  authoritarian it's a legitimate and if we simply stand up and point that out
[03:19.700 --> 03:23.820]  politically there's no way no matter how slick their propaganda and brainwashing
[03:23.820 --> 03:27.580]  that they're going to succeed when people understand that their gas prices
[03:27.580 --> 03:32.340]  are going up predominantly because the Federal Reserve monetizing the debt and
[03:32.340 --> 03:38.060]  that's now becoming mainstream news when people understand that presidents and
[03:38.060 --> 03:42.700]  and and members of the House and Senate come and go federal judges come and go
[03:42.700 --> 03:48.700]  but that 1913 push that junta that that that that that banking cartel that sits
[03:48.700 --> 03:53.900]  above our nation it stays and it is the author of this debt black holes we're
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.500]  going to be breaking all of that down today with bill still coming up in T-
[03:58.500 --> 04:07.820]  minus T-minus 56 minutes from now I'm just going to start my engines for and
[04:07.820 --> 04:11.940]  we come back in the official start of the full transmission on the other side
[04:11.940 --> 04:17.180]  of this quick break and attempt to get into all this news it is particularly
[04:17.180 --> 04:22.300]  wild and particularly revealing and we're going to be going over all of it
[04:22.300 --> 04:28.460]  a to z on the other side we have a lot of other very informative gas that are
[04:28.460 --> 04:34.060]  going to be joining us this week Webster Griffin Tarpley is also coming down here
[04:34.060 --> 04:38.460]  to be interviewed for a film I'm working on you know I've been working on films
[04:38.460 --> 04:40.900]  for two years now and they really haven't released one I mean I release
[04:40.900 --> 04:45.260]  Burmese's film that I produced and I worked some on police state for but that
[04:45.260 --> 04:49.380]  was you know a lot of them most the directing and work on that and and what
[04:49.380 --> 04:56.060]  came out was due to do and Douglas who did a great job but I really had three
[04:56.060 --> 04:58.740]  or four different films I've been working on but I am ramming through one
[04:58.740 --> 05:03.140]  right now this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[05:03.140 --> 05:07.580]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.580 --> 05:11.740]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.740 --> 05:15.780]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.780 --> 05:19.660]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.660 --> 05:23.940]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:23.940 --> 05:28.100]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.100 --> 05:32.420]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.420 --> 05:35.620]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[05:35.620 --> 05:39.980]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[05:39.980 --> 05:43.300]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[05:43.300 --> 05:47.340]  solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[05:47.340 --> 05:52.940]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government

[07:18.300 --> 07:22.700]  years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse
[07:22.700 --> 07:26.460]  of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general
[07:26.460 --> 07:31.460]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he

[07:34.940 --> 07:38.940]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress

[08:00.700 --> 08:08.220]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:13.820 --> 08:21.500]  it is Tuesday the 26th day of April 2011 and reading the newspapers
[08:21.500 --> 08:26.620]  listening to talk radio watching the news this morning the news channels
[08:26.620 --> 08:33.500]  it is as if the mainstream media is basically more and more
[08:33.500 --> 08:37.020]  acting and behaving like the Alex Jones radio show
[08:37.020 --> 08:42.940]  and info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and by that I mean only to a certain
[08:42.940 --> 08:47.340]  point they are admitting that the government has a
[08:47.340 --> 08:52.140]  nine percent approval rating it it was 11 new numbers came out yesterday the
[08:52.140 --> 08:55.660]  congress now has a nine percent approval rating
[08:55.660 --> 08:59.500]  no one believes anything the government says the government could say
[08:59.500 --> 09:02.700]  that the sky was blue and no one would believe it
[09:02.700 --> 09:07.580]  the system is in a crisis and it's
[09:07.580 --> 09:13.660]  suddenly being admitted that our economy is being imploded and that the
[09:13.660 --> 09:18.860]  federal reserve is private and that yes the government is spying on you
[09:18.860 --> 09:22.700]  without warrants and the government and the major
[09:22.700 --> 09:29.340]  corporation's response is to lie. Steve Jobs is in the news the head of
[09:29.340 --> 09:33.660]  apple saying it's preposterous that they don't spy on anybody
[09:33.660 --> 09:37.420]  and that they're not tracking your location or where you go or what you do
[09:37.420 --> 09:40.860]  now it's in the telecommunications act of 96
[09:40.860 --> 09:45.260]  that by october 1st 2001 all phones in the united states
[09:45.260 --> 09:50.700]  that are cell phones are triangulated via cell towers and are tracked and that
[09:50.700 --> 09:55.420]  there is a data trail on your phones that gives them a history of your location
[09:55.420 --> 09:58.780]  almost all cars made in the last decade also
[09:58.780 --> 10:01.740]  have a smart box that tracks how fast you were going
[10:01.740 --> 10:05.900]  what you were doing for a long period of time so that when you have a wreck they
[10:05.900 --> 10:08.860]  have a record of it everything is having these
[10:08.860 --> 10:12.380]  piggyback systems put in but here's Steve Jobs
[10:12.380 --> 10:20.140]  apple doesn't track anyone and that's out of yahoo news
[10:20.140 --> 10:27.500]  now the issue here is the system is losing all credibility
[10:27.500 --> 10:31.260]  across the political spectrum and that's why they're moving to try to
[10:31.260 --> 10:35.340]  censor and discredit and shut down the alternative media
[10:35.340 --> 10:39.660]  that's why they're moving to go ahead and devalue the dollar now
[10:39.660 --> 10:45.420]  so to impoverish us to such a great level that politically
[10:45.420 --> 10:50.060]  all we can do is basically focus on trying to feed ourselves
[10:50.060 --> 10:54.860]  hand to mouth the system is using
[10:54.860 --> 11:00.620]  debt bondage as a tool of control but let me just go over a smattering of the
[11:00.620 --> 11:04.860]  news that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[11:04.860 --> 11:09.580]  there's a new amazing us a today poll and remember this is being done of
[11:09.580 --> 11:12.860]  pretty much a mainline dumbed down people they
[11:12.860 --> 11:16.220]  they do these mainline polls from pools of people
[11:16.220 --> 11:20.460]  democrats republicans people they polled before people who they know how
[11:20.460 --> 11:23.420]  they're going to respond the number is actually much higher
[11:23.420 --> 11:28.380]  now notice that for three years a year before he even got an office
[11:28.380 --> 11:34.540]  when we had webster tarply uh and uh
[11:34.540 --> 11:40.540]  philberg and wane madson who were on questioning obama's birth certificate
[11:40.540 --> 11:44.700]  even before Jerome course he was and i'm not pooping his
[11:44.700 --> 11:47.660]  book that's number one on the bestseller list right now
[11:47.660 --> 11:51.100]  or has been number one off and on the point is basically from what i hear is
[11:51.100 --> 11:54.140]  going to be in it that's the same thing these guys research years ago
[11:54.140 --> 11:57.820]  just course he has now gone around and proven and that this is new
[11:57.820 --> 12:02.540]  that they've covered up in indonesia in the us
[12:02.540 --> 12:05.740]  uh in kenya his his records they've been destroyed
[12:05.740 --> 12:10.460]  so so where their smokers fire evidence of the obstruction of the evidence
[12:10.460 --> 12:16.700]  evidence of the absconding a clear who benefits who gains from destroying the
[12:16.700 --> 12:21.340]  evidence key bono they're acting very suspiciously
[12:21.340 --> 12:25.340]  so i have a cop pulls you over for speeding and he's looking around the car
[12:25.340 --> 12:27.820]  and they're like nothing's going on don't look back there
[12:27.820 --> 12:31.500]  you know the cop starts to look and and and it becomes probable cause because
[12:31.500 --> 12:35.340]  of the erratic way they're behaving this is classic
[12:35.340 --> 12:39.900]  criminology they are scared but the big issue here is for three years they've
[12:39.900 --> 12:43.020]  said you're a kook you're a lunatic you're a nut
[12:43.020 --> 12:46.700]  no one believes that he wasn't born in hawaii
[12:46.700 --> 12:51.020]  no one takes this seriously this is fringe kooks
[12:51.020 --> 12:54.540]  less than one percent as carl rove even said
[12:54.540 --> 12:58.780]  a few months ago on fox news trying to defend the republican and democrat
[12:58.780 --> 13:04.060]  establishment uh don't go there glenn bexing don't go there don't go there
[13:04.060 --> 13:07.740]  because the truth is the establishment knows his providence is in question
[13:07.740 --> 13:11.580]  they know he gave up a citizenship in indonesia that disqualifies him from
[13:11.580 --> 13:14.140]  being natural born uh once you've given up your
[13:14.140 --> 13:19.820]  citizenship to indonesia you can't come back here and never run for president
[13:19.820 --> 13:26.060]  they know and so they tried this this wall of ridicule this wall of laughing
[13:26.060 --> 13:29.020]  chockpole usa today drudge reports got it up
[13:29.020 --> 13:36.460]  only 38 say obama definitely born in us so you've got 62 percent
[13:36.460 --> 13:39.660]  and that's in a establishment poll let me tell you something i talked to
[13:39.660 --> 13:43.420]  democrats i talked to republicans i monitor the news
[13:43.420 --> 13:47.580]  everyone i know libertarians liberals conservatives
[13:47.580 --> 13:52.860]  anarchists no one believes obama was born in this country that i talked to
[13:52.860 --> 13:57.260]  it's probably just like you got nine percent approval writing for congress
[13:57.260 --> 14:02.700]  it's it's more like probably nine percent of i had to dead reckon
[14:02.700 --> 14:06.540]  believe this because he said he wouldn't hire lobbyist hired more lobbyist than
[14:06.540 --> 14:09.020]  anybody in history he said he'd stop the torture
[14:09.020 --> 14:12.940]  intensified it he'd stop the secret arrest intensified it he'd end the wars
[14:12.940 --> 14:17.580]  expanded them uh he wouldn't hire any uh wall street people
[14:17.580 --> 14:22.060]  he wouldn't take wall street money uh he wouldn't have signing statements
[14:22.060 --> 14:25.820]  he wouldn't have secret meetings he would open up the foyer request he's made
[14:25.820 --> 14:33.180]  a more secret than anybody uh i have never seen anything like it
[14:33.180 --> 14:36.620]  because the globalists are in high gear he's their puppet he's their front man
[14:36.620 --> 14:40.860]  he got four times the money that john mccain got not that mccain was good
[14:40.860 --> 14:44.780]  they saw the smart better-looking more intelligent
[14:44.780 --> 14:48.620]  on average obama than burnout mccain crazy mccain
[14:48.620 --> 14:52.220]  would be able to sell their agenda and put the left
[14:52.220 --> 14:56.540]  to sleep the left you know would stop complaining about torture secret
[14:56.540 --> 15:00.540]  arrest police state the patriot act
[15:00.540 --> 15:03.820]  the left was out buying guns under bush because they finally learned how to
[15:03.820 --> 15:06.700]  fear the government they finally got some common sense
[15:06.700 --> 15:10.620]  it was sleepy time for the first year well sleepy time's over
[15:10.620 --> 15:14.700]  we're two years into this now three years into the exposes
[15:14.700 --> 15:22.460]  of baraku saint obama and 38 percent say that he was definitely
[15:22.460 --> 15:30.300]  born in the usa 62 percent we're talking only a point
[15:30.300 --> 15:37.260]  away 1.3 points away we're talking only when when it hits 63
[15:37.260 --> 15:43.900]  percent and change two-thirds will not believe he was born in this country
[15:43.900 --> 15:48.620]  because they don't believe anything i mean if obama came out and said that he
[15:48.620 --> 15:52.620]  had white teeth no one would believe it if polosi came
[15:52.620 --> 15:56.140]  out and said she had brown hair no one would believe it
[15:56.140 --> 16:00.140]  if they came out and said the grass is green and tulips are red
[16:00.140 --> 16:05.100]  and and dandy lions are yellow and and daffodils are yellow and blue
[16:05.100 --> 16:09.180]  bonnets are blue we don't believe a stinking word that comes out of your
[16:09.180 --> 16:11.740]  mouth let me tell you something three and a
[16:11.740 --> 16:15.980]  half years ago when the liberty movement 9 11 groups
[16:15.980 --> 16:19.660]  actually five years ago started having tea parties throwing the 9 11 commission
[16:19.660 --> 16:24.540]  report in the water started in boston then liberty movements in austin
[16:24.540 --> 16:27.820]  had marches to get ron paul to run and then when he announced
[16:27.820 --> 16:32.540]  the first major ron paul tea party was in austin it's on record
[16:32.540 --> 16:36.780]  some media is accurate and calls him the grandfather of the tea party
[16:36.780 --> 16:40.060]  they put a meme out on fox and limbaugh does saying
[16:40.060 --> 16:43.740]  the tea party was founded two years ago it just had its birthday two weeks ago
[16:43.740 --> 16:47.660]  it was founded by shon hannity yes yes no
[16:47.660 --> 16:51.260]  no three years ago they were demonizing the tea party
[16:51.260 --> 16:55.100]  and putting out press releases saying conservatives don't hang out with these
[16:55.100 --> 16:57.740]  ron paul libertarians they're dangerous they're
[16:57.740 --> 17:01.500]  anti-military because they want to cut defense spending and and and cut foreign
[17:01.500 --> 17:06.220]  aid the republicans attacked the tea party until
[17:06.220 --> 17:10.380]  two years ago when they couldn't beat them they joined them rick perry was
[17:10.380 --> 17:15.180]  booed at four consecutive speeches i played the youtube videos here
[17:15.180 --> 17:17.820]  senator cornyn was booed it all started in texas
[17:17.820 --> 17:22.140]  then republicans were booed in other states and they panicked
[17:22.140 --> 17:27.020]  because it wasn't just republicans and libertarians going to democratic town
[17:27.020 --> 17:31.260]  halls and shouting them down republicans were and so suddenly rick perry said i
[17:31.260 --> 17:34.460]  kill coyotes outside my house in the middle of austin
[17:34.460 --> 17:40.460]  i i i carry a gun i wear a cowboy hat i want to secede i don't like the new
[17:40.460 --> 17:43.180]  world order this the guy hangs out at billder
[17:43.180 --> 17:46.300]  burg group and would demonize patriots a year before that
[17:46.300 --> 17:50.220]  and that some of the tea parties went what and they had the tea party express
[17:50.220 --> 17:55.020]  come through run by dick army and big fox news ads and the talk show host get
[17:55.020 --> 17:57.740]  out there and boy have you showed up with a ron paul
[17:57.740 --> 18:01.420]  shirt these old ladies we got video would hit you with their signs get get
[18:01.420 --> 18:07.100]  coming get get we founded it get get get on out of here get
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.340]  there ain't no dollar problem there ain't no new world order you get your
[18:11.340 --> 18:16.380]  but you get your hiding it out of here right now boy
[18:16.380 --> 18:20.620]  we like the patriot act we like torture we like the fellow reserve we like to
[18:20.620 --> 18:23.900]  see fr but then that didn't work so suddenly back
[18:23.900 --> 18:25.980]  and all of us are going there is a new world order
[18:25.980 --> 18:29.980]  george soros world government's run by some mid-level nobody van jones
[18:29.980 --> 18:35.580]  oh my gosh they're going to get us the federal reserve is evil
[18:35.580 --> 18:38.940]  see they have to get more hardcore to keep any credibility
[18:38.940 --> 18:45.260]  ladies and gentlemen when nsnbc airs and i was seeing these numbers uh at uh
[18:45.260 --> 18:49.020]  the buy the numbers nielson ratings site in fact i meant to cover this guys will
[18:49.020 --> 18:52.060]  you pull me uh the nielson ratings on an average
[18:52.060 --> 18:56.300]  week for msnbc i want to well the point is i
[18:56.300 --> 18:58.700]  i heard a talk show was talking about i went and looked it up over the weekend
[18:58.700 --> 19:02.460]  and and and there indeed it was there i mean i knew their average show had about
[19:02.460 --> 19:07.580]  150 000 viewers on msnbc uh their top shows every once in a while the big
[19:07.580 --> 19:12.060]  guest maybe a million prime time but generally about 500 000
[19:12.060 --> 19:15.340]  i mean a big talk show in a major city of six seven million people
[19:15.340 --> 19:18.940]  will have that during drive time okay you can look at the arbitrar numbers on
[19:18.940 --> 19:22.140]  that show so they are legends in their own mind
[19:22.140 --> 19:26.380]  and but i didn't know that when they air a vacuum cleaner or a chuck norris
[19:26.380 --> 19:30.220]  uh home gym ad they get more viewers
[19:30.220 --> 19:34.620]  in prime time and they get with with rachel mr madow
[19:34.620 --> 19:41.500]  and the rest of them so the point is they're paper tigers they're they're
[19:41.500 --> 19:46.460]  husk no one believes them no one buys into them so of course fox has an average
[19:46.460 --> 19:50.060]  of two million viewers talking a little bit about the new world order
[19:50.060 --> 19:53.820]  i mean they went all the way they have 20 million viewers
[19:53.820 --> 19:56.540]  i mean this show has over three million a day now folks
[19:56.540 --> 20:00.300]  but see we're not legends in our own mind we don't put on the hairs

[20:39.980 --> 20:43.020]  or was jeffison correct when stating a central bank issuing the public

[22:10.540 --> 22:14.540]  bonds to foreign central banks with japan about to become
[22:14.540 --> 22:18.140]  a seller of us bonds in order to rebuild its own nation
[22:18.140 --> 22:22.220]  and the us antagonizing china by calling them currency manipulators
[22:22.220 --> 22:26.220]  the federal reserve which is already buying about 70 percent of us treasuries
[22:26.220 --> 22:30.220]  will soon be the only buyer left of us treasuries our friends at the national
[22:30.220 --> 22:34.220]  inflation association believe that the us dollar will soon become worthless

[23:55.660 --> 24:05.660]  1-800-5600-31
[24:05.660 --> 24:12.460]  i was a highway man along the coach roads i did ride
[24:12.460 --> 24:17.580]  with sword and pistol by my side
[24:17.580 --> 24:21.580]  many a young maid lost her bubbles to my tray
[24:21.580 --> 24:25.420]  this always happens many a soldier shed his life
[24:25.420 --> 24:28.860]  i get into the show i look at one news article
[24:28.860 --> 24:33.340]  and i run off in a 30 minute 40 minute hour long rant i i can't do that today
[24:33.340 --> 24:36.380]  i've got to cover all this news it's too important
[24:36.380 --> 24:42.860]  but the power of the establishment is dissipating it's draining out like a
[24:42.860 --> 24:46.860]  fat hog that you haul up by its legs when you slaughter it you slit its throat
[24:46.860 --> 24:51.580]  they're bleeding out and the last drops of credibility are
[24:51.580 --> 24:56.220]  dripping from their neck right now they are dead on arrival
[24:56.220 --> 25:00.620]  they know it so they're moving with authoritarian control
[25:00.620 --> 25:07.180]  but that hoax is in the process of collapsing as well because we the people
[25:07.180 --> 25:11.260]  in every town and city across this country
[25:11.260 --> 25:15.740]  are gaining ground gaining confidence gaining momentum
[25:15.740 --> 25:19.660]  but when you pull up the numbers that an anti-gun anti-family
[25:19.660 --> 25:25.420]  george soros general electric crime syndicate
[25:25.420 --> 25:32.540]  supporting outfit like msnbc can't even get a couple hundred
[25:32.540 --> 25:35.980]  thousand viewers and ads for vacuum cleaners
[25:35.980 --> 25:39.340]  that they air get more viewers people would rather watch an
[25:39.340 --> 25:45.260]  infomercial for a smoothie machine or for a food
[25:45.260 --> 25:50.300]  dehydrator or for a chuck norris weightlifting set than they would these
[25:50.300 --> 25:53.740]  people they are jokes yes they've got slick sets
[25:53.740 --> 25:57.580]  yes they're in ten million dollar studios yes psych warfare people are
[25:57.580 --> 26:01.100]  loading their teleprompters for them but no one wants to watch it
[26:01.100 --> 26:03.900]  and fox is beginning to lose its viewers as well
[26:03.900 --> 26:08.780]  oh it still has more viewers than all of their cable news combined but
[26:08.780 --> 26:14.060]  only because they'll at least pose as patriots
[26:14.060 --> 26:18.380]  well how long can they stand up against a show like this one
[26:18.380 --> 26:21.900]  how long can sean hannity compete against the internet
[26:21.900 --> 26:27.020]  where people don't have to mince words well the answer is the system
[26:27.020 --> 26:31.260]  is a cornered rat and it's very very dangerous right now
[26:31.260 --> 26:35.580]  and so just because we've got them down does not mean they don't have a lot of
[26:35.580 --> 26:40.620]  aces up their sleeves a lot of tricks uh that they're ready to pull on us
[26:40.620 --> 26:44.300]  so they are cornered rats they are dangerous right now but but think about
[26:44.300 --> 26:47.500]  the credibility issue i want to get all of my writers in the
[26:47.500 --> 26:50.780]  next few weeks to write articles from their perspectives
[26:50.780 --> 26:54.540]  chronicling and pulling up the old articles that we wrote
[26:54.540 --> 26:59.020]  over the last 16 years where we broke down exactly what glass
[26:59.020 --> 27:02.700]  steigl would do in articles for info wars dot com 11 years ago
[27:02.700 --> 27:06.540]  we broke down how they would sell derivatives how they would destroy the
[27:06.540 --> 27:09.420]  economy how they would then cut all the other social
[27:09.420 --> 27:13.820]  services as the fix when it won't fix anything if you don't get rid of the
[27:13.820 --> 27:17.980]  private fellow deserve so you got a cut on your hand
[27:17.980 --> 27:21.900]  yeah you need to put a band-aid on it is a problem but your other arm is cut off
[27:21.900 --> 27:25.820]  with blood spraying out of it do you handle the cut on your hand or the
[27:25.820 --> 27:28.540]  arm that's cut off
[27:29.500 --> 27:34.060]  you know which issue you need to deal with first
[27:34.060 --> 27:38.460]  and so i start thinking about how we broke down
[27:38.460 --> 27:44.860]  basically everything we have such a high
[27:45.740 --> 27:52.700]  and rising credibility that the system is floundering and the more they come
[27:52.700 --> 27:56.460]  out and tell you that he was born in hawaii
[27:56.460 --> 27:59.740]  the more they tell you they've shown you his birth certificate which they have
[27:59.740 --> 28:05.260]  it they've shown a printout that's a receipt
[28:05.260 --> 28:10.140]  of birth certificate the more they push this the more investigators go to
[28:10.140 --> 28:13.260]  indonesia and the more they go to kenya
[28:13.260 --> 28:17.340]  and the more they go to hawaii and the governor remember when he was governor
[28:17.340 --> 28:21.260]  elect governor abercrombie going back four five
[28:21.260 --> 28:23.980]  months ago he said as soon as i get in office in the
[28:23.980 --> 28:26.460]  next few weeks i'm going to go get the birth certificate and release it
[28:26.460 --> 28:30.220]  and he went and looked for it and told the honolulu advertiser he said there
[28:30.220 --> 28:33.980]  isn't one i can't find it
[28:33.980 --> 28:40.060]  ladies and gentlemen i sent off to the bureau of vital statistics
[28:40.060 --> 28:44.940]  14 years ago for my birth certificate
[28:44.940 --> 28:47.980]  you know why you've all seen the video of me being arrested
[28:47.980 --> 28:52.860]  for refusing to thumb scan and i brought seven forms of id my old license
[28:52.860 --> 28:58.140]  my insurance my birth certificate a health club card i mean i brought it all
[28:58.140 --> 29:01.660]  just to illustrate that they wanted my biometric scan they arrested me
[29:01.660 --> 29:04.700]  and then i put my birth certificate in my jacket
[29:04.700 --> 29:08.700]  and then i ended up putting it in my back pocket and then i washed my laundry
[29:08.700 --> 29:12.300]  and washed it and so i later needed my original birth
[29:12.300 --> 29:16.780]  certificate uh when i was getting a passport
[29:16.780 --> 29:20.300]  and i sent off to the bureau of vital statistics
[29:20.300 --> 29:26.140]  and i got one in the mail a photocopy of the whole blueprint with my
[29:26.140 --> 29:30.380]  my hallmarks my feet marks on it my little my little ink feet in fact ought
[29:30.380 --> 29:33.260]  to dig that out i've got it at home and bring it in
[29:33.260 --> 29:38.380]  they will not release it okay now as people dig deeper
[29:38.380 --> 29:41.900]  they learn about the cia connections they learn about the indonesian

[35:40.460 --> 35:43.340]  half ago he was gotten on the plane by a sharp
[35:43.340 --> 35:47.020]  dressed man without a passport or anything and when the state department
[35:47.020 --> 35:50.460]  got pressured about it they admitted an unnamed us intelligence
[35:50.460 --> 35:54.060]  agency told us to get him on the plane
[35:54.060 --> 35:57.580]  that's a pretty good trick there in amsterdam got to bypass the naked body
[35:57.580 --> 36:02.140]  scanners that were already in got to get on the plane
[36:02.140 --> 36:05.420]  and then his little firecracker went off so all of us get to have the government
[36:05.420 --> 36:10.140]  stick their hands down our pants oh and and insider groups get millions of
[36:10.140 --> 36:13.580]  dollars of taxpayer money
[36:14.540 --> 36:20.380]  al qaeda assassin accused of bombing christian churches and
[36:20.380 --> 36:23.900]  a luxury hotel in pakistan was working for british
[36:23.900 --> 36:27.900]  intelligence at the same time according to leaked files
[36:27.900 --> 36:31.340]  and it goes on to report that the government the british government's
[36:31.340 --> 36:36.220]  not denying these leak files are real uh the files were handed to the guardian
[36:36.220 --> 36:40.140]  of the telegraph also indicate that 35 terrorists
[36:40.140 --> 36:43.740]  held at guantanamo bay may have been released by extremist
[36:43.740 --> 36:47.660]  preachers and radicalized by extremist preachers in the uk well
[36:47.660 --> 36:50.780]  yeah they're british intelligence on record
[36:50.780 --> 36:54.300]  just like every other major event now this guy's got a long name but the
[36:54.300 --> 37:02.700]  claim about adil haid al jazari ben hamilini is made in secret
[37:02.700 --> 37:06.540]  reports on detainees at the u.s. military guantanamo bay
[37:06.540 --> 37:10.140]  prison camp obtained by the whistleblowing website
[37:10.140 --> 37:14.860]  wiki leaks the Algerian who was captured in pakistan in
[37:14.860 --> 37:18.460]  03 was described by interrogators as a facilitator
[37:18.460 --> 37:21.500]  courier kidnapper and assassin for al qaeda
[37:21.500 --> 37:25.180]  and he just so happened to be government intelligence now
[37:25.180 --> 37:29.180]  if you want me to describe this in a way of your new listener
[37:29.180 --> 37:33.020]  i will use a pop cultured example how many of you have seen
[37:33.020 --> 37:39.980]  revenge of the sith episode three of the cheesy prequels
[37:39.980 --> 37:43.340]  and quite frankly four five and six are cheesy too but
[37:43.340 --> 37:46.540]  when your little kid watching them it kind of imprints on your brain
[37:46.540 --> 37:51.260]  isn't seen as cheesy but the point is it's arch typo
[37:51.260 --> 37:55.100]  how did a little known senator from the backwater planet
[37:55.100 --> 37:59.100]  become the supreme dictator of the galactic empire of the galactic republic
[37:59.100 --> 38:02.940]  that he turned into an empire well first he hired
[38:02.940 --> 38:07.020]  a group to do a blockade of his planet then he could complain that the senate
[38:07.020 --> 38:12.140]  didn't do enough and project himself into a key position in the senate
[38:12.140 --> 38:16.140]  uh then when terrorist attack the home world
[38:16.140 --> 38:21.980]  he becomes chancellor by demanding that more be done
[38:21.980 --> 38:26.300]  and being a hawk and by episode three you learned that he
[38:26.300 --> 38:29.660]  financed the terrorist he financed the trade federation
[38:29.660 --> 38:33.900]  and he double crosses them as well and then he destroys the republic and
[38:33.900 --> 38:36.780]  wipes out the old guardians of the republic now
[38:36.780 --> 38:39.980]  you can simplify that hitler gets into power in
[38:39.980 --> 38:43.900]  early 33 he firebombs the Reichstag declares
[38:43.900 --> 38:48.220]  civil emergency didn't call it martial law then he attacks Poland
[38:48.220 --> 38:51.340]  claiming Poland that attacked them by attacking his own military base world
[38:51.340 --> 38:54.220]  war two starts you know the rest of the story and Glyde which is completely
[38:54.220 --> 38:57.260]  declassified that the german military attacked her own base
[38:57.260 --> 39:02.060]  dressed up some prison inmates as german and polish troops shot him
[39:02.060 --> 39:05.900]  shot newsreel footage of it and said the Poles whose army was on horseback
[39:05.900 --> 39:10.460]  could attack them that's like saying uh Haiti is
[39:10.460 --> 39:15.180]  going to attack the united states you know Haiti just you know blew up
[39:15.180 --> 39:20.620]  uh marine core base in florida i mean no one would believe it
[39:20.620 --> 39:24.940]  but that's what happened though the Poles did put up more of a fight than the
[39:24.940 --> 39:29.260]  french did with their ancient military i mean they had a pre-world war one
[39:29.260 --> 39:33.020]  style military um up against the most modern military in the
[39:33.020 --> 39:36.060]  world had seen at that time very simple how how this happens
[39:36.060 --> 39:40.060]  you know hitler didn't just set up martial law overnight he had to stage
[39:40.060 --> 39:42.380]  terror attacks and do some other things
[39:42.380 --> 39:46.060]  um he used a depression to also get into power
[39:46.060 --> 39:49.740]  and he was given a western financing and he didn't start world war two without
[39:49.740 --> 39:55.260]  a staging a crisis um it's now been partially declassified
[39:55.260 --> 40:00.540]  that the 1898 blowing up of the battleship uh the main
[40:00.540 --> 40:03.980]  in Havana harbor was staged everybody had to be off the boat at the time on a
[40:03.980 --> 40:07.340]  special leave when something blew up in the boiler
[40:07.340 --> 40:10.220]  and then it was blamed on the spanish government
[40:10.220 --> 40:14.780]  remember the main so the united states started its imperial march taking over
[40:14.780 --> 40:18.380]  Cuba and the philippines and uh it just so happened to have their
[40:18.380 --> 40:22.300]  fleets ready to sneak attack spanish fleets at anchor
[40:22.300 --> 40:26.780]  at different ports the the the u.s just so happened to have its fleets all
[40:26.780 --> 40:31.500]  waiting off the coast with attack orders to hit the spanish fleets at anchor
[40:31.500 --> 40:35.020]  at what was left of their empire in the pacific
[40:35.020 --> 40:38.540]  sure believe that i gotta bridge i'll sell you
[40:38.540 --> 40:43.180]  and then of course it's declassified gulf of tonkin was used to get us into
[40:43.180 --> 40:50.300]  vietnam 4 000 plus us advisors 4 300 and change had died from 1960
[40:50.300 --> 40:56.380]  to 1964 before they staged the attack on the destroyers and
[40:56.380 --> 41:00.140]  then launched the war that killed 58 000 americans over a million vietnamese
[41:00.140 --> 41:03.740]  and you were a conspiracy theorist from 64 until
[41:03.740 --> 41:09.820]  2004 uh in the media in the 40 year anniversary they declassified the lbj
[41:09.820 --> 41:13.980]  tapes the cia admitted nsa released the transcripts
[41:13.980 --> 41:18.380]  totally staged premeditatedly nothing attacked the ships
[41:18.380 --> 41:21.580]  and then they had the gulf of tonkin resolution three days later
[41:21.580 --> 41:26.940]  and off to the races so see this doesn't just happen with darth cityus in the
[41:26.940 --> 41:30.780]  imaginary world of star wars a long time ago
[41:30.780 --> 41:37.020]  in a galaxy far far away okay it happens here in the real world
[41:37.020 --> 41:40.620]  am i saying there aren't muslim extremists in saudi arabia and other
[41:40.620 --> 41:44.700]  places that if they see you with a bible they will beat you to death
[41:44.700 --> 41:48.780]  no that goes on are christians persecuted in other areas
[41:48.780 --> 41:52.140]  yes and every area where christians are persecuted
[41:52.140 --> 41:55.900]  is an ally of the globalists the globalists have always hated christians
[41:55.900 --> 41:59.740]  because they want to replace it with their collectivist materialistic eugenics
[41:59.740 --> 42:03.180]  religion they want to tear down any existing order
[42:03.180 --> 42:06.460]  so while they're trying to tear down islam they're also trying to tear down
[42:06.460 --> 42:10.060]  christianity because they want and they're going to use both of them
[42:10.060 --> 42:14.700]  against each other wanted albert pike right and morals and dogma
[42:14.700 --> 42:19.260]  in 1877 and in subsequent letters one of them held in the british naval
[42:19.260 --> 42:22.700]  archives that they would have three world wars
[42:22.700 --> 42:27.500]  one to take down germany and to destroy europe
[42:27.500 --> 42:31.900]  a second one to bring in a league of nations is what he called it and then
[42:31.900 --> 42:34.940]  they later got to un this is before the league of nations was set up
[42:34.940 --> 42:40.300]  30 40 years before and then a final clash between the muslims
[42:40.300 --> 42:43.500]  and the christians and when they're done with us
[42:43.500 --> 42:46.140]  they bring in their collectivist world religion
[42:46.140 --> 42:50.300]  after tens of millions die in this next global clash of civilizations
[42:50.300 --> 42:53.820]  and then you read all the globalist documents the club of rome the un
[42:53.820 --> 42:57.820]  the ceo for the trilateral commission the peenak documents they talk about
[42:57.820 --> 43:02.060]  this clash of civilizations and so they create al-qaeda
[43:02.060 --> 43:05.580]  and have them attack the russians the serbs they have them overthrow
[43:05.580 --> 43:08.460]  arab governments that are secular the globalists don't like
[43:08.460 --> 43:14.300]  destabilization is the name of the game
[43:15.580 --> 43:19.820]  now shifting gears i'm going to skip this network break coming up because
[43:19.820 --> 43:23.260]  this is so important and stations should not
[43:23.260 --> 43:26.940]  air their ads over this uh just a note if folks miss it

[46:12.780 --> 46:16.780]  controls the netherlands whose wealth is secret
[46:16.780 --> 46:21.180]  and may even eclipse the queen the queen is german their name is sax coberg
[46:21.180 --> 46:26.620]  gotha and they are usurpers of england and king
[46:26.620 --> 46:32.540]  george the third was a german and king george the third was our enemy
[46:32.540 --> 46:39.420]  that we declared independence of and i make the point that kim jong il's
[46:39.420 --> 46:43.420]  father put him in power in north korea now he's putting his son in power
[46:43.420 --> 46:46.700]  pretty soon why shouldn't they just wear purple flowing rubs and crowns
[46:46.700 --> 46:49.820]  and then be worshiped by the little old ladies who have the teacups with the
[46:49.820 --> 46:53.980]  queen on them these anglophiles and i mean a lot of old ladies here in texas
[46:53.980 --> 46:56.540]  that i've been in houses they got the queen of england hanging up
[46:56.540 --> 46:59.900]  they think it's cute they're they're taught it's fun they're taught it's
[46:59.900 --> 47:03.580]  neat they're taught that it's a great thing they're taught
[47:03.580 --> 47:08.220]  that they should love it and they make it this big event
[47:08.220 --> 47:11.900]  and and no no one can wait it's so great it's so wonderful
[47:11.900 --> 47:15.420]  everybody's got to watch it then i see the polls out actually the vast majority
[47:15.420 --> 47:18.700]  of americans hate it and don't like it the vast majority of brits hate it and
[47:18.700 --> 47:23.260]  don't like it it's only the weakest minded people
[47:23.260 --> 47:28.300]  do you understand that in england they get billions of pounds a year
[47:28.300 --> 47:32.060]  billions and billions of dollars converted in taxpayer money
[47:32.060 --> 47:35.900]  they get welfare allowances for their scores of palaces apiece
[47:35.900 --> 47:40.620]  for gas allotments last winter when the old people had their gas turned off in
[47:40.620 --> 47:47.260]  the coldest winter uh the second coldest winter since the 1650s
[47:47.260 --> 47:52.220]  these are disgusting people and and i also see canadians in the comments on
[47:52.220 --> 47:56.060]  info wars present planet and on youtube saying how dare you say
[47:56.060 --> 47:59.740]  that the queen suspended parliament it's only a figurehead
[47:59.740 --> 48:04.940]  i have read and had parliamentary experts on this show and it doesn't take
[48:04.940 --> 48:09.580]  that the 20 plus commonwealth australia canada you name it
[48:09.580 --> 48:12.860]  and they do it all the time three times the last three years harper would have
[48:12.860 --> 48:16.060]  been out when the parliament votes to remove
[48:16.060 --> 48:20.940]  him he's got to leave three times he has activated the governor general
[48:20.940 --> 48:25.660]  who speaks for the queen to have the governor general dissolve it
[48:25.660 --> 48:28.940]  that he would have been gone
[48:29.580 --> 48:33.660]  but the elected parliament has been vetoed by the queen of england and you
[48:33.660 --> 48:37.180]  people are in such denial that some canadians are up there calling me a
[48:37.180 --> 48:40.780]  liar but i notice other canadians actually post in the comments the actual
[48:40.780 --> 48:44.060]  law and show what's happening and you can just google

[51:11.100 --> 51:15.260]  said she is absolutely delighted for her grandson and his bride to be
[51:15.260 --> 51:22.380]  the united states was founded on july 4th 1776 in resistance to the hegemonic
[51:22.380 --> 51:27.820]  despotic tyrannical rule of king george the third and the abuse against the
[51:27.820 --> 51:31.580]  colonies and most of the british parliament
[51:31.580 --> 51:35.500]  was against going to war with their fellow englishmen
[51:35.500 --> 51:38.540]  because the king was unpopular there as well
[51:38.540 --> 51:43.500]  it was known that he was a german king his father being brought over to rule
[51:43.500 --> 51:47.980]  england these people could barely speak english nothing against
[51:47.980 --> 51:52.060]  germans but you don't see me going over to germany to rule them
[51:52.060 --> 51:59.660]  the very essence of july 4th and 1776 is resistance to the disgusting house of
[51:59.660 --> 52:03.100]  winsor they didn't get that name until around world war one
[52:03.100 --> 52:06.380]  because before that they were known as the sax cobra gophus
[52:06.380 --> 52:10.460]  notice that we hear their names prince william you never hear his last name do
[52:10.460 --> 52:13.500]  you the slave public many other than england
[52:13.500 --> 52:16.940]  who support these people don't even know their last names because they don't
[52:16.940 --> 52:21.580]  want you knowing their last names three times the last three years
[52:21.580 --> 52:26.060]  the parliament in canada hasn't done what the queen of england wants so she
[52:26.060 --> 52:29.900]  suspended them shut down the parliament happened in the late
[52:29.900 --> 52:35.420]  70s in australia this is a tyrannical group pushing eugenics
[52:35.420 --> 52:40.700]  population reduction all the carbon taxes prince philip the queen's husband
[52:40.700 --> 52:45.260]  another german royal prince is a supporter of eugenics his cousin
[52:45.260 --> 52:49.100]  who was the prince married to the queen of the netherlands
[52:49.100 --> 52:54.380]  unadmitted nazi unadmitted eugenicist the point is these are the most filthy
[52:54.380 --> 52:58.780]  degenerate people you can imagine she owns more than half of canada
[52:58.780 --> 53:02.380]  more than half the land in england and then she's paid
[53:02.380 --> 53:06.540]  by the government for her palaces and all the rest of it it's disgusting and to
[53:06.540 --> 53:11.580]  watch us television fawning fox cnn cbs all of them
[53:11.580 --> 53:15.180]  oh it's so wonderful no one in america wait until next week

[53:22.300 --> 53:26.220]  stuff i mean it's it's hard i mean the energy is just palpable
[53:26.220 --> 53:28.620]  don't couples get married they're just hoping that some bank will be nice
[53:28.620 --> 53:31.740]  enough to give them a mortgage yeah these folks have a number of palaces to
[53:31.740 --> 53:35.740]  pick from nb sues is launching a free royal wedding
[53:35.740 --> 53:40.300]  app for the ipad got it this is truly a love story that captures
[53:40.300 --> 53:43.900]  everybody's attention this goes back to edwin bernay's
[53:43.900 --> 53:48.140]  a hundred years ago saying look to make politicians and royalty popular
[53:48.140 --> 53:51.340]  we'll have hollywood stars come to banquets and events with them
[53:51.340 --> 53:55.420]  we'll have music stars we'll have other people go there to basically make these
[53:55.420 --> 53:59.420]  elites be seen as celebrities themselves
[53:59.420 --> 54:02.620]  you know why america was founded because under the imperial
[54:02.620 --> 54:07.180]  royal system in europe and england if you weren't part of the inside group who
[54:07.180 --> 54:11.740]  had basically the patronage of the crown
[54:11.740 --> 54:15.260]  where they gave you land houses jobs you couldn't even get a license to be a
[54:15.260 --> 54:18.620]  carpenter a license to be a blacksmith a license to brew beer
[54:18.620 --> 54:22.700]  unless their local lords gave you the authorization
[54:22.700 --> 54:26.460]  so it wasn't just that you had to pay outrageous taxes you had to get their
[54:26.460 --> 54:32.780]  permission to even have a job to have a profession
[54:32.780 --> 54:37.260]  ladies and gentlemen that's the essence of globalism is big mega corporations
[54:37.260 --> 54:41.180]  many of which are owned and controlled by the german royal family
[54:41.180 --> 54:44.780]  that runs england and of course other netherlands
[54:44.780 --> 54:48.700]  the whole system they've set up and they promote is about this new global corporate
[54:48.700 --> 54:51.980]  system worldwide that through government power shuts
[54:51.980 --> 54:54.860]  down their competition and transfers the people's
[54:54.860 --> 54:58.460]  wealth through taxes to the offshore cartels
[54:58.460 --> 55:01.580]  these people are parasites they're disgusting
[55:01.580 --> 55:06.060]  they're filthy and if we want to reclaim the spirit of 1776
[55:06.060 --> 55:11.100]  we should realize how abhorrent monarchy is in all of its forms and that
[55:11.100 --> 55:17.020]  includes the un and the new royalty under the unelected eu
[55:17.020 --> 55:21.580]  bureaucratic system where over 80 of england's laws even though they're not
[55:21.580 --> 55:25.420]  part of the eu are made by eu bureaucrats please
[55:25.420 --> 55:29.180]  everyone remember the spirit of 1776 and a lot of folks in england
[55:29.180 --> 55:31.980]  are saying they're going to go out and protest it first the government said
[55:31.980 --> 55:34.300]  you've got the day off slaves you don't have to
[55:34.300 --> 55:37.580]  go to work on the you know big royal wedding coming up next week
[55:37.580 --> 55:41.180]  and then the republicans that's a group that want to get rid of the monarchy
[55:41.180 --> 55:44.540]  in england said we're going to protest in the streets and the government said
[55:44.540 --> 55:48.540]  you're not allowed to protest meanwhile they criticize syria for banning
[55:48.540 --> 55:52.220]  protest so anytime you see some mind-numb zombie
[55:52.220 --> 55:55.180]  talking about how exciting the wedding is or how they watched it
[55:55.180 --> 55:59.340]  you're watching a bunch of twitly inbred idiots that can't even dress
[55:59.340 --> 56:03.260]  themselves and have valets and until just a few decades ago
[56:03.260 --> 56:06.620]  they try to keep it quiet they have people that wipe their butts for them
[56:06.620 --> 56:10.140]  groom of the stool do you know the history of america
[56:10.140 --> 56:14.140]  do you know it started in resistance to this very usurping
[56:14.140 --> 56:18.860]  german family who aren't even british do you know that most the english
[56:18.860 --> 56:22.220]  hate the royal family do you know they have a secret police system
[56:22.220 --> 56:25.980]  that basically threatens people that talk about getting rid of the monarchy
[56:25.980 --> 56:29.500]  do you know that princess diana on record told her butler and others that
[56:29.500 --> 56:32.380]  made a videotape saying prince charles has threatened me
[56:32.380 --> 56:37.020]  he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident these people are
[56:37.020 --> 56:42.460]  absolutely anathema and the servile folks that have been raised to worship
[56:42.460 --> 56:45.740]  these people and all the little old ladies that think it's cute
[56:45.740 --> 56:48.300]  well that's why we're enslaved that's why our country's bankrupt that's what
[56:48.300 --> 56:51.260]  we're going to hell in a handbasket because you've forgotten
[56:51.260 --> 56:54.620]  what it is to be an american or perhaps you were never even taught
[56:54.620 --> 56:59.100]  but now you're going to learn what it's like to be a subject a slave
[56:59.100 --> 57:04.780]  what is royalty royalty is kim jung il in north korea
[57:04.780 --> 57:09.580]  his father took over and then gave him power and now he's giving power to his
[57:09.580 --> 57:13.180]  son why don't they just put gold crowns on their heads
[57:13.180 --> 57:17.660]  and dress up with long flowing robes uh maybe then americans would celebrate
[57:17.660 --> 57:20.780]  the royal wedding of kim jung il's son
[57:20.780 --> 57:25.020]  oh but they wear little military uniforms and we know how clownish it is
[57:25.020 --> 57:29.820]  but somehow we've been tricked at wearing big gold crowns and flowing robes
[57:29.820 --> 57:34.460]  isn't more ridiculous and stupid america has been great because it's not about
[57:34.460 --> 57:37.660]  what race you are what family pedigree or how
[57:37.660 --> 57:41.740]  murderous your great granddaddy was it's about what you individually can do it's
[57:41.740 --> 57:45.740]  about what you individually have to offer being an inventor a trailblazer
[57:45.740 --> 57:49.340]  and explore someone who's brave an artist someone who has
[57:49.340 --> 57:53.100]  incredible literature in their soul these royal

[58:01.020 --> 58:04.780]  and the british world family are at the head of pushing world population

[58:14.540 --> 58:17.980]  about eugenics do you understand this is mainline history
[58:17.980 --> 58:21.260]  the king of england had to advocate at the beginning of world war two because

[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.340]  banking is the system they set up the fact that it's a
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.660]  mathematical certainty under the system they've created that we will go bankrupt
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.700]  because the government's not issuing the currency and credit
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.460]  the private banks are and they've set it up where they have to create debt
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:58.940]  to even issue the currency and then in the last 30 minutes of the interview
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:03.980]  we'll get into solutions with bill still and also take some phone calls but

[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.900]  that over 90 percent of it is owed by the private banks not the people

[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.420]  more of those headlines when we come back but
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.340]  it's really happening the wages of letting this bed this
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.020]  this cartel run things are here and in your film
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.180]  the money masters you know put out 15 years ago you you travel the world you
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.900]  went to the national archives and i want to go through some of those quotes
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.180]  i didn't give you a heads up maybe during the break you can dig them up
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:44.540]  and the experts you interviewed the depression wasn't a mistake it wasn't an
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:48.300]  accident it was engineered so i want to talk about
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.660]  the system we're under so people then understand the system
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.020]  that your research shows we should move to good to have you here with us
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.180]  oh thank you so much for having me on again um we're really coming to the edge
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.140]  here with the dollar briefly in the two minutes we've got left we'll come back
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.620]  into the full body of the interview are we at the precipice right now
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.060]  well yeah but we don't need to be there you know we just don't need a system
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:14.380]  where we have to incur a national debt the thing that people don't realize
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.260]  even paul ryan head of the house budget committee
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.060]  will say inane stuff on tv like what we need to do is just cut the budget
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:25.740]  deficit and thereby reduce the national debt it ain't
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.500]  going to happen you can't reduce the national debt to reduce the national
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:34.220]  debt reduces the national money no the only way to fix this the
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:38.780]  only way is to get out of the federal reserve box to get out of the debt
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:43.900]  money system that's our only hope well you're absolutely right
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:48.540]  and so when we come back if you've got time grab some of those quotes that are
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.580]  on record let's describe the system we're under
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.180]  what their goal is their admission that they want to destroy free market
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:59.020]  destroy wealth it's this it's this false crony
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:03.820]  made off kin leite banker system that seeks to consolidate all power and
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:09.100]  control versus the system that our forebears set up and
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.820]  there's a debate here between kind of the ron paul
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.740]  model the gold silverback versus the lincoln greenback model and again
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.340]  we'll get to that at the bottom of the hour the first two segments the long
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.780]  one's coming up bill i want to really give you the floor
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.340]  because people need to understand what's happening currently by knowing the
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.580]  past to give us a history lesson to go over who these people are and the
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.220]  breakdown of the same families that engineered
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.860]  our great depression because i know your research i might put words in your
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.060]  mouth are the ones engineering what's happening today
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.100]  and i think it's a little more than just ignorance with paul ryan
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.620]  they're trying to sell us on the austerity of gutting everything to
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:50.620]  transfer all wealth to the bankers instead of cutting off the bankers
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.380]  and turning loose the power of true interest free credit basically
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.380]  to the general public bill still is our guest the book available at info wars

[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.340]  that we're in a war against the globalist the private banking cartel
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:32.060]  that sets up currency ponzi schemes that are issued and controlled by private
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.700]  interest and as thomas jefferson said if we ever
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.220]  allow private banks to control the issuance of currency and credit
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.980]  we will uh our our children will wake up homeless on the continent
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:46.220]  our forefathers conquered he went on to say banking institutions are more
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.900]  dangerous than standing armies in fact we're about to go to bill still but
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.740]  pull that quote up for me the full jefferson that i keep quoting if you
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:58.380]  just search uh thomas jefferson banks are more dangerous
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.660]  than standing armies it'll pull that quote up
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:05.260]  the general public knows gas prices are going up but they don't know why
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.300]  dollar devaluation and they don't know who's behind it
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.220]  the republicans are scapegoating the welfare people the welfare people are
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.500]  being scapegoated by the banksters against the middle class
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.980]  if you don't get rid of the banking cartel and the fractional reserve banking
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:24.060]  nothing will be fixed and we're going to go over the mathematics of that the
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:28.700]  history of that who these cartels are this is premeditated
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.860]  here are the headlines just in the last few days
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.940]  imf bombshell age of america nears end the globalist to move everything to

[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:45.340]  bills right as the fed says they may not go to qe3
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:50.140]  monetization of debt uh this is the information
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.820]  that is coming out and we also have the headlines today
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:10:00.780]  that the swiss frank is at all-time record highs against the dollar
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:06.460]  golden silver surging uh in prices again dollar tumbles to all-time low versus

[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.780]  spreads and i'm telling you if you cut off the welfare moms i'm not for having
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.500]  them dependent but at least some of the money they're
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.740]  given of taxpayers gets put back into the economy the banksters
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.420]  they use it to buy up capital items they use it to consolidate
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.660]  and his new book bill still no more national debt that breaks all this down
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.380]  as an interactive book will tell you about that later in the hour
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.980]  it's all available at info wars dot com along with his films
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:45.340]  the newest the secret of oz and the money masters
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:50.220]  these are the key tools i've been using money masters for 15 years
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:55.820]  to wake up people to show them the history to understand what's unfolding
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.500]  and now polls show over 80 want to auditor abolish the fed
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.460]  so that folks are getting past the puppet politicians
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:06.620]  and to the real illegitimate power behind the throne bill still you've got
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.140]  the floor break down the history the premeditation
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.740]  what we're facing what we're entering right now then we'll get into solutions
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.340]  well first of all auditing the fed is not going to do any good because
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:23.420]  if the fed disappeared tomorrow absolutely nothing would change it's
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.860]  not the fed it's the it's the commercial banks
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.300]  which the fed pretends to regulate when in fact
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.580]  the fed does nothing but cover for the commercial banks
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.980]  it's it's disguised to look like part of the government so we will think
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:41.660]  that the government is regulating the banks when in fact just the reverse is
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.980]  true it's the policy holding company it's the policy holding company
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:49.980]  that the fed is just covering for the banks that's why the deception of calling
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:53.660]  it the federal reserve system to make people think it's part of the government
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.740]  when i was doing the money masters the first person i sent the first cut of it
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:01.740]  to was milton freedman nobel prize-winning economist
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.860]  and i was surprised that he even would look at it but he did
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.540]  and i'll never forget when he called back after he'd seen it the first time
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.460]  this is what he said he said boy if you kill the fed and don't do anything about
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.580]  fractional reserve lending you've done nothing
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:19.740]  and you know it kind of shocked me and so we had to rejigger the edit on the
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:23.820]  money masters because he really understood it to a much greater depth i
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.540]  was much more let's kill the fed and all that kind of stuff
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.700]  but you have to understand it's not the fed it's the commercial banks behind the
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:35.020]  fed and their fractional reserve lending system that we've got to fix
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:40.620]  if we do those two things we eliminate the ability of commercial banks to lend
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.500]  money they don't have which is called fractional reserve
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.340]  lending and number two eliminate the ability the federal government to
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.100]  borrow then we fix this we're free of them forever
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.300]  and we can finally have a sovereign free nation once again
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.380]  with that very minimum the total elimination of income taxes
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.340]  so i think that's that's a pretty a pretty good payoff
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.340]  and all we have to do the only thing we have to do to control it
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.940]  is to control the quantity of money that's issued
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:13.100]  that's all we have to do now that might be easier said than done but you know
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:17.820]  what controlling the quantity of money or the quantity of money debt free getting
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.260]  out of control is one heck of a lot better than what we've got today the
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:25.020]  quantity of money being out of control when it's being borrowed
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.580]  so that's the basic situation now you said why are they after us well they're
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.620]  after us because america still is the freest
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:36.700]  nation in history it is the only nation that repeatedly
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.940]  and throughout its history has opposed the central bankers scam
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:45.820]  and they know that with that we are the great danger to not only them
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.660]  and they're they're this massive influx of the way they're able to centralize
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.020]  world money but to the entire new world order scheme
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.420]  they know america is the target they know they've got to try to take down america
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:02.060]  and it's uh this is still up for grabs it's still up for grabs whether or not
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:07.180]  humanity can successfully rule itself that is the basic question
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.940]  that's that's uh at risk right now are we able
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.460]  to self govern or do we slip back into serfdom
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:18.540]  where the rich guys of the world control absolutely everything
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:22.940]  that's what's at risk and that's what info wars is doing such a great job at
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:26.620]  and they control it through fraud so let's start at the beginning
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.020]  a brief history of money what the money changers do
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.460]  the program they're carrying out republicans will say
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:38.540]  what's wrong with rich guys these aren't rich guys that invented a computer
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:43.500]  or a widget or a video game or who know how to hit a baseball
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.100]  they do this through fraud and they've always used
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:51.340]  booms and busts to consolidate power break it down
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:56.380]  well that's exactly right this is the the rich guys club of the world attempting
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:02.780]  to monopolize all the money and thereby monopolize the political power as well
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:08.140]  that's the problem when a nation borrows its money into existence
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:13.420]  it's not just the interest on the debt for example last year
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.860]  we spent 204 billion dollars just paying interest on the national debt
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:23.500]  something that is entirely unnecessary we don't have to do it we don't have to
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:28.780]  have a system constructed that way and according to the congressional
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:32.860]  budget office the cbo even by their conservative estimates
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.300]  by 2020 the amount of money we will be paying just
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.740]  on interest on this totally unnecessary national debt
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.820]  is one trillion dollars that is entirely and completely
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:49.580]  unsustainable we won't get to 2020 with that in that type of situation
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.620]  something is going to happen before then so there's
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:56.780]  there's a crossroads coming up we can either continue down their system and
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:00.460]  their their solution that will be offered will be an international
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:05.100]  currency after another complete collapse of the american economy
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.980]  backed by gold the gold backed money thing that'll that'll be the decision
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:13.180]  point or we can go to a debt-free money
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:17.580]  issued by our own elected government that's the decision point we're coming
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.260]  up up headlong on and that's uh that's why we've
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.740]  got to try to get the word out now okay bill
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.860]  bill i want to get into some of the history of this and what happened in
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:32.380]  the great depression and what you see currently in the economic climate but
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.980]  you mentioned something about five minutes ago that i want listeners to
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:40.220]  know is not pie in the sky you said we can get rid of the income tax
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:44.940]  we didn't have the income tax for those that don't know until the same year
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:49.100]  we got the private banking front company of the federal reserve in place it's
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.540]  part of the communist manifesto the bankers actually
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.460]  want collectivism for the general public to transfer our wealth
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.060]  we built the nation without the income tax
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.140]  and the income tax does not go to run this country uh so explain that to
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.660]  people absolutely that's why it was used to
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:11.180]  back up the massive new debt that they knew the government was going to
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.540]  accumulate with the institution of the federal reserve act
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:18.780]  and it's just absolutely unnecessary this country was built
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.940]  on tariffs and excise taxes alone that's sufficient income
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.380]  uh for the nation and you you don't need a national
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:32.140]  a national federal income tax uh so you can get rid of both uh both in one fell
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.860]  swoop now you all you mentioned something interesting
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:39.180]  about china um you know the only trick what you're going to see here
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:43.020]  make it make no mistake about it we're we are moving into a
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:46.780]  hyperinflationary period there's absolutely no question about it
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.820]  you're seeing it in commodities and gas prices right now
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.740]  you're going to see it across the board and in price hikes and everything by
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.740]  the end of this year and uh so because the central
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:02.060]  bankers only have one trick up their sleeve all they can do
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:07.900]  is is to devalue at the individual national monies by printing more of it
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.420]  by actually lending more of it see i made the same mistake
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.700]  uh and so where does all that extra money go it continues to flood into china
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:20.300]  so what did we see uh just a couple weeks ago when
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:24.380]  china raised its interest rates for the fourth time since october
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:28.780]  it's because their uh their annualized inflation rate at this point is
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:34.460]  60 that's six zero percent per year china doesn't do very well under their
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:37.420]  current system in that in that type of inflationary
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.420]  environment because the folks on the east coast who still have jobs
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:46.060]  can still barely make it but when you double and triple basic food stuff
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:49.820]  for the peasants on the inland you're going to get social
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.020]  social unrest and that's what china fears more than anything else but
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.540]  there's nothing they can do because all the other western economies are inflating
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.580]  their currencies pretty much on an equal basis
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.860]  and all that extra money well absolutely look at our mainstream
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:06.780]  pro-globalist media they tell us china is valhalla
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:10.940]  steve uh watson's brother paul watson was just uh one of our riders was just
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:15.500]  over in china for two weeks an unmitigated
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:19.660]  hellhole in the cities he was in homeless people everywhere
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:25.340]  feces on the ground riots going on daily troops marching in the streets uh and
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.540]  we're told china is this wondrous model of the new
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:31.740]  world order that shows how our media is lying to us
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:36.620]  well absolutely i mean that china is going to suffer unrest because of this
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.060]  massive inflation but they have no alternative
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.340]  they have no other way to go other than to hyperinflate
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:46.780]  all currencies now the the swiss currency and
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:51.020]  the canadian currency and the australian currency are less prone to that so
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.380]  that's why you're seeing them change in relation to the value of the dollar
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:57.180]  that's right bill still stay there as bob Chapman said
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:00.940]  he recommended both those currencies years ago

[01:24:54.660 --> 01:25:00.100]  if you research the history of it it's on record the big central banks maneuvered to
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:04.860]  actually crash the market and then get people on social security so they'd be tied into
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:10.100]  the Ponzi scheme and go along with the expansion of the domestication and now we're headed
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:15.500]  into the next phase of getting rid of the free market imploding America blaming capitalism
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:21.140]  and moving towards a total hegemonic system run by the very same private banks at a world
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.140]  level.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:29.060]  Internet back at the occasion of Milton Friedman's 90th birthday which which a piece that ran
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:35.260]  on NPR because Friedman researched it and found out that the cause of the Great Depression
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:40.540]  was because the newly formed Federal Reserve system which was supposed to prevent such
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:46.260]  depressions deliberately contracted the amount of money in circulation by a factor of one
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:53.460]  third and then held that money out of circulation and that was the cause of the Great Depression.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:56.820]  Depression on the national level is just like a depression in your own personal level
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:01.500]  if you don't have money in your wallet it's a depression it's the same thing if they if
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:09.140]  they increase the amount of money in circulation like they did do the early the last 2000 through
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:16.060]  2008 for example then you have boom times and house prices zoom skyward and all they
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:21.220]  have to do is contract the currency a little bit and the economy turns back down and of
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:26.780]  course they're fully prepared to financially gain from that sort of thing and they do they
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:30.300]  buy up assets for pennies on the dollar this is something throughout the history of the
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:35.660]  United States they've done no less than half a dozen times if not ten times time and time
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:42.780]  again milking the economy milking the the wealth assets stripping the American people
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:47.420]  but you know we fortunately we still have the system we have in place this system can
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.420]  still survive.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.340]  Well we're going to get to that in a moment but but going back to the to the author the
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.780]  authors of the crimes that we're now witnessing and all this pain this time it was different
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:02.740]  than the Great Depression though they first gave themselves tens of trillions of fiat
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:09.380]  you know digital dollars that they hoarded and then loaned out at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:17.300]  some credit card APRs and we'll put the scene in a headline up 79.9 now so that bailout
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:22.300]  they admit they even restricted money more in the last two and a half years hoarding
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.980]  it for themselves as they got the country deeper in debt so that when everything finally
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:32.540]  goes under they're going to come in flush with cash as the saviors like carpetbaggers
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.020]  with off-the-chart interest rates.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:39.180]  Well it was it was worse than that I mean we found out then the congressional hearings
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:46.940]  after the 2008 debacle that JPMorgan and Citi were lending out 52 times the amount of money
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:53.180]  they had not just the 10 to 12 times allowed by international banking rules but 52 times
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:28:01.420]  Freddie and Fanny were leveraged out 72 times and Goldman Sachs was leveraged out 333 times
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:06.540]  and then about four months ago Obama got on TV and said you know we need to just end the
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:13.020]  reserve requirement altogether in other words 333 times is not sufficient for these bankers
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:18.980]  only infinity will do and that's the kind of system we have right now where there's
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:24.820]  a group of people that can essentially print money in their own bank electronically, lend
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:30.060]  it out to us at interest if they want or in this particular case now they can print this
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.420]  money out and play in the derivatives market where they can make far more profits than
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:40.580]  they can at lending fixed mortgages for 30 years.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:46.620]  It makes loan sharking look like a moral operation and these very same banking cartels JPMorgan
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:53.060]  Chase Goldman Sachs Citi Bank Bank of America Wells Fargo they're the big six you quote
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:57.940]  US holders of the private fellow reserve stock you got the Bank of England and others involved
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:00.940]  and they keep that secret very tightly held.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:07.700]  I mean since when do we have a private group who Congress can't even find out secrets from
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:12.780]  running rough shot over everything and two years ago Greenspan former Fed head told their
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:19.820]  news hour I'm sure you've seen the clip Bill that we are above the law no no branch of
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:23.460]  government can touch us we can do whatever we want I mean you might as well say he's
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.460]  God.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.780]  Well that's what the Bible says that the bar should be serving to the lender and that's
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:34.060]  the other that there are two problems with this national in the national debt the interest
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:38.940]  that's incurred number one it's the interest is compounding and we have to pay it but number
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:45.180]  two equally important but never talked about is the control that interest gives people
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.180]  you know also we're gonna talk about it when we get back long segment coming up we'll get
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:51.100]  into solutions with Bill still.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:30:00.740]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:05.100]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:09.740]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:14.380]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:19.980]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:25.220]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:30.420]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:34.620]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:39.260]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.420]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:47.740]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:12.940]  we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:19.100]  at home turning men's influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:25.340]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:30.980]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:35.860]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.340]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:45.820]  do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care right now in Washington DC
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:52.340]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:58.100]  wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:21.900]  tv well I won't back down no I won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:30.100]  but I won't back down you can't back down gonna stand my ground we're being enslaved
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:36.740]  financially by a bunch of fraudsters publicly for years they wouldn't give the Congress
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:41.900]  where the bailout money went and finally Bloomberg and others sued and got it trillions
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:48.780]  of dollars to foreign banks to domestic media payoffs to newspapers private banks get our
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:54.940]  money that we've got to pay interest on and then they pay it to newspapers and MSNBC
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:34:00.460]  to come out and attack the Tea Party that's out saying abolish the Fed audit the Fed and
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:07.220]  of course Ron Paul points out that yes abolishing the Fed won't do anything or auditing it won't
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:14.300]  but expose what the banks are doing that control it so it looks like a paradox but it's not
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:20.380]  really now bill still is our guest we're about to go back to him here in just a moment I

[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:40.500]  be getting into that now into the solution area but you got you got cut off by the break
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:47.980]  there bill when we talk about we won't back down we can't back down there is no way out
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:54.580]  except by defeating these people so to get into solutions in a nutshell explain the current
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:36:01.940]  monetary system versus what the founders established and your well researched alternative of government
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:10.460]  controlled and transparent fiat for credit to empower the individual to create a level
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:17.140]  playing field versus the globalist controlled fiat that's only used for them at interest
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:23.300]  and then the third way the gold silver route I mean my and people email me and say well
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:28.340]  why do you have bill still on and then have Ron Paul on well this is not a cult ladies
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:33.380]  and gentlemen we're here to get you thinking I have on who I think is interesting I have
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:37.940]  on who I think is well researched I have different perspectives and different views
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:44.660]  in complex multivariate multifaceted understandings as the lay of the land changes like I've studied
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:48.740]  history I like and tend to agree with bill still's model that a lot of top economists
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:54.060]  agree with and and as a system the bankers really get angry about especially with Lincoln
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:58.580]  but I know that they're not going to go with that system at this time show under the current
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:06.860]  system golden silver are going to go up so it isn't a contradiction that I'm I'm entertaining
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:10.940]  what he's saying but also saying golden silver is great because look at silver's up seven
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:17.420]  eight times what it was 10 years ago gold's up more than 400% four times and growing that's
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:21.980]  a consequence of what the globalists have done and bill's right the university of Texas
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.540]  the other big universities the dictators the banksters the Rockefellers the Rothschilds
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:32.780]  they all hoard golden silver they are positioning it where in the future it could be $5,000 for
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:38.300]  gold and 200 bucks for silver that's a potential and yes I would probably even as a golden silver
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:45.340]  bug at that time oppose a system that put them back in the driver's seat but it's again the
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:49.980]  reality is very complex it's not just will do you support Ron Paul's model or bill still's
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:56.060]  model or I'm here respecting you enough to have a wide spectrum breakdown okay bill I want to take
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:00.300]  a few calls later in the hour maybe hold you five minutes over the next hour or maybe even 20 if
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.980]  you can do it before Wayne Madsen comes back in he's busy doing another radio interview anyways
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:10.700]  he's down here visiting us in town with some breaking news but the toll-free number of folks
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:16.620]  have questions for you not long diatribe because we're almost out of time here but simple questions
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:21.500]  that you'd like to get answered or complex questions put in a simple way for bill still
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:30.300]  1-800-259-9231 we love to hear from you we're limited on time 800-259-9231 now getting into
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.060]  what the monetary system is currently the three different models that we've discussed
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:40.460]  and your your system and why you think it's the best system well first of all let me say a couple
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:47.420]  things that you said a lot first of all qe2 not happening that's a complete non-starter qe3
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:53.420]  will happen absolutely they have no other tricks in their bag do we want rich guys in the system
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:59.660]  absolutely we want rich guys in the system but you know the fifth what we want is a capitalist
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:04.940]  system what we don't have is a capitalist system we have a monopolistic system the fifth
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:11.180]  the plank of the communist manifesto says centralization of credit in the hands of the state
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:16.700]  by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly that's what we have today
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:23.260]  that's not what we need what we need is money created in the public interest without public
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:27.900]  debt it's as simple as that there's that there's two things that you have to do to make it happen
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:32.540]  number one you forbid further government borrowing number two you forbid the ability
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:37.020]  of commercial banks to lend money they don't have we're not trying to kill banks we're not
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:42.060]  trying to kill interest you know we need banks we need people to be able to get interest to
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:47.820]  risk their capital that's the capitalist system but we don't have that system we have the monopoly
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:57.020]  secondly uh you when when we've we've uh obama's stimulated the economy with about 1.4 trillion
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:02.380]  dollars but think about it those the banks that get that money get to multiply that by a factor of
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:09.180]  10 or 12 there's only 14 trillion dollars in the american economy so this 1.4 trillion when
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:14.940]  multiplied by 10 makes another 14 trillion other words they've doubled the amount of money in this
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:20.380]  system that's for sure inflationary we just haven't seen the full impact yet it usually takes about
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:25.740]  24 months to work its way through the system next you you keep referring to this jefferson quote
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:31.980]  i hate to tell you but on chapter 32 of my book i have a whole chapter on fake quotes i try to
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:37.500]  clean up some of these quotes that quote happens to be a fake um so well i know that that's in
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:44.140]  in in debate but i i mean i've got books that are over 100 years old uh with not just that quote but
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:49.020]  tons of quotes by the founders uh i've actually you know read some of the books were bitten by the
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:53.100]  founders that's all they talked about was the private central banks i mean that's what lincoln
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:59.660]  talked about that's what jackson talked about absolutely but but there's there's no uh verifiable
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:04.620]  source on that particular quote jefferson said plenty of other stuff similar to it but not that
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:09.740]  particular okay well let's go through some of those quotes uh well i'd have to dig them out of the
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:13.340]  book well that's why i was at the start of the show saying i didn't want to go through a few
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:19.580]  quotes because i mean the the the founding of our country mainly dealt with the monetary systems uh
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:23.900]  jackson it was all about the monetary system i mean bill breaks some of that down because this
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:29.260]  fight we're facing has been the fight that we've always been facing in any free society if they're
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:33.020]  going to have a shot at liberty you know when you say yeah we want rich guys in free market
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:39.020]  this is the opposite these guys use their monopoly over currency and credit to dominate to shut down
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:44.300]  their competition right they make the power pyramid very very steep that's the ultimate
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:49.100]  goal of the new world order to have that power pyramid as steep as possible where it's very
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:54.060]  tall and not very wide in other words very few people hold almost all the power at the top
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:42:00.860]  and the bottom portion uh the the we the people portion hold very little power at all i mean
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:04.860]  i want to say something else about gold money that i think will make sense to your skeptical
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:09.500]  audience and that is suppose that tomorrow your senator calls up and says you know what i've
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:14.620]  got a secret for you we've got this gold money bill that's absolutely going to pass congress
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:19.820]  in two weeks what would the first thing you do you'd go out and you buy all the gold you could
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:25.180]  well what do you think the rich guys of the world would do you know in other words they can corner
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:29.740]  the the backing of the money and thereby your money is no longer in the public interest it's
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:35.660]  completely manipulatable in order for money to be in the public interest it has to be valueless
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:43.420]  well let's go over the system that you developed how you developed it obviously proposed by other
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:48.460]  economists in the past but here's a quote that i have dug up the providence on it by the way i
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:53.660]  disagree with you on that jefferson maybe we can consult and and and bill you know you you flatter
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:59.580]  me by naming the secret of oz off of your research uh you know the time you were on my show and you
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:04.860]  said you heard me say that the wizard of oz was all about silver and gold back money and the fight
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.460]  against the banks and you thought it was crazy then you went and looked it up and found out it was
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:14.940]  a famous play i i actually researched that jefferson quote one time and uh it it there is some
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:20.460]  providence in it and some letters that that that have very similar things said and they believe
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:26.620]  it comes out of a news article quoting him posthumously shortly after his death right around
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:31.580]  the same day that uh who was the other guy that died on the same day he was a former president
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:36.860]  yeah john adams but but but going back to this what about this quote i see in the future a crisis
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:42.060]  approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country corporations
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:46.700]  have been enthroned in an era of corruption will follow that the money power of the country will
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:51.820]  endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:59.340]  aggregated in the hands of a few and the republic destroyed uh i i'm i'm not sure and i don't want
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:05.340]  to be quoted but i think that is also uh not verifiable this is this is according to i i did a
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:09.980]  lot of research on this and in the final throws of writing this book because there are that's
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:15.340]  lincoln there that's lincoln people out there who who are using yeah i know there are some people
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:19.820]  sure sure but i mean did lincoln issue the greenback did lincoln say none of the bankers
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.900]  i mean i mean i've got absolutely i mean were there thousands of news articles written about
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:29.020]  andrew jackson you know i killed the bank at the hermitage on his deathbed well but see that's
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:33.100]  that's not true either i went to the hermitage and and looked at his tomb and that's quote is
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:38.380]  not there i made a mistake in the money masters there this this no wait i've been to the hermitage
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:43.020]  in tennessee i wasn't talking about it being a quote on his grave uh he was quoted as telling
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:48.140]  the people when he died uh there that i killed the bank i mean that was published in the papers
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:52.380]  yes that that might be true but i reported in the money masters that that was on his tomb
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:56.220]  that was not correct so i'm just trying to clean up some of the stuff because there are people
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:00.940]  so basically the i mean the presidents never fought the banks then their whole history excuse me
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:06.380]  i'm being sarcastic oh no they've been present to have fought against them and that that's why
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:11.500]  that's why the new world order folks hate the united states so much because there's an outbreak of
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:17.740]  of anti new world order anti central bank control every so often and we're we're about to see another
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:26.540]  one well shifting gears uh let's let's get into what we're basically dealing with here
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.780]  with the monetary choices we have the ideas you cover in your book versus some of the other ideas
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:38.540]  that are out there right well the the current republican plan is austerity just as it is
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:43.740]  in great britain and all the other nations of europe that uh we can reduce spending enough
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:48.380]  so that we can start to pay down these national debts and as i pointed out before that's never
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:54.460]  going to happen the republican plan just isn't even in the ballpark of being able to pay down the
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:59.900]  national debt even if that was a good idea and it's not you can't fix the problem this way you
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:06.060]  have to get out of the debt money system all together and by the way in the great depression
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:15.260]  they also cut spending and that only intensified it okay well that's um i can't really speak to that
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:22.060]  no i'm saying i agree with you that in the middle of a depression when you do cut spending it it
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:27.260]  obviously only stalls the economy out oh yeah yeah well what what is a depression by definition it's
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:33.340]  less money in circulation and so so uh you know cutting more money out of the system is not going
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:38.860]  to work what you have to do is cut the debt out of the system and then the economy would revive
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:50.700]  immediately now describe your monetary plan um sure for folks sure well as i said the first thing
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:56.140]  if government can't borrow then it has to balance its budget and face the political consequences
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:47:01.340]  of new spending programs immediately because it would have to raise taxes to pay for them
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:07.580]  immediately sovereign nations don't have to borrow sovereign nations can create
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:14.300]  enforcement we probably need a constitutional amendment that caps the quantity of money that
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:20.780]  was Milton Friedman's suggestion having it raised only with population uh the chicago plan back in
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:27.420]  the 1930s was they offered two alternatives to tie it to inflation or to tie it to gdp i think
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:32.220]  gdp would be more difficult because you can't rely on any government economics numbers at this
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.940]  point they they're cooking all the books there's no honesty anywhere to be found as far as an
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:43.900]  economic numbers but i'd be willing to leave that to a panel of experts above my my level to decide
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:49.340]  that um secondly you have to eliminate this ability of the banks to lend money they don't
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:54.140]  actually have now those are the two federal solutions there's another solution at the state
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:48:00.940]  level that helps states out right away state bank the bank of north dakota model whereby states can
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:05.980]  create their own state chartered bank completely outside of the federal reserve system and uh
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:12.220]  they're thereby uh they can uh create their own credit so they don't have to borrow money
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.180]  through bonded indebtedness from the big new york money centers center banks this is not a far
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:22.700]  out experiment this has been working in north dakota for 90 years that's why uh north dakota is
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:27.980]  the only state with a balanced budget it has the highest birth rate all kinds of other good economic
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:32.140]  numbers coming out of north dakota and it's something that every state should employ and when
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:36.780]  you see legislative uh sessions and states start at the beginning the next year you're going you're
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:41.740]  going to see several states right on this well let's go back uh here some listeners are like
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:48.140]  like give the government the power to just issue fiat that's crazy well they've already given it
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:53.980]  to the private offshore banks that's exactly and that's why i go back to lincoln uh he tried
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:58.060]  to get financing for the war regardless of what your view is on the war out there listeners
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:03.740]  and he couldn't get it at a reasonable rate so he just issued his own currency give folks a history
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:08.780]  lesson well right we've we've gone to this every time our backs were to the wall for example in
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:15.660]  colonial colonial america there was uh not not much gold and silver so the only way these economies
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:21.100]  got off the ground were individual states printing their own currency individual banks and states
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:26.300]  printing their own currency but the problem was that no one knew how much each state was was printing
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:32.860]  and so it was a very difficult system uh so when they nationalized it with the continental currency
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:39.100]  during well actually the the the state system was so effective that the british government outlawed it
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:45.020]  and put us all on a uh gold only money system and that caused as it always does an immediate
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:50.460]  depression and according to franklin that was the root cause of the revolutionary war uh then when
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:55.980]  we actually were engaged in the revolutionary war we had a national money called the continental
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:50:00.940]  and of course people point to this as being the weimar republic of the revolutionary america
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:06.060]  but such was not the case at all all you have to do is control the quantity congress controlled the
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:11.740]  quantity of issuance of continental very well it was the british part two counterfeiting ships in
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:17.260]  boston harbour and they counterfeited the currency massively and this is very well documented
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:21.500]  because they understand how how important monetary systems are for folks that don't know how the
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:27.820]  globalist are waging economic war on us look at the two british counterfeiting ships flooding the
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:34.780]  markets so the colonies couldn't buy goods that's exactly right as uh all you have to do to make this
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:41.180]  system work is control the quantity that that's issued that's what all of economics is all about
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:47.420]  anyway to have to create a stable economy if you create a stable economy then the economy thrives
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:52.460]  that's right money is just the symbol of agreed upon exchange to grease the skids of the market
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:57.420]  but the banksters they make it king and they make it out of nothing and we bow down and give them all
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:03.820]  our liberty and freedom for it it's sick hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite

[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:43.180]  hour then Wayne Madsen is going to be in studio with us again bill stills our guest really an
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:50.220]  amazing work his new book no more national debt and it deals with an alternate system to the von
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:55.340]  meese alternate with a government issued fiat system that is what Lincoln did it is what the
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:55:01.100]  founding fathers did for a time i think this is all open for debate i'm not in either camp i want
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:05.020]  to get rid of the private fellow reserve and the private banks that are behind it that have engaged
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:11.100]  in all this fraud and bill stills done a lot of research into this and there's a lot of major
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:16.700]  academics like Friedman and others that supported it people can then also say that you know Friedman
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:22.140]  supported shock doctrine politically and that the bankers have kind of put this idea out there in
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:27.500]  case they get publicly exposed they think they can hand the power to congress and then congress will
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:34.220]  do favors to certain groups but if the public is genuinely educated about monetary issues
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:37.820]  that won't be possible but again we're having a larger debate going over some more of these
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:42.540]  quotes he did document the providence of this one if congress has the right under the constitution
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:48.380]  to issue paper money it was given them to use themselves not to be delegated to individuals
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:55.260]  or corporations andrew jackson and we do know the entire fight has always been against this money
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:56:02.620]  power as we are now witnessing it how many times did they try to kill andrew jackson uh at least
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:08.380]  twice if not three times the the the one where they stuck two pistols right in his stomach uh
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:14.540]  literally in his stomach and both pistols misfired that sounds like providence doesn't it oh absolutely
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:19.820]  providence jackson killed the bank so good that they didn't get they didn't get it back the way
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:26.780]  they wanted it until uh 1913 so for about 70 years so yeah he was a great hero uh we're gonna
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:30.140]  break in a moment come back and take some calls and talk more about the book and you're gonna dig
[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:34.540]  out some of the bona fide quotes and and to be clear i was talking to build during the break a lot
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:39.100]  of these are quotes that come out in parliaments or they're taken from other quotes and then
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:44.060]  if one or two words get changed over the hundreds of years and they claim they don't have providence
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:50.860]  i have studied the federalist papers the anti-federalist papers the debates uh i've i've i've got
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:57.020]  old reprints of newspapers from jackson's time with the cover of him fighting the hydra of the bankers
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:02.140]  i mean that's what this is all i mean what about the fights in 1913 leading up to the
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:06.060]  federal reserve act all of the limberg quotes and i mean that's all congressional record
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:11.500]  oh yeah that's all perfect yeah so the system you know wants to rewrite history it's kind of like
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:16.460]  those academics they had five years ago six years ago one of them got a lost his tenure
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:21.740]  up in chicago claiming that the founders weren't into guns and only 10 of americans and the colonies
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:27.260]  own guns and and the and the second amendment wasn't really what it was meant for there's a
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:32.700]  lot of rewriting going on out there and they you know they throw things up to try to oh actually
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:38.860]  america was anti-gun and and the united states was you know always loved the bank of england
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:46.140]  and they love the uh you know banking acts i mean that that's just not the case no it's not not the
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:50.700]  case at all in fact uh it was it was the core reason for the american revolution just like
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:53.820]  anything else if somebody takes all the money out of your wallet you're not happy
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:01.020]  but do you agree with my analysis that money is just a symbol of energy that we agree upon
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:07.180]  to exchange goods and and that the globalists have just turned it into the idol they've turned it
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:14.540]  into the uh energy itself i'd be able to control the quantity and and it's not difficult for them
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:20.140]  to control the quantity of money if that money is made of metal or based on metal money has to be
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:27.740]  value bill your phone was cutting out are you on a cordless uh yeah i'm not on a i'm not on a uh

[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:43.340]  it's all food for thought just getting people thinking about alternatives and and and having
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:48.460]  that debate uh is half the battle we're going to start taking your phone calls for bill still be
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:52.780]  with us a 20 after then wane madson joins us in studio for the balance of the hour have some other
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:01:00.940]  important news coming up 1-800-259-9231 uh let's go ahead and talk to tyrese in tennessee you're on
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:07.900]  the air go ahead hi alex hi mr still alex i had a couple of things for you i guess i'll start first
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:16.620]  with mr still if you can uh explain to me how how i would approach uh the expectations i place on my
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:22.780]  representatives and and how we should combat this this issue with our budget and the monetary
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:27.420]  things going on what what what type of expectations should we be having on our local officials if you
[02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:32.620]  don't take the money power away from these private banks nothing will fix anything and it's designed
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:37.500]  to reduce us down to total slaves so they can have us as poppers they control by debt sorry bill go
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:42.380]  ahead yeah that's exactly right and if you all you have to do is read william jennings brian 1896
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:47.260]  cross of gold speech and that's exactly what he says unless you fix the money power no other
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:52.700]  reforms are possible so you know what they're doing is they're trying to cut 38 billion dollars out of
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:59.740]  a budget when in fact they're still going to go 1.4 trillion dollars into the hole again this year
[02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:05.580]  so that's not a fix they can't possibly cut the budget enough even if they start flashing a medicare
[02:02:05.580 --> 02:02:11.180]  and social security because the interest is compounding you cannot fix this in any way
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:16.060]  other than by getting out of the federal reserve box getting out of the debt money system getting
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:21.020]  into a system where our money is issued in the public interest without debt that's the only fix
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:28.380]  does that answer your question yes sir in second second outlook this is for you i know a big part
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:34.380]  of uh our problem as far as trying to get these changes in our government is this unified front
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:40.940]  that we have we don't have and i like to share with you if you allow me what i've done on my part
[02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:47.820]  to try to try to fix this sure tell us connected uh i actually built an iphone application
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:53.740]  and it's uh it's called patriot eyes and it's in it it's in the app store and i would like
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:58.380]  for you to look forward and get put give me your comments on it and uh i guess i'll take i'll take
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:05.340]  your uh response to that offer is it called patriot eyes patriot eyes that's correct all right i'll
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:11.740]  check it out thank you so much sir survival doc in missouri you're on the air with bill still hello
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:19.580]  alex uh first time caller a long time listener um i have a um comment uh a point of disagreement
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:26.940]  with uh bill still i agree with most of what he says i don't agree that we should go back to
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:34.460]  another fiat monetary system because if you if you look at history every time a government has been
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:42.220]  given the um ability to create unlimited amounts of money they have used that to through uh through
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:49.180]  inflation to uh to tag you're right but in christ time and in the roman times they can manipulate
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:55.420]  metal coins as well that's the problem anything can be manipulated uh i mean is that your question
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:04:01.020]  or comment for bill well yes but i i think it's a lot harder to manipulate gold and silver because
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:06.380]  they can't be created and paper money can be created so easily and i just don't think we can
[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:11.820]  trust government to uh to monitor that's a great point bill what do you say that i understand the
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:16.620]  point and that is the basic point of this thing can we trust government with the greatest power and so
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:21.260]  my question to you is and of course you said the wrong thing you said that uh government's never
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:26.860]  been able to control the quantity that's just flat wrong but if if my question my question to you is
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:33.900]  if we're not going to give this the greatest power of a sovereign nation to the government then who are
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:39.580]  you going to give it to there's only one alternative you can't just let it go to the void that's what
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:45.660]  hamilton told washington and so there's thereby the bank of england jumped in started creating money
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:50.780]  and started creating i tell you what survival doc bill still stay there no well call you're coming up
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:58.620]  we got some of these modified quotes as well for you stay with us bill still

[02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:07.420]  www dot silver lungs dot com ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:19.660]  okay if you just joined this monetary researcher filmmaker author bill still interviewed melton
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:23.980]  freeman you name it or the books and videos he's put together to have done a lot of deep research
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:29.820]  he believes government should do what lincoln did and basically the government should create
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:36.220]  interest free money for its own operations and that we should have free market banks that have
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:43.900]  reasonable interest but are there to basically supply the economy with credit and at the same
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:48.940]  time not allow fractional reserve banking where as obama has said that they're not going eight to
[02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:54.940]  one or ten to one for every dollar in the bank now it's 300 to one 400 to one 500 to one that's not
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:09:00.140]  even counting the derivatives another form of financial instrument so think of the unfair
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:05.100]  trade advantage that gives them they're getting 300 400 to one free money we're paying interest
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:11.580]  no way to compete it's the greatest form of discrimination we also think of discrimination
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:17.740]  as black versus white or north versus south or man against woman or things like this but real
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:23.820]  discrimination is economic inequity that's really the system now survival doc you were
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:30.380]  saying that you disagree with bill still and and and saying that financial fiat has never worked
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:35.580]  governments can't be trusted and i kind of agreed with you if we talk about rome or the us or other
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:42.700]  systems but there have been smaller cities islands that have done it successfully for hundreds of
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:46.380]  years and i thought that's where bill was going i talked to him during the break that is where he's
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:52.300]  going but overall bill i think that survival doc the caller from missouri does have a point
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:57.900]  history is full of wreckage of governments that have issued their own currencies but generally
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:03.340]  they allow the money power to come in and manage it correct well that's true but i mean uh you know
[02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:07.900]  there have been outbreaks throughout history outside of the united states and now the states
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:12.540]  is the greatest example of fighting for the money power that's ever existed in the history of the
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:18.140]  world because we are the freest nation that's it they're the to-go hand-in-hand but smaller nations
[02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:23.020]  have have done this successfully for example guernsey off the coast of france it's actually a
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:30.140]  british protectorate uh found out uh found during the middle 1800s themselves in a horrible condition
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:35.500]  and that is they they had a very small economy and yet uh their dykes were breaking down the
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:41.820]  seawall was breaking down they needed a new market and so they but theirs is a a great uh
[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:48.780]  microcosm of what we should be doing and that is they uh they agreed to just issue a guernsey pound
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:55.100]  note uh and issue enough of them to do the repairs they wanted and so what all the citizens were
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:11:00.380]  basically agreeing is yeah there's going to be more money in circulation and so that that means
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:05.980]  that uh there's going to be more pressure to buy goods so the price of goods will naturally go up
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:12.140]  so they were all agreeing to suffer the inflation equally for the common good then once these
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:18.220]  edifices were built the central market and the seawalls repaired then they could tax uh whatever
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:23.900]  extra money that was in the system out of existence again and that thereby it was perfectly equal
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:29.660]  equal and equitable the money was being created without debt in the public interest and on the
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:35.580]  bigger scale that's what we need to go to in this country guernsey's uh european is it a british isle
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:40.860]  it's a british isle but it's very close to the coast of france but it's its own little country
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:46.940]  isn't it it's not a country i believe it it would be called a protectorate under the american system
[02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:50.700]  i don't know exactly what it's called under the british it's got its own government yeah it's got
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:56.060]  its own government and you if you go on the guernsey website which you can you can google right now
[02:11:56.060 --> 02:12:01.820]  you'll see that uh even though they still produce their own debt free government issued money that
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:08.700]  they they try to they control the quantity quite closely they try to create this steady state economy
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:13.500]  and that's why there's so successful that's why they only have a 20 percent income tax and they
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:18.780]  have one of the highest standards of living in europe wow yeah no i've i've read quite a bit about
[02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:26.460]  guernsey uh any other points survival talk well yes just one other and that is i think that the
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:32.540]  value and the quantity of money can be controlled without bankers and governments and that's by
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:42.140]  allowing the free market to us to operate and i believe that's the opinion of ron paul yeah they
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:47.180]  love the the austrian economists love to talk about the free market but you know what we've
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:52.780]  had a pretty free market the last 10 years how's that been working out for us not so good there
[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:58.140]  is no free but it's had government backing that's how i mean if the banksters wanted to engage in
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:04.380]  this fraud and rip people off that's their civil issue it's that it's that it's that pirate market
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:09.180]  with government backing that's allowed all this bill if if you allow if you just say we're gonna
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:14.700]  leave it to the free market then for sure the rich guys club of the world are going to control it
[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:19.180]  because they control the so-called free market there's no free market on the the dow jones the
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:24.380]  stock exchange it's just a bunch of high frequency computers trading with each other there is absolutely
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:30.380]  no free market if we had a free market then we'd be in good shape but we don't all right survival
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:34.700]  doc good questions i want to go through some quotes and then hurry through some more calls for
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:41.020]  bill still this amazing book no more national debt bill has a really good perspective well
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:45.740]  researched and i think it's it's well worth looking at but unfortunately most americans are
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:50.460]  still not even having this discussion and it's this discussion that needs to be had so that
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:55.980]  we're informed on monetary issues or no matter what road we go down it's going to be corrupted
[02:13:55.980 --> 02:14:01.020]  correct bill yes that's absolutely true and you know one of the one of the most interesting periods
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:06.940]  that that i i've i've never been into before that i get into in the book is during the crash of
[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:13.260]  of the 1930s for example there was a british professor who won the Nobel prize in chemistry
[02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:19.980]  1921 by the name of frederick saudi and he got interested in monetary matters and he just makes
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:24.460]  some fantastic quotes which uh is this the appropriate time to get into some yeah you know
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:31.580]  hit us yeah well this is a saudi quote for example in 1933 uh the fluctuations could be
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:37.020]  minimized if the government alone had the power to create money and created it in order to maintain
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:41.900]  a stable price level which is just what i've been talking about in order to achieve a government
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:47.020]  monopoly on the creation of money it would be necessary to eliminate the money created by banks
[02:14:47.020 --> 02:14:52.460]  in the process of making loans the growing bank failures of the early thirties provided by night
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:58.220]  and others at chicago with the opportunity to reinstate and redefine the saudi proposal um
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:02.300]  then there's another one there is a something called the program for monetary reform which is
[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:09.660]  put out in 1939 by paul douglas he was professor of economics at university of chicago uh Irving
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:15.580]  fisher of yale frank graham of princeton url hamilton of duke wilford king of nyu and charles
[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:21.900]  whitersley of princeton uh this plan was endorsed by 80 of the professors of economics during the
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:26.860]  depression the great depressionary period and here's a quote out of this work if they were so
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:31.980]  right on it's just unbelievable if the purpose of money and credit were to discourage the exchange
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:38.300]  of goods and services to destroy periodically the wealth produced to frustrate the and trip
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:43.020]  those who work and save our present monetary system would seem to be a most effective instrument
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:48.300]  to that end they're talking about the federal reserve system that was just past 15 years earlier
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:54.300]  they got they saw it exactly right so um and then they talk about the nations that went off the
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:59.500]  gold standard as they and they they proved beyond the shadow of the doubt that the nations that
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:05.100]  went off the gold standard earlier uh came out of the depression sooner and here was their their
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:09.740]  quote france was among the last to abandon gold and she's still suffering from her mistake and
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:17.020]  waiting so long so um you know it's this period of the 30s that uh there were two there was the
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:23.020]  chicago plan and the program for monetary reform these guys thought exactly right and thereafter
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:29.100]  the fed system clamped down on professors of economics so that this outbreak of truth would
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:37.980]  never happen again bill continue with some more quotes okay uh well here here's another here's
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:43.100]  another quote out of out of this program for monetary reform our own monetary policy should
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:48.940]  be directed towards avoiding inflation as well as deflation and in attaining and maintaining as
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:54.220]  nearly as possible full production and employment and that's exactly what we're talking about all
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:17:00.620]  you have to have to do to have a successful economy is to control is to control the quantity so that
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:06.060]  it's so the price level stays steady that's the whole purpose of economics and you know
[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:12.540]  don't you think that if that's all we have to do to fix this economy don't you think we could find
[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:18.700]  a half dozen or a handful of good people around the country who would be honest about this and
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:25.100]  just control the quantity of the u.s. issuing its own death pre-government money i'll say it again the
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:31.100]  last caller uh we you know believed the ron paul thing that you have to leave it to the free market
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:37.580]  and uh back your money with uh gold or silver or some other form of commodity and any any time
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:43.500]  you back it with a commodity as word got out that this bill inflation fruition that people would buy
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:48.300]  up the commodity so you're not you're not really it's in control of the rich well what if you went with
[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:53.900]  silver though uh i mean i mean certainly we've had gold back and silver back currency before and
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:59.100]  it and there were some manipulations that went on and some runs and it was actually the Federal
[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:05.340]  Reserve that used that unstable part of it as their pretext to sell the Federal Reserve Act
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:10.860]  well that was of course the theory of William Jennings brian in 1896 and the reason was his
[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:15.980]  father was a greenbacker so he knew greenbacks were the solution but the greenback party had only
[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:20.940]  gotten about three percent in the three uh previous presidential cycles so he went with the silver
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:26.300]  backed money because silver is being wildcatted uh you know from mines in the west and so he figured
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:30.540]  you know they wouldn't be able to control it so well but remember back in the 70s when the hunt
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:36.380]  brothers controlled the silver market right at the dawn of electronic trading i'd tell some hilarious
[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:41.500]  stories in here about that hunt brother's episode so two two guys yeah but that was them
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:48.140]  cornering it artificially this is being driven by inflation now well yeah but i mean if you still if
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:53.580]  you made silver the basis of money the rich guys in a blink of an eye could buy it up through their
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:58.860]  high frequency trading compute computers you can't money has to be valueless in order to really be in
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:05.820]  the public interest yeah that goes back to the tally sticks and seashells that's right well i mean i
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:11.740]  think this overall has been a very good discussion and um i'm still researching the austrian school
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:19.100]  i'm researching uh the uh schools that uh you follow and i know that any alternative to the
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:25.260]  private banking hegemony that we have now uh is a change of pace and it will take the power
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:31.740]  structure some time to reorganize around the new system and i i again i get calls on both sides
[02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:38.060]  off air angry every time i have ron paul on about monetary issues or i have you on or others saying
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:43.340]  why am i giving out different views and it's because it's a college of ideas your books available

[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:17.340]  and he has been in there and one of the little office cubicles just banging away researching
[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:23.260]  making phone calls doing interviews we've got a bunch of breaking news with the obama providence
[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:29.740]  issue where he really came from big us today poll only 38 percent believe he was definitely born
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:34.940]  here 62 and growing that's almost two-thirds really are having questions we've got some big
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:40.860]  nsa developments of course wane formerly worked with the nsa so that's coming up as well finishing
[02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:45.820]  up with bill still and i'll try to cram in these collars later after bill leaves i'm i'm sorry but
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:50.380]  we've got to get madson in here i could talk to bill for 100 hours and wane for 100 hours as well
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:56.140]  the secret of oz is a great dvd documentary breaking this down uh also the money master's
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:25:01.980]  also made by mr still uh it's basically my favorite uh it's three plus hours two desk
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:07.500]  discounted info wars dot com and this new book no more national debt you call this the world's
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:13.580]  first interactive book uh we were talking during the break you were saying this was always household
[02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:19.340]  discussion monetary issues even in blue collar you know people on wagon trains were discussing
[02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:24.620]  this hundreds of years ago and right up until 1913 and it's when we forgot about this that the
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:29.820]  bankers were able to run wild bill still what do folks need to get no more national debt well
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:35.340]  because you we've got to make this a household issue again the household issue that has to be
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:41.340]  on the forefront of every federal election from now on has to be the quantity of money how much
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:45.500]  money is there in the system of course we can't control that as long as the bankers have control
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:50.060]  of that we can only control that if you bring that money power back into congress and then have
[02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:55.980]  an oversight committee who actually controls the issuance of that money uh from elected state
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:26:02.140]  representatives now as far as the the hyperscan this is the first hyperscan enabled uh book uh
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:07.980]  the printed book ever there's almost a hundred hyperscans in there it allows me to link uh it
[02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:12.940]  allows me to cut the book uh size in half essentially because i can link to supplemental
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:19.820]  videos i can i can show the the actual pdf of the original federal reserve act all by just
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:26.860]  initializing a free app that goes on your smartphone or you can you can type um the url
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:32.620]  into your desktop computer so desktop computers won't be left out to so it's got a mega expanded
[02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:40.140]  bibliography basically uh well it's not just the bibliography it allows me to update the
[02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:46.460]  information for example it allows people to interact with this this uh fake quotes issue is big and
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:52.220]  so i want to interact with people who have uh different uh uh information on the fake quotes
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:57.740]  and it allows people to interact with me and so we can improve that as well it's it's the truly

[02:28:56.860 --> 02:29:01.260]  that he considers to be his base i think it goes with the arrogance of barack obama and his
[02:29:01.260 --> 02:29:06.060]  administration obama we had the head of the small business league on hundreds of thousands of members
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:12.460]  obama got rid effectively of the blacks black small business assistance fund i'm not surprised
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:18.300]  and now we know today it's being reported that he's not delivered any of his promises to deal with

[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:30.300]  and you're in your sunday dress so we're honored uh wane you were getting into new developments on
[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:36.860]  the social security number on his college records big this new pullout upwards of two-thirds don't
[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:41.660]  think he was born in this country because these the public finally is learning not to trust government
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:48.620]  well we have uh there's a couple new developments one is uh from a hawaii state senator sam slone
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:58.540]  slone uh he uh says he know he knew the obama's uh grandparents in hawaii and he's stating uh
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:06.540]  that he uh feels that uh obama was born in hawaii but that if the birth certificate is exposed it
[02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:13.020]  may reveal that barack obama's senior is not the actual father of that's right he's gone public
[02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:18.460]  that's all over the honolulu uh in the hawaiian papers it's all over the place and and is this
[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:23.900]  the reason why i do know that the white house likes to divert people to the birth certificate but
[02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:28.700]  they won't produce the actual certificate they say no it's a certificate of live birth is there
[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:34.140]  something in the actual original birth certificate that they're saying okay well the birth certificate
[02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:40.060]  it's real but you can't see it may not be the fact that he uh i i exactly they're hiding something
[02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:44.460]  in the past i believe he was born in hawaii the state senator says he believes he was born in hawaii
[02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:50.460]  certainly knew the grandparents he he probably knew them well enough to know that the that barack obama
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:55.660]  was born in hawaii and now we have this issue with the social security number that was issued uh to
[02:37:55.660 --> 02:38:01.020]  president obama it was not a hawaii issued social security number it was issued in the state of
[02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:06.140]  connecticut this is the social security number he used on a selective service registration form
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:12.700]  he used it on other forms and it's 0 4 2 xx because of privacy we don't know 4 4 2 5 it was
[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:20.300]  previously held by an individual died in 18 i was born i should say in 1890 and uh had died and
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:26.700]  the number was reissued in the state of connecticut to president uh um uh president obama in the uh
[02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:34.140]  late 90s president satara president sataro sabarca you know whatever um i i think i again i think
[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:39.660]  there's other avenues that have not been looked at what we know is his records are being covered up
[02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:44.620]  like nothing we've ever seen we know he gave up citizenship to be indonesian we know they've
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:50.620]  been covering things up and so yes they love to say aha birth certificate and then his wife gives
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:57.020]  all these speeches years ago about he went back to his home country of kenya uh what do you think's
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:39:03.420]  going on here i i again he uh obama said he was going to run the most transparent administration
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:08.860]  in the history of the country even on his own background he's been totally opaque he has not
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:14.220]  been transparent he's not been transparent on other issues as well but if he can't be transparent
[02:39:14.220 --> 02:39:19.980]  on his own background how can we expect him to be forthcoming on other issues having to do with
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:24.620]  the economy the intelligence community surveillance programs and everything what does your gut tell
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:29.580]  you i mean you think he was born in hawaii i i believe he was born in hawaii but i do believe
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:36.060]  had he may have opted for an indonesian passport because lolo sataro adopted him we also know
[02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:40.860]  we know he changed his name right and we know he changed his name we also know that lolo sataro
[02:39:40.860 --> 02:39:46.780]  adopted another uh little girl at the time who was about the same age as obama she claimed that uh
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:54.620]  uh she was obama's step sister but the uh this other step sister of obama uh eng sataro or sataro
[02:39:54.620 --> 02:40:01.020]  eng says oh that woman was a charlatan she uh was no uh she was not adopted and there was a tranny
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:05.660]  nanny and this is a weird group well and that and this uh supposed to have sister died a couple
[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:10.860]  years ago we don't know what she died of obviously uh it was an old age because she's the same age as
[02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:18.060]  obama then we have the nanny tranny that uh raised obama in jacardo uh who went by the name turdy uh
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:22.700]  that individual apparently is still alive but when that information came out in a movie made in
[02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:29.260]  indonesia last year there was this like pushback against uh the producers of the film saying oh
[02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:35.100]  there there this was a fictional character there was no such uh the transsexual nanny but now we
[02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:41.820]  know that there was a transsexual nanny so every on almost at every turn we find out that the obama
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:48.780]  administration and he uh is not forthcoming and something he should know totally about his own
[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:54.380]  background more and more becomes clear they put obama in knowing he had all this baggage knowing
[02:40:54.380 --> 02:41:00.140]  that they could blackmail him and control him but also as a way to claim it was hope and change
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:04.700]  but as a way to create division amongst the american people so we would fight with each
[02:41:04.700 --> 02:41:09.420]  other instead of going after the private fellow reserve absolutely and you know this
[02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:14.140]  and you know looking at the streets in washington now i can say something about his hope there
[02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:19.340]  was a lot more people out on the streets asking for change uh i've never seen so many homeless
[02:41:19.340 --> 02:41:24.300]  people even when reagan turned them out of the mental institutions when he cut back funding
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:29.180]  uh and we had all the homelessness when mitch snider was big with his movement in the 1980s
[02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:33.740]  it was nothing compared because when i'm what we're seeing now in washington our homeless couples
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:40.780]  people in their 50s and 60s are out on the street and remember all those people at his
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:45.500]  event saying thank you mr president right after he got elected uh i'm not going to pay for my car
[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:51.500]  my house anymore and he played along with it they really thought that that ben bernack he was going
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:56.460]  to helicopter money to them or that parachutes you know with vaults wagon beetles were going to come
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:02.460]  out of the sky well i i don't think he has any uh any affinity for the people who are hurting in
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:06.860]  this country as a matter of fact let's go back to the oa campaign and and and he said something
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:11.100]  that hillary could have used as a campaign issue but didn't he said when they were talking about the
[02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:15.660]  price of food was going out when the price of gas was going up he said yes uh michelle and i noticed
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:21.340]  that the price of arugula was uh very high now who eats arugula in south chicago except for that
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:26.380]  tiny community in hide park around the university of chicago uh hillary didn't use it but that was
[02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:32.780]  almost george bush and the and the store scanner moment uh it showed that he was totally obama
[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:39.580]  out of touch with society arugula i mean you know people in south chicago uh can't afford
[02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:46.380]  arugula even if they knew what it was yeah they're eating rice and beans absolutely absolutely and
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:50.860]  they're you know and now many people can't eat even the staples anymore because the price of food
[02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:55.580]  is skyrocket and meanwhile geithner comes out today and says we have a strong dollar and strong
[02:42:55.580 --> 02:43:00.940]  dollar policy when they know their policy of monetization of debt is causing it to be devalued
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:07.900]  oh absolutely i'm out look again this gets back you know tennessee geithner's father peter geithner
[02:43:07.900 --> 02:43:13.900]  was uh obama's mother's boss at the ford foundation she spent a lot of time in new york we don't know
[02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:18.940]  what she was doing in new york but she was there at a time when the ford foundation was laundering
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:26.060]  a lot of money for the cia uh for various programs we do know that uh obama's mother spoke javanese
[02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:31.260]  and we know that when she was in new york there was a uh an attempt to assassinate the president of
[02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:36.700]  surinam who's back in as president and obama has already signaled he won't do anything have anything
[02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:42.540]  to do with this guy again as he hold these grudges like he might hold against qaddafi uh was his
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:49.180]  mother involved in the attempt by the cia to oust desi burter say in surinam in 1986 she was in
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:54.220]  new york working for ford spoke javanese she would have been a hot commodity for the cia in that year
[02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:59.340]  and yesterday you went through the incredible intelligence agency connections of his entire
[02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:04.700]  family oh there there's there's more there than meets the eye i was recently told that uh
[02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:09.900]  we know that president obama's mother was in pakistan she was indonesia she traveled to philippines
[02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:14.300]  with the asian development bank and the other fronts that she worked for but she was also in
[02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:21.740]  the country of gana in in the night in 19 uh the the mid uh in 1980s what was she doing there obama
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:27.500]  hasn't said anything about her time in gana but we know that uh in nineteen in 1987 when she was
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:33.740]  supposedly in the in in gana the country to the north her president was assassinated in the cia
[02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:39.580]  coup thomas sankara who was who was really the hugo chavez of africa he said we're gonna we're gonna
[02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:43.740]  pull out of the world bank we're gonna pull out of the imf we're tired of these western banks telling
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:49.420]  us what to do and he was assassinated a dear a mommy dearest seemed to have been in an awful lot
[02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:56.460]  of places where the cia was conducting activities and she seemed to have the credentials uh to
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:45:01.580]  be in those places uh and then they try to say she was some hippie flower child uh you know just
[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:07.260]  the free spirit and trying to help poor people get microloans i'm not buying it i i think the
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:12.140]  the evidence speaks for itself we got a little bit into it but you want to say anything more about
[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:19.820]  this uh new uh leaker case that you were just mentioning uh yes tom uh tom tam was a justice
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:26.540]  department prosecutor whose father was a career fbi uh agent worked under jagra hoover he uh was the
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:31.260]  person who leaked the information about this illegal stellar wind remember stellar wind was
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:36.700]  itself a classified term a handful of people in the bush administration knew about it he leaked
[02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:42.460]  the information and uh they stormed into his home with a swat team took his kids computers took their
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:46.940]  christmas card mailing list well the justice department just dropped its investigation of
[02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:54.540]  tom tam but again how does he get his reputation back who's going to pay for uh his legal expenses
[02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:58.460]  you're supposed to leak information if it's illegal absolutely national security doesn't
[02:45:58.460 --> 02:46:04.780]  project crime well we have tom drake who leaked information about massive corruption in contracts
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:09.180]  at the national security agency his agency his trial starts in baltimore very soon he's being
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:14.700]  charged under the espionage act of 17 1917 four people in the history of this country have been
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:19.420]  charged with that well if they're dropping the charges against tom tam why aren't they dropping
[02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:24.780]  the charges against um tom drake and while they're at it they can drop the charges against bradley
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:29.580]  manning because there is no way he could have made up off with over a quarter million cables
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:35.900]  on a lady lady gaga cd that is that is just a made up story in my opinion it didn't happen
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:41.180]  but uh obama like uh nixon with charles manson said oh he's guilty uh he committed a crime
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:47.900]  well it's it boggles the mind how they've been torturing bradley manning you know naked in a
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:53.260]  freezing cell when obviously a private isn't going to have three decades of secret cables
[02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:56.460]  from multiple different agencies the army doesn't have that
[02:46:57.260 --> 02:47:01.660]  bottom line what do you think wiki leaks because they put out some good info but some stuff that
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:06.780]  makes it look like kind of a soros operation uh you work for the nsa you know you've worked as a
[02:47:06.780 --> 02:47:11.900]  journalist at all different levels what's the word in dc what what is wiki leaks it's it's
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:18.780]  class it's a classic uh um uh good cop bad cop type thing uh it's so much information has been
[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:23.740]  released the newspapers the corporate papers went ahead and redacted some of these cables
[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:29.260]  after they consulted with the state department uh if you're going to do that there's always a chance
[02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:34.220]  that these cables have been manipulated altered in some respect we know the history of the bush
[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:39.180]  administration with altering intelligence you know yellow cake uranium from nigeria and they're all
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:46.940]  and uh major politicians taking money from saddam hussein for the oil for food program
[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:50.780]  and these documents that were supposedly found in the rubble and bagdad had been
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:55.500]  doctored with whiteout i mean not even a good job at doing it so we know their history of these
[02:47:55.500 --> 02:48:03.820]  neocons i suspect that uh the cables that were released uh about tunisia egypt syria yemen pakistan
[02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:11.260]  other countries have probably been highly altered uh to to bring pressure to bear on these governments
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:15.180]  to well it's in men of the state department's trying to destabilize the middle east right and
[02:48:15.180 --> 02:48:20.540]  then we you know and then we have some uh information it comes out about uh one al-qaeda guy was an
[02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:26.620]  mi-six uh operative well you got to put this the good stuff in there to make the other leaks
[02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:31.740]  look well that's what i was about to bring up ap roiders sky television all reporting al-qaeda
[02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:37.180]  bomber worked for uk intelligence and they go and admit the documents are real and that he was
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:43.260]  an british intel guy out commanding al-qaeda forces same story with the seven seven bombing
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:48.860]  with a swat same story with and we're all the locky running the underwear bombing the time square
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:54.860]  i mean why why would fox news be given a pentagon document and then the pentagon go yeah that's
[02:48:54.860 --> 02:49:00.940]  true are they almost inoculating this in case it comes out later that that that i mean ben laden
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:05.820]  literally is a hand puppet for the globalist well they may be or they may be it may be like a straw
[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:12.140]  man they're putting out there to get it out there so they can control uh the reaction rather than uh
[02:49:12.140 --> 02:49:16.620]  have a have a have a look that's what i meant titrate the dust i think so and and look we we
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:20.860]  got to go back to what british farms the former british foreign secretary robin cook said that
[02:49:20.860 --> 02:49:26.620]  al-qaeda was nothing more than a cia database it meant the base it meant a database of all these
[02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:31.980]  arab's egyptian Saudis that were used in the war against the soviet union and he died suddenly
[02:49:31.980 --> 02:49:37.420]  of a heart attack after making these revelations robin cook as foreign secretary was also in charge
[02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:44.620]  of mi six uh and he was in charge of the british nsa the gchq he would have known why why did dr
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:48.300]  david kelly the head inspector go public and say they've told me they're going to kill me and put
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:53.900]  me in the woods and they did it why would uh why would the former head of the mi six why did he go
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:58.620]  public i mean they've got to know what's going to happen to him i think robin cook realized what a
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:05.420]  treasonous person tony blair was he he resigned from the blair government and then he went public
[02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:09.660]  on the word is he was mad about a murder in kelly right and the word is we had a leak of
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:16.460]  information about spying on the un uh from a gchq a person named kathryn gunne and uh
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:21.900]  they never prosecuted her because the word is that people like robin cook and claire short who
[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:27.820]  would also resign from the blair administration probably encouraged that leak to to just point
[02:50:27.820 --> 02:50:34.700]  out that tony blair was just a lying uh deceptive the word is he was the same as obama he kept tabs
[02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:40.460]  on the leftist in college for mi five oh absolutely and uh and and tony blair look oh at the minute
[02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:46.620]  clinton leaves office he's running over here to hug uh george w push the guy's a total chameleon
[02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:52.860]  he's um you know i mean uh but people like by the way they're talking about him for EU president
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:58.700]  or swarzenegger which is perfect because it's an unelected position so so we'll talk about that with

[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:31.340]  uh people in london mosque that's what the guantanamo torture shows actually what it shows
[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:36.940]  is that they torture people there for two three four five years and then release them and they
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:43.100]  end up being the commanders of the rebel forces in places like libya and from our bilterberg
[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:48.300]  sources uh through jim tucker that approved me very accurate they were beside themselves at a
[02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:53.820]  trilateral commission meeting last week uh that first the stanford review tried to deny he was at
[02:54:53.820 --> 02:54:57.500]  that meeting and then they had to correct well i guess he was at a trilateral meeting in that
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:03.260]  neighborhood okay but still you know this this alex jones report isn't true uh but to make a long
[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:10.220]  story short um the globalist are hopping mad that the la times and others reported that indeed
[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:15.740]  al qaeda is the main force of the quote good guys in libya i mean how much more obvious does this
[02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:22.700]  have to get wane i mean we have so much ample evidence uh that al qaeda is just uh basically
[02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:29.420]  run but has been run uh by the cia and its affiliate agencies around the world australia
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:35.500]  britain uh other countries i you know i don't know how much more evidence uh people need to
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:42.940]  know that this is a fake organization it it was created for the whole purpose of uh bringing
[02:55:42.940 --> 02:55:50.060]  about amongst other things the patriot act here in similar uh acts and laws in other countries uh
[02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:55.420]  the mere fact of what we have to travel like we do now uh when i left uh reagan yesterday i
[02:55:56.140 --> 02:56:01.420]  i had to go through the the millimeter wave detection i never uh take my wallet out and
[02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:05.100]  the guy says what's in your pocket i said my wallet is give me that wallet you know well
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:09.260]  you know i i'm not used to giving it's all prisoner training line up give me that exactly
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:14.460]  and then they insisted on winding my hands and checking it uh in some machine and and you know
[02:56:14.460 --> 02:56:19.180]  what he says okay you can go now it's training you that you're bad you're a prisoner it's taking
[02:56:19.180 --> 02:56:25.580]  normal law-abiding people and giving us prisoner training absolutely i mean i i remember when you
[02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:29.820]  didn't have to go through a magnetometer when you went to the airport you could go to your plane
[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:34.620]  you know with 15 minutes to spare you got a better chance of being killed by a honeybee i pulled up
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:39.340]  the numbers than by an al-qaeda terrorist i mean since when do they i mean even if you don't think
[02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:42.300]  the government's behind the terror folks and they're behind almost all of it there is some real
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:48.060]  organic the way they oh it's going to get you oh man oh it's so scary don't worry we're going to take
[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:52.060]  all your rights away and launch a bunch of wars and make trillions of bucks and then we get the
[02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:57.900]  internal maya homeland security reports it's all about landowners gun owners anti-war libertarian
[02:56:57.900 --> 02:57:02.620]  ron paul grips this is all about the american people well remember the instituted airport
[02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:07.500]  checks because of the planes being hijacked to cuba and and what were we exposed to oh these
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:12.460]  people are hijacking planes to cuba because they're all in bed with fidel castro like castro
[02:57:12.460 --> 02:57:18.380]  you know plan the whole operation uh again that that sounds like that even those original hijackings

[02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:09.660]  because the french were talking about maybe maybe making some deal with the palestinian

[03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:34.140]  retransmission with bill still and a breakdown of the geopolitical developments that are taking
[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:38.780]  place right now and the fact that the mainstream media is losing all credibility very very quickly
[03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:45.100]  and imploding on itself but you had one other development on the obama front that's important
[03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:52.700]  well recently there was a hearing in the u.s. district court in washington dc an individual
[03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:59.500]  sued larry sinclair he wrote a book about obama in chicago claimed that he had two sexual
[03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:09.180]  trips with obama in 1999 did did cocaine with obama the law firm that represented the plaintiff
[03:01:09.180 --> 03:01:13.660]  is patin and boggs is the most one of the most powerful law firms in washington dc
[03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:20.860]  let's figure about 700 to 800 dollar an hour law firm so they were used to sue larry sinclair
[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:28.380]  and also his booksellers amazon barnes and noble and books a million judge leon threw out that
[03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:34.860]  lawsuit against the booksellers the suit against larry sinclair is still being deliberated upon
[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:40.620]  but it was quite interesting i i and only one other journalist my colleague andrew craig
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:43.820]  we're sitting in that courtroom nobody from the post nobody from any other
[03:01:44.380 --> 03:01:50.860]  publication we were there we we heard judge leon and deliberations asked a question well he said
[03:01:50.860 --> 03:01:55.260]  well what accusations are we making here are these the accusations against the president
[03:01:55.260 --> 03:02:01.660]  and he clearly this is now part of the official transcript in a court hearing in washington dc
[03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:07.020]  this one will not go away either we have the choir director at trinity united church of christ
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:12.860]  donald young his mother says she's now fearful of her life and that her son was fearful of his life
[03:02:12.860 --> 03:02:17.980]  it was her son that contacted larry sinclair and said i saw your youtube video about obama
[03:02:17.980 --> 03:02:24.860]  be very very careful these people are dangerous and of course uh donald young was killed gangland
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:29.740]  execution style he was on his way he wanted to go to liberia to teach school to get out of the
[03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:35.740]  united states talking about people who knew obama very well in his case maybe really very well
[03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:39.420]  wanting to get out of the country but they they nailed him and they nailed another guy from the
[03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:46.460]  church a guy named larry bland so we have two two people winding up dead right out of trinity
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:52.220]  united church of christ these people i do believe i mean business when they issue for threats issue
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:59.980]  for threats but you don't you weren't told why you've been through an embassy a foreign embassy
[03:02:59.980 --> 03:03:05.180]  in a major news publication been told the white house once you dead uh and you say well you know
[03:03:05.180 --> 03:03:11.580]  figuratively and they said no literally you're just guessing it's the cia background but i mean it
[03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:17.180]  it it may be that you're digging around into his sexual escapades that that could be and certainly
[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:22.380]  that but that has been also the subject of the tabloids they've covered that extensively the globe
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:29.660]  has written about that i think because they control chicago and they control it very well
[03:03:29.660 --> 03:03:35.020]  they can deal with that what they probably can't deal with is they don't have their fingers everywhere
[03:03:35.020 --> 03:03:39.180]  as much as they might want to think they do i don't think they can deal with indonesia i don't
[03:03:39.180 --> 03:03:44.460]  think they can deal with the mother's background in pakistan hawaii the high power people coming
[03:03:44.460 --> 03:03:48.860]  out saying no he's a he was born here just from the he has a different name he's a different person
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:55.260]  right i i've even heard from uh one uh fairly reputable source that maybe obama's real father
[03:03:55.260 --> 03:04:02.540]  was a cuban who uh when uh his uh a mother was taken by her father to cuban i'll tell you i've
[03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:06.940]  looked at his dad he looks nothing like his supposed absolutely and i mean he looks nothing
[03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:11.820]  there is no there is absolutely no resemblance uh one could say that the resemblance would be
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:17.100]  more fitting of somebody who might have been an afro cuban uh or somebody from one of the more
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:23.820]  hemitic tribes of uh the the horn of africa and kenya or or a neighboring country but certainly
[03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:29.260]  not somebody who was a member of the luo tribe because they are a bantu tribe and obama just
[03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:35.420]  does not have any of the bantu features i mean his dad looks nothing like him absolutely nothing
[03:04:35.420 --> 03:04:42.300]  there there is absolutely no resemblance and i this comes from people from africa who are you
[03:04:42.300 --> 03:04:47.500]  know the tribes from uganda and kenya they look at the father they think that this can't be this
[03:04:47.500 --> 03:04:52.700]  they can't be his father they they know this because they this is their this is their continent and
[03:04:52.700 --> 03:04:57.340]  in their region they know uh know these things about the people it's almost like if you had two
[03:04:57.340 --> 03:05:06.380]  black people and they had a redheaded kid i mean it just doesn't a wangray job
