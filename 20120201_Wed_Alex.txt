[09:37.080 --> 09:41.400]  scientific dictatorship and if you want to be a real man you need to wake up to
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.080]  that fact and a lot of you are awake but you're like well I'm scared of the
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.320]  system what is this thing with fear why do people love it I'm afraid of being
[09:51.320 --> 09:59.080]  afraid you understand I am such a coward I want to explain this this is something
[09:59.080 --> 10:03.800]  I've been trying to articulate to myself I am such a coward that I'm afraid of
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.920]  being afraid I am so afraid of giving in and being into fear that I am fearless
[10:09.920 --> 10:18.800]  I will not be part of this I will not grovel you understand that you've got
[10:18.800 --> 10:25.160]  to laugh at this it is a mind game it is a mind trick it is a joke to serve this
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.080]  new world order it is so clownish that they've got cops all over the country
[10:29.080 --> 10:32.440]  standing around in black outfits and black helmets with machine guns and
[10:32.440 --> 10:36.080]  police chiefs on record have said it's to scare the public it's not to make you
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.720]  feel safe it is a joke when the TSA tries to intimidate you it is a joke when
[10:41.720 --> 10:45.000]  city council people act arrogant at you like they don't care what you're saying
[10:45.000 --> 10:53.400]  it is a joke all of this is meant to break you and train you to be a slave not
[10:53.400 --> 10:57.960]  even in an average North Korean town do they have checkpoints and people being
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.040]  grubbed just if anybody reports you for anything you disappear into a black
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.160]  hole and it's a culture of groveling and licking the boots of the system only
[11:08.160 --> 11:13.200]  here now do people pull up at highway checkpoints randomly set up and are
[11:13.200 --> 11:21.240]  searched just just just thoroughbred oozing stinking criminality oozing
[11:21.240 --> 11:26.600]  stinking criminality with the government sticking their hands down
[11:26.600 --> 11:32.560]  people's pants all of this smart meters you know ten years ago it's a conspiracy
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.560]  the San Francisco Chronicles said that these will track your power usage and
[11:37.560 --> 11:43.240]  will control your power and the engineers from the companies went public got fired
[11:43.240 --> 11:47.160]  it all started in California and in London England in every case I've been
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.780]  at events where whistleblowers have actually come and the the integrated
[11:51.780 --> 11:56.960]  circuits all of it has algorithm systems that track power usage and even know
[11:56.960 --> 12:01.040]  the signature of a certain brand of blender washing machine everything
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.240]  because it's all been encoded in an industrial program against humanity I
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.560]  had Stalman you know the inventor of free software on just a few weeks ago and
[12:09.560 --> 12:14.360]  he was pointing out it's totally shut up as a corporate conspiracy of course they
[12:14.360 --> 12:17.600]  laughed at us and said oh it doesn't exist then about five years later they're
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.200]  like well we actually are gonna start charging you more when you use too much
[12:21.200 --> 12:25.040]  power with a smart meter and it is tracking everything you do and now
[12:25.040 --> 12:28.640]  they're coming out with new appliances that actually have chips that tie into
[12:28.640 --> 12:32.760]  the power with data over it and now they're going to control the light bulbs
[12:32.760 --> 12:39.240]  in your house the new fluorescence by law and actually with burst systems
[12:39.240 --> 12:43.440]  burst communications communicate and commandeer your computers source
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.200]  associated press guess where they're already testing it police stations
[12:47.200 --> 12:52.120]  across the United States started Minnesota now it's moved to many other
[12:52.120 --> 12:58.880]  states and cities Minneapolis first city I mean it is so incredible that we
[12:58.880 --> 13:04.280]  just let the major corporations under globalist banker control six mega banks
[13:04.280 --> 13:10.120]  less than 100 mega cores under them bigger than most countries assassins
[13:10.120 --> 13:20.240]  spy groups swallow prostitute sex control ops you name it I mean it is just off
[13:20.240 --> 13:27.040]  the charts what they've got now and it is all just rolling with our money our
[13:27.040 --> 13:32.960]  energy all going into a panopticon surveillance grid where everything is
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.160]  automated and controlled by the central technocrats that's what I've called
[13:37.160 --> 13:39.880]  them for decades that's what they now call themselves because of their own
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.800]  documents going back to the 70s and 50s and 30s they call themselves
[13:44.800 --> 13:50.800]  technocrats 1970 books a big new brzezinski he admits the globalist run
[13:50.800 --> 13:56.080]  organized crime he admits they run mass murder in Cambodia you know he admits in
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.560]  all these books he writes that they've set up a global technocrat system that
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.120]  they were going to have it built and he even lists the very time we're living
[14:05.120 --> 14:10.920]  in now where there'll be the entire Air Force drone combat robots on the ground
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.040]  total control and they've already got all the ground robots they just know
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.240]  that that's really going to freak people out and they're not going to roll those
[14:18.240 --> 14:22.800]  out until the next stage terror attack and then there'll be robots are watching
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.280]  with their infrared even at night and they do have weapon systems they're
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.800]  just now rolling out robots with tasers and things they use the non-lethal stuff
[14:30.800 --> 14:36.920]  to get you psychologically to to begin to see the police attack you with
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.640]  tasers and tear gas then they up the power of the taser up the power of the
[14:40.640 --> 14:45.240]  tear gas and the billy club strikes and the arrest for no reason and police said
[14:45.240 --> 14:49.960]  a month ago balling up is now assaulting and resisting so felony charges if you
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.200]  even raise your arm when they're just cracking your brains out that's an evil
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.000]  just just overturning logic overturning every form of checks and balance and
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.560]  decency and everything good and wholesome pure evil now I'm gonna get into a
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.720]  sod in Syria I ran all of that what happened in Florida where that's going
[15:10.720 --> 15:17.920]  S&P warns a further rate downgrade for the US it's coming CNBC housing prices
[15:17.920 --> 15:26.600]  hit post bubble low is a threatens holder with contempt they got the dirt on
[15:26.600 --> 15:29.480]  this so that's why they don't even fund somebody to run for Congress unless they
[15:29.480 --> 15:32.360]  slipped through like Ron Paul as they've got all the car theft records on them
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.300]  like yes you didn't know about that I learned something every day Wayne
[15:36.300 --> 15:38.720]  Madsen told me about that yesterday on the nightly news and I went and looked
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.160]  it up and it was just constant records and investigations and indictments for
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.160]  car theft all over the United States military base robberies everything else
[15:47.160 --> 15:52.920]  I mean this is when the guy was older I mean that's who runs this country I'm
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.000]  sorry it's just unbelievable and then he started one of the first big anti theft
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.720]  alarm companies that's where he made all his money problem reaction solution I
[16:04.720 --> 16:12.000]  mean tyranny translated is ruled by criminals and not just criminals you're
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.880]  lucky if you get a tyranny where it's just criminals who just want power just
[16:15.880 --> 16:22.240]  want money it's usually ruled by psychos that's why they build the same
[16:22.240 --> 16:28.800]  structures the black uniform the surveillance the spy the Trojan and
[16:28.800 --> 16:35.840]  their fruits are raping your daughter poisoning your water enslaving your
[16:35.840 --> 16:41.800]  society destroying your job because they want you in the ditch they want you in
[16:41.800 --> 16:47.360]  the ditch so poor uneducated can't read can't write and don't know how to defend
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.960]  yourself and unarmed so they can have their way and they are gonna have it
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.600]  good now one cannot even cover one of these articles without giving you a
[16:57.600 --> 17:00.880]  little bit of background because when I see an article about a guy at a famous
[17:00.880 --> 17:07.600]  off-the-leash dog walking park that I've been to in California and they walk

[24:33.640 --> 24:38.720]  like any other human I've seen it when they knock the peaceful girl off the
[24:38.720 --> 24:44.200]  bicycle clubbing her in the head like wild gorillas and then charge her with
[24:44.200 --> 24:50.640]  a crime I see it and and and I see them taser people with pleasure for no reason
[24:50.640 --> 24:55.680]  and get off on it and I watch the video of them try to set up a veteran in
[24:55.680 --> 25:02.840]  Austin and then not release their own squad car video I see it and it's just a
[25:02.840 --> 25:10.320]  manifestation of the overall corruption but look at this park ranger story you
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.120]  know I was at the Grand Canyon in my RV out investigating things a few months
[25:14.120 --> 25:18.720]  ago and we took a wrong turn at the Grand Canyon and we're turning around just a
[25:18.720 --> 25:26.600]  little turnaround area and this lights turned on park ranger woman jumped out
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.720]  of the car ran over sort of banging on the door I opened it up and she said
[25:31.720 --> 25:36.280]  what are you doing and where who are you where are you from and I was just like
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.840]  well we just took a wrong turn you parked the RVs down that road and we're
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.280]  like well it's nighttime it's raining we just took a wrong turn and she was just
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.200]  all pumped and crazy these are all people that were either bullies when
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.920]  they were kids or they got beat up a lot and they're just all crazed and they
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.200]  watch TV all day and they think everybody's out to get them I mean I've
[25:57.200 --> 26:00.800]  seen the newscast in Tennessee and other states I talk about this a lot we've
[26:00.800 --> 26:04.800]  aired the newscast here where it shows families whole highway shut down pulling
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.840]  into these checkpoints with state police and army and Marine Corps National
[26:09.840 --> 26:16.320]  Guard they'll have MPs from the Air Force there was all in the news and TSA is
[26:16.320 --> 26:22.920]  running it and the cops are like just acting more crazed than I would do when
[26:22.920 --> 26:27.360]  I work for a large animal vet for about nine months that was rough work and then
[26:27.360 --> 26:32.240]  we got these big beef ranches and get into get into pins that would have 500
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.600]  the worst thing was wild cows cows that never even vaccinated dehorned wild
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.360]  snorting they were like basically hamburger meat cows they weren't
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.640]  quality super quality beef probably really is good beef leaner the whole
[26:43.640 --> 26:47.280]  grass-fed and they be snorting and ramming and they explained early on
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.800]  you got to have total confidence that they're gonna attack you and so you get
[26:50.800 --> 26:54.360]  in there with that cattle prod and you're just and you have to believe it the
[26:54.360 --> 26:58.880]  minute you don't believe it they come after you and the times point is you're
[26:58.880 --> 27:01.680]  running them trying to force them it's really hard when you first get in there's
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.200]  500 and then you get them down to you know they're all tires only 100 or so
[27:05.200 --> 27:08.120]  that haven't gone through the shoot they got electric dehorners hacking their
[27:08.120 --> 27:11.960]  horns off giving them shots sometimes branding them the nauseous smell of
[27:11.960 --> 27:17.960]  burning flesh and fur and everything I don't know why I digressed off of that
[27:17.960 --> 27:24.560]  story there was a point to me getting into working there and seeing that oh
[27:24.560 --> 27:31.880]  yeah the cops act more crazed than cowboys in pins with giant animals that
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.800]  want to kill you I mean they're just like huh huh huh huh huh huh while the car
[27:36.800 --> 27:41.880]  I mean you're mentally ill your brains are the size of walnuts it's pathetic
[27:41.880 --> 27:45.520]  you're under this fantasy land because you go home and watch cop shows all day
[27:45.520 --> 27:48.560]  it's well-known cops do this and fantasize where they're the good guys
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.240]  and terrorists are everywhere and people are trying to kill them everywhere the
[27:52.240 --> 27:55.440]  number one cause of death is hanging your butt out in the highway when you're
[27:55.440 --> 27:58.640]  writing tickets and they finally nationwide are stopping that and
[27:58.640 --> 28:06.320]  coming up on the passenger side walnut brains okay and the general public or
[28:06.320 --> 28:11.040]  walnut brains too you've got a big brain but you only use a walnut portion of
[28:11.040 --> 28:15.400]  it I've already digressed I just can't even handle it anymore this is a
[28:15.400 --> 28:20.040]  total hoax all of this is a hoax it's not the law to take take vaccine so
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.040]  they're trying to make it the law because people are waking up it is not the law
[28:25.040 --> 28:28.760]  that you got to have Florida water and so cities are passing laws to kick the
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.200]  lobbyist out and get it out of the water so the states are passing laws well
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.280]  your laws are a fraud and you're assaulting people you criminal scum
[28:36.280 --> 28:40.920]  and it's not just sodium fluoride seven-fold increase in bone cancer and
[28:40.920 --> 28:44.560]  brain damage and all this they add hundreds of other chemicals with it like
[28:44.560 --> 28:50.440]  lead arsenic and mercury you filthy degenerate scumbag city councils who
[28:50.440 --> 28:55.720]  are assaulting everyone I live in the country now in well water but let me tell

[29:15.640 --> 29:21.440]  last night we had a piece McBreen did where he showed the cigarette ads saying
[29:21.440 --> 29:25.720]  doctors say smoke cigarettes and now doctors say aspartame is good will you
[29:25.720 --> 29:30.120]  ask him to get that transferred over immediately I want to play that here the
[29:30.120 --> 29:37.800]  point is the point is you are assaulting me okay it isn't funny you're

[29:41.680 --> 29:45.240]  doing this to us okay so that's why I'm there that's one of about a thousand

[34:03.400 --> 34:11.040]  knowingly put chemical weapons in our food the aspartame is E. coli feces and
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.920]  a chemical weapon that's highly addictive a neurotoxin all of this is
[34:15.920 --> 34:24.920]  going on this is how real all of this is this is how hard core and I see
[34:24.920 --> 34:31.240]  everywhere a militarized internal army class of swarms of agencies and
[34:31.240 --> 34:37.080]  bureaucrats looking at the public and treating us like trash and garbage and
[34:37.080 --> 34:42.560]  the enemy the bankers have hijacked America they've declared war on the
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.920]  people with the NDAA and Northcom and they are training us to be prisoners
[34:47.920 --> 34:52.040]  and training us to have them put their hands on us and training us to have our
[34:52.040 --> 34:57.240]  children taken away government is compartmentalized at the bottom you've
[34:57.240 --> 35:02.080]  got a bunch of well-meaning do-gooders on average who are following the fantasy
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.040]  land of TV and what they believe they're really doing above them you've got
[35:06.040 --> 35:11.480]  sociopaths and control freaks and just mercenaries and above that you've got
[35:11.480 --> 35:15.120]  actual conscious criminals that understand their level of the scam and
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.520]  above that you've got master think tank integrator criminals and then above
[35:19.520 --> 35:24.080]  that you've got the mega directors and above that you've got a handful of
[35:24.080 --> 35:30.600]  families who are totally given over to evil you couldn't be or you couldn't
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.520]  serve this system this is a system built by testing and developing and
[35:36.520 --> 35:43.320]  intermarrying the greatest forms of intelligent black power black evil
[35:43.320 --> 35:53.720]  hell force Satan's spirit the energy of pure death you understand it seeks
[35:53.720 --> 36:00.520]  destruction that is its beauty that is its rainbow that is its light that is
[36:00.520 --> 36:07.720]  its ether that is its essence that is its end game that is its very existence
[36:07.720 --> 36:13.480]  that's what it does and I am here conscious seeing the plan that's
[36:13.480 --> 36:18.440]  cartoonishly obvious at the grassroots level I mean just the basics that
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.280]  freedom is being destroyed foreign banks are robbing us world government's
[36:22.280 --> 36:28.720]  being set up that's all confirmed do you know that you've seen nothing yet that
[36:28.720 --> 36:34.520]  that this time we're in will be remembered as heavenly if we don't
[36:34.520 --> 36:39.000]  turn this around they're now and I told you this a decade ago announcing
[36:39.000 --> 36:46.200]  laboratories hundreds of them with level four bio weapons in them that kill
[36:46.200 --> 36:50.840]  over 90% of those that come in contact I know I talk about this every day the
[36:50.840 --> 36:54.440]  fact that they're announcing it and telling you it's probably going to get
[36:54.440 --> 37:00.120]  out is them creating the false memory so when they announce it was an accident
[37:00.120 --> 37:05.880]  or they announced domestic groups got in and released it you'll buy that because
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.760]  you've already heard it it's a gal lighter it's a ground prepare they're
[37:11.760 --> 37:19.600]  preparing your mental soil they're pre-programming and for someone who lives
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.520]  this and who has proven through my think tank operation that I know what
[37:23.520 --> 37:29.200]  they're doing I'm sitting here watching a giant boa constrictor coil around our
[37:29.200 --> 37:33.360]  society and tell us it's doing it to protect us from al-qaeda when al-qaeda
[37:33.360 --> 37:39.400]  publicly works for NATO on record Libya everywhere else Syria Iran everywhere
[37:39.400 --> 37:44.840]  blowing everything up and is used again as the skeleton key to open every door
[37:44.840 --> 37:50.680]  to take our rights away I'm watching the horror I see the articles every day
[37:50.680 --> 37:55.880]  people dying from being hit with electro shock lethal weapons they're
[37:55.880 --> 37:59.800]  actually called less lethal in the book for public consumption they call them
[37:59.800 --> 38:04.680]  non-lethal and you notice they've upped the power twice now the deaths are
[38:04.680 --> 38:11.360]  increasing there they it's all incremental now I'm going to give the
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.240]  number out and I'll definitely get the calls in the next hour maybe even this
[38:15.240 --> 38:18.920]  hour but I'm just it's just it's just it's just all coming home here folks and
[38:18.920 --> 38:24.240]  we need to really break with the system and break with its lies and really see
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.560]  it for what it is most people even in the media aren't bad most people in the
[38:28.560 --> 38:34.160]  police the military aren't bad vector good most people are good but they're
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.000]  deceived and they play along because they believe what they're being told we
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.880]  are financing not just our own enslavement but a giant technological
[38:43.880 --> 38:49.560]  factories totally replacing humans robots building robots official Pentagon no
[38:49.560 --> 38:54.520]  more ground troops no more nothing disenfranchising humans
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.600]  emasculating humans just like calculators of age where people can't even do
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.920]  basic math I'm not saying the calculator is bad itself we need to control
[39:03.920 --> 39:09.800]  technology not let a technocratic elite build its architecture that we pay for
[39:09.800 --> 39:16.840]  in taxes and our purchases to build in backdoor Trojan horse systems that
[39:16.840 --> 39:24.120]  control us we need to understand we shape the planet we shape the architecture
[39:24.120 --> 39:32.640]  we are involved as men not just passive people that just live here and accept
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.480]  whatever that programming television assaults us with the controllers hate
[39:37.480 --> 39:41.600]  us they write books about how they want to kill us they write books about how
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.480]  great it is done plug grandma how great torture is how good it is to get rid of
[39:45.480 --> 39:49.540]  the Bill of Rights Newsweek Time Magazine every cop movie I see like
[39:49.540 --> 39:53.760]  law-abiding citizen the Constitution is the problem robots are killing people
[39:53.760 --> 39:59.320]  all of this to checkpoints on highways men in black uniforms everywhere just
[39:59.320 --> 40:03.640]  conditioning the sheeple conditioning the sheeple do you like being conditioned
[40:03.640 --> 40:07.000]  do you like being laughed at you like the controllers thinking you're pathetic
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.160]  you debating Romney Genrich and all this it's all rearranging debt chairs on the
[40:13.160 --> 40:20.040]  Titanic winning in this system if you don't overthrow the paradigm is losing
[40:20.040 --> 40:24.880]  you could have a trillion dollars and go with this system you're a loser you
[40:24.880 --> 40:29.880]  can have nothing but wake people up and help humanity and build things that are
[40:29.880 --> 40:39.440]  decent and you are in the shadow of God you gotta decide ladies and gentlemen
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.000]  which side of this year on that's all I can tell you because because more and
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.120]  more I see the full design of this and thank God I woke up thank God I didn't
[40:50.120 --> 40:54.520]  fall to evil like so many others or corruption or decadence and I'm not
[40:54.520 --> 41:00.700]  perfect by a long shot my sins are great but thank God my heart is with God
[41:00.700 --> 41:07.240]  thank God at my core I'm a good person thank God for that because the curse of
[41:07.240 --> 41:15.640]  those that have been seduced from birth into corruption is a prison that in and
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.840]  in a a commitment to evil and a commitment to bondage and servitude and
[41:22.840 --> 41:32.400]  pain and humiliation that is such a horrible thing I even pity the
[41:32.400 --> 41:37.760]  psychopathic twisted generals of the New World Order I mean you look at them you
[41:37.760 --> 41:45.120]  can see in their eyes and their flesh the great burden they're under totally
[41:45.120 --> 41:55.040]  taken over by the God of this world you can see it oh man the way the evil
[41:55.040 --> 42:05.440]  manifest in those men like Chertoff and Napolitano Janet Napolitano and all
[42:05.440 --> 42:09.640]  their little pimp servants all so they could wear fancy suits and people open
[42:09.640 --> 42:19.080]  doors for them sell their soul for the whole world what is it profit them what
[42:19.080 --> 42:24.600]  is it profit a man and then every day I see articles like this one this came out
[42:24.600 --> 42:27.640]  a few days ago I didn't get to and then I actually reading the whole article this
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.120]  morning San Francisco Chronicle ranger zaps off leash dog walker with a shock
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.520]  weapon Hester Berg whose age is not available was arrested on suspicion of
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.520]  failing to obey a lawful order having dogs off a leash and knowingly providing
[42:40.520 --> 42:45.360]  false information he said I don't have an ID he was released did not return
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.560]  phone calls witnesses said the use of the stun gun and the arrest seemed
[42:49.560 --> 42:53.560]  excessive for someone walking two small dogs off a leash it was really scary
[42:53.560 --> 42:59.000]  said Michael Babcock who said he had seen the incident as she and her husband
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.520]  walked their two border collies I just felt so bad for him Babcock said
[43:03.520 --> 43:06.800]  Hester Berg had repeatedly asked the ranger why he was being detained she
[43:06.800 --> 43:11.360]  didn't answer him Babcock said he just tried it's not detained it's arrested
[43:11.360 --> 43:16.920]  it's an arrest it's a custodial arrest he just tried to walk away she never gave
[43:16.920 --> 43:20.680]  him a reason Babcock said the ranger shot Hester Berg in the back with a
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.480]  shock weapon as he walked off Babcock said we were into disbelief they had to
[43:25.480 --> 43:28.200]  call an ambulance for him they're so powerful now it's killing people all
[43:28.200 --> 43:34.920]  the time I got some of the autopsies here it didn't make any sense Rancho
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.880]  del terra has long been an off-the-leash walking spot for local dog owners yeah
[43:39.880 --> 43:42.320]  I've been with friends there and walked her dogs in December the area became
[43:42.320 --> 43:46.320]  part of the National Park system which requires that all dogs be on a leash
[43:46.320 --> 43:50.920]  yes not enough to have like 85% of the land out west the feds got more Levitt
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.560]  said the ranger was trying to educate residents on the rule I'm sure she did
[43:54.560 --> 44:02.040]  the Park Service is investigating the incident he said and I mean it was like
[44:02.040 --> 44:05.320]  me at the Grand Canyon we took a wrong term we're on a road we're turning
[44:05.320 --> 44:10.120]  around and lights go on she runs up bangs on the door we open it's like what

[54:35.960 --> 54:39.920]  Amendment that's torture they call it paying compliance and it was all tested
[54:39.920 --> 54:44.240]  out on pro-lifers in my film martial law there's an in the extra addendum
[54:44.240 --> 54:49.800]  there's the footage of police in the 80s and 90s breaking people's arms for
[54:49.800 --> 54:54.240]  sitting on sidewalks and you see the arms broken compound fractures big
[54:54.240 --> 54:57.960]  purple you know bones popping out bones are white when you're dead folks

[55:02.640 --> 55:05.600]  see them break a guy's arm and then cops pull a billy club over and get in a
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.120]  little psycho enjoyment because you know they dare sit out front a clinic and
[55:09.120 --> 55:11.880]  try to stop something there and I'm supposed to just think that's freedom
[55:11.880 --> 55:16.680]  all of that is coming to the general public because the foreign banks want
[55:16.680 --> 55:20.920]  you to sit there while they take your farm your ranch your business your tax
[55:20.920 --> 55:25.760]  money through taxes through regulations through property taxes and they want you
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.560]  to learn that it's normal and that it's loving and that it's a good when the
[55:31.560 --> 55:35.680]  system does it and in the system spends this it says you're being anti-cop no
[55:35.680 --> 55:41.400]  I'm anti the police being turned into an army of darkness I told you they'd use
[55:41.400 --> 55:44.600]  the military against us I've seen the training forever I told you they'd take
[55:44.600 --> 55:48.480]  guns they've done it in drills across the country and in New Orleans now
[55:48.480 --> 55:52.880]  they're saying they're gearing up for it I'm the best friend the military and
[55:52.880 --> 55:57.840]  the police will ever have because if this thing goes to a civil war I will
[55:57.840 --> 56:00.800]  guarantee it's not gonna be a cakewalk for you people aren't gonna wait in
[56:00.800 --> 56:04.920]  their houses for you to come swat team them at home once the gloves comes off
[56:04.920 --> 56:09.640]  buddy pal I just see the police are all gonna lock themselves up in their
[56:09.640 --> 56:14.080]  little armored fortresses and society's gonna collapse and nothing's gonna move
[56:14.080 --> 56:19.120]  down the roads and that's what the globalist plan in a civil war it's in
[56:19.120 --> 56:22.200]  the IMF World Bank documents that I do it in third world countries and a year
[56:22.200 --> 56:27.960]  later after the rioting and the problems people will beg for the military
[56:27.960 --> 56:32.960]  let's not go down this road let's not all be played as chumps here are some of
[56:32.960 --> 56:40.160]  the articles this is from the article at a police officer website this is
[56:40.160 --> 56:48.800]  actually an AP story knows Reuters taser upping zap power and this is from a
[56:48.800 --> 56:53.120]  year ago the second time they upped the power there's not enough death from it
[56:53.120 --> 57:00.440]  so you gotta up that power tasers police torture weapons AFN.org and it
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.760]  goes on to say Orange County police use a taser got an 18 year old Orlando man
[57:04.760 --> 57:07.640]  who was tied to a hospital bed the reason was the man refused to give a
[57:07.640 --> 57:12.560]  urine sample and so they just began to taser him and taser him and taser him
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.000]  until he answered the question and then we've got it in Kalamazoo Gazette where
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.360]  the sheriffs did it we've got it in the Olympian where this where they did it in
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.280]  another place and they've got all the towns as articles where they're doing
[57:23.280 --> 57:29.360]  it everywhere tell me who you are oh didn't boom I'm gonna taser you no fifth
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.520]  amendment that's torture and what do they say what does the park rangers say
[57:33.520 --> 57:39.040]  when she tasered him he's charged and was tasered for failure to obey a lawful
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.360]  order really gotta answer your question the cops actually believe that's a
[57:43.360 --> 57:47.240]  lawful order because they got criminal judges and criminal prosecutors most
[57:47.240 --> 57:52.360]  of them a bunch of narcotics traffickers all on the take sitting there telling you
[57:52.360 --> 57:56.760]  you can do that no you can't scum it's called the fifth amendment shove it in a

[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:06.520]  of hurt and I want to shake people out of their morass so many days I get up
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.280]  here and just control myself and get guests on and I'm gonna be honest with
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.800]  you know about 90% of the time I know more than all the guests do and I just
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.400]  sit here because I like to talk to somebody else and hear their perspective
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.640]  and then I interrupt when I want to make a point it's good to ask my like Ron
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:27.720]  Paul or Ellen Waddon because they know as much as I do or more or you get
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.440]  people on the show that that understand part of the equation and are really
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.800]  smart in that area and surpass you in knowledge when you do research later
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.160]  you understand they've got a specialty area but then they're real stupid in
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:48.960]  other areas and I mean I guess we all are it's just I'm not enemies with the
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.600]  globalist enforcement idiots you know I realized they're just like the general
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.760]  public they're they're under mind control they're brainwashed in a hundred
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:04.040]  different ways but it doesn't make them any less dangerous it doesn't make them
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:11.040]  any less more out of control it doesn't make them any less disgusting and I'll
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:17.080]  try to get through as many people as I can but I've just gotten the point where
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.760]  I'm not gonna mince words anymore and I'm not gonna play games with people you've
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.520]  probably noticed I'm not talking much about the election you probably noticed
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.920]  I'm not talking about a lot of our big issues this one with Bill Gates comes

[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.480]  acting like he's going after Holder but having the back off and Holder played
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:55.720]  the ace card the ace of spades that George W. Bush was involved in a previous
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:04.000]  program identical of course I told you months before that Holder would play
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.480]  that card and he did I mean if you figured out we know what we're talking
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.880]  about have you figured out there's thousands of flavors of bull this ain't
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.720]  where it's at you know how creepy it is to know I'm right you know how creepy it
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.040]  is that so many other people don't get it when it's so obvious and how dangerous
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.840]  that is and how freaky that is that I'm sitting here knowing what their next
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.960]  moves are knowing exactly how they're operating seeing all the crimes they're
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.080]  committing and I've got to watch zombie public go around all day and I got to
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.440]  watch cops going around bugging their eyes out at the public they're not as
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.440]  bad here in Austin on average I've been other parts of the country though where
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.320]  they've got departments where they've pushed a thug ism and I mean it is
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.680]  disgusting these are idiots having their food and water jacked their children
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.080]  slow killed their whole future destroyed their pension funds already rated they

[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.800]  them in a restaurant they will flip out I saw a bunch of special forces command
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.920]  people at 9-11 who I know were involved in the secret security operations I
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.640]  saw them in a restaurant and I walked up to them about it and they all stopped
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.520]  eating got up and left one of those places you go through and get the food
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.880]  the deli and go sit in the back they they all knew one of them obviously knew I
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.560]  was there's even video this on the web I think we put it on the web got up and
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:30.520]  left because I walked right up about Northcom operation PDD 51 you know you

[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.040]  illegal and they just looked at me like one of them was a colonel just got up
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.880]  and left because nationals they could they couldn't even be there when I was
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:48.600]  saying all that stuff I see I got the sunglasses towel I see it and I'm sick
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.440]  of it I'm like rowdy Piper I'm like you're gonna put them on put them on I'm
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:02.800]  not asking put them on this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.240]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.280]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.680]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.200]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only

[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.080]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have

[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.640]  into the addendum of the man on the street interview that Darren McBrain
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:31.280]  did yesterday that we aired premiered here yesterday on the radio TV show
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.960]  where he went out and asked folks if they know about aspartame causing brain
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.160]  tumors and the rest of it stuff that's in tens of thousands of products
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.080]  including most sugar candy now and has added all sorts of finished products to
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.520]  casseroles to TV dinners it's just it's in there because it's a special little
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.600]  thing the Defense Department masterminds want you to have because you know al-Qaeda
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.800]  admittedly works for them and Amaral al-Aqeen number three in al-Qaeda

[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.960]  to be used against us for a long time we had the documents and congressional
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.120]  hearings but the establishment media would say that's a conspiracy don't
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.200]  listen to that man and they'll go out and build a straw man of fake information
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.880]  and then discredit that a fake FEMA camp a fake military drill all the real
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.400]  stuff's right there Darren was pointing out that on snopes and all these
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.680]  George Soros type outfits he they discredit that aspartame is bad for you
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.560]  but then go and it's straw man baloney see they don't discredit the real facts

[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.600]  die yeah the plant makes its own pesticide and then you eat it and
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.840]  Monsanto says well it just fungus naturally grows on corn yeah and the
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.840]  bugs don't eat it when it's one one thousandth of what this corn grows
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.560]  inside of it and then ignorant people always send me emails going they don't

[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.760]  example I got up here and say Dinecore was caught running child kidnapping
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.280]  rings in Europe and Dinecore is the biggest subsidiary controller of private
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.920]  CPS agents in the United States I mean that is an acclaim that's admitted go
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.960]  look it up I don't care if it sounds crazy you better look up you know you
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:49.680]  don't have time to play games anymore I mean I go to a neurotic level to prove
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.880]  everything I say like I start saying they taser people to make them answer
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.200]  questions now and that's a torture and a violation of its amendment and the
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.880]  Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code and common sense of every Canada
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:07.200]  free society but I actually went and had them pull the Reuters and AP articles
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.280]  and showed it to you and then the articles are reporting it like it's good
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.000]  they're like well this is good they torture people now they're like oh it's
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.320]  reasonable and this judge says it's okay see a lot of times the mainstream media
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:26.080]  doesn't lie they go oh yeah they take a million six children a year and they do
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.440]  have the highest rate of abuse in once they're in government custody but you
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.440]  know they need more funding that's why so they can do more of it oh we do have
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.640]  more drug use and more people in prisons under the drug war the answer is get
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:45.400]  rid of more rights and hire more police oh really who pick up the users of the

[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.680]  so immoral so illegal and is going to replace humans and make the technocrats
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.760]  very powerful we can beat them right now but we got to take control of the
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.000]  architecture we've got to start discussing the fact that everything's
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.160]  being built as an architecture of control and have a say in that like Dr.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.600]  Stallman others say and we've got to start voting with our dollars now for
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.920]  open free architecture and this is such a master plan we're facing but it's
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:14.000]  outrageous and so if we just fight it we can win their biggest tool was false

[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.760]  turning me on to the Apple seed project I heard it I heard the guy on your show
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.000]  about two years ago and I recently took the course I would encourage all your
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.120]  listeners to go and spend a weekend with those wonderful people man how for
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.040]  those that don't know it's it's basic rifleman training yep absolutely those
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.480]  founding fathers knew what they were talking about right Tom Jefferson that
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:56.320]  your rifle be a constant companion on your walks yeah I need to use my rifles
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.480]  more I used to be an incredible rifleman I mean I could shoot the top of a
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.600]  Tabasco bottle at 200 yards every time and now I could shoot bulls eye 200
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.520]  yards but I mean I used to be just an incredible shot as I shot every week and
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.640]  now I'm just a mediocre but it's it it should be a constant companion in our
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:21.640]  lives saloon and it also just teaches you discipline patience and how to you
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.600]  know it's not just about getting the shot off it's about everything and of
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.080]  course and at lunchtime and they tell you about the opening stages of 1776 and
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.720]  actually tying it all back to what happened in New Jersey about the
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.520]  ammunition ban that's what the British were doing they were raiding all of the
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:45.080]  powder powder stores so they get again a little sort of a tie in there you know if
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.000]  you read the Declaration of Independence it's everything the Crooks are doing
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.400]  now I mean look the government has been caught all eight law enforcement
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:56.920]  agencies shipping drugs in that's in all the federal documents fast and furious
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.880]  on the news they're covering it up and shipping the guns into Mexico to blame
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.280]  the Second Amendment CBS News got the documents I mean we already knew that
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.600]  obviously it was the blame the Second Amendment they used it for that I
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.920]  predicted years ago that was the program going on because I know these criminals I
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.400]  know them but now they're caught and no one gets in trouble because the
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.320]  government is criminal run they've gotten away with every crime you can
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.560]  imagine and lower level criminals who aren't as evil they can't say no to the
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.520]  other criminals because they're all compromised I mean you realize how
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.360]  dangerous that is
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.760]  of evil my friend a hierarchy of evil everybody trying to scramble to the top
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.960]  and the controllers at the top knows so they are the ones holding the strings
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.840]  holding all of the information you know the extortion the bribery everything
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.320]  it's rotten from the bottom up the top and they pit us against each other or
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.280]  they try to pit they give us the false choices they try to pit us against each
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.000]  other you know and that's the thing about again coming back to apple seed
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.520]  empowering the individual spreading the community you know the founding fathers
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:09.880]  were also pacifists they waited to be shot at first and that's what we need to
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.800]  do you know we need to be the individual the pacifist constantly promoting
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.760]  peace peace peace in this world promoting peace 24-7 and exhausting every
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:25.840]  avenue but preparing for defense and end of the end of the defense stops not
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.200]  backing off right on and listen there's one other thing I wanted to ask you
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.640]  Lindsey Williams was on your show about maybe a year ago right and he was
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.920]  talking about meeting some I don't know with some Arizona Congress woman who
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.280]  had a meeting with with mr. Napolitano and she told her to have enough food and
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.200]  water for six months I figured out who it is and asked him off air and he said
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.440]  Alex please don't tell anyone yes that's who I talked with but please it
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.640]  was in confidence but yeah you can figure out who it is real quick but
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.600]  every cop I know everybody's told it's total collapse coming the globalists
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:10.120]  are acting like gee the derivatives and all this we didn't know now we have to
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:15.080]  use homeland security on you it was always set up for us as I said on 9-11
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.000]  as I said years before because of the Rand Corporation all of that I've got
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.520]  more of their documents today I was reading they're they're they're they're
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.680]  talking about false flags like we're idiots I've got a bunch of different
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.440]  institutes talking about false flags in front of us brother like we don't see
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:37.000]  that's Gary Hart since letter dog net denigine saying will stage terror attacks
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.920]  and we are chained questioning it's in my film truth rising they confront him
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.360]  and they go you send a letter saying which stage attacks he goes no I didn't
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.400]  write that letter you don't have a copy of that and they go here it is he goes
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.040]  oh I did write that letter yes and he suddenly starts sweating like like they
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.800]  can see they're so used to everybody being ignorant and spiritually and
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:04.120]  culturally and and and gut blind that that when they actually know you can
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.680]  see them they're scared and that's the thing globalist 15 years ago when I
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:12.480]  would confront them were arrogant they are scared to death I saw Kirk Watson in
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.920]  Saudi Arabia studio last year that was their interview and he was there after
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.680]  me I was leaving and he saw me and he was wherever the bunch of other state

[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.400]  normal to be awake it's normal to be alive in a healthy culture and then we
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.040]  look at those who are stunted and in small-minded and take care of them as
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.520]  children when Christ talked about suffer the little ones that's not just the
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.640]  children in that beautiful poetry better to tie a millstone around your neck and
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.360]  throw yourself into the deepest sea than to harm one of these a millstone they
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.480]  have the donkey or the person you'd push it around and grind the grain so you
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:19.080]  can make the bread grind the wheat grind grind it down could weigh tons better to
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.680]  tie that around your neck and jump into the ocean than to hurt a simple person
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:30.720]  to hurt an old lady to hurt a child to to to use someone's lack of knowledge to
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:37.920]  feed on them and abuse them and suck off of them better that you kill yourself
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.960]  than do that because God hates you vengeance belongs to God but I will
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.480]  tell you here I am here to defend against evil and I'm here to wake people up
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:56.000]  and as humans we are instruments of justice and when you're doing right and
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.800]  when you're on the side of good who can stop you if they kill you you become a
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.400]  martyr if they don't you march forward against the enemy if they kill your
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:13.320]  name show what the information's already gone out you are the answer to the New
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:20.040]  World Order you are the answer to 1984 you are 1776 if you're listening to my
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:30.000]  voice you are the resistance you get how real this is how exciting that is how
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.440]  hardcore reality is that a great contest between the forces of good and evil is
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.920]  always taking place around you but a great contest a great crossroads a great
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:48.040]  time when the future of our species destiny is being decided when our course
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:38:01.640]  is the object of the great contest to stand here now with you truth is
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:10.680]  stranger than fiction make the right choice you're only alive once choose
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:18.320]  wisely don't sit on the fence don't be lukewarm if you're going to serve evil
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:22.000]  and serve it with all your heart all your mind all your soul and if you're
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:29.080]  going to serve good realize that good is not some limp risted weak groveling
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:37.160]  thing good is fiery and shatters mountains good is the documented cases of
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:43.640]  a woman picking up a giant there were cases this in the 50s and 60s giant
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:51.080]  Cadillac off of their child as they squeal underneath the axle the cases are
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.800]  well documented where the woman sees the small child screaming sees the blood and
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:59.960]  the woman turns off their governor their psychological block that's theirs we
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.920]  don't hurt ourselves and others and lifts that car off that child on record
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:13.800]  our potential mentally spiritually physically is unbelievable that's why
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.720]  the globalist are scared they have this knowledge but are evil and have sought
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:28.680]  to hoard it for themselves I am not illuminated with their Luciferian
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:35.640]  garbage because illumination is only partial knowledge it's a lie they think
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.680]  they know the secrets of the universe they think they know but they're damned
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.480]  they're they're cut off because of their own choices they're given a great
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.480]  delusion they have physical knowledge how to manipulate people and they know
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.040]  others are unconscious but they themselves have not broken the surface of
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:01.440]  the water they are not seen clearly they have not breached they are not truly
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.080]  conscious because if you're truly conscious then you don't think there's a
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:12.920]  God you know there's a God and you can't put it in a book you can't even get a
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.360]  sermon about it to understand it one cannot be told about the matrix one
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:26.040]  must see it it's the metaphor we see in films like they live you're gonna put
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:30.600]  these sunglasses on but the guy still had to make the choice put these
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.400]  sunglasses on or start eating concrete the truth is you're already eating
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.920]  concrete because you won't put the sunglasses on you don't need to believe
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:47.200]  what Alex Jones believes because I don't believe Jack Diddley squat I see I know
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:52.840]  and once you are awake it's ridiculous how easy it is to be awake you can't
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:57.840]  believe how weak the globalist are you can't believe that if the mass of us
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:03.840]  began to awake we would throw this little one inch parasite off of our back
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:11.160]  like we were brushing off some diseased beetle but I warn you the system knows
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:16.280]  that and is racing with our money our ingenuity our science our energy to
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:21.840]  build giant armies of drones ground robots most the cars are gonna be remote
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.720]  control already multiples multi-states of 18 wheelers that are driverless we're
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.120]  being dehumanized we're having the whole system taken away from us as if we
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.400]  don't have a choice and as if we're not involved in anything now I'm gonna give
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.200]  us some financial news but first I want to illustrate what they do here and if
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:43.800]  you're not watching at prismplanet.tv or the free video streaming info wars.com
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.720]  that's fine you're listening on the radio now an XM AM FM we'll archive this
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:53.240]  report probably tomorrow so with an article by Curt Nemo if not it'll be
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.680]  Friday because it'll make brains working on another piece all together with the
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.880]  man on the street on aspartame just one chemical weapon they're using against
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:05.200]  us that of course Bill Gates is involved in now owning part of Monsanto
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:10.200]  Rumsfeld got it passed it was a Department of Defense weapon weaponized
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.440]  bacteria that defecates a chemical weapon that's highly addictive a lot of
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.000]  poisons are addictive you can look at all up to yourself I know this sounds
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:23.600]  insane it's all look at manufacturing process aspartame and it's got ads from
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.680]  1981 when it rolled out I remember being about six seven years old and all my
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.840]  neighbors and myself getting in the mail the gumballs a big package of gumballs
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.860]  that were nutritious wheat I remember eating it thinking it tasted bad and it
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:42.040]  giving me a headache I knew the Dallas water you can almost light on fire it's
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.900]  got so many chemicals on it gave me a headache as a child I just learned well
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:50.120]  I've been out playing soccer or baseball or football I'm gonna drink the water I'm
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.360]  gonna get the headache I'm gonna brush my teeth I'm gonna get the headache they
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:58.240]  come to school with the fluoride pills I'm gonna get my headache I didn't know
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:08.560]  what floor I was doing to me I was experiencing it but the point here is
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:15.960]  that Fred Flintstone ads about how great cigarettes are ads for women about
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.200]  how sexy it is to have cigarettes and they even psych warfare chief a chief
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.440]  nephew of Sigmund Freud you know he worked for the Pentagon even wrote how
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.520]  they sold women that it was feminist and cool to smoke cigarettes knowing it
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:34.920]  would kill them and sold the fake rebellion factor and of course was the
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:43.400]  author of the book propaganda but the point is they called it liberty torches
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:49.160]  for women Edward Bernays put out that term show them in smoke your cigarette
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:56.880]  for women dipped powdered snuff behind closed doors and snorted it but he's
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:00.560]  the reason we eat bacon and eggs they couldn't really sell the pork bellies
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.840]  it was only used for food flavoring you know it's dues and things so they had a
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.560]  national thing about gotta have bacon with your eggs and gotta have them the
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.600]  music room you know it's just a lot of PR things to sell products but he also
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.880]  worked for the Department of War and they sold programs will put some of
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:19.760]  these graphics up before we go to the video of big full-color spreads and
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.720]  magazines about doctor recommended camel it's so good you'd walk a mile got a
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:30.120]  sore throat smoke some extra camels they'll set you right you know the
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.200]  majority of doctors think Kent is the best and it's its film footage and
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:39.840]  newscast and and film reels and ads so many of these online where the doctors
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.120]  smoking the cigarette and it's the thing to do and Fred Flintstone smoking the
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.520]  Winston they're so delicious they've got the flavor you do you demand it's so
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:55.360]  good for you you're so beautiful when you do it oh mommy enjoy your Marlborough

[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.920]  children love the cigarettes and you know the doctor recommends you need your
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:09.080]  cigarettes more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette I wanted to show
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.960]  you this so when you hear about doctors say fluoride's good in your water oh
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.640]  really the sodium fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals they add under that
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:22.600]  name oh doctors say Prozac's good oh doctors say there's no mercury in shots
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.760]  remember that line 10 years ago and then we pointed out look at the insert it
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.880]  says they're like oh well it's in there but it's good for you it's good for your
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.600]  brain do I need to play the newscast again mercury is good for your brain
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.640]  most deadly heavy metal in the brain keeps eating through it and other heavy
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.920]  metals just cause plaques it keeps killing and killing and killing and killing
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.800]  causes electrochemical death in the neurons but they say it's good for you
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:52.840]  now let's play the commercial where the doctor says it's so good for you and
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.240]  Fred Flintstone likes it as well and then it segues with all these happy
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:00.920]  families and you know old men sitting out front the old-fashioned gas station
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:08.280]  it's all meant to be nostalgic for the 50s it's all stylized like a Norman
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.680]  Rockwell painting this came out in the 80 81 but it's all stylized like you're
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.920]  in the 50s playing nostalgia hitting the trigger that this is old-fashioned this
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.120]  is good and then adds about it's got everything that's in a bowl of milk and
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.840]  cereal and bananas it's healthy it's not really natural but it comes from things
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:32.400]  that are natural never telling you it's bacteria feces department of defense
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:37.400]  weapon program I mean this is all imagined they're showing kids eating it
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:42.360]  saying it's good comparing it to bananas knowing it's a department of
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.920]  defense chemical weapon here it is
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.520]  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack Winston's
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.760]  got that filter friend the Flintstone has been brought to you by Winston
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  America's best-selling best-tasting filter cigarette cartoons for the kids
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:16.080]  look that rocks happy they all got Winston in a repeated national survey
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:21.360]  doctors in all branches of medicine doctors in all parts of the country were
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:27.200]  asked what cigarette do you smoke doctor once again the brand named most was
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:33.440]  camel yes according to this repeated nationwide survey more doctors camels
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.560]  than any other cigarette why not change to camels for the next 30 days and see
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.120]  what a difference it makes in your smoking enjoyment see how camels agree
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:54.360]  with your throat see how mild and good tasting a cigarette can be last year
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.160]  two million people got gumballs in the mail
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.960]  oh a gum drop
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:16.800]  and for some reason we played this last night and had better audio and he goes
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:22.800]  on to say how great it is and how it takes good care of you
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:37.800]  these ads are so old the the first one where it's nostalgic and everybody's
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.000]  getting the the gumballs in the mail and trying it and enjoying it next it cuts
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.960]  to an ad that from the same year that's got a little bit better audio back that
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:50.520]  up where it's like it doesn't come from a cow but it but it could doesn't come
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.120]  from bananas it's not natural but it comes from nature well yeah it's a
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.920]  genetically engineered bacteria the first ever engineered that was meant to
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.200]  eat toxic waste by the Pentagon I mean look it up but this is showing parents
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.360]  their kid oh it's healthy like milk go ahead and go back to it here it is
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.840]  either to cows but they might as well if you've had bananas and milk you've
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:18.160]  eaten what's in nutritious wheat it's made from things like those found
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.840]  naturally and good things to eat like two building blocks of protein nature
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.520]  doesn't make nutritious wheat but nutritious wheat couldn't be made without
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:35.280]  it nutritious wheat brand sweet oh just look for the swirl oh it's nature
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:43.800]  everybody's happy nature doesn't make it but it could it could oh why don't you
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.960]  tell us how you make it you're showing us cows and little kids you make a mix
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:53.480]  cereals of milk and eating bananas and a toucan a tree everything's healthy why
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.400]  don't you tell us where it came from why don't you just show us the big
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:00.200]  factories I've seen video of it we ought to show people that again big giant

[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:04.680]  adopt what we do it goes off the charts okay and the globalists say they're
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:07.920]  killing us and they enjoy it and they suck the money out of us as they do it
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.600]  it's very very simple and you wake up to that all the other stuffs window
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:19.240]  dressing S&P warns of cuts another u.s. downgrade coming pay the bankers higher
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:24.120]  interest even though we gave them the money again you can't make up a level
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:27.840]  the fraud because they because the globalists have learned like Hitler said
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.080]  the bigger the lie the better the bigger the fraud the better make it so
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:37.080]  outlandish house prices hit post bubble low I thought it was a big recovery
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:40.520]  course the government knows it's a depression they engineered it latest
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.840]  congressional budget outlook for 2012 2022 well over 10% unemployment got
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:53.000]  numbers here about Obama's policies increased national debt 47% 21.7
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.880]  trillion CNS news doing a good job bringing us down he's not screwing up
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.840]  it's his job to sucker you along I want to bring Ted Anderson up obviously the
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:06.320]  pitch gold are incredibly low prices at you and hope you're saying enough to get
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:10.680]  it we told you them artificially raising margin calls driving things down was
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.640]  it from statistically and historically only a tactic look at the 12-year graph
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.520]  they do that from time to time it goes up and goes down but always overall up
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.520]  now it's going back up because they've announced QE3 and China and others are
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.320]  buying it Ted what's the news you've got today on this front well like you say
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:33.880]  the S&P story is the big thing today that they're looking to downgrade the
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:38.640]  dollar again or downgrade the US government bonds you know we're just
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:44.920]  falling into banana Republic status China here's a article out of Al Jazeera
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.760]  and it just says China is shifting some of its massive foreign holdings into
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.400]  gold away from US dollar undermining the dollar's role as the world's reserve
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.200]  currency according to the recent released WikiLeaks so it's they come out of
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:04.080]  Wiki but it's it's still true this is what China is doing we we have China
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:09.160]  sitting in the the sixth largest holder of gold and and their population
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.720]  obviously is much greater than that they can they can take on quite a bit more so
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:21.400]  that's going on the MF global thing is the the the guy Michael Michael Roseman
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.320]  is going to be in front of Congress talking about the MF global crisis the
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:30.760]  European Corzine got caught perjuring himself saying he didn't know where the
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.080]  money went and now they just say it's evaporated or no vaporized is the word
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.480]  yeah vaporized I mean obviously a lot of debt and a lot of default and too much
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.800]  leverage and it's just the whole thing is such a mess and then it's that's
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.080]  being driven by Europe and and here you have China getting away from the United
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:53.240]  States currency obviously gold is going to go up in price right now the US
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.800]  dollars down at 78 78 gold right now is up it's seen its high today of 15 or
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:07.120]  1751 70 just to be clear to briefly Ted if people call Midas resources and ask

[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:53.280]  listening to GCN visit GCN live com today a little over a year ago I began to do a
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.440]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that was still
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:01.920]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:04.840]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:09.160]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:14.280]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight

[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.800]  all right we're new five more minutes today Anderson go to break and go right
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:40.520]  to your calls I promise I'll control myself I want to hear from you we got a
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.520]  bunch of the news that I got to get into when I ran they got big thing tink tink
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:48.880]  saying yeah false flags will help us got the latest on bill gates that's all
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.600]  coming up but right now going back to Ted I mean Ted look the system has
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:56.520]  engineered a depression to create more of a managed economy just like the great
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:00.760]  depression but this is going to be a lot bigger obviously home ownership rates
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:05.440]  have fallen 66% is downturn nears but the reports are that the Chinese
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:11.800]  government not just the people are buying gold as fast as they can
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.320]  Venezuela has announced irrevocable withdrawal from World Bank arbitration
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.040]  body Venezuela of course has demanded its gold back out of the British banks
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.160]  and it's now places itself directly in line of fire with globalist elites that's
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:31.600]  out of Venezuela analysis by Ewan Robertson we've got Sicily's pitchport
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.160]  movement in revolt open revolt in areas of Italy but nobody's covering that here
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:42.120]  on our media I mean at Davos Ted the elites admitted that that global
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.280]  government's failing that was what they had up on the big screen and that they're
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.840]  concerned they should be concerned Ted they've been so good at robbing
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:51.800]  everything they haven't been too good though at covering up that they're the
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:57.040]  ones doing it Ted no they haven't been as a matter of fact and and like you say
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:01.080]  they're losing control they're doing everything they can to destroy the
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:05.800]  currency will probably be falling into a new currency a world currency but
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:10.240]  David Malpass is writing right now that the feds actions will kill the US dollar
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.960]  and of course he's referring to the feds policy to keep the interest rates
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.720]  low all the way to the year 2014 I mean you got to realize that's quantitative
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:22.720]  easing three even though they're not saying it it's happening and now that's
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:27.600]  going to drive gold prices up gold is been money for 6,000 years so is silver
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.520]  people have been trading gold and silver as money and that's why it holds value
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.800]  when you see gold and silver rising that is a bellwether to the fact that the
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:39.480]  United States dollars dropping it's hard to follow the dollar indexes and
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.200]  actually get a take on what's going on because the currencies that they're
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.600]  measuring against are falling too so you have to turn to commodities to get that
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:50.920]  you can look at oil you can look at other things but one of the best things to
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.600]  look at is gold and Alex you're talking about gold and silver personally I think
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.080]  that people just they should not be without this we have survival bags of
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.840]  dimes on the website you can call us for them but that is small pieces of
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:08.920]  silver that can be used as money no matter what happens from what I can tell
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.400]  everything that I've been reading the United States dollars in trouble and if
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.280]  you're sitting here thinking that you're going to be able to have stocks bonds
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.080]  mutual funds even money in government securities like Treasury bonds notes
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  bills that type of thing the inflation tax is just going to eat it away that's
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:30.560]  what they're going for right now the Fed is printing money to try to keep the
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.520]  economy going and S&P is even coming out now and saying that the United States
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:39.200]  bonds are in trouble and you better do something different and that's why you
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.040]  see China getting out of it and of course you're going to see all these
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.960]  countries that they are obviously not favorable to the United States to start
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.040]  worth they don't want to be involved with that you're going to see total
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:54.920]  demonization of gold because it's what exposes the fact that the currencies are
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.800]  all being devalued we're not saying gold and silver or silver bullets but it's
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.920]  as close as you're going to get in my experience in my personal life you know I
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.440]  bought gold at 300 bucks an ounce silver at five never sold it at its high

[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.520]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:11.560]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:15.440]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:19.480]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:24.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.400]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.880]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:39.840]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:20.480]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:25.720]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:30.880]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:35.200]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.

[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.040]  contempt over the false flag terror attack that the criminal justice
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:29.500]  department launched against Mexico and the US to blend the Second Amendment by
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:33.040]  shipping the irons into the country and then blame our basic freedoms because
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:39.840]  they are Constitution hating terrorist. Smart meters for energy to be voluntary
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:43.360]  but then you actually read deeper it's basically mandatory. Pythons are
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:47.080]  squeezing the life out of the Everglades scientists warm gonna break that down.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:52.360]  Obama on drones a lot more but right I got a bunch of breaking news and the US
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:55.360]  nuke sub head towards Persian Gulf that's breaking.
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:00.400]  Paul Joseph Watson infowars.com that's just some of what's coming up but right now
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:06.920]  Trey in South Carolina you're on the air welcome. Hey Alex called about a year ago
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:12.280]  I think I asked how you dealt with the burden of all the knowledge and it gave
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:18.240]  me a pretty good answer and since then I've been awake quite a long time but
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:22.560]  you know I really don't watch too much cable TV and if I do it's the history
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.400]  channel you know stuff like that but even in in things like that you can see
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:32.480]  how biased everything is and you can see the the conditioning I mean the
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:37.440]  conditioning everywhere it's not just in news it's in TV. Once you're awake it
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:43.200]  is it is so wild to see the bombardment and the brainwashing and then to see
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:47.880]  adults with the satisfied little smirk they get when they're in make-believe
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:51.760]  they're in a trance literally this is what the psych warfare chief say and
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:57.240]  they're in make-believe about their role and they've got all these little niches
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:02.400]  and subgroups that you know that people have these false identities and they
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.320]  did the studies you know a hundred years ago where you put a hunting cap on
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:09.480]  somebody people act like a hunter you put a you know wild native outfit on you
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.320]  jump around and say ugabuga you dress a woman up in a sexy outfit she feels
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.360]  sexual you dress guys up in black uniforms they they feel menacing and
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.600]  powerful and their little kids I I mean I've been in New Yorker places and it's
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:25.920]  and they'll have they'll have cops with big machine guns giant body armor and
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:31.080]  and you see the photos of them online and they're just like and they sit there
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:35.160]  burying their teeth and acting tough and and actually people walk by scared of
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.720]  them and you see the cops actually feeding on it and it's like a five year
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:43.280]  old dressing up like a superhero running up when my son was five and acting like
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:48.240]  he was scaring me and I'd play along they literally are children they are
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.880]  children in a mind control system I mean they are so sad that's why I used to
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.680]  get mad at them I realized these are damaged people and in the general public
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:03.080]  are literally just childlike arrested development brain damaged people I mean
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:08.200]  it is it is we are under zombie control sorry go ahead yeah I mean it the whole
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:13.560]  whole system is just so big in and to wake other people up I mean I've got two
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:17.760]  little sisters one's in grade school and the other ones she's in sixth grade and
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.880]  you know I worry about them you know and I chill that's why I want to get them
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.520]  young if you teach children about manipulation early on they become
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:29.840]  genius at it look look here's the deal the system this is key what I'm about to
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.560]  tell you listen very carefully this is very important something I don't say
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:38.320]  enough or may have never even said the globalists get their power out of
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.360]  massaging and manipulating hoaxes and trends that then get picked up by the
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:49.440]  general public and acted upon and it's the mass of billions giving their power
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.880]  to it and playing along is what makes it go system-wide and be so huge because
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:01.560]  we all start unconsciously repeating it like saying we're attacking Iraq we're
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:06.000]  attacking Afghanistan you know we're you know the you know the superpower we're
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:11.280]  not a superpower we're a military province debilitated destroyed none of
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.320]  our infrastructure fixed falling apart by offshore mega banks who let us take
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:19.760]  the blame for all the crimes they're committing there's just levels to this
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.920]  and so I always say you know we shouldn't be in Iraq we're not in Iraq
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:30.000]  we're hijacked that's like if a guy hijacks your plane you know it's like
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.960]  we're hijackers no we're on a plane that's hijacked now so so as we unlock
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.520]  people's minds and they start seeing that power paradigm starts heating up
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:44.520]  like a dynamo and that's what scares the globalist because as we because a
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:49.440]  zombie repeating mind control gives some power to the system and in mass it's
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.160]  it's very powerful and it creates a feedback loop echo chamber but as
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:57.920]  people actually activate and become conscious literally wake up out of the
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:01.400]  matrix it's not an electronic matrix they're trying to build that and
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:05.520]  service into it with electronics and the rest of it but it's a it's a false
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:10.880]  habitat and a false understandings that we add power to as people wake up out
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:15.760]  of that and go whoa then it adds incredible power to the accelerate the
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:19.840]  awakening that's why they're trying to head us off at the past they are look
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:25.160]  the new world order inside their new order system literally has
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:32.200]  alert alert critical mind control system breaking we have failures at multiple
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:36.520]  levels I mean it I mean they are they are free is Brzezinski Hillary all of
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.800]  them to their own groups are like info or we're losing it they're waking up get
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:43.400]  a war going add more chemicals in the water you know get it going I mean they
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:51.480]  are they are not invincible go ahead also back when Ron Paul was campaigning
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:56.040]  here in South Carolina I've made it an effort the weekend before the primary to
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:01.160]  go out into the downtown area and pass out Ron Paul pamphlets and information
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:08.440]  well I came across one guy and he was a former he's a vet and I had asked him you
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.920]  know what he thought about Ron Paul and he said I love everything about Ron Paul
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:15.640]  the only thing I do not like and the only reason I'm not voting for him oh
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:21.160]  mind you he's voting for Rick Santorum but I don't like his foreign policy and I
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.480]  said okay so what you're telling me is you you want you want the way it is now
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:33.840]  and he says no I want other countries to know who who who's got the big guns
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:37.760]  or who's they didn't word it like that but he said no he personally feels
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:42.640]  powerful through the new world order system he I mean these guys these cops
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:47.800]  all of them that I talked to who aren't awake they have pride in it when this is
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:53.240]  a system that hates them more than the Iraqis that's the worst part because
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:59.080]  whenever you you try to tell them like I had brought it up to him and I've said
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.560]  New World Order and he kind of like what are you talking about I know you're not
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:07.800]  talking about the wrestling I was like no no of course not this government is a
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:12.200]  serious serious serious thing and I didn't even want to try to get into it
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.600]  with them because you could tell sir if he thinks the New World Order is
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:19.600]  Hulk Hogan which they did on purpose of course as part of the blurring
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:23.320]  everything I mean you just you need to move on you're not gonna be able to
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:27.000]  help him right now I mean you look look look that's what I'm saying they buy
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.840]  into their their own identity is in the system and I mean the guys like that here
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:34.800]  this show and that they and that they're being poisoned on purpose doesn't
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:39.160]  matter if I have so many documents and books published by the globalist they're
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:43.200]  not gonna listen and you know that guy's kid could die of cancer he's not gonna
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:47.040]  listen because he's not gonna admit somebody killed his kid then he'd have
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.800]  to do something about it see and he's not gonna do that he's gonna go bury his
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:55.280]  kid and everybody's gonna cry at the funeral and then that's it I mean the
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:01.160]  guys look they're they are spiritually weak they are psychologically weak and
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.440]  all you can try to do is plant a seed I would move on to those that are already
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.480]  partially awake I mean you let the dead bury the dead knock the dust off your
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:13.840]  feet no pearls before swine try to give somebody the knowledge in a loving way
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:18.560]  they're under zombie control just saying praying for him you know and a lot of
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:22.240]  times if you try to convince them nicely they get a power trip like you're
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:26.600]  trying to sell them and haha they're aware of that just say you know what
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:32.280]  pal enjoy yourself I appreciate your call yeah you're not gonna that's I mean
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:38.000]  that people like that I mean that's one of the big control systems is when they
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.040]  think it's their military and their country and and then everybody's you
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:47.760]  know they they know I'm big oh yes they know you're very big that they they use
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:52.320]  you for a guinea pig they're training paramilitary to kill the veterans they
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.840]  hate your guts and constantly talk about how you're the enemy and the number
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:02.720]  one threat but see he's the type who'll who'll go along with the system he's
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:07.280]  that 30% or so that'll serve serve up evil and because they're the good guys
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.240]  say oh I'm a good guy so I torture oh well I'm a good guy so I do this and

[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:32.360]  don't screen your calls you're just on air very good people always call in the
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:38.040]  show like want me to screen their call I mean you're on all right all right my
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.480]  church has been co-opted I think I go to the Venice Church and I try to talk to
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:47.360]  the senior pastors a couple of months ago because you know I called in before
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.360]  and I told you I left California because of all what's going on down there of
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:53.960]  course a couple of callers called in and there's there you know all the news is
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:57.280]  going on now how this becoming a police state down there that that's the reason
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:00.520]  why I left but I had a good church that went to down there and they told me to
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:04.840]  go to an Adventist church that's the best church to go to because they're they
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:08.680]  they they they had they worship the best in the scripture they worship on the
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:12.680]  right day you know they they are in a good health and food nutrition went to
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:16.360]  this nice church here I found a very nice one but I talked to a senior pastor I
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:20.080]  said hey what do you think about what's going on in in prophecy today what's
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:24.520]  going on and what do you think of this show that I listen to your show and
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:31.800]  he says oh brother you know just they'll drive you crazy don't go there yeah
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:36.400]  well the seventh day Adventist on average I've known some are very good
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:41.720]  hard-working smart people and they and then they're you know supposedly about
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:46.000]  being healthy but they never tell you GMO I mean GMO is a bunch of bacteria and
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.040]  insect genes added and is deadly I mean you might as well be drinking Jack
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.440]  Daniels every day by the gallon that'd be better for you and they're like oh it's
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:19:00.080]  fine and and yes the big denominations I know this the seventh day Adventist are
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:05.440]  the only group of test subjects that actually volunteered seventh day Adventist
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:09.280]  in the 40s 50s 60s 70s and 80s and they'll and it hadn't been declassified
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:14.400]  since we're only up to the 80s volunteered to be an experiment some of
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:19.400]  which were semi-lethal killed people and they and they because the church told
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:25.760]  their men go be part of this Pentagon test and seventh day Adventist for
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:30.240]  whatever reason I mean it's all the big denominations I mean clergy response
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:34.720]  teams are over a hundred thousand covert preachers are FEMA officers part of
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:39.880]  infra-guards spying on their flocks telling them submit to tyranny and so
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:45.160]  he's probably a infra-guard or at least clergy response team if it's a big
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:49.240]  church I mean you better believe he's got files on everybody in the church and
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:52.920]  you were reported to homeland security not like it anything wrong but they're
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:56.840]  just getting ready for the arrest and everything so he probably is an outright
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:20:00.400]  servant of the New World Order I want to hear more about it when we come back

[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:07.120]  you know what I know about Seventh Day Adventist because I don't get into all
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:10.360]  these different Christian sex and groups and all of them fighting with each other
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:18.280]  is that my mother right around the time I was born went to work and I was gonna
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:22.320]  confuse because she went back and forth at the Dallas the Dallas was the Dallas
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:26.600]  Morning News or Dallas Times Herald I think was the Dallas Morning News she
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:30.120]  hates it when I talk about her on there I better not and then for a while because
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:34.160]  of family friends she was the main secretary for like one of the biggest
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.960]  Seventh Day Adventists in the country he was like the big-headed guy in Dallas had
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:41.720]  a national TV show and he'd like get next in on the phone he get mad about you
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:47.200]  know corruption or sex stuff you know being pushed in Congress or whatever and
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:51.760]  he say get me the White House and she remembers that sometimes him actually
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:54.400]  being able to get through to you know head people at the White House because
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:57.760]  she was a secretary she's worked there a few years because he could work part-time
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:02.760]  and she wanted to take care of me but she said I mean the guy would almost jump
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.960]  up and down angry at corruption and run around doing stuff and had a national
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.200]  TV show so he was certainly a good guy according to what she said because last
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:17.400]  time we talked about that as we were talking about Bobby Vaughn who was the
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:21.000]  John Berger who'd come over to the house he died of brain cancer a few years ago
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.640]  longtime family friend and talk about the New World Order I remember hearing it
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:28.160]  you know from the time I was like a year old he was over the house like every day
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:35.040]  he was a next-door neighbor he was a nurse and but then also she said she
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:38.640]  heard New World Order talk from the Seventh Day Adventist guy and I can
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.880]  barely remember his name I'm not going to talk about it because I don't want to
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:44.560]  get it wrong I don't get a national national TV show and it was like a big
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:49.040]  deal but I don't know about the Seventh Day Adventists now I mean I don't know
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.240]  much about them know about what is their Ellen wider whatever I read part of that
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:58.040]  book but I mean I'm just not going to get off into it but but yes if your
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:04.120]  preacher is Baptist Seventh Day Adventist Catholic Jewish Imam whatever it is
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:12.160]  and somebody says what about this radio show that what about this radio show
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:16.080]  that's talking about New World Order and corruption and they're like oh just
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.720]  don't go there it'll drive you crazy that's the standard line if just don't
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:23.840]  worry don't get involved you just don't trouble yourself you know you don't want
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.520]  to get persecuted or you don't want any trouble that's clergy response team
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:31.040]  I've shown you years after we gave you the documents and everybody balked at
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:35.400]  it oh there's not a hundred plus thousand secret preachers trained trained
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.560]  for this to tell their flock give the guns up go to the FEMA camp when they
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:46.960]  say you know do all these things you're told take the inoculation and then they
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.560]  have clergy response team on Louisiana TV going it was the pastors that told
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:55.840]  everyone to go to the camps and to be ready for forced inoculation or
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:59.600]  whatever's needed during martial law and it shows the preachers saying do what's
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:03.440]  of the Lord don't worry about things you just do whatever the authorities say
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:09.240]  that's Romans 13 you don't trouble yourself that's a direct FEMA doctrine
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:14.720]  Hitler's favorite Bible verse Romans 13 out of context that they used to whip you
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:18.480]  on the head with and if you're hearing that out of a preacher they've been
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:25.560]  programmed and you might as well go to the extreme and go join the church of
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:28.760]  Satan and I'm being sarcastic but I mean you might as well just know what
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.920]  you're dealing with is my point then being told don't be involved I mean
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.200]  that's the opposite of what Christ taught that's the opposite of what's in the
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:40.160]  Bible I don't ask me to give you doctrine for you know for your Christianity
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:43.600]  or whatever I'm just telling you that the reason Christians won't fight
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:48.280]  corruption is because every major denomination is getting rid of their
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:51.840]  preachers I mean I went to a church here locally I'm not going to get into
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:54.640]  what the nomination whatever it's what's one my family goes to and I went
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:59.280]  sometimes and they had a preacher that was you know little bit anti-war anti-corruption
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.800]  it was a little left-leaning but kind of old left it was a Methodist church and
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:09.520]  I would get drug in there and now he's gone and it's Bella Melinda Gates are
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:15.560]  gonna save us and and you know we're for all for liberating people's sexual
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:20.440]  civil rights basically you know it just it turns into that and and that's what
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:23.640]  the churches have all turned into and guns are bad and you know I see the
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:26.640]  Catholic Church is sending out letters you know turn your guns in it's of the
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:30.120]  Lord and you know open the borders up it's of the Lord and they're just
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:33.920]  globalist tools I mean period you you cannot debate that that's what they're
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.240]  doing just like in Russia or China the churches have been taken over but did
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:42.600]  you want to say anything about that yeah Alex I want to add something to that
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:48.280]  I'm the church that I went to down southern California was a small small
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:53.640]  group and the wonderful they they had guest speakers all over the country that
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:29:00.600]  were main at seven day Adventist ministers that traveled nationally I
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:04.160]  don't know if you ever heard of this particular one his name is Bill Hughes no
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:07.600]  no I told you I haven't followed up all the news and stuff I've I got my
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:12.760]  relationship with God but but what I'm asking you is what else did he say he
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.400]  just said well just don't trouble yourself don't get involved in that
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:21.760]  yes specifically on him up just a nice man clean cut very intelligent you know
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:28.040]  tall then you know that gray glasses you know very very distinguished and like
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:33.280]  head-bundered yeah yeah exactly later what he would do he would sit down the
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:37.360]  church next to me and you know he would talk to me see I was doing and I don't
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:42.480]  know if he was trying to do some type of a connecting with me there but we didn't
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:46.360]  speak much more about it but oh after you talked about the New World Order he
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:51.600]  was intelligence gathering on you oh this one we're on the March the
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:58.720]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:38.640]  calls it just becomes a quagmire when you try to debate different religious
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:44.440]  groups and things all people need to know is is that every religious group in
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:48.840]  this country and every denomination I mean it was over a hundred thousand
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:53.760]  preachers four years ago and we haven't gotten any intel on it since then they
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:59.880]  started out with like ten thousand and two thousand and two that we know of and
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:04.920]  then they kept doubling it each year and it was well over a hundred thousand by
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:09.760]  two thousand and eight or so and I mean it's super creepy we got the document
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:13.200]  it's like prepare them for the forced inoculation prepare them to go to the
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:16.880]  emergency centers prepare them to turn in their firearms and that Jesus would
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.880]  want them to tell them everything's fine let the emergency take place do as
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.960]  you're told and we'll sort everything out later and we've got all these
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:29.520]  manuals and handbooks and everything and then you see the preacher on TV going
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:33.280]  do what's the Lord tells you we'll sort everything out later don't trouble
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.960]  yourselves with what's happening don't be involved do what you're told and they
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.200]  said on the newscast the preachers help the government with their biggest
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:46.120]  threat and problem the people this idea like it's government and the federal
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:52.080]  family as they call themselves that's what mafia means the family or our thing
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:35:01.120]  La Cosa Nostra and again we just do what we're told sure you're walking your
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:04.400]  dog here in the park well this is a dog walk part well it's not now it's now
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.240]  Forest Service oh I didn't know that but give me your ID I don't I don't have
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:12.200]  one I'm walking dogs well you're detained ten minutes later tell me why I'm
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:17.560]  detained well I gotta go I gotta go to work I'm leaving taser and to them
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:22.040]  that's reasonable because they work for narcotics trafficking murderers oh by
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:25.360]  the way I'll go to this and I'll go to your calls is a threatened holder with
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:30.640]  contempt Politico house oversight committee chairman Darrell Issa threatened
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:33.480]  Tuesday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress of the
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:36.400]  Justice Department did not provide certain documents in response to the
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:40.800]  committee subpoena so I guess they don't care that holder threatened to bring
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.480]  out Bush's involvement in this pre-holder there he's going ahead with a
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.820]  little bit there maybe I'm gonna be wrong maybe they're not just scoring
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:51.840]  political points in a letter to Holder Issa wrote that this committee will have
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:55.600]  no alternative but to move forward proceedings to hold you in contempt of
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:01.360]  Congress if Holder and DOJ didn't produce documents they demanded relating to
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:06.320]  fast and furious gun walking scandal Holder has until Thursday February 9th to
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:09.960]  comply according to Issa Issa accused the Justice Department of trying to
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:13.760]  obstruct our investigation and deceive the public by withholding documents
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:17.880]  really got caught lying I mean folks I pointed out a year ago when this broke
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:23.480]  that they gave press conferences about their gun walking program three years
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:28.200]  ago they said the second amendments to blame you have him giving press
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:32.800]  conferences I've aired these with miss Mr. Nepolitano I mean Mrs. Nepolitano
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:40.320]  three's the charm miss Nepolitano or madame madame as they call her in
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:45.320]  Congress madame I guess she is a madame pimping us out to the New World Order
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:51.840]  madame because she runs all the little pimp gropers at the TSA and she said I
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:54.840]  never heard of it never and then you cut to news conferences with her talking
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:58.720]  about it none of this was secret we knew six and a half years ago that there was
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.760]  a program shipping guns into Mexico to destabilize things and later blame the
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:08.520]  Second Amendment before Obama was even on the radar screen Celica still all the
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:12.800]  other interviews I've done it's all on record and then in February of last
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:17.200]  year it comes out in Chicago National Security declared in a Soa Loa drug
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:20.160]  cartel case where they declared national security and said we're allowed to ship
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:25.240]  cocaine in and you ship us guns and the government came in and said national
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:28.560]  security we agree it's true but national security you cannot bring this up and
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:33.920]  then it came out in other cases this was first on prisonplanet.com our
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.640]  listeners pointed it out to us we wrote an article then it was in El Paso
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:43.000]  Times Chicago Tribune but never a big national story so they knew it was
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.960]  coming out so 60 minutes came out and said well they ordered gun shop owners
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:54.280]  to let people buy guns illegally to track them that was all a cover so
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:58.960]  everybody has that in their head oh the sting went wrong that was gonna be
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:02.760]  their cover in Oklahoma City if they got caught it was a sting gone wrong no
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:07.720]  no no things went as planned it's just that ATF people wouldn't go along with
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.080]  it and leaked it and investigative journalist Wayne Madsen's done the
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:15.640]  interviews with high-level federal whistleblowers and others off record
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:20.560]  sources confirming what we first heard that judge Roel and Giffords who were
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:26.320]  both by the way pro-second amendment in New Mexico and into the Arizona area
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:29.080]  that they were investigating in both areas they were even talking to West
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:34.120]  Texas people that were involved according to Madsen West Texas Congress
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:39.440]  people US Congress people about this and well you know the rest of the story
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:46.360]  don't you okay let's go ahead and talk to Leon in Nevada thanks for holding
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.160]  sir good afternoon Alex and thanks for giving me a chance to a report on a
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.720]  couple things here locally last night I went to a local casino here and watch
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:39:00.240]  Dr. Ron Paul speak and I gotta say there was such an amazingly huge crowd it was
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:06.080]  probably bigger than the 2008 entire county convention that happened there
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:09.920]  was a huge number of people went when the question was asked how many people
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:14.000]  planned on being delegates were on par this season I think every day and in the
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.640]  other place went up there had to been I mean there was well over 500 people as
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:22.560]  an outstanding event and then the other thing I wanted to mention was you know
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:29.760]  the the continual habitual sabotage that the the state party does here seems to
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.360]  be going its way again this year you know that a Sheldon Addison is a local
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:39.960]  casino magnets contributed $10 million to the Gingrich campaign evidently here
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:45.040]  about three weeks ago the Clark County GOP decided to have a special caucus
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.840]  after all of the rest of the caucuses were closed through the state here in
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:52.920]  Clark County they started 8 o'clock and I think they're supposed to wrap up by
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:59.680]  around 3 or 4 o'clock a special caucus will be held at 7 p.m. coincidentally at
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:04.400]  a school that has Sheldon Addison's name on the Sheldon Addison Educational
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:08.960]  Center and there's a good possibility that they're you know gonna try to fix
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.400]  the numbers on that and like I said again it's just the habitual sabotage
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:16.960]  that they keep performing here in this state I remember when Aaron Russo ran
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:21.520]  for governor they did everything to they could to discredit him they shut
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:26.000]  down the state convention in 08 to prevent a Brown Paul win and then when
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.640]  Sharon Angle got the nomination they did everything they could to sabotage her
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:33.640]  campaign of course no no I remember let me let me comment on that that's a lot
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:36.360]  I appreciate your calling holding to talk about that but I need to get to
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.800]  others but let me just comment on things you've talked about there briefly
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.880]  Ron Paul's got all these Hollywood endorsements all these sports
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:49.800]  endorsements more bumper stickers and signs everywhere wins all the major
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:54.560]  polls straw polls raises more money than all candidates combined for the
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:59.240]  military so by every other metric he's the front runner but they keep telling
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:05.800]  you he can't win he can't win so when they cheat him you then feel like well
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:10.480]  he must have not won no there is fraud going on but there was fraud four years
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:15.200]  ago now they're having more trouble he's there getting the word out about
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:21.480]  liberty and it's exposing election fraud and it shows people when they give him
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:24.840]  less debate time and when they do cover him they're negative or when they do
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:28.560]  when he does win a poll he'll be number one so they don't mention who was
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:31.320]  number one it'll be number two they don't mention who got number two that's
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:36.520]  showing people that it's a rigged fight you know Don King had to put on a lot of
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:42.960]  rigged fights before people finally stop watching his pay-per-views and so we
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:47.200]  point out it's fake people so well that's an oxymoron support Ron Paul give
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:50.200]  him money get behind him but your singers fraud not everywhere but it's
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:55.080]  enough to throw it but you get on the field because that's how you expose it
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:58.520]  that's not an oxymoron people that look at things in a one-dimensional way see
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:05.560]  it as an oxymoron so that's going on also I'll be honest I didn't do a lot of
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:08.320]  research on this I mean I've got some background knowledge quite a bit
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:13.040]  actually but I don't listen to neocon radio I don't follow a lot of what
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:17.800]  they're up to I see bits and pieces and I've now really done some research the
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:23.480]  last week to see why one part of the Republican establishment is attacking
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:26.680]  Newt Gennrich and the other half is saying he's basically God and what's
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:30.440]  going on there there's a lot of things Gennrich is unstable is dangerous is
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.640]  is connected many Republican leaders and I said this years ago but but now
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:38.440]  they're coming out with it is basically a Democratic operative and tied in with
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:45.280]  the Clinton East is he's been endorsed by Sarah Palin who's a big globalist he's
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:52.360]  been endorsed by you know all all these other former senators and people Thompson
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:58.280]  the rest of them and I actually did some research he's been endorsed by all the
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:06.400]  big neocon talk show host all of them which is weird because you've got mint
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:10.440]  Romney tied in with Bain Capital that especially in the past still to some
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:15.920]  extent owns most of clear channel so it's really weird but the reason you're
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:22.840]  seeing such a attack on Gennrich is I think because they know he's got so
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.120]  much luggage that he is basically a ringer anyway you slice it but I mean
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:32.160]  Romney's a globalist too so it's a mess but I saw an article in a telegraph the
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:35.960]  New York Times and there's hundreds of articles I see come across on time to
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:41.840]  read them but I scan that the headline attacking drudge and the normal thing is
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:45.520]  to say drudge is dead no one visits drudge when he's got more traffic than
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:51.040]  ever more the New York Times Twitter Facebook combined you look that up and
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:55.640]  then I saw literally articles everywhere family from the from the control left
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:44:00.400]  saying he's endorsing Mitt Romney well I look at drudge every day that's not
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:05.200]  what's happening drudge when there's a big Ron Paul volley is covering Ron
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:08.680]  Paul or when there's a big deal with the you know Gennrich or somebody he
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:12.840]  covers that he covers whatever the zeitgeist is he's got a nose for the
[02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:18.280]  zeitgeist if you want to quote for Matt drudge he has a nose for the zeitgeist
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:23.200]  because it's what he's into and and so they're trying to say he's got some
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:28.080]  political acts well all the media has their own views go into things you can
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:33.000]  tell he doesn't like the TSA you can tell he's broken in the last five years
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.280]  and forced the mainstream media to admit Bilderberg's real by carrying our
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:40.120]  articles and now that mainstream media is covering and he links to them too I
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:44.080]  mean drudge I supposed to do his radio show on Sunday nights whenever I got a
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.520]  chance because he was against cloning and all this crazy stuff and spying and
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:53.840]  surveillance he gets it he gets it you know he got run out of Fox News because
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:58.360]  he was pro-life they don't want somebody up there they want to say I'm pro-life
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:03.040]  but they're not rock the boat and keep it going so they've got all these
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.600]  articles coming out you know saying oh my gosh you know he's endorsing Mitt
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:11.800]  Romney and that's not what's happening a lot of Republicans and people all he
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:15.320]  was doing is linking to all these articles pointing out how bad new
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:20.840]  Gendrich is and when stuff was coming out on other candidates like Rick Perry
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.680]  he was linking to it because that's the feeding frenzy that's the news that's
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:32.120]  what's going on he mainly just covers what is the real zeitgeist on the
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:39.880]  internet not the zeitgeist that the prostitutes try to create he covers the
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:44.840]  buzz I'd say 80% of it's that it's just whatever is interesting like you go
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:47.780]  there there's an article about pythons all over Florida killing most the
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:54.640]  wildlife that's interesting or tasering a guy for walking his dogs at what was
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:46:01.520]  a dog park a week before and now is a national park that's interesting and so
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.400]  what it's about is it's about jealousy and that's why the establishment media
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:13.960]  attacks us and says we're not credible as well because I wear my views on my
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:19.120]  sleeve I talk about what I really think I'm not hiding what I stand for and I'm
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:22.840]  giving you my views my facts my analysis all right I'm done talking about
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:27.760]  that and you know again you wanna know where drudges at he's the guy more than
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:32.480]  any other big media outlet who's covered the cover up of Ron Paul he's
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:41.560]  carried our articles he's covered the suppression he's covered all of that so
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:48.280]  basically it is a grassroots zeitgeist deal it's a big zeitgeist that Ron Paul
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:53.400]  is being suppressed he covers it breaks they're scared of drugs because he's
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:47:01.080]  able to block media whore blockage he's able to break media blackouts and more
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:05.480]  and more as things get proven to drugs that building burgers real and once
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:09.040]  world government he's covering it as more and more comes out about the whole
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:14.120]  neural water plan he's covering and the fact that that can drive the major news
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:17.560]  is really freaking out the establishment and you know they call him the
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:22.320]  Howard Hughes in this article well you know what I've had people show up in
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:25.680]  parking lots and ask me if I want to blow stuff up before they're clearly a cop
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:29.000]  I mean maybe I should be like Howard Hughes you know maybe it's maybe it's
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:32.240]  good drudge doesn't really associate with the neocons anymore and go to their
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:35.760]  parties and hang out with people let me tell you something when you wake up to
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:39.560]  reality none of that crud matters anymore
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:42.960]  that drudge is the Howard Hughes the internet like Hughes he lives in
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:45.960]  splendid isolation communicating only through a small group of trusted friends
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:49.560]  like Hughes his influence has quietly helped shape Republican politics for
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.560]  generation but while the eccentric Hughes use money to put his pals in the
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:57.040]  White House drudge has always relied on blogs and tweets the drudge report
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:59.880]  which started its life as an email gossip column now receives millions of
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:04.560]  unique visitors per month about per day these these these I mean this is supposed
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:07.920]  to be a positive article they can't even get that right one tiny info where he's
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:11.040]  getting a million a day folks come on drudge is like you like we're like a
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:16.160]  small mountain there's a big Mount Olympus over here one study found that
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:19.560]  it drives more traffic than Twitter Facebook combined judges claim to be
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:22.400]  authentic voice of conservative movement is now under attack last week and it just
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:27.360]  goes on now yeah he's not authentic conservative because the New York Times
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:34.000]  says so now they're attacking drudge folks because he's going off the
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:46.880]  reservation yeah you know how do I know well I don't talk about private stuff
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:51.840]  but drudge did put out a tweet you know saying Alex Jones here's a quote from
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:57.160]  Alex Jones guys Google drudge tweets Alex Jones I forget it it was a quote
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:02.000]  from the show he tweeted the day after that was a Sunday show where I said
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:07.840]  living in reality is is exhausting I mean it's it's it's there's no rest for
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:11.760]  those living reality was basically the quote and obviously I see drudge I
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:18.320]  was at 3 a.m. and I'm seeing updating you know because once you get into this
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:23.760]  stuff it's addicting I mean I I if I just dedicated myself to having something
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:27.720]  like the drudge report I couldn't do the job he does I mean he just is always on
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:32.720]  always on always on and these media whores I mean you got the New York Times
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:38.240]  last time I saw it it spends like 300 400 million a year to run the New York
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:44.680]  Times or more and it has less traffic than drudge they don't like that they
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:50.920]  want to set the agenda they want to run the show let's jam another call right
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:58.000]  now Kara in Virginia go ahead hey can hear me yes I can welcome hi I've been

[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:45.720]  cities that have turned into prisons and that's because that the culture's been

[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:13.080]  maybe you're right I'm going from memory yeah I'm reading off the internet now I
[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:19.960]  said 86 to 13 and I was just totally surprised about this and you know you know
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:23.720]  the whole policy commentators we're not we're not supposed to be used against
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:28.680]  American citizens and everything like that but I just want to you know when

[02:58:57.320 --> 02:59:01.280]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:04.840]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:59:04.840 --> 02:59:10.000]  anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of

[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:08.200]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:24.080]  are you talking to Brandon who's a Marine just back from Afghanistan will
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:27.440]  jam in a few more here but you were saying when the economic collapse comes
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:34.800]  please continue yeah if the economic collapse comes then hopefully it does
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:41.200]  and we can get Ron Paul in there I know I've woken up hundreds of Marines that
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:45.560]  use Ron Paul supporters and actually woken them up to the New World Order and
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:50.840]  know what's going on and that's the big thing I mean without us or with the
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:55.400]  police that they you know the globalist bill of burgers they can't carry out
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:59.040]  there and by the way they've all committed crimes look at Corazon caught
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:03.800]  stealing money we know where it went we know who we got it you know where it
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:07.360]  went and he's caught lying and no one's getting in trouble I mean they're a
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:12.400]  bunch of crooks I mean it should be easy to wake people up and throw them in
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:17.560]  jail and get our country back exactly I've been waking up Marines ever since
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:24.480]  I found out I actually got on info wars from another Marines brand and woke up
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.480]  and like you said earlier once you're awake it's so easy to see what's going
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:33.240]  on man let me ask you about the opium have you seen the newscast where they
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:39.240]  show the Marines ordered to help grow it no man when I was in Afghanistan we
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:45.840]  weren't even I mean the opium wasn't even an issue just let the opium grow you
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:51.480]  know let's you know everything like that you know we're there to nation build
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:57.760]  get the you know Afghan people away from the Taliban and all this the whole time
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:02.800]  I've done two deployments in Afghanistan two deployments in Iraq I have not
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:08.640]  one seen one single actual al-Qaeda member out of the whole thing and I
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:13.120]  was a new group in England who was inspired by al-Qaeda it's always
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:18.160]  inspired hey are any of your Marine buddies going why is al-Qaeda being given
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:26.240]  Libya yeah yeah I mean that no no nobody's there we haven't really talked
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:29.480]  about that I've talked to Marine and Army people who were there in the first
[03:02:29.480 --> 03:02:34.000]  few years they said they would go with CNN two separate ones Army ones Marine
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:38.200]  ones Arranger ones I think force recon but the point is and they said they would
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:41.560]  go with CNN and say we're here at an al-Qaeda base no one's ever been here
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:44.760]  and there'd be MREs and stuff everywhere and they'd find out from their
[03:02:44.760 --> 03:02:49.080]  buddy later that their unit had been there a month before with Fox News just
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:54.200]  it was all fake he said they blow up fake bunkers everything else oh yeah
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:02:58.240]  definitely definitely I mean I was in the Sanging district was like the last
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:05.440]  Taliban stronghold and you know the Afghan wars basically I mean basically
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:10.040]  won according to the globalist they basically accomplished what they won
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:14.880]  out of Afghanistan but of course they're going to drag it on and keep on
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:18.040]  I mean isn't Afghanistan just a bunch of tribes killing each other who'll be
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:23.920]  killing each other when the troops are gone that's it it's just the law you
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:29.160]  lawless corrupt society I mean there's no point of us being there you know I'm
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:33.560]  a huge Ron Paul supporter we just need to get our troops back home there is no
[03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:41.040]  threat the Taliban are so-called Taliban whatever they are I mean they fight us
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:45.680]  we go out there on patrol they ambushes whatever it's probably just we're on
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:50.920]  their turf I mean you look at it the other way around I see a Chinese guy
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:55.960]  walking down a squad walking down my street taking over my country you know
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:02.160]  what I'm gonna go I'm gonna go crazy too bro I'm gonna you know but anyway so
[03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:06.840]  the Marines know that they understand that yeah yeah at least my Marines do
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:11.040]  my marines well they must know Ron Paul's getting the majority of them
