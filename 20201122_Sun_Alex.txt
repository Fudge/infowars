[00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:20.413]  Ladies and gentlemen, the head of the Federal Elections Commission has gone public and said there was massive fraud orchestrated across the country against President Trump and against the American people.
[00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:22.654]  That is coming up.
[00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.541]  We also have Senator Kramer coming out and saying Trump has every right to be challenged in this election.
[00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:30.522]  Al Gore didn't concede for 38 days.
[00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:31.623]  It's only been 20 days here.
[00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:34.665]  We're going to lay it all out today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.325]  So much huge breaking news.
[00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:39.407]  The Supreme Court moving in to certify the election for Trump.
[00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:40.387]  And so much more.
[00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:45.670]  You don't want to miss this live Sunday transmission, November 22nd, 2020.
[00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.411]  But first, a key report.
[00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.832]  The election fraud in four minutes.
[00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:52.266]  The company is called Dominion Voting.
[00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.928]  It's used in 28 states.
[00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:58.593]  Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion.
[00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:08.505]  Several days ago, Dominion came under heavy fire after allegations that their machines caused thousands of votes in one Michigan county to be switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.
[00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:12.328]  It's a feature of the system that was designed with a back door so that people could watch in real time
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.086]  And calculate with an algorithm how many votes they needed to change to make the result they wanted to create.
[00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:44.709]  Each voting machine is a computer running a computer program.
[00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:54.776]  Whether that computer counts the votes accurately, or makes mistakes, or cheats by shifting votes from one candidate to another, depends on what software is installed in the computer.
[00:01:54.776 --> 00:02:00.580]  President Trump won by not just hundreds of thousands of votes, but by millions of votes.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.763]  We have so much evidence, I feel like it's coming in through a fire hose.
[00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:14.571]  In Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans, causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidates.
[00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:23.374]  The county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes.
[00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:31.518]  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same capacity.
[00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:37.021]  We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed.
[00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.981]  It was designed to rig elections.
[00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:41.963]  And the software development was funded by
[00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.765]  The Clinton Global Initiative.
[00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:45.946]  That's what the Democrats do.
[00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:48.628]  If they don't like the rules, they change them.
[00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:53.112]  And they change them at the last minute, they manipulate them, they want to tear down our American system.
[00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:55.173]  It is indeed a very foul mess.
[00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:58.576]  It is farther and wider and deeper than we ever thought.
[00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:02.780]  But we are going to go after it, and I am going to expose every one of them.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.542]  Installing that vote-stealing program in a voting machine takes 7 minutes per machine with a screwdriver.
[00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:11.283]  But really, the software I built was not rocket science.
[00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:14.044]  Any computer programmer could write the same code.
[00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:17.965]  Once it's installed, it could steal elections without detection for years to come.
[00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:23.867]  We've got statistical evidence that shows hundreds of thousands of votes being just put in and replicated.
[00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:28.429]  In total, about 500,000 votes were taken from Trump and switched to Biden.
[00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.149]  130,000 here, 27,000 there.
[00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.456]  You can see how there's 200,000 votes magically for Biden at 3 a.m.
[00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:37.437]  in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:43.245]  It's like drag and drop Trump votes to a separate folder and then delete that folder.
[00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:47.611]  Because you knew you were going to use those ballots to catch Biden up.
[00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.612]  This is literally global government.
[00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:55.856]  The communist Chinese and others want to take this country over and President Trump has been standing against that.
[00:03:55.856 --> 00:04:03.540]  And he was winning all these battleground states by higher numbers on election night till they closed the polls and then secretly stuffed the ballot boxes.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.241]  And so that's why they're scared of recounts.
[00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:07.522]  It's why they're scared of legislatures stepping in.
[00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:09.063]  That is their constitutional duty.
[00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:15.487]  This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating.
[00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:28.233]  And the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine for people in this country to have participated in in any way, shape, or form.
[00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:33.416]  And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated.
[00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:39.421]  American patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to the highest level
[00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:43.983]  We are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote.
[00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.122]  The great moment of truth is here.
[00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:14.207]  America discovered in the last five, six years that we were under globalist control and that traitors in both parties have sold us out to communist China and multinational corporations and we're establishing an authoritarian, anti-American system.
[00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:29.321]  Well now they've launched their counter-assault and through fraud are trying to steal the election right now and complete the police state takeover by bankrupting the people of the United States but also the entire world to bring us to our knees under the Great Reset.
[00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:36.184]  InfoWars has never been more valuable or more important, and I'm honored for the position that you've put me in, and for God's blessing.
[00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:47.968]  But I'm asking all listeners to understand that InfoWars is spending more money than we've ever spent in the fight to expose the stolen election, Agenda 21, the Great Reset, and the globalist takeover.
[00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:50.389]  So please visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.692]  We have the big stop-the-steal sale that I've extended to the weekend, but then it will end because so many products are about to sell out.
[00:05:55.692 --> 00:05:57.873]  Pre-shipping Triple Patriot points at 60% off.
[00:05:57.873 --> 00:05:58.753]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:02.575]  I don't know.
[00:06:14.932 --> 00:06:20.300]  Well, we told you about the 79 days of hell, that Election Day would just kick off.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:30.074]  The Democrats, attempting to steal the election, they promised they would hold it up right through the inauguration and would not concede under any circumstance.
[00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:39.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is November 22nd on this live Sunday worldwide transmission.
[00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:48.663]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be here live for the next two hours.
[00:06:48.663 --> 00:06:57.770]  Then Owen Schroer is coming in for the new show we've been doing during the election and during this coming up constitutional crisis and global crisis we accurately predicted.
[00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.311]  With the show Sunday live,
[00:07:01.002 --> 00:07:01.863]  6 to 8 p.m.
[00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:02.883]  Central Standard Time.
[00:07:02.883 --> 00:07:04.304]  Very powerful transmission.
[00:07:04.304 --> 00:07:06.406]  Takes a lot of calls, a lot of guests.
[00:07:06.406 --> 00:07:08.547]  Okay!
[00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:11.829]  Let me just tell you up front here what we got for you.
[00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:13.531]  I'm a realist.
[00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:18.154]  If Trump would have lost this election, I would have been completely honest about it and tell you.
[00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:20.575]  I don't make stuff up.
[00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:28.040]  I would have said Joe Biden needs to be arrested as a communist Chinese agent, on record, along with his son and the rest of his scumbag family.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.901]  But that's another issue.
[00:07:30.558 --> 00:07:34.481]  They stole this thing bigger than Dallas and that evidence is all out there.
[00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:43.667]  And now the globalists are death-threatening and twisting arms like you've never seen to get people out there, even folks we think we can trust, to turn against this process and say that there's not fraud.
[00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:56.696]  But we have the head of the Federal Elections Commission, there's a long interview up at InfoWars.com, but I'll play 43 seconds of it in a moment, saying there are seven documented examples of election fraud
[00:07:58.404 --> 00:08:02.186]  Which really is organized so it's not classical voter fraud.
[00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:10.669]  And then you have Senator Cramer saying Trump has every right to pursue legal avenues available to him.
[00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:18.053]  The idea that he's a dictator, the idea that this is criminal, the idea that it's unprecedented is just a lie on his face.
[00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:22.835]  Al Gore challenged for 37 days until the Supreme Court overturned him.
[00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:27.808]  And there have been elections that went for months before.
[00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:46.279]  The Democrats said, I'm not going to play the videos, you've seen them, there's hundreds of them, Pelosi, Hillary, Biden, Obama, all of them saying, we think there's a red mirage, we think he's going to win big, but we're going to have these magic votes that come in after, and so we're going to contest no matter what.
[00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:50.222]  I mean, they all said it, and now they're like, you never contest, that's what dictators do.
[00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:55.825]  So they're allowed to contest, but Trump isn't allowed to contest, and you see the spin.
[00:08:55.825 --> 00:09:02.150]  Oh, the governor of Georgia came out and said the election was clean and repudiated Trump.
[00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.054]  Well, the video is at Infowars.com.
[00:09:06.054 --> 00:09:18.985]  The governor came out and said there's clear evidence of fraud, called for a criminal investigation, and said that now that he's certified what the state operations head put out,
[00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:26.576]  That now Trump can come in and actually do a signature check, which reportedly they didn't even check the signatures.
[00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:29.077]  A lot of the ballots that got mailed didn't even have signatures.
[00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:30.937]  Those are all thrown out.
[00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:47.382]  Especially the ones that came in after the election, where in all these states, five battleground states, they ordered, the Postal Service did, employees that if something was after the election, November 4th, 5th, 6th, that you would backdate it so they could count it.
[00:09:49.206 --> 00:09:51.087]  This is all on record.
[00:09:51.087 --> 00:09:53.708]  Trump has an open and shut case on all this.
[00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:56.489]  And then next segment, I'll lay it out.
[00:09:56.489 --> 00:10:09.816]  The Supreme Court, unprecedentedly, came in and changed, in key battleground states, what Supreme Court justices were over what circuit.
[00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:16.839]  And so, who will be ruling on what cases to take from the circuits, and who will have control of those rulings to fast track them.
[00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:31.398]  And they've put Gorsuch, and they've put Thomas, and they've put Barrett, and they've put Alito, and they've put Kavanaugh over the four key states.
[00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:36.880]  So they are locked and loaded, a major signal, they see the fraud, they know the scam, they're moving in.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.243]  That's why there's almost no coverage of that, but I shot a two-hour report yesterday about it.
[00:10:43.294 --> 00:10:49.558]  And I shot another 15 minute report this morning on it that are at band.video.
[00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:51.400]  I would suggest you email those out.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.224]  I would suggest you share those if you want to defeat these criminals because the one thing big tech is counting on
[00:10:58.317 --> 00:10:58.617]  is that
[00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:27.729]  But do you believe there is voter fraud out there, specifically in Pennsylvania and other states that are weighing heavily in on this election?
[00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:43.326]  I do believe that there's voter fraud taking place in these places.
[00:11:43.326 --> 00:11:45.908]  Otherwise, they would allow the observers to go in.
[00:11:45.908 --> 00:12:02.715]  When you have claims of, you know, 10,000 people who don't live in the state of Nevada, having voted in Nevada, you have the video showing where people are, you know, they're either duplicating a spoiled ballot right there, or they're in the process of just marking a ballot that came in blank.
[00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.395]  Uh, for a voter.
[00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:07.476]  Uh, that's a process that needs to be observed by election observers.
[00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.596]  State law allows those observers to be in there.
[00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:15.098]  Uh, and if they're not, then the law's not being followed, making this, uh, an illegitimate election.
[00:12:15.098 --> 00:12:19.039]  Now, if you're a TV viewer, we're simulcasted radio and TV, you notice that's Newsmax.
[00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:22.679]  Their audience is about five-fold, so is ours.
[00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:25.940]  Newsmax has the head of the Federal Election Commission on.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.781]  They're not even having the head of the FEC on Fox, even Fox.
[00:12:30.882 --> 00:12:32.284]  That's the cover-up.
[00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:35.630]  So, he's on OAN, he's on Newsmax.
[00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.891]  Great!
[00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:36.592]  I'm glad they're out there.
[00:12:36.592 --> 00:12:37.734]  I'm not in competition with them.
[00:12:37.734 --> 00:12:38.756]  I'm in competition with the globalists.
[00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:39.317]  I want to defeat them.
[00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:53.056]  But CNN's had a bunch of their hosts call for OAN and Newsmax to be shut down under the Fairness Doctrine and bring back what was overturned in 1984 by Reagan, totally unconstitutional.
[00:12:53.056 --> 00:12:56.658]  They're saying we're nonpartisan at CNN and MSNBC.
[00:12:56.658 --> 00:13:04.501]  We can say what we want and say that Trump's a dictator, but you can't have Newsmax or Infowars and have
[00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:12.907]  The head of the Federal Elections Commission on to say there is fraud, and then to show video of people marking ballots.
[00:13:12.907 --> 00:13:17.272]  Remember what got caught in early voting a month before the election?
[00:13:17.272 --> 00:13:30.445]  In Pennsylvania, a man sitting there, the observers had to sit back over 50 yards away, but Yahoo News zoomed in and it showed the man filling ballots out and looking over his shoulder.
[00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:34.455]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:36.096]  It's caught on video.
[00:13:36.096 --> 00:13:37.557]  Let me tell you what's happening here.
[00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:38.738]  I've been working seven days a week.
[00:13:38.738 --> 00:13:40.580]  I'm not complaining.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.401]  But I, my hair is falling out.
[00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:45.644]  I mean, my God, I'm so stressed out about this.
[00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:49.306]  And I'm sitting there and I was up here this morning at 7 a.m.
[00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:49.927]  with Rob Dub.
[00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.730]  No place I'd rather be.
[00:13:52.730 --> 00:14:08.717]  And we're looking at his computer and it's a law firm in Michigan, sent us dozens of videos and depositions and sworn video affidavits and the affidavits of all these witnesses that were in Detroit and the fraud, all sworn, all in court from one law firm.
[00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:12.819]  And I was in there for hours just trying to watch it.
[00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:15.800]  And it was all incredible.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.222]  That law firm tries to put it up on YouTube, taken down.
[00:14:22.645 --> 00:14:30.135]  So, I'm scrambling to get the little bit of crew we got, because folks got to have some time off, got a skeleton crew tonight, to try to upload those law firm videos.
[00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:33.218]  This is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:33.218 --> 00:14:34.200]  The clock is ticking.
[00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:47.499]  So yeah, I'm racing around like a chicken with my head cut off because the Chi-Coms, the globalists, are taking our country over and they are announcing a new lockdown if Biden gets in to break us financially and bring us into slavery.
[00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:50.019]  And I'm not going to sit here and I'm not going to take it.
[00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:55.380]  And I'm not going to run my mouth about, well, if they keep this up, we'll just have a physical war.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.321]  Balderdash.
[00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:02.962]  If you're not fighting hard now in the info war, you're never going to pick up a gun in a physical war.
[00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:04.810]  I'm
[00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:31.920]  Klaus Schwab, the UN, the head of the IMF are all saying, America's done.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.680]  We're using COVID to shut them down.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.521]  We're going to punish Americans for Trump.
[00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:37.942]  They're giving speeches about how it's all made up.
[00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:40.002]  Klaus Schwab goes, oh, COVID's not even a threat.
[00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:42.063]  We're just using it to shut everything down.
[00:15:42.063 --> 00:15:45.664]  I mean, God Almighty, these people are arrogant.
[00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:48.444]  They've miscalculated again, just like Hitler did.
[00:15:48.444 --> 00:15:49.865]  And they're going to find out.
[00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.165]  They're going to find out.
[00:15:52.165 --> 00:15:54.306]  We're going to defeat these people together.
[00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:54.746]  Spread the word.
[00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:55.306]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:58.197 --> 00:16:06.884]  You know, something very sad is happening, and it's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when Infowars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:22.357]  I warned everybody there was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until, effectively, there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationalists, and populists.
[00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.058]  And now that's happened.
[00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:37.744]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown, and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 as basically an overblown hoax.
[00:16:37.744 --> 00:16:44.767]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:52.630]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us, and they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy, to try to control us.
[00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.698]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
[00:16:58.897 --> 00:17:04.099]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:21.666]  And it's the fact that InfoWars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:22.927]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:25.688]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:31.050]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:36.693]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[00:17:36.693 --> 00:17:41.195]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:52.260]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world of what's really happening.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.060]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.101]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.740]  The games are over.
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.781]  The waiting is over.
[00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:03.462]  The fight is now out in the open.
[00:18:03.462 --> 00:18:04.062]  World government
[00:18:19.594 --> 00:18:20.875]  We're good to go.
[00:18:38.955 --> 00:18:47.386]  InfoWars can only stay in the fight and continue to be the tip of the spear if you financially support us by getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:47.386 --> 00:18:55.596]  And we have one of the biggest sales of the year, about to end, up to 60% off, triple patriot points and free shipping with the Stop the Steal special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:59.068 --> 00:19:05.730]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:11.711]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:12.932]  Incredible!
[00:19:12.932 --> 00:19:21.814]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[00:19:21.814 --> 00:19:22.995]  That is a fact.
[00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:28.236]  And all the hero sheep that wear the mask to go along with this are signing on to mass murder
[00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:30.117]  Bigger than what Hitler did.
[00:19:30.117 --> 00:19:33.578]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:42.522]  This is a medical, world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IDs, and coming with forced inoculations.
[00:19:42.522 --> 00:19:47.604]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.405]  That story's on Infowars.com.
[00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:57.649]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you do not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary Great Reset.
[00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:16.067]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.067 --> 00:20:24.509]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:34.896]  So according to law, according to history, according to common practice, Trump is well within his rights.
[00:20:34.896 --> 00:20:37.777]  In fact, it's his duty to challenge a fraudulent election.
[00:20:37.777 --> 00:20:46.900]  It's we the people they're attempting to steal our sacred right and birthright of determining our own leaders from.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.200]  Remember this four years ago?
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.081]  I keep showing this every day on the show.
[00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:52.381]  It hangs on the wall outside my office.
[00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:57.823]  Madam President Newsweek reportedly printed a quarter million of these and said she was the president.
[00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:18.981]  Well this year they just said, how about we just have all the controlled corporate media, and have all these world leaders, all these people, sit there and congratulate him as the winner, even though that's not how the law works, even though Hillary said we're gonna contest, it's our right to contest, which it was, and then just gaslight everybody and say that that's the case.
[00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:29.410]  Hell, by this yardstick, they might as well just say that Hillary really won the election in 2020.
[00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:40.561]  And of course, if she's able to steal it, make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were picked because they want one thing, status and money.
[00:21:40.561 --> 00:21:42.103]  They don't want to run nothing.
[00:21:43.117 --> 00:21:57.701]  Joe Biden and Kamala are known as, put me on private jets, give me money, give me palaces, give me caviar, give me sex, give me drugs, and I don't want anything else.
[00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:01.263]  The bottom of the barrel.
[00:22:01.263 --> 00:22:03.823]  That's all this is.
[00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.744]  And so it is a hundred percent fraud.
[00:22:07.898 --> 00:22:09.280]  Complete!
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.927]  When they tell you that Trump's a dictator and it's unprecedented what he's doing.
[00:22:12.927 --> 00:22:14.830]  All of it's a lie on its face.
[00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.793]  I'm not going to repeat all the evidence.
[00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:17.294]  Al Gore, 37 days.
[00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:20.149]  Supreme Court rolled against him.
[00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:21.130]  That's what Trump said.
[00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.993]  He said months ago, he said, bad stuff in Pennsylvania, bad stuff in Georgia.
[00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:32.039]  Hell, they had PBS documentaries a month before the election saying it's totally fraudulent with decertified machines in all these states.
[00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:37.543]  Oh, but the news is like, there's no evidence to Minion Software and Smartmatic are bad.
[00:22:37.543 --> 00:22:43.508]  They've just been kicked out of all these other countries and all these other states because they've been caught in election fraud.
[00:22:44.431 --> 00:22:48.434]  It's like, oh, Jeffrey Dahmer's on death row for eating people.
[00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:52.397]  They're like, oh, next you're going to claim Jeffrey Dahmer ate people.
[00:22:52.397 --> 00:23:00.604]  I mean, next you're going to claim that, you know, if you live in Florida by a pond, watch out, alligators don't eat your dog.
[00:23:00.604 --> 00:23:03.846]  You know, it's just what these criminals do.
[00:23:03.846 --> 00:23:09.411]  And then they sit there and gaslight us after Russiagate and the fake impeachment and all of it.
[00:23:09.411 --> 00:23:10.772]  And they just decided, no Trump.
[00:23:12.622 --> 00:23:20.205]  You know, they say that, yeah, more than double the number of blacks voted for Trump than voted last time, and more than double Hispanics.
[00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:28.409]  Yeah, he got, but you know, and women voted for Trump more than last time, but oh, it was white men didn't vote for Trump.
[00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:31.230]  Oh, old dead white men, you mean.
[00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.471]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:23:33.471 --> 00:23:37.793]  But they just go, no evidence of fraud, no evidence of fraud, no evidence of fraud.
[00:23:37.793 --> 00:23:39.114]  President-elect, we say so.
[00:23:40.771 --> 00:23:45.255]  And the media just declares him the winner when that's not how this works.
[00:23:45.255 --> 00:23:46.576]  Wow.
[00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:50.659]  Just like the COVID fraud is used to shut the economy down and blame Trump for COVID.
[00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:55.943]  It's already plagued you, the FEC chairman, coming out and saying there's massive evidence of election fraud.
[00:23:55.943 --> 00:24:03.429]  Here's Senator Kramer, Kevin Kramer, talking about the reality that of course Trump has the right to do this.
[00:24:03.429 --> 00:24:03.750]  Here it is.
[00:24:04.246 --> 00:24:08.089]  But I'm going to use Senator Pat Toomey, your Republican colleague from Pennsylvania.
[00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:14.893]  Here's what he said last night after the decision came down to essentially throw out the president's lawsuit in Pennsylvania.
[00:24:14.893 --> 00:24:29.943]  With today's decision by Judge Matthew Brand, a longtime conservative Republican, whom I know to be a fair and unbiased jurist, to dismiss the Trump campaign's lawsuit, President Trump has exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result of the presidential race in Pennsylvania.
[00:24:29.943 --> 00:24:32.885]  I congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
[00:24:33.445 --> 00:24:34.925]  On their victory.
[00:24:34.925 --> 00:24:39.966]  Do you concur with Senator Toomey that it is now over?
[00:24:39.966 --> 00:24:42.287]  Chuck, first of all, again, thanks for the opportunity to be with you.
[00:24:42.287 --> 00:24:46.088]  And no, I do not, although I think it's very likely.
[00:24:46.088 --> 00:25:02.351]  That said, I think we, again, I don't know why we're so easily offended by a president that's carrying out all of his legal options in court, not enhancing or encouraging any riots or burnings of buildings or beating up of Democrats coming out of
[00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:05.192]  Okay, the full nine minute clip is at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:06.192]  I suggest you go watch it now.
[00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:33.641]  You heard him saying, yeah, looks like it's unlikely Trump will win.
[00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:35.702]  Only because we're being conned.
[00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:39.864]  Just like they said Iraq had WMDs and they didn't.
[00:25:39.864 --> 00:25:42.845]  We're being gaslit.
[00:25:42.845 --> 00:25:43.866]  We're being lied to.
[00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:53.558]  That was an Obama judge that we knew was going to throw it out without even looking at the evidence in Pennsylvania.
[00:25:53.558 --> 00:26:00.022]  And that's what Trump's lawyers said, it's what I said, is it's going to the Supreme Court.
[00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:02.544]  What did Trump say four months ago with the vote-in ballot?
[00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:07.387]  And the 80 million, he said that's illegal, they're gonna stuff it, it's gonna go to the Supreme Court.
[00:26:07.387 --> 00:26:09.669]  He's known this the whole time!
[00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:10.370]  So have we!
[00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.552]  How did we say 79 days to hell?
[00:26:12.552 --> 00:26:13.933]  How did we say this was coming up?
[00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:16.515]  Because it was all there!
[00:26:16.515 --> 00:26:18.677]  But the general public are spectators.
[00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:22.981]  They just watch things minute to minute, don't remember the last thing that happened.
[00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:28.486]  And real consciousness is remembering things.
[00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:30.608]  Is having a continuity and understanding.
[00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:33.523]  So here's what I want to go over.
[00:26:33.523 --> 00:26:36.824]  I want to go to clip 5.
[00:26:36.824 --> 00:26:40.806]  Roger Stone, Bill Gates, Microsoft design election fraud software use.
[00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:47.868]  Yeah, we keep talking about Dominion or Smartmatic and they're bad and they've been decertified most places.
[00:26:47.868 --> 00:26:50.269]  But a lot of the other companies are using
[00:26:52.472 --> 00:26:57.194]  Gates software that all over the world's been flagged and caught for fraud.
[00:26:57.194 --> 00:27:00.515]  Gates is involved in NewsGuard, telling you what news you can read.
[00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:01.656]  He's trying to be your doctor.
[00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:04.097]  He's trying to tell you how to take these vaccines.
[00:27:04.097 --> 00:27:06.458]  He's involved in everything.
[00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:13.121]  And now they've announced, Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, that Bill Gates will tell him what to do and be his chief advisor.
[00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:19.155]  When the UK takes over the rotating post of the G7.
[00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:20.897]  Incredibly important.
[00:27:20.897 --> 00:27:24.080]  So, we talk about Bill Gates as your doctor, Bill Gates as your president.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.965]  Hell, now Bill Gates will be the most powerful G7 president.
[00:27:28.965 --> 00:27:30.006]  That's globalism.
[00:27:30.006 --> 00:27:32.969]  I mean, Bill Gates is a New World Order operative.
[00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:34.731]  He's making his move.
[00:27:34.731 --> 00:27:36.232]  He's the commander.
[00:27:36.232 --> 00:27:37.453]  He's the Darth Vader.
[00:27:37.453 --> 00:27:38.935]  I keep telling you that.
[00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:41.747]  Here's Roger Stone talking about it.
[00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:43.207]  Roger Stone.
[00:27:43.207 --> 00:27:48.790]  All the controversy regarding Dominion voting systems is but the tip of the iceberg.
[00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.510]  Here's the real villain.
[00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.632]  It's none other than Bill Gates and Microsoft.
[00:27:53.632 --> 00:28:08.458]  You see, Microsoft designed a software called Election Guard that's being used by Dominion, as well as Election Services, Heart InterCivic, CleanBallot, Election Systems and Hardware, Bepro, and Smartmatic.
[00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:09.018]  In other words,
[00:28:10.404 --> 00:28:20.997]  100% of the voting machines and voting systems in this country are using the same software that Dominion has been caught using to switch votes.
[00:28:20.997 --> 00:28:25.522]  The denial by the mainstream media that there's any evidence whatsoever
[00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.432]  Alright folks, that's the Stone Cold Truth.
[00:28:28.432 --> 00:28:29.093]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:51.411 --> 00:28:57.652]  With more election fraud, what they're going to pull next, how to stop them, then I'm going to shift gears into their larger plan.
[00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:16.278]  Most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[00:29:16.278 --> 00:29:22.802]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night.
[00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:25.364]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:26.264]  This is completely transparent.
[00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:29.366]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:30.287]  Trump has not conceded.
[00:29:30.287 --> 00:29:32.388]  None of the states have certified the vote.
[00:29:32.388 --> 00:29:34.590]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:40.213]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:40.814]  And in Georgia,
[00:29:41.514 --> 00:29:44.016]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:46.297]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[00:29:46.297 --> 00:29:50.239]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time, because the last hoax failed.
[00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:54.382]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[00:29:54.382 --> 00:29:56.543]  As we know it, we will beat Venezuela.

[00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:06.634]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[00:30:06.634 --> 00:30:17.156]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns where you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[00:30:17.156 --> 00:30:26.918]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[00:30:27.478 --> 00:30:30.740]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.662]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[00:30:33.662 --> 00:30:35.202]  This is world government.
[00:30:35.202 --> 00:30:39.905]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:41.926]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:44.368]  This is what the communist takeover looks like.
[00:30:44.368 --> 00:30:48.250]  To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely
[00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.977]  Transform the world into a prison planet.
[00:30:51.977 --> 00:30:53.981]  How long have we warned you about this?
[00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:55.324]  But you can fight back.
[00:30:55.324 --> 00:30:57.208]  America is the last bastion.
[00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:58.029]  Stop submitting.
[00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:14.932]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[00:31:14.932 --> 00:31:18.434]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:21.695]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[00:31:21.695 --> 00:31:25.238]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[00:31:25.238 --> 00:31:27.499]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[00:31:27.499 --> 00:31:28.920]  I suggest Band.Video.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:35.044]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[00:31:35.044 --> 00:31:43.510]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:51.376]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:53.037]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[00:32:00.282 --> 00:32:02.505]  It's a great moment of truth this year.
[00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:14.641]  America discovered in the last five, six years that we were under globalist control and that traitors in both parties had sold us out to communist China and multinational corporations and would establish the authoritarian anti-American system.
[00:32:15.442 --> 00:32:29.718]  Well now they've launched their counter-assault and through fraud are trying to steal the election right now and complete the police takeover by bankrupting the people of the United States but also the entire world to bring us to our knees under the Great Reset.
[00:32:30.439 --> 00:32:36.582]  InfoWars has never been more valuable or more important and I'm honored for the position that you've put me in and for God's blessing.
[00:32:36.582 --> 00:32:48.408]  But I'm asking all listeners to understand that InfoWars is spending more money than we've ever spent in the fight to expose the stolen election, Agenda 21, the Great Reset, and the globalist takeover.
[00:32:48.408 --> 00:32:50.810]  So please visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:56.112]  We have the big stop-the-steal sale that I've extended through the weekend but then it will end because so many products are about to sell out.
[00:32:56.112 --> 00:32:58.293]  Pre-shipping Triple Patriot points at 60% off.

[00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:15.928]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.928 --> 00:33:17.869]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.869 --> 00:33:22.371]  Coming up... Let me kick off.
[00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:23.932]  Hour number two.
[00:33:23.932 --> 00:33:26.894]  The answer to their tyranny is 1776.
[00:33:26.894 --> 00:33:29.495]  That means resisting and not complying.
[00:33:31.186 --> 00:33:34.708]  They tell us leave the borders wide open, let child smugglers bring kids across.
[00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:43.574]  They tell us let pedophilia be promoted on Netflix, but you can't open your gym up, you can't open your church up eight months into this COVID fraud, this COVID deception.
[00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:53.235]  Next hour, I've got the videos of the uprising in Europe, in Germany, in England, and in California and New York.
[00:33:53.235 --> 00:34:07.445]  Californians revolt, anti-lockdown protests storm the streets, gather outside Gavin Newsom's home in defiance of curfew after Newsom got caught, had huge parties not wearing masks, Chicago Mayor Lightfoot.
[00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.025]  All of them!
[00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:09.646]  Of course it's a fraud!
[00:34:09.646 --> 00:34:10.567]  They're criminals!
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.523]  I had a major whistleblower contact us a few days ago.
[00:34:14.523 --> 00:34:16.746]  We've confirmed their identity.
[00:34:16.746 --> 00:34:20.491]  I'm not going to say what area they're in, but it's high level.
[00:34:22.932 --> 00:34:26.435]  Governmental real COVID tracking by hospital groups.
[00:34:26.435 --> 00:34:32.219]  And COVID has less than one-tenth of one percent morbidity rate.
[00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:36.722]  And they know it's a fraud and they know it's a scam.
[00:34:36.722 --> 00:34:40.125]  And they're told to put everybody that dies of something else in the list.
[00:34:40.125 --> 00:34:45.789]  It is just incredible to go out and publicize little children wearing these masks and going through the rest of it.
[00:34:45.789 --> 00:34:52.254]  So, I'm going to be covering that next hour on this live Sunday show.
[00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:59.588]  It's not supposed to exist, it's not supposed to be happening, it's not supposed to be heard.
[00:34:59.588 --> 00:35:13.935]  Bill Gates just thinks he'll put out polio vaccines that have live polio in it and kill a bunch of people and be the number one cause of polio and that we won't actually cover the Indian and the African newspapers and then his admission to the AP.
[00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:24.511]  They think they're going to cover up all the government reports of cancer viruses being added to vaccines to give you cancer.
[00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:28.414]  They think everybody's for sale and that everybody will sell out.
[00:35:28.414 --> 00:35:29.815]  Think again!
[00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:31.176]  This is where it ends.
[00:35:31.176 --> 00:35:32.357]  I don't sell out.
[00:35:32.357 --> 00:35:33.958]  I don't back down.
[00:35:33.958 --> 00:35:37.241]  Because I am not in league with Satan and I will not burn in hell with you.
[00:35:37.241 --> 00:35:38.202]  Do you understand that?
[00:35:41.994 --> 00:35:43.034]  That's why this is so serious.
[00:35:43.034 --> 00:35:45.275]  This is not a game, people.
[00:35:45.275 --> 00:35:46.595]  You're going to see world government.
[00:35:46.595 --> 00:35:48.015]  You're going to see the Antichrist.
[00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:51.096]  You're going to see a large portion of the world slaughtered.
[00:35:51.096 --> 00:35:53.337]  Pull up Revelation, guys, if you can.
[00:35:53.337 --> 00:35:59.998]  Revelation verse about the pale horse and he arrives upon his death and hell follows with him.
[00:35:59.998 --> 00:36:03.039]  Pull that up on screen, please, if you can.
[00:36:03.039 --> 00:36:05.780]  You will see world government.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.540]  You will see it all.
[00:36:08.473 --> 00:36:14.835]  You're going to be at a point where half the children you know by age five are dying with brain tumors.
[00:36:14.835 --> 00:36:17.676]  You're going to witness total extermination.
[00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:23.877]  And you will finally meet God in your mind or you will get on your knees to Satan.
[00:36:23.877 --> 00:36:26.618]  But you will go through the fire.
[00:36:26.618 --> 00:36:28.299]  No one will escape.
[00:36:28.299 --> 00:36:32.440]  Not me, not you, not anybody.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.241]  Because God is justice.
[00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:36.441]  So,
[00:36:41.024 --> 00:37:00.170]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have made their beds and they are going to have to sleep in them.
[00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.331]  We should have a few headlines though in the next segment.
[00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:04.731]  Paul Watson's done a really great job.
[00:37:04.731 --> 00:37:09.593]  I'm going to air something he just put out a few hours ago.
[00:37:09.593 --> 00:37:10.033]  There it is.
[00:37:11.969 --> 00:37:18.795]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him.
[00:37:18.795 --> 00:37:28.022]  And they were given authority over one-fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
[00:37:28.022 --> 00:37:28.543]  And I looked.
[00:37:28.543 --> 00:37:34.147]  Now let's read the King James Version.
[00:37:34.147 --> 00:37:40.433]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat upon him was Death,
[00:37:41.499 --> 00:37:58.072]  And hell followed with it, and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a sword, with hunger, and with death, and with the beast of the earth.
[00:37:58.072 --> 00:38:09.722]  Revelation, the NASB, I looked and behold an ashen horse, and he who sat upon its name was death, and Hades was following with him.
[00:38:10.638 --> 00:38:23.045]  Authority was given to them over a fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword, with famine, pestilence, with the wild beasts of the earth.
[00:38:23.045 --> 00:38:24.626]  Let me tell you who rides that horse.
[00:38:24.626 --> 00:38:32.310]  Who is the spiritual vessel of the Antichrist before the Antichrist comes is Bill Gates.
[00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.932]  The man who sits on the white horse of death is Bill Gates.
[00:38:35.819 --> 00:38:37.680]  I've told you that for 20 years.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.741]  And now you see it.
[00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:40.562]  He is your world ruler.
[00:38:40.562 --> 00:38:41.743]  He is the head of the G7.
[00:38:41.743 --> 00:38:47.266]  He is the last gate.
[00:38:47.266 --> 00:38:52.049]  And he will be the executor of you and your family.
[00:38:52.049 --> 00:38:54.851]  He will kill you and your family when he's done.
[00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:57.893]  And you will die.
[00:38:57.893 --> 00:39:01.495]  But he can't get your soul.
[00:39:01.495 --> 00:39:04.638]  There's the white horse right there.
[00:39:04.638 --> 00:39:05.298]  Total commitment.
[00:39:07.401 --> 00:39:09.622]  Absolute satanic will.
[00:39:09.622 --> 00:39:15.325]  Total demonic possession.
[00:39:15.325 --> 00:39:19.167]  Look upon it.
[00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:23.469]  He's coming for you and your family.
[00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:27.811]  He sits upon a white horse.
[00:39:27.811 --> 00:39:29.952]  Death.
[00:39:29.952 --> 00:39:32.994]  And his name was Death.
[00:39:32.994 --> 00:39:35.135]  And power was given to him.
[00:39:36.425 --> 00:39:44.487]  To kill at least one-fourth of the planet.
[00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:51.608]  And his main target is Africa.
[00:39:51.608 --> 00:39:53.029]  God help us.
[00:39:53.029 --> 00:39:56.129]  Truly.
[00:39:56.129 --> 00:39:57.550]  God help us.
[00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.910]  People ask me, are you scared of Bill Gates?
[00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:59.430]  Huh?
[00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.570]  No.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.081]  I feel nothing from Bill Gates, but I see death.
[00:40:07.081 --> 00:40:10.102]  But I feel God's big, powerful heart angry.
[00:40:10.102 --> 00:40:14.703]  And I just really feel sorry for that little demon that's Bill Gates.
[00:40:14.703 --> 00:40:22.126]  Because Bill Gates will be imprisoned with his own spirit for eternity alone.
[00:40:22.126 --> 00:40:23.586]  And that is a fate worse than death.
[00:40:23.586 --> 00:40:28.268]  I'm gonna go to break.
[00:40:28.268 --> 00:40:29.008]  And I'm gonna come back.
[00:40:30.253 --> 00:40:32.236]  And I'm going to hit some really important news.
[00:40:32.236 --> 00:40:32.757]  The enemy.
[00:40:32.757 --> 00:40:34.159]  We don't have Bill Gates financing us.
[00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:38.967]  We don't have Ted Turner financing us, who also wants to kill you and your family.
[00:40:38.967 --> 00:40:42.011]  We don't have them financing us and putting up Georgia Guidestones for us.
[00:40:42.952 --> 00:40:45.353]  Saying people the stars and love God and love each other.
[00:40:45.353 --> 00:40:47.154]  That's what I would put on those guidestones.
[00:40:47.154 --> 00:40:47.934]  We don't have that.
[00:40:47.934 --> 00:40:49.355]  We have you.
[00:40:49.355 --> 00:40:54.177]  And we have products that are powerful, and products that are amazing, and products that are game changing.
[00:40:54.177 --> 00:40:59.279]  And we have a big sale that hasn't ended yet, because I've been out of town and busy and fighting 24-7.
[00:40:59.279 --> 00:41:02.960]  But it is the Stop the Steal Mega Sale.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.001]  And a bunch of the products are about to sell out, so I must end it.
[00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:09.643]  I've got to come in tomorrow morning early and try to come up with a new sale with a few products we've got left.
[00:41:11.049 --> 00:41:11.509]  Thank you.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.681]  It's back in stock.
[00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:31.921]  50% off.
[00:41:31.921 --> 00:41:33.281]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:41:33.281 --> 00:41:34.101]  Close to selling out.
[00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:35.222]  Still back in stock.
[00:41:35.222 --> 00:41:36.382]  50% off.
[00:41:36.382 --> 00:41:37.483]  Like I said, Vitamineral Fusion.
[00:41:37.483 --> 00:41:40.844]  It's got all the vitamins, all the essential minerals, the amino acids.
[00:41:40.844 --> 00:41:41.444]  It's discounted.
[00:41:41.444 --> 00:41:42.265]  It's about to sell out.
[00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:43.765]  Fish oil, krill oil.
[00:41:43.765 --> 00:41:47.446]  I couldn't do any of this without the products.
[00:41:47.446 --> 00:41:48.647]  And I just thank God for them.
[00:41:48.647 --> 00:41:50.688]  And I thank God for you and your support.
[00:41:50.688 --> 00:41:53.989]  And I suggest you go to InfoWarsTore.com while you still can.
[00:41:55.247 --> 00:42:01.220]  Because if they do put that would-be dictator, that chi-com puppet in, Biden, he'll follow whatever orders they say.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.004]  And the word is, they're coming after me directly.
[00:42:03.004 --> 00:42:04.687]  They've got the indictments and all of it ready.
[00:42:07.429 --> 00:42:14.892]  I would stop stealing your last chance at this global crisis to get an InfoWars t-shirt, to get a water filter, to get an air filter, to get storable food, to get ready to ship within days.
[00:42:14.892 --> 00:42:16.952]  You know, everything we've got is in stock now.
[00:42:16.952 --> 00:42:18.133]  Supply chains are breaking down.
[00:42:18.133 --> 00:42:29.277]  Don't know about future orders in the future, but we're just gonna keep committing and going forward with afterburners on full blast, even though our tank is on E, and we're just not gonna stop.
[00:42:29.277 --> 00:42:34.539]  And if the money doesn't come in, we'll just crash like the phoenix into the sand, which is fine with me.
[00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:40.037]  Because God's in control, and God is in control of me.
[00:42:40.037 --> 00:42:42.659]  I'm a rotting, stinking vessel.
[00:42:42.659 --> 00:42:49.804]  I got rags, but God can take rags and tie them around a post and light a big torch that can burn down the New World Order.
[00:42:49.804 --> 00:42:51.306]  And I'm on fire.
[00:42:51.306 --> 00:42:54.288]  And I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above the Satanists forever.
[00:42:58.131 --> 00:42:59.172]  The games are over.
[00:42:59.172 --> 00:42:59.833]  The waiting is over.
[00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:01.255]  The fight is now out in the open.
[00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:19.158]  The world government is here in the latter part of 2020.
[00:43:19.158 --> 00:43:25.424]  It's attempting to collapse the world economy, set up a global digital currency and AI surveillance system.
[00:43:25.424 --> 00:43:28.987]  And InfoWars is on the front lines fighting harder than ever.
[00:43:28.987 --> 00:43:32.831]  And we pledge to you to never back down and never give up in the face of this evil.
[00:43:32.831 --> 00:43:37.356]  Because we know God is watching and God is in charge and God is on our side.
[00:43:38.056 --> 00:43:46.464]  InfoWars can only stay in the fight and continue to be the tip of the spear if you financially support us by getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:46.464 --> 00:43:50.327]  And we have one of the biggest sales of the year, about to end, up to 60% off.
[00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:54.691]  Triple Patriot points and free shipping with the Stop the Steal Special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:03.735]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America, he really was telling the truth.
[00:44:03.735 --> 00:44:10.000]  They don't just work for the Communist Chinese, and the globalists, and the EU, and the whole Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating crew.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:19.408]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds, and believe that they do own us, and tell us who the President is, even though that's not in law.
[00:44:19.408 --> 00:44:23.551]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again, saying, Joe Biden is President-elect.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:33.505]  Repeating it over and over again, like a brainwashing mantra, when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes, and those votes are being challenged, there's massive evidence of fraud.
[00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:36.447]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[00:44:36.447 --> 00:44:43.391]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[00:44:43.391 --> 00:44:46.393]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted, and there's massive fraud being discovered.
[00:44:47.113 --> 00:44:50.500]  We're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.201]  He's a globalist.
[00:44:51.201 --> 00:44:52.384]  He wants carbon taxes.
[00:44:52.384 --> 00:44:56.652]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:57.193]  This is war.
[00:44:58.777 --> 00:45:05.444]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[00:45:05.444 --> 00:45:11.430]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.651]  Incredible!
[00:45:12.651 --> 00:45:19.498]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation.
[00:45:19.878 --> 00:45:21.520]  Not the COVID virus.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.681]  That is a fact.
[00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:29.829]  And all the hero sheep that wear the mask and go along with this are signing on to mass murder bigger than what Hitler did.
[00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:33.292]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[00:45:33.292 --> 00:45:35.855]  This is a medical world government
[00:45:36.175 --> 00:45:42.237]  A radical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IVs, and coming with forced inoculations.
[00:45:42.237 --> 00:45:47.299]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[00:45:47.299 --> 00:45:49.099]  That story's on Infowars.com.
[00:45:49.099 --> 00:45:57.362]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you do not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary Great Reset.
[00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:00.890]  It's all on record.
[00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:16.042]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[00:46:16.042 --> 00:46:18.744]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[00:46:18.744 --> 00:46:20.766]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[00:46:20.766 --> 00:46:22.867]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:25.849]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:30.192]  And once they get you locked down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[00:46:30.192 --> 00:46:30.872]  That's how it works.
[00:46:30.872 --> 00:46:33.214]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[00:46:33.214 --> 00:46:36.536]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be alright.
[00:46:36.536 --> 00:46:37.336]  No.
[00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:42.239]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[00:46:42.239 --> 00:46:46.742]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[00:46:46.742 --> 00:46:47.643]  That's the allegory.
[00:46:48.363 --> 00:46:49.843]  We gotta bust out of this thing now.
[00:46:49.843 --> 00:46:51.284]  We gotta say no now.
[00:46:51.284 --> 00:46:53.524]  We gotta make a run for it now, but we still can't.
[00:46:53.524 --> 00:46:56.885]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's gonna get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[00:46:56.885 --> 00:47:01.966]  So stop submitting.
[00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:04.587]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.756 --> 00:47:36.924]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson has put out an extremely powerful report.
[00:47:36.924 --> 00:47:38.265]  It's posted at Band.Video.
[00:47:38.265 --> 00:47:40.347]  It's posted at Infowars.com.
[00:47:40.347 --> 00:47:41.388]  It's a 13-minute report.
[00:47:41.388 --> 00:47:42.549]  We won't have time to air the whole thing.
[00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:44.370]  It's a 10-and-a-half-minute segment, but here's part of it.
[00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:53.718]  I'm going to start the second hour, and I'm going to lay out the Great Reset, Build Back Better, the Communist, Fascist, and I'll explain how that works, Takeover,
[00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:57.530]  That is here if you don't resist it and say no.
[00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.513]  But you've got a good chance to stop it.
[00:47:59.513 --> 00:48:01.555]  At least less than how bad it's going to be.
[00:48:01.555 --> 00:48:03.678]  How far will they push?
[00:48:03.678 --> 00:48:05.400]  However far you put up with.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:11.447]  But here is part of Paul Joseph Watson breaking down the Great Reset and what it really means.
[00:48:11.447 --> 00:48:11.808]  Here it is.
[00:48:13.872 --> 00:48:15.594]  They think you're stupid, Stangler Report.
[00:48:15.594 --> 00:48:16.575]  They think you're stupid.
[00:48:16.575 --> 00:48:19.377]  You know that Great Reset thing you keep hearing about?
[00:48:19.377 --> 00:48:27.865]  You know, that technocratic agenda to exploit COVID to centralise economic power and transform society into a social credit score hyper-surveillance transhumanist dystopia?
[00:48:27.865 --> 00:48:28.565]  Yeah, that one.
[00:48:28.565 --> 00:48:29.967]  Well, it doesn't exist.
[00:48:30.347 --> 00:48:32.628]  The New York Times said so.
[00:48:32.628 --> 00:48:39.489]  I mean, the World Economic Forum literally celebrated the Great Reset on the same day the New York Times published this article.
[00:48:39.489 --> 00:48:43.410]  Time Magazine devoted an entire issue to it, but it still doesn't exist.
[00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:50.672]  Just like this video from two months ago of Justin Trudeau heralding the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity for a reset.
[00:48:50.672 --> 00:48:52.053]  By the way, hit pause.
[00:48:52.053 --> 00:48:53.153]  Back to the subject in seconds.
[00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.772]  Let me explain why they do this.
[00:48:56.772 --> 00:49:04.879]  They put out to their people what they're going to do to us, and then when we say we don't want it, they teach their people how to lie.
[00:49:04.879 --> 00:49:05.400]  Watch.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.661]  We deny it.
[00:49:06.661 --> 00:49:07.762]  We're going to steal the election.
[00:49:07.762 --> 00:49:09.463]  We're going to stuff the ballot boxes.
[00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:11.065]  We put out $80 million.
[00:49:11.065 --> 00:49:13.007]  When they complain, we say it doesn't exist.
[00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:18.816]  Or we're going to say there's not two genders, and we're going to cut little boys' testicles off.
[00:49:18.816 --> 00:49:23.138]  We're going to call sexual mutilization and sterilization trendy.
[00:49:23.138 --> 00:49:24.779]  We're going to call it trendy.
[00:49:24.779 --> 00:49:26.380]  They're teaching their people.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.560]  That's what this is.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.041]  The average leftist now is in on the fraud.
[00:49:30.041 --> 00:49:32.382]  Most of them I talk to know they're evil.
[00:49:32.382 --> 00:49:34.243]  They know it's a lie.
[00:49:34.243 --> 00:49:35.324]  They know it's a great reset.
[00:49:36.229 --> 00:49:37.490]  That's the key.
[00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.831]  They believe they're going to get money and power out of it, even though they aren't.
[00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:42.332]  They're useful idiots.
[00:49:42.332 --> 00:49:43.373]  Wow.
[00:49:43.373 --> 00:49:44.673]  Talk about scum.
[00:49:44.673 --> 00:49:48.155]  My uncle, great uncle, I say great uncle because my uncle was a great man.
[00:49:48.155 --> 00:49:53.298]  He would always say, you can't con an honest man.
[00:49:53.298 --> 00:49:56.460]  But people that are into evil are very easy to deceive.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.462]  And so the most deceived are the people thinking they're part of the winning team.
[00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:10.820]  When in all, Mother Jones and, you know, the New York Times, the Washington Post, oh, great reset, we're using COVID to bring in a utopia and end the family.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.260]  And then we're like, hey, that's bad.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.921]  Oh, it doesn't exist.
[00:50:13.921 --> 00:50:21.463]  And they think like engaging in that fraud makes them powerful, when all they're doing is celebrating their own destruction.
[00:50:21.463 --> 00:50:22.603]  Let's continue.
[00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:28.665]  Two months ago of Justin Trudeau heralding the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity for a reset,
[00:50:30.101 --> 00:50:34.525]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[00:50:34.525 --> 00:50:39.709]  This is our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts, to reimagine economic systems.
[00:50:39.709 --> 00:50:40.729]  He never said that.
[00:50:40.729 --> 00:50:43.712]  It was all just one empty conspiracy theory.
[00:50:43.712 --> 00:50:46.354]  We're seeing a lot of people fall prey to disinformation.
[00:50:47.347 --> 00:50:52.091]  Conservative MPs and others want to start talking about conspiracy theories.
[00:50:52.091 --> 00:50:55.694]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[00:50:55.694 --> 00:50:56.895]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:50:56.895 --> 00:51:00.498]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[00:51:00.498 --> 00:51:01.759]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:51:01.759 --> 00:51:02.219]  Reset.
[00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:03.481]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:51:03.481 --> 00:51:03.941]  Reset.
[00:51:03.941 --> 00:51:05.202]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:51:05.202 --> 00:51:09.766]  I mean, Dr. Strangelove here literally endorses in his own book, which is called
[00:51:10.226 --> 00:51:22.736]  COVID-19, the Great Reset, implantable brain chips that can read your thoughts, and the onset of minority report style pre-crime programs where you're deemed guilty before you've even committed a crime.
[00:51:22.736 --> 00:51:29.822]  He admits that COVID is not an existential threat, but that it's an opportunity for technocrats to reorder society.
[00:51:30.823 --> 00:51:36.788]  Via a Great Reset, the World Economic Forum publishes regular promo videos hyping the Great Reset.
[00:51:36.788 --> 00:51:38.750]  But it still doesn't exist.
[00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.112]  That is, if you're criticising it.
[00:51:41.112 --> 00:51:45.575]  If you praise it, then suddenly it does exist, and it's a good thing.
[00:51:45.575 --> 00:51:54.863]  Because by redistributing wealth as part of the Great Reset, our beneficent overlords are going to fix inequality and help the little guy.
[00:51:54.863 --> 00:51:56.044]  Pause again.
[00:51:56.044 --> 00:51:57.185]  Back it up five seconds, please.
[00:51:58.246 --> 00:52:05.531]  This is the IMF and World Bank proposing this that go in and engineer third world countries to be poor and not build infrastructure.
[00:52:05.531 --> 00:52:15.239]  These are the most ruthless scumbags in the world that created hundreds of trillions of dollars of fake debt that they've signed us on to and now they want to collapse us to end poverty.
[00:52:16.084 --> 00:52:23.048]  They all fly in their big private jets to Davos, but say you shouldn't have a car, or you shouldn't have air conditioning.
[00:52:23.048 --> 00:52:33.955]  I mean, literally, they're telling you how chic it is to be a slave, and it's all a bunch of weird royalty out of Europe and Nazi heirs and stuff.
[00:52:33.955 --> 00:52:36.977]  I mean, these are the people that run Bill Gates, folks.
[00:52:36.977 --> 00:52:38.718]  This is the real power.
[00:52:38.718 --> 00:52:40.379]  And they're making their move right now.
[00:52:40.379 --> 00:52:40.980]  Let's continue.
[00:52:42.149 --> 00:52:50.036]  ... wealth as part of the Great Reset, our beneficent overlords are going to fix inequality and help the little guy.
[00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:53.238]  Because globalist technocrats are really into helping the little guy.
[00:52:53.238 --> 00:52:55.500]  I mean, it's worked wonders so far!
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.462]  Amazon, profit up 100%.
[00:52:57.462 --> 00:52:59.063]  Walmart, profit up 80%.
[00:52:59.063 --> 00:53:00.804]  Target, profit up 80%.
[00:53:00.804 --> 00:53:02.706]  Lowe's, profit up 74%.
[00:53:02.706 --> 00:53:06.049]  Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Google, stock at record high.
[00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:09.211]  Small businesses, 21% closed.
[00:53:09.211 --> 00:53:10.452]  Revenue for the rest, down 30%.
[00:53:11.513 --> 00:53:12.975]  Wow, so helpful!
[00:53:12.975 --> 00:53:18.701]  Thanks to lockdown, the CEOs of these companies have seen their personal wealth increase by tens of billions.
[00:53:18.701 --> 00:53:22.105]  While small businesses have lost over 200 billion.
[00:53:22.105 --> 00:53:25.589]  While cabbies in the UK are on starvation wages.
[00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:28.973]  But yeah, this Great Reset sounds like a worker's paradise!
[00:53:28.973 --> 00:53:31.076]  Oh yeah, and you know all those rules they made?
[00:53:31.596 --> 00:53:34.477]  Lockdowns, face masks, social distancing.
[00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:38.577]  Yeah, well apparently the technocrats who made them don't have to abide by them.
[00:53:38.577 --> 00:53:40.638]  Do as we say, not as we do.
[00:53:40.638 --> 00:53:44.018]  Some Karen will screech at you in the street for not covering up.
[00:53:44.018 --> 00:53:48.399]  But Dianne Feinstein is apparently exempt indoors.
[00:53:48.399 --> 00:53:53.420]  Intelligence agencies are using cell phone networks to spy on pleb lockdown compliance.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:54:00.561]  You're being told to cancel Thanksgiving, but Governor Gavin Newsom can dine with California Medical Association lobbyists.
[00:54:01.181 --> 00:54:09.589]  Inside a fancy $350-a-meal French restaurant, in violation of his own COVID-19 protocols, he's set for everyone else.
[00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:12.231]  And Laurie Lightfoot can attend a pro-virus... Hey, pause again.
[00:54:12.231 --> 00:54:13.152]  Back it up.
[00:54:13.152 --> 00:54:15.914]  No mask, no social distancing, all crap.
[00:54:15.914 --> 00:54:17.015]  All dog training for you.
[00:54:17.015 --> 00:54:22.480]  They have a major whistleblower coming up tomorrow over major governmental systems.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.581]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:54:23.581 --> 00:54:26.063]  Where they're like, it's total fraud.
[00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:27.845]  Flu is way worse.
[00:54:28.886 --> 00:54:35.933]  But again, people get habituated, they don't want to admit they've been conned, so they get deeper into it, and the forced inoculations are coming.
[00:54:35.933 --> 00:54:37.915]  We'll cover that next hour, but let's go ahead and go to this.
[00:54:42.347 --> 00:54:43.208]  Interesting!
[00:54:43.208 --> 00:54:47.391]  Meanwhile, police in Australia are telling people they can't walk their dogs.
[00:54:47.391 --> 00:54:49.252]  They think you're stupid.
[00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:52.275]  Justin Trudeau, a normal Christmas is out of the question.
[00:54:52.275 --> 00:54:59.961]  But wait, the technocrats say that if we behave ourselves, they'll let us out of lockdown for a whole five days over Christmas!
[00:54:59.961 --> 00:55:01.262]  Thank you, globalists.
[00:55:01.262 --> 00:55:02.543]  How gracious of you.
[00:55:03.303 --> 00:55:05.045]  We're so grateful!
[00:55:05.045 --> 00:55:07.728]  You know, we had lockdown for other religions' festivals.
[00:55:07.728 --> 00:55:08.589]  Yes!
[00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:09.470]  We did, actually.
[00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.331]  Well, darling!
[00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:11.933]  Why should the Christians get it easier?
[00:55:11.933 --> 00:55:13.795]  Seriously, why should we?
[00:55:13.795 --> 00:55:17.379]  Why should we be the ones that have to have our festival saved?
[00:55:17.901 --> 00:55:20.882]  When we didn't do that for other religious festivals.
[00:55:20.882 --> 00:55:21.422]  Pause again.
[00:55:21.422 --> 00:55:23.042]  Back it up five seconds.
[00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:25.663]  The Muslims have not been banned in any of their demonstrations.
[00:55:25.663 --> 00:55:26.823]  The other mosques have been shut.
[00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:28.024]  It's been churches.
[00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.764]  Christians are being targeted.
[00:55:29.764 --> 00:55:34.105]  Even the UN admits double the persecution of Christians than we just saw ten years ago.
[00:55:34.105 --> 00:55:35.325]  This is outrageous.
[00:55:35.325 --> 00:55:37.726]  Piers Morgan is a disgusting piece of crap.
[00:55:39.005 --> 00:55:40.827]  Back to Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[00:55:40.827 --> 00:55:42.288]  They think you're stupid.
[00:55:42.288 --> 00:55:43.890]  Why should the Christians get it easier?
[00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:45.771]  Seriously, why should we?
[00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:53.799]  Why should we be the ones that have to have our festival saved when we didn't do that for other religious festivals in the last few weeks?
[00:55:53.799 --> 00:55:56.562]  Because we're a Christian country, you utter spoon!
[00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:59.204]  COVID-19 doesn't give a flying fuck about Christmas!
[00:55:59.264 --> 00:56:02.166]  If we have to make compromises this year, so be it.
[00:56:02.166 --> 00:56:07.949]  Oh, you mean like you didn't give a fuck about your son attending a super spread of Black Lives Matter protest?
[00:56:07.949 --> 00:56:09.971]  You said you were proud of him.
[00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:17.976]  So if we go round to Granny's on Christmas Day, eat the turkey, trash her house and then set fire to it, that'll make it okay, right?
[00:56:17.976 --> 00:56:21.318]  Matt Hancock says hugging will be banned this Christmas.
[00:56:21.318 --> 00:56:22.258]  Fuck off!
[00:56:22.258 --> 00:56:23.139]  Alright, let's stop there.
[00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:31.733]  I forgot to tell the guys to bleep Paul Joseph Watson's reports, and we're having to delay that, so I don't want to get any stations hearing cuss words.
[00:56:31.733 --> 00:56:33.693]  CNN's allowed to say the F word.
[00:56:33.693 --> 00:56:37.294]  Everybody else is, but we can't, which is what this is all about.
[00:56:37.294 --> 00:56:38.995]  The royal family doesn't wear masks.
[00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:40.635]  They've got giant palaces.
[00:56:40.635 --> 00:56:42.556]  The Islamists don't wear masks unless you're a woman.
[00:56:43.496 --> 00:56:47.961]  All the leftists don't wear masks, but you're supposed to and your church is going to stay closed.
[00:56:47.961 --> 00:56:50.064]  This is totally and completely sick.
[00:56:50.064 --> 00:56:54.288]  The full report is at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:56:54.288 --> 00:57:00.535]  I sincerely hope you share it and spread it, because the real disease they're scared of is freedom.
[00:57:00.535 --> 00:57:01.616]  Band.Video.
[00:57:03.058 --> 00:57:14.402]  Ban.video find the full Paul Joseph Watson report and the big massive bombshell Supreme Court preparing to certify Trump's re-election if he properly gets the cases with the five states up to them.
[00:57:14.402 --> 00:57:22.025]  It's still a very circuitous, dangerous road and people are going to go crazy when he ends up winning and Biden's proven to be a fraud.
[00:57:22.025 --> 00:57:23.706]  But Trump has a real path to victory.
[00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:24.726]  That's why he's doing this.
[00:57:24.726 --> 00:57:27.607]  That's why they're trying to discredit it and why they're so scared.
[00:57:27.607 --> 00:57:28.808]  Hour number two.
[00:57:30.253 --> 00:57:44.791]  Coming up, if you want to defeat the globalists, you want to stand against them, then ladies and gentlemen, tell folks on your email, on your text message, on word of mouth now about that local radio station, or how you're listening at Band.Video or InfoWars.com.
[00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:46.093]  We're live next hour, coming up.
[00:57:48.223 --> 00:57:49.024]  Warning!
[00:57:49.024 --> 00:57:49.744]  Warning!
[00:57:49.744 --> 00:57:50.605]  Warning!
[00:57:50.605 --> 00:58:06.196]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover, the giant third world collapse, and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[00:58:07.157 --> 00:58:21.868]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:29.971]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[00:58:29.971 --> 00:58:35.973]  Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[00:58:35.973 --> 00:58:40.135]  And that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[00:58:40.135 --> 00:58:42.716]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[00:58:42.716 --> 00:58:47.578]  Trump must repudiate it, expose Fauci and Gates and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[00:58:48.849 --> 00:58:55.452]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.
[00:58:55.452 --> 00:58:58.914]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:42.512]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:59:51.585 --> 01:00:01.948]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.948 --> 01:00:10.630]  Live from Austin, Texas in defiance of tyranny, broadcasting worldwide because of your support, I am Alex Jones!
[01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.171]  And this is The InfoWar!
[01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:16.633]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:16.633 --> 01:00:18.273]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:18.273 --> 01:00:39.443]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.443 --> 01:00:42.004]  They may have the four horsemen, but we got the angel of death.
[01:00:44.298 --> 01:00:47.741]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:50.803]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very blessed to be here.
[01:00:50.803 --> 01:00:56.808]  Coming up, we have a solution rising up, fighting back, resisting.
[01:00:56.808 --> 01:01:06.796]  But because most of you, including my wife, have seen all the news that all the governors said Trump's full of crap in Georgia, why there's no fraud, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:10.919]  I thought I'd actually go to some of his press conference yesterday.
[01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:11.920]  They don't want you to see.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.481]  Here it is.
[01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:15.766]  Good afternoon.
[01:01:15.766 --> 01:01:26.469]  COVID-19 has introduced numerous challenges to county and state elections officials as they work to keep Georgia elections secure, accessible, and fair.
[01:01:26.469 --> 01:01:40.752]  Given the record number of absentee ballots and narrow margin in the November 3rd election for President of Georgia, I joined many in backing a hand recount and urging a thorough investigation into any voting irregularities.
[01:01:41.892 --> 01:01:53.738]  The Secretary of State oversaw a complete audit, which revealed significant errors made in several counties, including Floyd, Fayette, Douglas, and Walton.
[01:01:53.738 --> 01:02:05.004]  It is important for Georgians to know that the vast majority of local election workers did their job well, under unprecedented circumstances, and I thank them for their service.
[01:02:06.004 --> 01:02:18.192]  However, it's quite honestly hard to believe that during the audit, thousands of uncounted ballots were found weeks after a razor-thin outcome in a presidential election.
[01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.934]  This is simply unacceptable.
[01:02:20.934 --> 01:02:23.595]  I've heard directly from countless Georgians.
[01:02:23.595 --> 01:02:26.137]  They expect better, and they deserve better.
[01:02:27.307 --> 01:02:38.559]  It's important to note that this audit only looked at ballots, not the signatures on the absentee applications or the signatures on the ballot envelopes.
[01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:42.884]  The Georgians I have heard from are extremely concerned about this.
[01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:47.789]  So I encourage Secretary Raffensperger to consider addressing these concerns.
[01:02:48.931 --> 01:03:03.167]  It seems simple enough to conduct a sample audit of signatures on the absentee ballot envelopes and compare those to the signatures on applications and on file at the Secretary of State's office.
[01:03:03.167 --> 01:03:09.435]  This morning, the Secretary announced his support of strengthening photo ID requirements for absentee balloting.
[01:03:10.512 --> 01:03:20.155]  Voters casting their ballots in person must show a photo ID, and we should consider applying that same standard to mail-in balloting.
[01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:27.556]  I have heard from many members of the General Assembly, and I appreciate their input and share their concern.
[01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:37.299]  I look forward to working with Lieutenant Governor Duncan, Speaker Ralston, and members of both bodies to address the issues that have been raised over the last several weeks.
[01:03:39.071 --> 01:03:47.915]  Earlier today, Secretary Raffensperger presented the certified results of the 2020 general election to my office.
[01:03:47.915 --> 01:04:03.681]  Following Judge Grimsberg's ruling yesterday, state law now requires the governor's office to formalize the certification, which paves the way for the Trump campaign to pursue other legal options in a separate recount if they choose.
[01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:07.712]  Georgia has runoff elections for two U.S.
[01:04:07.712 --> 01:04:14.099]  Senate seats and a Public Service Commissioner scheduled to occur over the next several weeks.
[01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:23.050]  We demand complete explanations for all discrepancies identified so that our citizens will have complete confidence in our elections.
[01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:30.913]  In the runoff election, we cannot have lost memory cards or stacks of uncounted ballots.
[01:04:30.913 --> 01:04:36.454]  We must have full transparency in all monitoring and counting.
[01:04:36.454 --> 01:04:42.336]  Every legal vote must be counted and the security of the ballot box... But CNN said there's no evidence of fraud.
[01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:46.457]  I mean, they said Biden's our president.
[01:04:46.457 --> 01:04:52.259]  They've only begun to fight global estate with us.
[01:04:52.259 --> 01:04:53.159]  60 seconds, we're back.
[01:04:57.478 --> 01:05:01.941]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stocks for being sold out for months.
[01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:08.104]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells in the body.
[01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.945]  That's every human activity.
[01:05:09.945 --> 01:05:15.508]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid.
[01:05:15.508 --> 01:05:18.330]  Leading competitors have 3 to 5%.
[01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:23.013]  The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're going to find.
[01:05:23.493 --> 01:05:28.475]  So both of these are amazing products, and they fund the InfoWar, which is a 360 win.
[01:05:28.475 --> 01:05:39.199]  On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand, they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points, and free shipping at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:05:39.199 --> 01:05:42.360]  That's Bio True Selenium from the mustard seed.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.661]  It's amazing.
[01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:44.581]  And on top of it,
[01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:49.243]  We also have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula at MFORSTORE.COM.
[01:05:49.243 --> 01:05:50.904]  This gel will not last long.
[01:05:50.904 --> 01:05:52.345]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:05:52.345 --> 01:05:53.746]  We really need to try these products.
[01:05:53.746 --> 01:05:55.867]  People absolutely love them because they really, really work.
[01:05:55.867 --> 01:05:56.787]  MFORSTORE.COM.
[01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.130]  Big Brother.
[01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.911]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:10.911 --> 01:06:12.791]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:14.512]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.172]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:21.733]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.733 --> 01:06:24.934]  Alright, let's talk about solutions right now.
[01:06:24.934 --> 01:06:32.636]  It was the head of President Trump's COVID-19 task force that said, this is all overblown, it's a power grab.
[01:06:32.636 --> 01:06:36.197]  They're counting all these other dead people of cancer, car wrecks, gunshot wounds, drowning.
[01:06:36.597 --> 01:06:39.499]  Skydiving accidents, motorcycle accidents.
[01:06:39.499 --> 01:06:41.581]  They're counting all of those as COVID-19 deaths.
[01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.523]  That's confirmed.
[01:06:44.523 --> 01:06:46.565]  They're just creating a chicken little scenario.
[01:06:46.565 --> 01:06:55.752]  They said it's time to rise up when Michigan and other states announce all the small businesses are closed, but Walmart
[01:06:57.301 --> 01:06:57.461]  I don't
[01:07:16.889 --> 01:07:28.653]  That the British Prime Minister has said it, the German Chancellor has said it, the Canadian Prime Minister came out and said, this is a lockdown for world government to teach us how to be poor and to need help from them?
[01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:32.335]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:07:32.335 --> 01:07:37.657]  By the way, this isn't me bragging.
[01:07:37.657 --> 01:07:40.878]  This is the converse, or this is the other side of this thing.
[01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:55.680]  I got calls the last three days from major world leaders, major people in government, the biggest people in media.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.801]  And they said, all of them said the same thing.
[01:07:57.801 --> 01:08:07.006]  They said, Jones, when we go to dinner parties or these big Hollywood parties or with these big events, everyone loves you now and everyone's asking about you.
[01:08:09.471 --> 01:08:10.912]  It's not about me.
[01:08:10.912 --> 01:08:15.455]  It's that I'm just, I represent the resistance and people that are awake.
[01:08:15.455 --> 01:08:17.396]  So it's the opposite of a power trip for me.
[01:08:17.396 --> 01:08:22.760]  I'm just some guy that goes home, climbs my bed, goes to sleep, totally freaked out, fighting all the time.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:28.183]  But I am the archetype like you are, the common man, the common woman, the common human in resistance.
[01:08:28.183 --> 01:08:30.345]  So, I can tell you,
[01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:54.066]  The average Hollywood star, people worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the average top talk show host, the average person with the top shows in the country, are like, okay, why is everyone at these mountaintop events, both literal and figurative, talking about you?
[01:08:57.438 --> 01:09:03.182]  Because they're now realizing we were right, and they're realizing how much danger they're in.
[01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.823]  I take no pleasure in being in that zeitgeist.
[01:09:05.823 --> 01:09:09.045]  I am a beyond imperfect vessel.
[01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:12.848]  I'm like a colander.
[01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:15.809]  I've got so many holes in me, but I recognize it.
[01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:22.894]  But I have now lived to the point where the very people
[01:09:24.571 --> 01:09:28.795]  Going along with this are scared, and they should be.
[01:09:28.795 --> 01:09:33.098]  Because this is a post-human system being built.
[01:09:33.098 --> 01:09:35.260]  And I told some of these folks, they have kids.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.122]  By the way, all people that call me have children.
[01:09:37.122 --> 01:09:38.403]  That's why these globals don't have children.
[01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:50.485]  Another thing that gets you if you haven't had children, but the point is it creates a metaphysical thing where you're tied to humanity even more, to your ancestors, into the future, and it's just like, it's a command once you have children.
[01:09:50.485 --> 01:09:52.867]  Doesn't mean you're perfect, but it's a command.
[01:09:52.867 --> 01:09:56.309]  And these people are all like, I know why you called.
[01:09:56.309 --> 01:09:59.951]  And they go, this happened all three times, they go, I love my children.
[01:09:59.951 --> 01:10:02.512]  And one person started crying and said, what do I do?
[01:10:02.512 --> 01:10:06.675]  And I said, get on your knees to God, I don't know what to do.
[01:10:06.675 --> 01:10:08.256]  I've already been through this process they've been through.
[01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.412]  I'm not that important.
[01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:16.213]  I'm just the focal point of this resistance.
[01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:19.234]  And that's why what we do here is so important, why the listeners are so important.
[01:10:19.234 --> 01:10:20.314]  And I'm ready to die.
[01:10:20.314 --> 01:10:21.635]  I'm ready to be imprisoned.
[01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:23.055]  I'm ready to put in solitary confinement.
[01:10:23.055 --> 01:10:24.576]  I'm ready to be tortured for the truth.
[01:10:24.576 --> 01:10:28.357]  Because I realize I can't sign on to the pedophilia and the Satanism.
[01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:31.018]  In fact, it's a very easy... I'm not into persecution.
[01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.538]  I'm not into masochism.
[01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:34.679]  I don't like pain.
[01:10:34.679 --> 01:10:36.599]  But I'll take it.
[01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:37.840]  I'll take as much as they're gonna give me.
[01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.823]  Because that's so short compared to eternity.
[01:10:40.823 --> 01:10:50.789]  Because Jesus Christ is on the other side of it.
[01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:52.530]  And I wish we could have stopped this.
[01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:53.811]  I really wish we could have.
[01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:56.252]  But we can't.
[01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.813]  We're gonna get hurt for what we've done.
[01:10:57.813 --> 01:11:02.336]  And quite frankly, we deserve it.
[01:11:02.336 --> 01:11:04.077]  Doesn't mean Satan's right to be carrying it out.
[01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.570]  Satan's the author of it.
[01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:07.711]  Satan tricks us.
[01:11:07.711 --> 01:11:09.631]  Satan greases his kids for our bad behavior.
[01:11:09.631 --> 01:11:15.052]  I want to talk now about solutions.
[01:11:15.052 --> 01:11:17.333]  I want to talk about solutions.
[01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:19.954]  Because now we're entering the scary time.
[01:11:19.954 --> 01:11:23.034]  And it just gets scarier from here on out.
[01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:24.775]  And the men will be measured.
[01:11:24.775 --> 01:11:25.835]  And the women will be measured.
[01:11:25.835 --> 01:11:28.736]  And we're all going to be measured.
[01:11:28.736 --> 01:11:33.197]  We're all going to be put through the fire.
[01:11:33.197 --> 01:11:34.117]  And I welcome the fire.
[01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:39.626]  I welcome the fire.
[01:11:39.626 --> 01:11:42.047]  Because it will cleanse us.
[01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:49.411]  And it will burn away the lies and separate the metal from the trash.
[01:11:49.411 --> 01:11:54.494]  And in that fire we will find our ascendance.
[01:11:54.494 --> 01:11:56.635]  Or we will find our destruction.
[01:11:56.635 --> 01:11:58.916]  The real test is now here.
[01:11:58.916 --> 01:12:02.898]  From here on out, the gates of hell have been opened.
[01:12:05.506 --> 01:12:14.368]  Christ had the keys, but we asked Christ for the keys like bad teenagers to take the car for a ride and open the gate.
[01:12:14.368 --> 01:12:16.668]  The gate's open.
[01:12:16.668 --> 01:12:22.369]  Now we're gonna have that experience.
[01:12:22.369 --> 01:12:23.649]  So let's talk about a solution.
[01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:25.590]  Let's talk about how you fight back.
[01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:28.930]  Like Dr. Atlas said, you need to rise up.
[01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:32.851]  We do need to rise up against fear, against hysteria, against this obvious scam.
[01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:35.651]  Let's play the first clip.
[01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:36.931]  This is a California protest.
[01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:38.732]  Go to Governor Newsom's house.
[01:12:38.732 --> 01:12:39.112]  Here it is.
[01:13:02.312 --> 01:13:08.003]  The point is, that's how this starts, is recognizing the fraud, recognizing the scam.
[01:13:08.003 --> 01:13:11.551]  Here's another clip of folks saying burn their mask at Huntington Beach.
[01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:12.994]  Here it is, same state, California.
[01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:40.322]  So take heart, my friends.
[01:13:40.322 --> 01:13:43.683]  They steal this from us, their doom is even greater.
[01:13:43.683 --> 01:13:50.026]  And I don't wish for that, but that is a real possibility.
[01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:50.986]  So here's another clip.
[01:13:50.986 --> 01:13:51.967]  This is in New York.
[01:13:53.769 --> 01:13:59.950]  Where they try to go to gyms and restaurants and say, you can't be open, but oh, everybody, everything else can be open.
[01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:02.631]  Like, like Newsom's announced all of Hollywood's open.
[01:14:02.631 --> 01:14:04.571]  All of his vineyards have never got closed.
[01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:06.011]  All the big strip malls are open.
[01:14:06.011 --> 01:14:07.812]  Just your clothes because you're little.
[01:14:07.812 --> 01:14:09.552]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[01:14:09.552 --> 01:14:11.072]  This is war.
[01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:14.013]  So they finally ran off these corrupt cops.
[01:14:14.013 --> 01:14:16.153]  They don't worship police.
[01:14:16.153 --> 01:14:20.614]  The left wants to take over the police.
[01:14:20.614 --> 01:14:22.995]  But when cops are doing wrong, they are the enemy.
[01:14:22.995 --> 01:14:23.355]  Here it is.
[01:14:38.794 --> 01:14:43.258]  Armed men come to a gym to tell them you can't be open.
[01:14:43.258 --> 01:14:44.378]  And look, they're not wearing masks.
[01:14:44.378 --> 01:14:45.299]  They're out of the cult.
[01:14:45.299 --> 01:14:47.100]  They're done.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:47.621]  This is all
[01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:50.492]  The desperate left.
[01:14:50.492 --> 01:14:54.234]  They're like, hey, we love Blue Lives Matter, but we're not your slaves.
[01:14:54.234 --> 01:14:55.274]  You gotta go to the road!
[01:14:55.274 --> 01:14:57.115]  We will not comply!
[01:14:57.115 --> 01:14:59.557]  We will not comply!
[01:14:59.557 --> 01:15:02.098]  We will not comply!
[01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:04.600]  We will not comply!
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.521]  We will not comply!
[01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:09.824]  This is a protest, guys!
[01:15:09.824 --> 01:15:12.827]  So the war has only begun, yeah.
[01:15:12.827 --> 01:15:14.830]  Your business being open is a protest.
[01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:17.052]  You taking care of your children is a protest.
[01:15:17.052 --> 01:15:21.056]  You taking care of your body is a protest against Satan!
[01:15:21.056 --> 01:15:23.679]  The whole thing's a war against life!
[01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:28.944]  The whole thing is a bunch of greedy, hateful people that are so hateful, they hate themselves.
[01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:31.091]  They project their own hate on you.
[01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:37.015]  Well, I tell Bill Gates and I tell Bill Clinton, you're going to meet Christ face to face.
[01:15:37.015 --> 01:15:52.325]  And you're going to be folded into yourself and sent to a place by yourself, your own little universe, so you can play God by yourself with no one to abuse, because that's the real Phantom Zone is a whole universe for you little demigods by yourselves.
[01:15:52.325 --> 01:15:54.246]  You will be with yourself forever.
[01:15:54.246 --> 01:15:55.487]  You are cursed and damned.
[01:15:56.327 --> 01:16:03.931]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[01:16:03.931 --> 01:16:14.437]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns where you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:24.222]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[01:16:24.782 --> 01:16:27.744]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[01:16:27.744 --> 01:16:30.966]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[01:16:30.966 --> 01:16:32.506]  This is world government.
[01:16:32.506 --> 01:16:37.209]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[01:16:37.209 --> 01:16:39.230]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:41.652]  This is what the communist takeover looks like.
[01:16:41.652 --> 01:16:45.554]  To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely
[01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:49.276]  Transform the world into a prison planet.
[01:16:49.276 --> 01:16:51.437]  How long have we warned you about this?
[01:16:51.437 --> 01:16:52.597]  You can fight back.
[01:16:52.597 --> 01:16:54.498]  America is the last bastion.
[01:16:54.498 --> 01:16:56.819]  Stop submitting.
[01:16:56.819 --> 01:16:58.000]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:58.920]  Remember Pelosi?
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.880]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.281]  Remember Obama?
[01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:05.583]  All of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:09.985]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win a landslide if they have the internal polls.
[01:17:09.985 --> 01:17:11.206]  And indeed, Trump won.
[01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:14.828]  Most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[01:17:14.828 --> 01:17:21.352]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night.
[01:17:21.352 --> 01:17:23.914]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[01:17:23.914 --> 01:17:24.794]  This is completely transparent.
[01:17:24.794 --> 01:17:27.916]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:28.857]  Trump has not conceded.
[01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:30.938]  None of the states have certified the vote.
[01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:33.140]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:38.763]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[01:17:38.763 --> 01:17:39.364]  And in Georgia,
[01:17:40.064 --> 01:17:42.566]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[01:17:42.566 --> 01:17:44.848]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[01:17:44.848 --> 01:17:48.790]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:50.712]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[01:17:50.712 --> 01:17:52.913]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[01:17:52.913 --> 01:17:55.095]  As we know it, we will beat Venezuela.
[01:17:55.095 --> 01:17:55.856]  Infowars.com
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.121]  The games are over.
[01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:00.162]  The waiting is over.
[01:18:00.162 --> 01:18:01.844]  The fight is now out in the open.
[01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:04.227]  World government is here in the latter part
[01:18:17.722 --> 01:18:17.922]  I'm good.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:34.540]  We're good to go.
[01:18:57.534 --> 01:19:02.058]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[01:19:02.058 --> 01:19:04.600]  This is taken under the tongue.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.802]  It is pure turmeric.
[01:19:06.802 --> 01:19:16.010]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:21.855]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[01:19:21.855 --> 01:19:24.017]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[01:19:24.457 --> 01:19:27.679]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:29.520]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.641]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:33.822]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[01:19:33.822 --> 01:19:35.183]  Some like bodies better.
[01:19:35.183 --> 01:19:39.325]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[01:19:39.325 --> 01:19:40.526]  And they fund the NymphoWar.

[01:19:59.646 --> 01:20:02.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:08.101 --> 01:20:15.483]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:42.014 --> 01:20:44.475]  You know, folks, I love to talk.
[01:20:44.475 --> 01:20:47.678]  I love to talk to you, and I'm very honored and blessed to be here.
[01:20:47.678 --> 01:20:54.623]  But I happened to be going through some Ronald Reagan clips yesterday afternoon, and I was...
[01:20:56.988 --> 01:21:01.612]  I'm doing some research, and I came across Ronald Reagan's farewell address.
[01:21:01.612 --> 01:21:02.732]  It's 22 minutes long.
[01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:07.416]  You just type in Ronald Reagan's farewell address from the Oval Office, and you'll pull it up.
[01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:12.840]  I'm only going to air a few minutes of it, but compare this, because Ronald Reagan wasn't perfect, but not people that knew him.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.921]  He cared about America.
[01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:15.362]  He loved freedom.
[01:21:15.362 --> 01:21:17.223]  He really cared about the people.
[01:21:17.223 --> 01:21:20.386]  And compare him to an Obama or a Hillary.
[01:21:22.688 --> 01:21:23.968]  And then even to a Trump.
[01:21:23.968 --> 01:21:27.749]  You know, Trump wants to beat the globalists in ways he's better than Reagan.
[01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:30.250]  But with Reagan, there's a real genuineness.
[01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:37.652]  And notice, all Reagan's trying to do is unify the people and make you proud of goodness.
[01:21:37.652 --> 01:21:41.853]  So that you're proud of what you've done and proud of who you are.
[01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:45.294]  You know, back then, the suicide rate was 200% lower.
[01:21:45.294 --> 01:21:46.914]  I was looking it up.
[01:21:46.914 --> 01:21:49.615]  It was a fraction of the suicides there is now.
[01:21:49.615 --> 01:21:50.735]  People felt good about themselves.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:58.642]  I don't want you to be demoralized during these lockdowns and feel bad about yourself, whether you're old, white, black, Hispanic.
[01:21:58.642 --> 01:21:59.543]  Don't listen to them.
[01:21:59.543 --> 01:22:01.863]  You all are beautiful and God loves you.
[01:22:01.863 --> 01:22:06.065]  And your relationship with God is what matters.
[01:22:06.065 --> 01:22:08.125]  And so here's a few minutes of what Ronald Reagan had to say.
[01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:10.226]  I just felt moved to play some of this.
[01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:14.488]  But I suggest you go watch the full farewell final Oval Office address.
[01:22:14.488 --> 01:22:15.448]  What's the exact name of this?
[01:22:17.717 --> 01:22:23.402]  It's President Ronald Reagan's Farewell Address to the Nation, January 11, 1989.
[01:22:23.402 --> 01:22:27.586]  Here's part of it.
[01:22:27.586 --> 01:22:33.711]  My fellow Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office, and the last.
[01:22:33.711 --> 01:22:37.635]  We've been together eight years now, and soon it'll be time for me to go.
[01:22:37.635 --> 01:22:42.639]  But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.
[01:22:43.615 --> 01:22:46.577]  It's been the honor of my life to be your president.
[01:22:46.577 --> 01:22:52.180]  So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.622]  Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve.
[01:22:56.622 --> 01:23:01.365]  One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart.
[01:23:01.365 --> 01:23:12.511]  You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass, the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:19.071]  And so many times, I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass and connect.
[01:23:19.071 --> 01:23:21.913]  Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.
[01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:27.718]  People ask how I feel about leaving, and the fact is, parting is such sweet sorrow.
[01:23:27.718 --> 01:23:31.781]  The sweet part is California, and the ranch, and freedom.
[01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:33.162]  The sorrow?
[01:23:33.162 --> 01:23:36.665]  The goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place.
[01:23:37.671 --> 01:23:45.154]  You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the President and his family live.
[01:23:45.154 --> 01:23:51.557]  There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning.
[01:23:51.557 --> 01:23:57.519]  The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial.
[01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:06.131]  But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac, and the Virginia shore.
[01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:11.652]  Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run.
[01:24:11.652 --> 01:24:14.193]  Well, I see more prosaic things.
[01:24:14.193 --> 01:24:21.254]  The grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river.
[01:24:21.254 --> 01:24:23.594]  I've been thinking a bit at that window.
[01:24:23.594 --> 01:24:27.055]  I've been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean.
[01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:32.437]  And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one.
[01:24:32.437 --> 01:24:37.503]  A small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor.
[01:24:37.503 --> 01:24:45.511]  It was back in the early 80s, at the height of the boat people, and the sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea.
[01:24:46.428 --> 01:24:52.151]  The sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant.
[01:24:52.151 --> 01:25:00.855]  The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat, and crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America.
[01:25:00.855 --> 01:25:03.857]  The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship in safety.
[01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:11.988]  As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck and stood up and called out to him.
[01:25:11.988 --> 01:25:14.711]  He yelled, Hello, American sailor.
[01:25:14.711 --> 01:25:17.234]  Hello, freedom man.
[01:25:17.234 --> 01:25:19.716]  A small moment with a big meaning.
[01:25:19.716 --> 01:25:23.901]  A moment the sailor, who wrote it in a letter, couldn't get out of his mind.
[01:25:23.901 --> 01:25:25.943]  And when I saw it, neither could I.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:31.723]  Because that's what it has to... It was to be an American in the 1980s.
[01:25:31.723 --> 01:25:33.805]  We stood again for freedom.
[01:25:33.805 --> 01:25:35.326]  I know we always have.
[01:25:35.326 --> 01:25:41.590]  But in the past few years, the world, again, and in a way, we ourselves, rediscovered it.
[01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:43.932]  It's been quite a journey, this decade.
[01:25:43.932 --> 01:25:46.974]  And we held together through some stormy seas.
[01:25:46.974 --> 01:25:50.697]  And at the end, together, we're reaching our destination.
[01:25:51.772 --> 01:26:04.519]  The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits, from the recession of 81 to 82, to the expansion that began in late 82 and continues to this day, we've made a difference.
[01:26:04.519 --> 01:26:09.963]  The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proudest of.
[01:26:09.963 --> 01:26:18.628]  One is the economic recovery in which the people of America created and filled 19 million new jobs.
[01:26:18.628 --> 01:26:20.629]  The other is the recovery of our morale.
[01:26:21.562 --> 01:26:26.266]  America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership.
[01:26:26.266 --> 01:26:29.970]  Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this.
[01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:37.697]  It was back in 1981, and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in Canada.
[01:26:37.697 --> 01:26:41.000]  The meeting place rotates among the member countries.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.283]  The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized nations.
[01:26:46.152 --> 01:26:49.893]  Well, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened.
[01:26:49.893 --> 01:26:53.554]  And it was all Francois this and Helmut that.
[01:26:53.554 --> 01:26:58.535]  They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first-name basis.
[01:26:58.535 --> 01:27:04.617]  But at one point, I sort of leaned in and said, my name's Ron.
[01:27:04.617 --> 01:27:09.878]  But in that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback.
[01:27:09.878 --> 01:27:12.279]  Cut taxes and regulation.
[01:27:12.279 --> 01:27:13.339]  Started to cut spending.
[01:27:14.173 --> 01:27:16.335]  Soon the recovery began.
[01:27:16.335 --> 01:27:20.961]  Two years later, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast.
[01:27:20.961 --> 01:27:29.250]  At the big opening meeting, we all got together and all of a sudden, just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me.
[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.972]  And then one of them broke the silence.
[01:27:31.972 --> 01:27:35.116]  Tell us about the American miracle, he said.
[01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:41.191]  Well, back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so different.
[01:27:41.191 --> 01:27:44.932]  Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe.
[01:27:44.932 --> 01:27:48.113]  Our views on foreign affairs would cause war.
[01:27:48.113 --> 01:27:53.755]  Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse.
[01:27:53.755 --> 01:28:04.138]  I even remember one highly respected economist saying back in 1982 that the engines of economic growth have shut down here.
[01:28:05.006 --> 01:28:08.414]  And they're likely to stay that way for years to come.
[01:28:08.414 --> 01:28:09.576]  Alright, let's stop there.
[01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:11.421]  Why did I play this?
[01:28:11.421 --> 01:28:12.102]  Because back in 19...
[01:28:15.147 --> 01:28:16.649]  88 when Reagan's leaving.
[01:28:16.649 --> 01:28:17.970]  Governments are still in charge.
[01:28:17.970 --> 01:28:18.791]  They've got problems.
[01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:19.331]  They're corrupt.
[01:28:19.331 --> 01:28:22.894]  But they're not corporations that are totally ruthless.
[01:28:22.894 --> 01:28:24.716]  They're now bigger than government.
[01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:28.519]  And he could actually chart the world and get people to imitate America.
[01:28:28.519 --> 01:28:29.600]  Now it's the Chinese.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.661]  It's the big corporations.
[01:28:30.661 --> 01:28:31.682]  It's Apple.
[01:28:31.682 --> 01:28:34.324]  It's lobbying against rules against slave camps.
[01:28:34.324 --> 01:28:35.686]  I've got articles right here.
[01:28:35.686 --> 01:28:36.546]  These people are evil.
[01:28:36.546 --> 01:28:37.047]  They're bad.
[01:28:37.047 --> 01:28:37.647]  They're dangerous.
[01:28:38.561 --> 01:28:45.069]  That's why I wanted to play that, to talk about what was going on 30 plus years ago versus what's happening today.
[01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:54.120]  Alright, I'm gonna get into the big globalist master plan, what the reset really means to you and your family, and how to stop it dead in its tracks, straight ahead on this live Sunday transmission.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:07.086]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart inventive people, believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[01:29:07.086 --> 01:29:11.969]  They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[01:29:11.969 --> 01:29:16.592]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[01:29:16.592 --> 01:29:21.815]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:24.257]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[01:29:25.598 --> 01:29:35.248]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshippers that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from the humanity, but really, they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[01:29:35.248 --> 01:29:40.013]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but...
[01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:46.379]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[01:29:46.379 --> 01:29:48.521]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[01:29:48.521 --> 01:29:50.722]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[01:29:50.722 --> 01:29:53.505]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[01:29:53.505 --> 01:29:55.466]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[01:29:56.516 --> 01:30:00.357]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:30:00.357 --> 01:30:04.679]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:30:04.679 --> 01:30:13.182]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:13.562 --> 01:30:30.165]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:30:30.165 --> 01:30:41.187]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:50.191]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:30:50.191 --> 01:30:55.734]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:58.743]  It really is simple.
[01:30:58.743 --> 01:31:00.423]  The left are into being deviant.
[01:31:00.423 --> 01:31:02.224]  And I don't mean sexually deviant.
[01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:04.084]  That goes the territory.
[01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:11.365]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against their own species, deviant against the order of nature.
[01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:16.126]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because they want to play God.
[01:31:16.126 --> 01:31:18.307]  Everything they touch, they destroy.
[01:31:18.307 --> 01:31:23.047]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[01:31:23.047 --> 01:31:26.548]  Their religion is not taking care of the old, but euthanizing them.
[01:31:27.088 --> 01:31:36.451]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep third world countries in serious poverty and poor, ballooning populations and then watching all that new fruit die on the vine.
[01:31:36.451 --> 01:31:40.993]  To continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:42.814]  They truly are the children of Satan.
[01:31:42.814 --> 01:31:43.774]  They are the children of the devil.
[01:31:43.774 --> 01:31:51.036]  And if you look at the slaves that served Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifest that being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[01:31:51.036 --> 01:31:52.677]  Sin is not profitable.
[01:31:52.677 --> 01:31:54.898]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Infowar.
[01:31:56.317 --> 01:31:58.798]  America is in crisis.
[01:31:58.798 --> 01:32:03.660]  Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming under Biden.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:10.403]  Support InfoWars for fighting its total economic collapse and Biden's martial law disguised as Lockdown 2.

[01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:59.593]  Please take action today in our emergency center.
[01:32:59.593 --> 01:33:02.294]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:39.504]  We're not gonna take it lying down.
[01:33:39.504 --> 01:33:46.610]  Hold on!
[01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:50.953]  Everything's gonna be alright.
[01:33:50.953 --> 01:33:52.274]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:52.274 --> 01:33:53.255]  We are with God.
[01:33:53.255 --> 01:33:55.056]  That's all that matters.
[01:33:55.056 --> 01:33:58.178]  We have free will.
[01:33:58.178 --> 01:34:00.200]  And many of our fellow humans have chosen Satan.
[01:34:03.447 --> 01:34:06.688]  So now, comes the pain.
[01:34:06.688 --> 01:34:09.248]  They gotta be shown.
[01:34:09.248 --> 01:34:10.068]  They gotta be spanked.
[01:34:10.068 --> 01:34:15.609]  Alright, let's look at it right now.
[01:34:15.609 --> 01:34:23.611]  Let's talk about what's currently happening right now and how to fight back against these demons.
[01:34:23.611 --> 01:34:27.552]  You know, the greatest failure of all of us, including President Trump, was
[01:34:28.677 --> 01:34:33.900]  When they cut off our communications, when they let big tech, that's 90% of communication now.
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.261]  People don't talk over landlines.
[01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:37.963]  They don't even talk over cell phones.
[01:34:37.963 --> 01:34:39.044]  That's only 10%.
[01:34:39.044 --> 01:34:42.866]  Landlines and cell phone calls, I looked it up just this morning, are about 9.7%.
[01:34:42.866 --> 01:34:45.728]  It's estimated a year ago.
[01:34:45.728 --> 01:34:49.051]  The numbers are always old.
[01:34:49.051 --> 01:34:56.996]  90% of communication is on Facebook, is on Twitter, is on Google, is on Apple.
[01:34:59.286 --> 01:35:04.230]  Or is over some telecom internet.
[01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:21.303]  And when we allowed AI program software that had congressional hearings to come in and block what you can say and what you can do, we gave them everything they needed to make a run at our government, a run at us, a run at our economy.
[01:35:21.303 --> 01:35:28.389]  And they've so far, with this blitzkrieg attack they launched a year ago, have won spectacularly.
[01:35:29.335 --> 01:35:31.796]  Lightning war.
[01:35:31.796 --> 01:35:32.856]  100% profit for Amazon.
[01:35:32.856 --> 01:35:37.598]  80% profit increase the last year for all the other big techs.
[01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:40.259]  They are killing us.
[01:35:40.259 --> 01:35:43.140]  It'd be one thing if they were making great profits and everybody else got a piece of it.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:43.820]  No.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:46.621]  It's at your expense and it's on record.
[01:35:46.621 --> 01:35:52.864]  And they sit there thinking you're an idiot going, knowing you were trained at a university, going, we're going to build back better.
[01:35:52.864 --> 01:35:53.744]  It's a great reset.
[01:35:53.744 --> 01:35:57.405]  You're going to get free stuff any moment now.
[01:35:57.405 --> 01:35:57.946]  Wait for it.
[01:35:57.946 --> 01:35:58.566]  We're sending it.
[01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:10.394]  And it's so cold-blooded.
[01:36:10.394 --> 01:36:17.237]  So, we as a civilization, we as a society, have to decide, do we want to be chumps?
[01:36:17.237 --> 01:36:31.024]  And that's my message before I hit this news, to not the 90% that are regular listeners, that are already informed, not from me, just by their own experiences, that tune in because they resonate with what we cover.
[01:36:31.024 --> 01:36:32.285]  I care about the prodigal son.
[01:36:33.973 --> 01:36:37.755]  I care about the lost people.
[01:36:37.755 --> 01:36:45.881]  And, you know, I have to humble myself and say I'm sorry, I'm not Chrysler.
[01:36:45.881 --> 01:36:46.421]  I should have been.
[01:36:46.421 --> 01:36:48.442]  I should have been more sweet to you.
[01:36:48.442 --> 01:36:49.703]  I should have spent time with you.
[01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:55.026]  I should have tried to really talk to you instead of being arrogant against you.
[01:36:55.026 --> 01:36:57.308]  But I need you to understand something.
[01:36:57.308 --> 01:36:59.049]  You're not part of the power structure.
[01:37:00.128 --> 01:37:01.528]  You're not part of the New World Order.
[01:37:01.528 --> 01:37:03.489]  You're not part of the winning team.
[01:37:03.489 --> 01:37:17.713]  When you're in Antifa, or you're in Black Lives Matter, or you're in some leftist organization, you're seen as the dumbest chumps in the world by Bill Gates, by George Soros.
[01:37:17.713 --> 01:37:25.915]  And it's come out from Facebook executives and Google executives that their whole mission is to make you alone and weak.
[01:37:29.827 --> 01:37:33.430]  And that they take pleasure in that.
[01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:47.302]  And so my only message to you is, there's something about the loser where they won't admit they're wrong and they won't admit they're conned.
[01:37:47.302 --> 01:37:48.984]  But you know, I still care about you.
[01:37:51.206 --> 01:37:54.628]  Because God, my heart tells me to care about you.
[01:37:54.628 --> 01:37:57.689]  I know there are people out there that think this is all funny.
[01:37:57.689 --> 01:37:59.190]  I think it's all a joke.
[01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:04.553]  You feel like you're on the winning team with Joe Biden, that reanimated zombie.
[01:38:04.553 --> 01:38:06.454]  And Kamala Harris.
[01:38:06.454 --> 01:38:12.017]  And you think you're running around and you're having victories and oh, you're on the winning team.
[01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:15.038]  You're not going to get a dollar out of this.
[01:38:15.038 --> 01:38:17.040]  You're not going to get ahead any by this.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.541]  Trump was doing everything he could
[01:38:23.166 --> 01:38:28.188]  To quite frankly, decadently flood your ass with money.
[01:38:28.188 --> 01:38:31.569]  It doesn't matter if you're Hispanic, white, black, old, young.
[01:38:31.569 --> 01:38:33.310]  Trump flooded things.
[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:43.754]  Because Trump said, why are we giving unlimited fiat currency to rich bankers and then nothing is given to the public?
[01:38:43.754 --> 01:38:44.394]  Why are we doing that?
[01:38:46.684 --> 01:38:59.151]  He said, if we're going to devalue currencies worldwide, which is an ongoing race by the bankers to bankrupt the current system, Trump said, fine, in the final act, let's just pump money to the average person.
[01:38:59.151 --> 01:39:01.853]  And the general public was in brainwash to say.
[01:39:03.547 --> 01:39:06.008]  We don't want you to give us money.
[01:39:06.008 --> 01:39:29.713]  We want George Soros, who started off his adult life rounding up fellow Jews for the Nazis, who bankrupts pension funds, and old people's pension funds, and says he's proud of it, and you're literally signed on to this soulless entity that doesn't care about you.
[01:39:29.713 --> 01:39:30.813]  That is truly insane.
[01:39:34.949 --> 01:39:38.692]  And so I have a responsibility as a Christian.
[01:39:38.692 --> 01:39:47.137]  You know, if I was a globalist, I would see you and see you as an animal, see you as trash, and I would feed on you.
[01:39:47.137 --> 01:39:50.219]  But God's spirit leaves me if I start thinking like that.
[01:39:50.219 --> 01:39:57.685]  So I'm not gonna treat you like that, but I will tell you straight up to your face, if you're a Democrat, if you're a leftist,
[01:39:58.641 --> 01:40:01.202]  If you're an antifa, you're an idiot.
[01:40:01.202 --> 01:40:10.544]  Literal Count Dracula, and then Prince Philip, who runs him, and Prince Charles, who are the Dracula line.
[01:40:10.544 --> 01:40:18.066]  Literally, literally, this is Hungarian, Romanian, these are the dudes.
[01:40:18.066 --> 01:40:20.807]  For a thousand years, these are blood drinkers.
[01:40:20.807 --> 01:40:26.208]  You are literally on your knees to the seed of Satan, the dragon.
[01:40:27.512 --> 01:40:30.713]  And you think it's going to give you milk and cookies at night.
[01:40:30.713 --> 01:40:31.654]  It isn't.
[01:40:31.654 --> 01:40:33.395]  You are fools.
[01:40:33.395 --> 01:40:35.015]  And you are in grave danger.
[01:40:35.015 --> 01:40:36.996]  And I'm begging you.
[01:40:36.996 --> 01:40:39.257]  I'm begging you for your own soul.
[01:40:39.257 --> 01:40:40.457]  We will destroy you.
[01:40:40.457 --> 01:40:42.498]  God's going to destroy you.
[01:40:42.498 --> 01:40:44.939]  I'm asking you to get off the side of Satan.
[01:40:44.939 --> 01:40:47.300]  I don't want to destroy you.
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.981]  I take no pleasure in this.
[01:40:48.981 --> 01:40:50.482]  I don't want to destroy you.
[01:40:50.482 --> 01:40:51.602]  I don't want God to destroy you.
[01:40:51.602 --> 01:40:53.043]  I'm just begging you, please.
[01:40:53.043 --> 01:40:54.363]  Stop serving Satan.
[01:40:54.363 --> 01:40:55.004]  Turn back now.
[01:40:55.004 --> 01:40:55.604]  There's still time.
[01:40:57.432 --> 01:40:58.292]  There's still time.
[01:40:58.292 --> 01:40:58.892]  You can do it.
[01:40:58.892 --> 01:41:01.093]  You can renounce Bill Gates.
[01:41:01.093 --> 01:41:03.073]  You can renounce Fauci.
[01:41:03.073 --> 01:41:04.974]  You can renounce Ted Turner.
[01:41:04.974 --> 01:41:06.934]  You can renounce George Soros.
[01:41:06.934 --> 01:41:08.634]  And you can accept Jesus Christ.
[01:41:08.634 --> 01:41:11.075]  You've got to do it quickly.
[01:41:11.075 --> 01:41:16.536]  There isn't much time.
[01:41:16.536 --> 01:41:22.037]  This is such a serious situation.
[01:41:22.037 --> 01:41:25.438]  Please, please turn back now.
[01:41:25.438 --> 01:41:26.658]  God doesn't want to destroy you.
[01:41:28.493 --> 01:41:35.221]  God doesn't want to annihilate you, but you've got to reject the power of the earth.
[01:41:35.221 --> 01:41:39.586]  You have to reject Satan or you don't have any hope.
[01:41:39.586 --> 01:41:43.170]  You must reject Joe Biden telling you you're dirty and you're bad.
[01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:44.151]  You're all this.
[01:41:44.151 --> 01:41:45.312]  These people are sick.
[01:41:45.312 --> 01:41:47.635]  I want to come back to the final segment.
[01:41:47.635 --> 01:41:48.056]  I'm going to hit.
[01:41:49.906 --> 01:41:54.987]  Their COVID lockdown to take over, how to stop it, how to resist in my humble view.
[01:41:54.987 --> 01:41:58.948]  And then Owen Schroyer is coming up with an amazing Sunday Live.
[01:41:58.948 --> 01:42:02.428]  They only have six minutes of ads because only local ads run.
[01:42:02.428 --> 01:42:09.510]  So that'll be coming up Sunday Live on all the streams, all the streams, all the streams, all the streams.
[01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:13.290]  And you'll be able to find that and share that on local radio stations, TV stations.
[01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:17.131]  Owen Schroyer is coming up for two hours after I leave you.
[01:42:18.271 --> 01:42:20.433]  This is such an incredible time.
[01:42:20.433 --> 01:42:29.363]  I want to thank the crew and thank everybody that's kept us on air because this is such an amazing point in history that we're all living together.
[01:42:29.363 --> 01:42:31.725]  Just please reject Satan.
[01:42:31.725 --> 01:42:33.267]  You can do it.
[01:42:33.267 --> 01:42:35.549]  Break the will of Satan.
[01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:36.630]  Turn loose.
[01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:37.431]  Join Jesus.
[01:42:37.431 --> 01:42:38.352]  I've done it.
[01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.513]  You can do it.
[01:42:39.513 --> 01:42:40.434]  Join Christ now.
[01:42:41.385 --> 01:42:42.987]  My hand is open.
[01:42:42.987 --> 01:42:43.708]  I love you.
[01:42:43.708 --> 01:42:44.549]  I care about you.
[01:42:44.549 --> 01:42:45.850]  Join us.
[01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:47.332]  Join us for eternity.
[01:42:47.332 --> 01:42:48.693]  Go with life.
[01:42:48.693 --> 01:42:49.254]  Stay with us.
[01:42:56.158 --> 01:43:03.063]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[01:43:03.063 --> 01:43:06.906]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[01:43:06.906 --> 01:43:13.931]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[01:43:13.931 --> 01:43:17.453]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[01:43:17.453 --> 01:43:20.535]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid.
[01:43:20.535 --> 01:43:23.497]  But we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:24.658]  I think?
[01:43:45.299 --> 01:43:51.785]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[01:44:03.855 --> 01:44:14.399]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns where you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[01:44:14.399 --> 01:44:24.162]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[01:44:24.722 --> 01:44:27.985]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[01:44:27.985 --> 01:44:30.908]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[01:44:30.908 --> 01:44:32.449]  This is world government.
[01:44:32.449 --> 01:44:37.134]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[01:44:37.134 --> 01:44:39.176]  They're announcing that Christmas is cancelled.
[01:44:39.176 --> 01:44:41.598]  This is what the communist takeover looks like.
[01:44:41.598 --> 01:44:45.502]  To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely
[01:44:45.882 --> 01:44:49.208]  Transform the world into a prison planet.
[01:44:49.208 --> 01:44:51.112]  How long have we warned you about this?
[01:44:51.112 --> 01:44:52.554]  But you can fight back.
[01:44:52.554 --> 01:44:54.458]  America is the last bastion.
[01:44:54.458 --> 01:44:55.259]  Stop submitting!
[01:44:57.222 --> 01:45:03.905]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[01:45:03.905 --> 01:45:09.887]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:11.107]  Incredible!
[01:45:11.107 --> 01:45:19.991]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[01:45:19.991 --> 01:45:21.151]  That is a fact.
[01:45:21.151 --> 01:45:26.373]  And all the hero sheep that wear the mask to go along with this are signing on to mass murder
[01:45:26.733 --> 01:45:28.274]  Bigger than what Hitler did.
[01:45:28.274 --> 01:45:31.735]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[01:45:31.735 --> 01:45:40.699]  This is a medical, world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IDs, and coming with forced inoculations.
[01:45:40.699 --> 01:45:45.761]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[01:45:45.761 --> 01:45:47.562]  That story's on Infowars.com.
[01:45:47.562 --> 01:45:55.846]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you do not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary Great Reset.
[01:45:57.253 --> 01:46:00.996]  Communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months.
[01:46:00.996 --> 01:46:06.159]  But the European Union and every other major Western nation is still under some form of lockdown.
[01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:13.365]  And the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested if they leave their houses, just like we've seen in Australia.
[01:46:14.085 --> 01:46:17.486]  You see, the authoritarians want total control.
[01:46:17.486 --> 01:46:23.608]  And because they don't respect this, because the general public puts up with so much abuse, they're going for broke.
[01:46:23.608 --> 01:46:24.629]  Why shouldn't they?
[01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:26.549]  They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars.
[01:46:26.549 --> 01:46:28.870]  They never get in trouble for the Chinese slave camps.
[01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:32.572]  They never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in Africa.
[01:46:32.572 --> 01:46:35.993]  They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country.
[01:46:36.733 --> 01:46:39.775]  And so why shouldn't they go for broke?
[01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:42.517]  Because so many people are domesticated and they're soft.
[01:46:42.517 --> 01:46:43.998]  And they have Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:46:43.998 --> 01:46:45.619]  They love their abusers.
[01:46:45.619 --> 01:46:47.780]  They can't believe they're being lied to.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.822]  They can't believe they're being conned.
[01:46:49.822 --> 01:46:51.843]  And so they're going into bondage.
[01:46:51.843 --> 01:46:54.225]  You see, there's always a minority that says no.
[01:46:54.225 --> 01:46:59.148]  And Infowars is that minority.
[01:46:59.148 --> 01:47:01.750]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:07.948 --> 01:47:36.984]  Old pirates, yes they rob I Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took I From the bottomless pit But my hand was made strong By the hand of the Almighty We forward in this generation
[01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:41.614]  Beautiful Bob Marley.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.601]  All right, let's go to this clip.
[01:47:58.601 --> 01:48:06.085]  Here's Fauci in 2017, right from Selective saying he will be challenged by a health crisis.
[01:48:06.085 --> 01:48:07.386]  And now they've launched it.
[01:48:07.386 --> 01:48:09.207]  He ran Wuhan with Bill Gates.
[01:48:09.207 --> 01:48:10.287]  He is the enemy.
[01:48:10.287 --> 01:48:12.108]  He is the author of our destruction.
[01:48:12.108 --> 01:48:13.228]  He should be arrested.
[01:48:13.228 --> 01:48:14.029]  He is Hitler.
[01:48:15.248 --> 01:48:32.477]  is that there is no question that there will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak and
[01:48:36.305 --> 01:48:36.885]  That's right.
[01:48:36.885 --> 01:48:37.886]  That's not the full clip.
[01:48:37.886 --> 01:48:40.127]  It goes on as it'll be a surprise outbreak.
[01:48:40.127 --> 01:48:41.787]  And it gets very, very obvious.
[01:48:41.787 --> 01:48:42.988]  Let's find that full clip for tomorrow.
[01:48:42.988 --> 01:48:45.369]  You guys are great, but that's the one you pulled up.
[01:48:45.369 --> 01:48:51.072]  Here is Fauci on 60 Minutes in March saying, don't wear a mask.
[01:48:51.072 --> 01:48:52.832]  They call this fake news.
[01:48:52.832 --> 01:48:55.053]  It actually gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[01:48:55.053 --> 01:48:58.175]  That's what the real studies he wrote, 2008, say.
[01:48:58.175 --> 01:48:59.615]  Snopes says it's not true.
[01:48:59.615 --> 01:49:00.416]  Go read the study.
[01:49:00.416 --> 01:49:01.176]  It is true.
[01:49:01.176 --> 01:49:04.798]  Again, and then learn the criminal actions of Snopes for yourself.
[01:49:04.798 --> 01:49:05.158]  Here it is.
[01:49:05.638 --> 01:49:10.401]  There's a lot of confusion among people and misinformation surrounding face masks.
[01:49:10.401 --> 01:49:12.221]  Can you discuss that?
[01:49:12.221 --> 01:49:18.805]  The masks are important for someone who's infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.
[01:49:18.805 --> 01:49:25.888]  Now, when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, whatever, everybody's wearing a mask.
[01:49:25.888 --> 01:49:30.451]  Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.
[01:49:31.343 --> 01:49:34.405]  You're sure of it, because people are listening really closely to this.
[01:49:34.405 --> 01:49:36.087]  Right now, people should not be walking around with a mask.
[01:49:36.087 --> 01:49:39.229]  There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
[01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:49.097]  When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better, and it might even block a droplet.
[01:49:49.097 --> 01:49:53.301]  But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
[01:49:55.222 --> 01:49:57.423]  There are unintended consequences.
[01:49:57.423 --> 01:50:00.884]  People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.
[01:50:00.884 --> 01:50:04.145]  And can you get some schmutz sort of staying inside there?
[01:50:04.145 --> 01:50:05.285]  Of course, of course.
[01:50:05.285 --> 01:50:10.987]  But when you think mask, you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill.
[01:50:10.987 --> 01:50:18.189]  The people who, when you look at the films of foreign countries and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine.
[01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.589]  That's fine.
[01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:19.490]  I'm not against it.
[01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:20.570]  If you want to do it, that's fine.
[01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:23.134]  But it can lead to a shortage of masks.
[01:50:23.134 --> 01:50:24.296]  Exactly, that's the point.
[01:50:24.296 --> 01:50:26.360]  It could lead to a shortage of masks.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.665]  So what this is, is cult programming, okay?
[01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:32.971]  So that's what he actually had to say.
[01:50:32.971 --> 01:50:33.813]  Now let's look at the facts.
[01:50:36.095 --> 01:50:43.399]  His study he wrote in 2008 said bacterial pneumonia was the main cause of death in the Spanish Flu because everyone wore masks.
[01:50:43.399 --> 01:50:46.341]  They used to think leeches on your legs were the way to go.
[01:50:46.341 --> 01:50:52.245]  The truth is, all of us breathing on each other, touching each other, gives us herd immunity.
[01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:53.846]  That's what makes us strong.
[01:50:53.846 --> 01:50:55.967]  Other people have already gotten an immunity.
[01:50:55.967 --> 01:50:57.988]  You give them your immunity.
[01:50:57.988 --> 01:50:58.849]  Nine times out of ten.
[01:50:58.849 --> 01:51:02.911]  I mean, I don't want to knock on wood here.
[01:51:02.911 --> 01:51:05.493]  I've had one fever in five and a half years.
[01:51:05.493 --> 01:51:05.813]  One fever.
[01:51:07.611 --> 01:51:13.535]  And it was this January, from flying on planes, a bad cough for about a week, and a fever.
[01:51:13.535 --> 01:51:15.256]  It was probably COVID.
[01:51:15.256 --> 01:51:18.378]  I was tested for COVID on Joe Rogan's show, didn't come up.
[01:51:18.378 --> 01:51:19.519]  Doesn't matter!
[01:51:19.519 --> 01:51:25.142]  The tests only pick up a high viral load of any virus, that's on record.
[01:51:25.142 --> 01:51:25.883]  So it's a fraud!
[01:51:25.883 --> 01:51:27.904]  I mean, I can read the study!
[01:51:27.904 --> 01:51:34.128]  I can read, it's like, I talked to family about this, like, how do you know that I read the study?
[01:51:34.128 --> 01:51:35.149]  It's so frustrating.
[01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:36.370]  So, again,
[01:51:37.281 --> 01:51:39.462]  They told us 4% would die from this.
[01:51:39.462 --> 01:51:42.824]  It's less than one-tenth of 1%.
[01:51:42.824 --> 01:51:44.545]  They told us 2.5 million will be dead.
[01:51:44.545 --> 01:51:46.085]  It's a quarter million.
[01:51:46.085 --> 01:51:47.386]  And most of those died of something else.
[01:51:47.386 --> 01:51:50.027]  It's a fraud!
[01:51:50.027 --> 01:51:51.668]  The science doesn't lie.
[01:51:51.668 --> 01:51:52.829]  The math doesn't lie.
[01:51:52.829 --> 01:51:57.611]  We've got all these epidemiologists that have come out, all these virologists, and they get censored!
[01:51:57.611 --> 01:51:59.372]  The heads of university!
[01:51:59.372 --> 01:52:01.153]  The heads of Cedars-Sinai!
[01:52:04.727 --> 01:52:14.051]  Because Big Tech wants to keep the lockdown going because their companies have had 80 to 100 percent profit increases because everything else is shut down.
[01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:18.293]  Because you run away and get shut down, they don't!
[01:52:18.293 --> 01:52:21.915]  I know our listeners get this, but you've got to be aggressive.
[01:52:21.915 --> 01:52:23.976]  I went to restaurants this weekend.
[01:52:23.976 --> 01:52:24.796]  I went to stores.
[01:52:24.796 --> 01:52:26.077]  I didn't wear a mask.
[01:52:26.077 --> 01:52:28.338]  I got confronted one time in a grocery store and I said, listen,
[01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.312]  The economy's imploding.
[01:52:33.312 --> 01:52:34.093]  This is BS.
[01:52:34.093 --> 01:52:34.793]  This is a grocery store.
[01:52:34.793 --> 01:52:35.293]  Leave me alone.
[01:52:35.293 --> 01:52:36.434]  Actually, I know you're right.
[01:52:36.434 --> 01:52:37.835]  I'll tell you.
[01:52:37.835 --> 01:52:39.376]  Let's look at some headlines here.
[01:52:39.376 --> 01:52:52.604]  California exempts Hollywood movie studios from COVID lockdown restrictions, but says churches, bars, restaurants, gyms, not.
[01:52:52.604 --> 01:52:52.764]  Well,
[01:52:56.448 --> 01:52:59.711]  On a scale of 1 to 5, you get 5 Hitler mustaches.
[01:52:59.711 --> 01:53:01.993]  Wish you had a new thing there.
[01:53:01.993 --> 01:53:05.276]  You get 5 Hitler mustaches Newsome.
[01:53:05.276 --> 01:53:07.738]  Millions of Americans ignore COVID travel warning.
[01:53:07.738 --> 01:53:11.142]  First vaccination is expected December 11th.
[01:53:11.142 --> 01:53:13.063]  Oh!
[01:53:13.063 --> 01:53:17.688]  And they admit you have to sign a waiver when you take it because it may make you so sick.
[01:53:17.688 --> 01:53:20.650]  So, there are going to be a lot of COVID deaths from the vaccine.
[01:53:20.650 --> 01:53:21.011]  Get ready.
[01:53:23.086 --> 01:53:28.608]  European leader predicts COVID hell will trigger monumental populist backlash.
[01:53:28.608 --> 01:53:36.252]  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot defends joining crowds celebrating Biden-Harris win with her mask off with thousands of people.
[01:53:36.252 --> 01:53:39.593]  It's all a scam, people.
[01:53:39.593 --> 01:53:48.798]  And again, Newsom got caught flying out to Hawaii with hundreds of Democrats paid for by donors with taxpayer money, not wearing masks.
[01:53:48.798 --> 01:53:50.458]  It's all a big scam.
[01:53:50.458 --> 01:53:51.859]  It's all a big joke on you.
[01:53:54.677 --> 01:54:00.882]  Our hypocritical leaders don't even follow their own COVID-19 rules.
[01:54:00.882 --> 01:54:03.544]  Of course they don't.
[01:54:03.544 --> 01:54:07.486]  And we shouldn't leap in and like join them and like, oh, look, you're bad.
[01:54:07.486 --> 01:54:08.087]  You didn't do it.
[01:54:08.087 --> 01:54:09.408]  No, it's all a fraud.
[01:54:09.408 --> 01:54:10.789]  You know it's a fraud.
[01:54:10.789 --> 01:54:14.832]  It's an economic weapon to shut us down.
[01:54:14.832 --> 01:54:19.055]  Oh, but here's where the real meat and potatoes happen right now.
[01:54:22.518 --> 01:54:23.858]  Look at these headlines.
[01:54:23.858 --> 01:54:35.962]  Britons who test negative for COVID twice in a week are set to receive a Freedom Pass run by Bill Gates, the Prime Minister announces.
[01:54:35.962 --> 01:54:39.623]  The Global Medical ID now announced.
[01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:40.604]  Wow!
[01:54:40.604 --> 01:54:44.165]  And who else is promoting it?
[01:54:44.165 --> 01:54:44.345]  Oh!
[01:54:44.345 --> 01:54:48.246]  Oh, look!
[01:54:48.246 --> 01:54:49.766]  Overhead shot.
[01:54:49.766 --> 01:54:51.067]  Xi Jinping
[01:54:52.216 --> 01:54:54.937]  Proposes global health QR code.
[01:54:54.937 --> 01:54:57.057]  We should go to every restaurant now.
[01:54:57.057 --> 01:54:59.378]  They go, oh, we don't have menus anymore, it's a QR code.
[01:54:59.378 --> 01:55:01.258]  It's getting you ready for the social credit score.
[01:55:01.258 --> 01:55:04.039]  Demand a paper menu, don't do it, leave.
[01:55:04.039 --> 01:55:11.901]  Chinese President Xi proposes global health QR code system to revive coronavirus-battered trade and travel.
[01:55:11.901 --> 01:55:14.021]  Oh, they'll fix to the travel.
[01:55:14.021 --> 01:55:16.182]  Just accept this, you'll get your money.
[01:55:16.182 --> 01:55:19.423]  No, you accept this, you're over.
[01:55:19.423 --> 01:55:20.063]  And it gets worse.
[01:55:21.004 --> 01:55:29.128]  World Economic Forum endorsed Great Reset seeks to eliminate currency and private property for the general public except for themselves.
[01:55:29.128 --> 01:55:36.612]  They say, we will bankrupt you, but don't worry, everything will be free, even though they've exploited the third world like monsters.
[01:55:36.612 --> 01:55:37.252]  Wow!
[01:55:37.252 --> 01:55:38.553]  Incredible!
[01:55:38.553 --> 01:55:44.576]  Meanwhile, John Kerry says Great Reset is needed to stop rise in populism.
[01:55:44.576 --> 01:55:47.318]  The former Secretary of State says it's punishment
[01:55:47.984 --> 01:55:52.547]  For Brexit and America for not joining the New World Order.
[01:55:52.547 --> 01:55:53.988]  Wow!
[01:55:53.988 --> 01:55:58.211]  He's gonna punish us just like Justin Trudeau said.
[01:55:58.211 --> 01:56:00.112]  Oh, thank you!
[01:56:00.112 --> 01:56:02.914]  And the average Latvian goes, punish me, punish me.
[01:56:02.914 --> 01:56:05.595]  They're cucked.
[01:56:05.595 --> 01:56:07.817]  You've got all the articles about the Great Reset.
[01:56:09.574 --> 01:56:11.535]  What happened to an academic freedom?
[01:56:11.535 --> 01:56:22.199]  Scientists fumes as Facebook flags COVID-19 study by a major medical journal saying masks do not protect you and give you viral pneumonia.
[01:56:22.199 --> 01:56:23.620]  That article is from RT.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:25.521]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:56:25.521 --> 01:56:26.801]  Here's the actual study.
[01:56:26.801 --> 01:56:28.502]  The American Spectator reported it.
[01:56:28.502 --> 01:56:35.925]  Landmark Danish study finds no significant effects for face mask wearers except for viral pneumonia.
[01:56:35.925 --> 01:56:36.025]  Oh.
[01:56:37.306 --> 01:56:40.809]  But again, you're not supposed to know that.
[01:56:40.809 --> 01:56:41.730]  Oh, and look at Trump.
[01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:42.891]  He's so evil.
[01:56:42.891 --> 01:56:44.953]  Trump attends his final G20 summit.
[01:56:44.953 --> 01:56:46.794]  Oh, his final?
[01:56:46.794 --> 01:56:49.357]  No, he's the president, not Biden.
[01:56:49.357 --> 01:56:50.558]  It's all fraud.
[01:56:50.558 --> 01:56:52.539]  Does not participate in a pandemic.
[01:56:52.539 --> 01:56:56.923]  Preparing the session because he knows it's a global martial law fraud.
[01:56:56.923 --> 01:57:00.547]  He should have gone and exposed the whole damn thing.
[01:57:00.547 --> 01:57:00.807]  All right.
[01:57:02.717 --> 01:57:10.247]  Owens Troyer, two minutes after I leave here, takes over on the audio and video streams and many radio stations.
[01:57:10.247 --> 01:57:11.589]  Owen is an amazing patriot.
[01:57:12.697 --> 01:57:14.698]  He's about to take over with Sunday Live.
[01:57:14.698 --> 01:57:18.559]  Please stay tuned to all our feeds and share them.
[01:57:18.559 --> 01:57:20.740]  Share them or roll over and die.
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:23.441]  Your action isn't just like a side thing.
[01:57:23.441 --> 01:57:24.642]  You're the steak.
[01:57:24.642 --> 01:57:25.802]  I'm the potatoes.
[01:57:25.802 --> 01:57:34.466]  You've got to share the link on your Twitter, on your Facebook, on your email, on your instant message, on your text message.
[01:57:34.466 --> 01:57:35.286]  Do it now!
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.905]  The American Revolution is televised.
[01:57:38.905 --> 01:57:40.549]  We're fighting the globalist takeover.
[01:57:40.549 --> 01:57:41.171]  Are you helping?
[01:57:41.171 --> 01:57:41.712]  I know you are.
[01:57:41.712 --> 01:57:42.514]  God bless you.
[01:57:42.514 --> 01:57:43.436]  Owen Schroer, coming up.
[01:57:43.436 --> 01:57:44.238]  See you back tomorrow at 11am.
