[00:00.000 --> 00:13.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, the head of the Federal Elections Commission has gone public and said
[00:13.240 --> 00:18.480]  there was massive fraud orchestrated across the country against President Trump and against
[00:18.480 --> 00:20.600]  the American people.
[00:20.600 --> 00:24.080]  That is coming up.
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.320]  We also have Senator Cramer coming out and saying Trump has every right to be challenging
[00:27.320 --> 00:32.320]  this election.
[00:32.320 --> 00:34.720]  We're going to lay it all out today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34.720 --> 00:36.360]  So much huge breaking news.
[00:36.360 --> 00:41.120]  The Supreme Court moving in to certify the election for Trump and so much more.
[00:41.120 --> 00:45.720]  You don't want to miss this live Sunday transmission, November 22nd, 2020.
[00:45.720 --> 00:47.480]  But first, a key report.
[00:47.480 --> 00:50.240]  The election fraud in four minutes.
[00:50.240 --> 00:52.240]  Company is called Dominion Voting.
[00:52.240 --> 00:53.740]  It's used in 28 states.
[00:53.740 --> 00:58.520]  Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion.
[00:58.520 --> 01:03.120]  Several days ago, Dominion came under heavy fire after allegations that their machines
[01:03.120 --> 01:07.880]  caused thousands of votes in one Michigan county to be switched from Donald Trump to
[01:07.880 --> 01:08.880]  Joe Biden.
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.640]  Which is why Texas rejected using Dominion software three times, raising concerns that
[01:13.640 --> 01:17.360]  the system was not safe from fraudulent or unauthorized manipulation.
[01:17.360 --> 01:23.400]  It was funded by money from Venezuela and Cuba and China has a role in it also.
[01:23.400 --> 01:27.720]  So if you want to talk about foreign election interference, we certainly have it now.
[01:27.720 --> 01:33.960]  It's a feature of the system that was designed with a back door so that people could watch
[01:33.960 --> 01:40.200]  in real time and calculate with an algorithm how many votes they needed to change to make
[01:40.200 --> 01:42.160]  the result they wanted to create.
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.160]  Each voting machine is a computer running a computer program.
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.680]  Whether that computer counts the votes accurately or makes mistakes or cheats by shifting votes
[01:50.680 --> 01:54.800]  from one candidate to another depends on what software is installed in the computer.
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.640]  President Trump won by not just hundreds of thousands of votes but by millions of votes.
[02:00.640 --> 02:04.800]  We have so much evidence I feel like it's coming in through a fire hose.
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.200]  In Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.800]  causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidates.
[02:15.800 --> 02:22.120]  The county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation
[02:22.120 --> 02:23.620]  of the votes.
[02:23.620 --> 02:30.480]  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same
[02:30.480 --> 02:31.600]  capacity.
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.040]  We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed.
[02:37.040 --> 02:39.040]  It was designed to rig elections.
[02:39.040 --> 02:44.960]  And the software development was funded by the Clinton Global Initiative.
[02:44.960 --> 02:45.960]  That's what the Democrats do.
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.400]  If they don't like the rules, they change them.
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.160]  And they change them at the last minute, they manipulate them, they want to tear down our
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  American system.
[02:53.160 --> 02:55.040]  It is indeed a very foul mess.
[02:55.040 --> 03:00.120]  It is farther and wider and deeper than we ever thought, but we are going to go after
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.840]  it and I am going to expose every one of them.
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.640]  Installing a vote-stealing program in a voting machine takes seven minutes per machine with
[03:07.640 --> 03:08.640]  a screwdriver.
[03:08.640 --> 03:11.400]  But really, the software I built was not rocket science.
[03:11.400 --> 03:14.160]  Any computer programmer could write the same code.
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.040]  Once it's installed, it could steal elections without detection for years to come.
[03:18.040 --> 03:22.200]  We've got statistical evidence that shows hundreds of thousands of votes being just
[03:22.200 --> 03:23.880]  put in and replicated.
[03:23.880 --> 03:29.000]  In total, about 500,000 votes were taken from Trump and switched to Biden.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.360]  130,000 here, 27,000 there.
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.520]  You can see how there's 200,000 votes magically for Biden at 3 a.m. in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[03:37.520 --> 03:43.520]  It's like drag and drop Trump votes to a separate folder and then delete that folder.
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.920]  As you knew, you were going to use those ballots to catch Biden up.
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.440]  This is literally global government, the Communist Chinese and others want to take this country
[03:52.440 --> 03:56.920]  over and President Trump has been standing against that and he was winning all these
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.120]  battleground states by higher numbers on election night until they closed the polls and then
[04:01.120 --> 04:03.120]  secretly stopped the ballot boxes.
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.200]  And so that's why they're scared of recounts, it's why they're scared of legislatures stepping
[04:07.200 --> 04:09.160]  in and is their constitutional duty.
[04:09.160 --> 04:22.960]  This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating and the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.280]  for people in this country to have participated in in any way, shape or form.
[04:28.280 --> 04:33.760]  And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated.
[04:33.760 --> 04:39.920]  New patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to the highest level
[04:39.920 --> 04:43.840]  of our government and we are going to take this country back.
[04:43.840 --> 04:45.720]  We are not going to be intimidated.
[04:45.720 --> 04:47.760]  We are not going to back down.
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.520]  We are going to clean this mess up now.
[04:51.520 --> 04:53.520]  President Trump won by a landslide.
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.840]  We are going to prove it and we are going to reclaim the United States of America for
[04:57.840 --> 04:59.840]  the people who vote.
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.880]  The great moment of truth this year, America discovered in the last five, six years that
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.840]  we were under globalist control and the traitors of both parties that sold us out to Congress,
[05:09.840 --> 05:13.840]  China and multinational corporations and were established in the authoritarian anti-American
[05:13.840 --> 05:14.840]  system.
[05:14.840 --> 05:19.200]  Well now they've launched their counter assault and through fraud are trying to steal the
[05:19.200 --> 05:24.200]  election right now and complete the police state takeover by bankrupting the people
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.920]  of the United States but also the entire world to bring us to our knees under the great
[05:28.920 --> 05:29.920]  reset.
[05:29.920 --> 05:33.800]  Info wars has never been more valuable or more important and I'm honored with the position
[05:33.800 --> 05:38.680]  that you've put me in and for God's blessing but I'm asking all listeners to understand
[05:38.680 --> 05:43.000]  that info wars is spending more money than we've ever spent in the fight to expose the
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  stolen election agenda 21, the great reset and the globalist takeover.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.400]  So please visit infowarstore.com today.
[05:50.400 --> 05:53.320]  We have the big stop to steal sale that I've extended through the weekend but then it will
[05:53.320 --> 05:55.720]  end because so many products are about to sell out.

[06:02.720 --> 06:20.320]  Well we told you about those 79 days of hell that election day would just kick off the
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.320]  Democrats.
[06:21.320 --> 06:27.880]  They promised they would hold it up right through the inauguration and would not concede
[06:27.880 --> 06:32.880]  under any circumstance.
[06:32.880 --> 06:39.680]  Ladies and gentlemen it is November 22nd on this live Sunday worldwide transmission.
[06:39.680 --> 06:48.760]  I am your host Alex Jones and we are going to be here live for the next two hours.
[06:48.760 --> 06:52.040]  President Owen Schreuer is coming in for the new show we've been doing during the election
[06:52.040 --> 06:56.280]  and during this coming up constitutional crisis and global crisis we accurately predicted
[06:56.280 --> 07:03.000]  with the show Sunday live, 6 to 8 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Very powerful transmission.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.680]  Takes a lot of calls, a lot of guests.
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.760]  Okay, let me just tell you up front here what we got for you.
[07:11.760 --> 07:13.560]  I'm a realist.
[07:13.560 --> 07:17.840]  If Trump would have lost this election I would have been completely honest about it and tell
[07:17.840 --> 07:20.520]  you I don't make stuff up.
[07:20.520 --> 07:24.640]  I would have said Joe Biden needs to be arrested as a communist Chinese agent on record along
[07:24.640 --> 07:30.600]  with his son the rest of his scumbag family but that's another issue.
[07:30.600 --> 07:34.760]  They stole this thing bigger than Dallas and that evidence is all out there and now the
[07:34.760 --> 07:38.000]  globalists are death-threading and twisting arms like you've never seen to get people
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.000]  out there.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.640]  Even folks we think we can trust to turn against this process and say that there's not fraud
[07:43.640 --> 07:49.040]  but we have the head of the Federal Elections Commission, there's a long interview up at
[07:49.040 --> 07:54.440]  mfoldwars.com and I'll play 43 seconds of it in a moment saying there are seven documented
[07:54.440 --> 08:02.160]  examples of election fraud which really is organized so it's not classical voter fraud
[08:02.160 --> 08:10.040]  and then you have Senator Kramer saying Trump has every right to pursue legal avenues available
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.040]  to him.
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.760]  The idea that he's a dictator, the idea that this is criminal, the idea that it's unprecedented
[08:15.760 --> 08:17.960]  is just a lie on his face.
[08:17.960 --> 08:26.000]  Al Gore challenged for 37 days until the Supreme Court overturned him and there have been elections
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.840]  that went for months before.
[08:27.840 --> 08:31.760]  The Democrats said I'm not going to play the videos, you've seen them, there's hundreds
[08:31.760 --> 08:32.760]  of them.
[08:32.760 --> 08:40.040]  Pelosi, Hillary, Biden, Obama, all of them saying we think there's a red mirage, we think
[08:40.040 --> 08:44.200]  he's going to win bag, but we're going to have these magic votes that come in after
[08:44.200 --> 08:46.160]  and so we're going to contest no matter what.
[08:46.160 --> 08:51.240]  I mean they all said it and now they're like you never contest, that's what dictators do.
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.680]  So they're allowed to contest but Trump isn't allowed to contest and you see the spin.
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.240]  Oh the governor of Georgia came out and said the election was clean and repudiated Trump.
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.680]  Well the video is at mfoldwars.com, the governor came out and said there's clear evidence of
[09:07.680 --> 09:16.960]  fraud called for a criminal investigation and said that now that he certified what the
[09:16.960 --> 09:24.000]  state operations had put out that now Trump can come in and actually do a signature check
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.400]  which reportedly they didn't even check the signatures, a lot of the ballots that got
[09:27.400 --> 09:31.640]  melded didn't even have signatures, those are all thrown out, especially the ones that
[09:31.640 --> 09:37.160]  came in after the election where in all these states, five battleground states, they ordered
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.280]  the Postal Service did, employees that if something was after the election, November
[09:43.280 --> 09:51.320]  4th, 5th, 6th, that you would backdate it so they could count it, this is all on record.
[09:51.320 --> 09:56.520]  Trump hasn't opened and shut case on all this and then next segment I'll lay it out.
[09:56.520 --> 10:05.640]  The Supreme Court unprecedentedly came in and changed in the key battleground states
[10:05.640 --> 10:12.200]  what Supreme Court justices were over, what circuit and so who will be ruling on what
[10:12.200 --> 10:16.680]  cases to take from the circuits and who will have control of those rulings to fast track
[10:16.680 --> 10:25.760]  them and they've put Gorsuch and they've put Thomas and they've put Barrett and they've
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.320]  put Elito and they've put Kavanaugh over the four key states so they are locked and
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.000]  loaded, a major signal, they see the fraud, they know the scam and they're moving in.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.120]  That's why there's almost no coverage of that but I shot a two hour report yesterday about
[10:42.120 --> 10:49.480]  it and I shot another 15 minute report this morning on it that are at band.video.
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.600]  I would suggest you email those out, I would suggest you share those if you want to defeat
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.520]  these criminals because the one thing big tech is counting on is that they can censor
[10:59.520 --> 11:03.720]  you on Facebook, Twitter, Google and all the rest of it but they can't do it yet on your
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.720]  email or your text messages, they're trying, Facebook is censoring text messages but you
[11:08.720 --> 11:11.960]  can override these people if you get upset and take action, if you tell people about
[11:11.960 --> 11:15.440]  the local radio station you're listening to, another great way to do it, a local TV station
[11:15.440 --> 11:17.960]  so we're going to be getting into all that.
[11:17.960 --> 11:25.280]  FEC Chairman Trey Tanner confirms there was election fraud this year, points to several
[11:25.280 --> 11:29.160]  instances and we go through all of it, there's seven of them.
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.840]  So let's go ahead and roll that short clip.
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.840]  But do you believe there is voter fraud out there specifically in Pennsylvania and other
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.120]  states that are weighing heavily in on this election?
[11:40.120 --> 11:43.960]  I do believe that there's voter fraud taking place in these places otherwise they would
[11:43.960 --> 11:46.040]  allow the observers to go in.
[11:46.040 --> 11:51.560]  When you have claims of 10,000 people who don't live in the state of Nevada having voted in
[11:51.560 --> 11:57.040]  Nevada you have the video showing where people are, they're either duplicating a spoiled
[11:57.040 --> 12:03.200]  ballot right there or they're in the process of just marking a ballot that came in blank
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.680]  for a voter.
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.400]  That's a process that needs to be observed by election observers, state law allows those
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.520]  observers to be in there and if they're not then the law is not being followed making
[12:12.520 --> 12:15.160]  this an illegitimate election.
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.120]  Now if you're a TV viewer, we're simulcast at radio and TV, you know that's Newsmax,
[12:19.120 --> 12:22.680]  their audience is about five fold so is ours.
[12:22.680 --> 12:26.880]  Newsmax has the head of the Federal Election Commission on, they're not even having, they
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.360]  head of the FEC on Fox, even Fox, that's the coverup.
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.240]  So he's on OAN, he's on Newsmax, great, I'm glad they're out there, I'm not in competition
[12:37.240 --> 12:40.920]  with them, I'm in competition with the globalists, I want to defeat them.
[12:40.920 --> 12:46.360]  But CNN's had a bunch of their host calls for OAN and Newsmax to be shut down under
[12:46.360 --> 12:53.200]  the fairness doctrine and bring back what was overturned in 1984 by Reagan, totally unconstitutional.
[12:53.200 --> 12:59.080]  They're saying we're nonpartisan at CNN and MSNBC, we can say what we want and say that
[12:59.080 --> 13:07.200]  Trump's a dictator but you can't have Newsmax or Info Wars and have the head of the Federal
[13:07.200 --> 13:13.080]  Election Commission on to say there is fraud and then to show video of people marking ballots.
[13:13.080 --> 13:17.320]  Remember what got caught in early voting a month for the election?
[13:17.320 --> 13:22.880]  In Pennsylvania a man's sitting there, the observers had to sit back over 50 yards away
[13:22.880 --> 13:31.120]  but Yahoo News zoomed in and it showed the man filling ballots out and looking over his
[13:31.120 --> 13:32.120]  shoulder.
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.960]  I mean, this is unbelievable, it's caught on video, let me tell you what's happening
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.160]  here, I've been working seven days a week, I'm not complaining but my hair is falling
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.960]  out, I mean my God, I'm so stressed out about this and I'm sitting there and I was up here
[13:47.960 --> 13:53.680]  this morning at 7 a.m. with Rob Dew, no place to rather be and we're looking at his computer
[13:53.680 --> 14:00.120]  and it's a law firm in Michigan sent us dozens of videos and depositions and sworn video
[14:00.120 --> 14:05.680]  affidavits and the affidavits of all these witnesses that were in Detroit and the fraud
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.360]  all sworn all in court from one law firm and I was in there for hours just trying to watch
[14:12.360 --> 14:15.920]  it and it was all incredible.
[14:15.920 --> 14:22.720]  That law firm tries to put it up on YouTube, phew, taking down, phew, phew, phew, phew.
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.040]  So I'm scrambling to get the little bit of crew we got because folks got to have some
[14:26.040 --> 14:30.320]  time off at a skeleton crew tonight to try to upload those law firm videos.
[14:30.320 --> 14:35.880]  This is insane, ladies and gentlemen, the clock is ticking.
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.440]  So yeah, I'm racing around like a chicken on my head cut off because the chai comms,
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.680]  the globalists are taking our country over and they are announcing a new lockdown if
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.040]  Biden gets in to break us financially and bring us into slavery and I'm not going to
[14:48.040 --> 14:51.680]  sit here and I'm not going to take it and I'm not going to run my mouth about, well,
[14:51.680 --> 14:57.360]  if they keep this up, we'll just have a physical war, boulder dash.
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.160]  If you're not fighting hard now in the info war, you're never going to pick up a gun in
[15:02.160 --> 15:08.760]  a physical war of the chai comms and the globalists want this to be physical because they could
[15:08.760 --> 15:10.920]  mismanage the whole thing and bring the country down.
[15:10.920 --> 15:16.320]  I want the people to not comply, civil disobedience, say no to the system and take our country
[15:16.320 --> 15:19.600]  back and identify this as an outside globalist operation.
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.280]  The COVID shutdown, Joe Biden, all of it and hell, they're making it easy.
[15:24.280 --> 15:32.000]  The Bond villain, Klaus Schwab, the UN, the head of the IMF are all saying America's done.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.760]  We're using COVID to shut them down.
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.600]  We're going to punish Americans for Trump.
[15:35.600 --> 15:37.880]  They're giving speeches about how it's all made up.
[15:37.880 --> 15:40.040]  Klaus Schwab goes, oh, COVID's not even a threat.
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.960]  We're just using it to shut everything down.
[15:41.960 --> 15:45.720]  I mean, God almighty, these people are arrogant.
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.040]  They've miscalculated again just like Hitler did and they're going to find out.
[15:50.040 --> 15:52.280]  They're going to find out.
[15:52.280 --> 15:58.240]  We're going to defeat these people together, spread the word, we'll be right back.
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.200]  You know something very sad is happening and it's very sad because it was all avoidable.
[16:02.200 --> 16:06.800]  Two and a half years ago, an info war has got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.240]  I warned everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that
[16:11.240 --> 16:17.040]  they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there
[16:17.040 --> 16:22.400]  was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and populists.
[16:22.400 --> 16:23.720]  And now that's happened.
[16:23.720 --> 16:28.080]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.840]  and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump needed to get out front and
[16:33.840 --> 16:37.360]  fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax.
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.080]  He started to do that the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand
[16:42.080 --> 16:44.840]  that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[16:44.840 --> 16:48.440]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to start up the American people and
[16:48.440 --> 16:52.120]  divide us and they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy to try to
[16:52.120 --> 16:53.440]  control us.
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.480]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming
[16:57.480 --> 16:58.480]  next.
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.120]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when
[17:03.120 --> 17:04.120]  it comes to the show?
[17:04.120 --> 17:08.680]  And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what
[17:08.680 --> 17:13.600]  the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis
[17:13.600 --> 17:18.160]  that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and
[17:18.160 --> 17:21.280]  then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.400]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[17:26.400 --> 17:31.080]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.960]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus
[17:35.960 --> 17:36.960]  on that issue.
[17:36.960 --> 17:37.960]  We did.
[17:37.960 --> 17:41.240]  And you focused on it by supporting us and info wars.
[17:41.240 --> 17:45.360]  So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[17:45.360 --> 17:49.280]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[17:49.280 --> 17:51.320]  literally helped make up the world.
[17:51.320 --> 17:52.320]  What's really happening?
[17:52.320 --> 17:53.840]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[17:53.840 --> 17:55.840]  I want to thank you for your support.
[17:55.840 --> 18:04.200]  Big tech is in league with the globalist and the chai comms as attempting an information
[18:04.200 --> 18:06.200]  to against America.
[18:06.200 --> 18:13.200]  And when we take this country back, they must be held accountable as S&R is offered.
[18:13.200 --> 18:14.200]  The games are over.
[18:14.200 --> 18:15.200]  The waiting is over.
[18:15.200 --> 18:17.320]  The fight is now out in the open.
[18:17.320 --> 18:21.840]  World government is here in the latter part of 2020 is attempting to collapse the world
[18:21.840 --> 18:27.320]  economy, set up the global digital currency and AI surveillance system and info wars is
[18:27.320 --> 18:29.640]  on the front lines, fighting harder than ever.

[18:51.880 --> 18:59.320]  reappoints and free shipping with the stop to steal special at info wars store.com.
[18:59.320 --> 19:03.120]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group Bank
[19:03.120 --> 19:05.840]  of America, JPMorgan Chase Coleman tax.
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.160]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds
[19:10.160 --> 19:12.320]  of millions to start the death incredible.
[19:12.320 --> 19:17.440]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the
[19:17.440 --> 19:21.920]  chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[19:21.920 --> 19:22.920]  That is a fact.
[19:22.920 --> 19:28.520]  And all the hero sheep where the mask to go along with this are signing on to mass murder
[19:28.520 --> 19:30.240]  bigger than what Hitler did.
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.720]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[19:33.720 --> 19:39.640]  This is a medical world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world
[19:39.640 --> 19:42.560]  IDs and coming with forced inoculations.
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.720]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[19:47.720 --> 19:49.560]  That's stories on info wars.com.
[19:49.560 --> 19:53.600]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this
[19:53.600 --> 20:20.000]  or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary great reset.
[20:20.000 --> 20:28.320]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:28.320 --> 20:34.040]  So according to law, according to history, according to common practice, Trump is well
[20:34.040 --> 20:35.040]  within his rights.
[20:35.040 --> 20:37.840]  In fact, it's his duty, the challenge of fraudulent election.
[20:37.840 --> 20:45.400]  It's we the people they're attempting to steal our sacred right and birthright of determining
[20:45.400 --> 20:47.240]  our own leaders from.
[20:47.240 --> 20:50.120]  Over this four years ago, I keep showing this every day on the show.
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.640]  It hangs on the wall outside my office.
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.360]  Madam President Newsweek reportedly printed a quarter million of these and said she was
[20:57.360 --> 20:58.360]  the president.
[20:58.360 --> 21:02.840]  Well, this year, they just said, how about we just have all the control corporate media
[21:02.840 --> 21:08.480]  and have all these world leaders and all these people sit there and congratulate him as the
[21:08.480 --> 21:09.980]  winner.
[21:09.980 --> 21:13.200]  Even though that's not a law works, you know, Hillary said we're going to contest.
[21:13.200 --> 21:18.400]  It's our right to contest, which it was, and then just gaslight everybody and say that
[21:18.400 --> 21:24.000]  that's the case.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.520]  Hell by this yardstick, they might as well just say that Hillary really won the election
[21:28.520 --> 21:29.520]  in 2020.
[21:29.520 --> 21:37.440]  And of course, if she's able to steal it, make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.600]  were picked because they want one thing, status and money.
[21:40.600 --> 21:43.200]  They don't want to run nothing.
[21:43.200 --> 21:49.600]  Joe Biden and Kamala are known as put me on private jets, give me money, give me palaces,
[21:49.600 --> 21:57.720]  give me caviar, give me sex, give me drugs, and I don't want anything else.
[21:57.720 --> 22:01.400]  The bottom of the barrel.
[22:01.400 --> 22:03.880]  That's all this is.
[22:03.880 --> 22:12.160]  And so it is a 100% fraud complete when they tell you that Trump's a dictator and it's unprecedented
[22:12.160 --> 22:13.160]  what he's doing.
[22:13.160 --> 22:14.800]  All of it's a lie on its face.
[22:14.800 --> 22:20.040]  I'm not going to repeat all the evidence Al Gore 37 days, Supreme Court ruled against
[22:20.040 --> 22:21.040]  him.
[22:21.040 --> 22:22.040]  That's what Trump said.
[22:22.040 --> 22:25.200]  He said months ago, he said bad stuff in Pennsylvania, bad stuff in Georgia, hell they
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.440]  had PBS documentaries a month before the election saying it's totally fraudulent with
[22:29.440 --> 22:33.880]  decertified machines and all these states, oh, but the news is like there's no evidence
[22:33.880 --> 22:37.680]  to minion software and smartmatic or bad.
[22:37.680 --> 22:41.760]  They've just been kicked out of all these other countries and all these other states
[22:41.760 --> 22:43.840]  because they've been caught in election fraud.
[22:43.840 --> 22:50.040]  It's like, oh, Jeffrey Dahmer is on death row for eating, eating people like, oh, that's
[22:50.040 --> 22:52.400]  you're going to claim Jeffrey Dahmer, eight people.
[22:52.400 --> 22:58.640]  I mean, that should have claimed that, you know, if you live in Florida by a pond, watch
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.680]  out, alligators don't eat your dog.
[23:00.680 --> 23:05.880]  You know, it's just what these criminals do and then they sit there and gaslight us after
[23:05.880 --> 23:12.680]  Russia gate and the fake impeachment and all of it and they just decided no Trump.
[23:12.680 --> 23:17.360]  You know, they say that, yeah, more than double the number of blacks voted for Trump and voted
[23:17.360 --> 23:23.760]  last time and more than double Hispanics, yeah, he got, but you know, and women voted for
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.800]  Trump more than last time, but oh, it was white men didn't vote for Trump.
[23:28.800 --> 23:34.640]  Oh, old dead white men, you mean, I mean, it's ridiculous, but they just go, no evidence
[23:34.640 --> 23:40.840]  of fraud, no evidence of fraud, no evidence of fraud, president elect, we say so.
[23:40.840 --> 23:45.360]  And the media just declares him the winner when that's not how this works.
[23:45.360 --> 23:46.760]  Wow.
[23:46.760 --> 23:50.680]  Just like the COVID fraud is used to shut the economy down and blame Trump for COVID.
[23:50.680 --> 23:54.880]  It's already plagued you, the FEC chairman coming out and saying there's massive evidence
[23:54.880 --> 23:55.880]  of election fraud.
[23:55.880 --> 24:02.600]  Here's Senator Kramer, Kevin Kramer talking about the reality that of course Trump has
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.600]  the right to do this.
[24:03.600 --> 24:04.600]  Here it is.
[24:04.600 --> 24:08.280]  But I'm going to use Senator Pat Toomey, your Republican colleague from Pennsylvania.
[24:08.280 --> 24:13.480]  Here's what he said last night after the decision came down to essentially throw out the president's
[24:13.480 --> 24:15.000]  lawsuit in Pennsylvania.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.480]  With today's decision by Judge Matthew Bran, a longtime conservative Republican whom I know
[24:19.480 --> 24:23.920]  to be a fair and unbiased jurist, to dismiss the Trump campaign's lawsuit, President Trump
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.560]  has exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result of the presidential
[24:28.560 --> 24:29.760]  race in Pennsylvania.
[24:29.760 --> 24:33.720]  I congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their
[24:33.720 --> 24:34.720]  victory.
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.360]  Do you concur with Senator Toomey that it is now over?
[24:38.360 --> 24:42.360]  Chuck, first of all, again, thanks for the opportunity to be with you.
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.240]  And no, I do not, although I think it's very likely.
[24:46.240 --> 24:51.840]  That said, I think we, again, I don't know why we're so easily offended by a president
[24:51.840 --> 24:57.400]  that's carrying out all of his legal options in court, not enhancing, you know, encouraging
[24:57.400 --> 25:03.680]  any riots or burnings of buildings or beating up of Democrats coming out of Democratic meetings
[25:03.680 --> 25:05.240]  or events.
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.040]  It's just a simple legal process.
[25:07.040 --> 25:13.000]  And really, there have not been a lot of evidentiary hearings that have involved the Trump case.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.840]  There have been other hearings, and I noticed that you used a number that was rather large
[25:17.840 --> 25:21.360]  of cases that have been thrown out or dismissed.
[25:21.360 --> 25:25.640]  But when it comes down to actually looking at evidence, there have not been many if-
[25:25.640 --> 25:28.760]  Okay, the full nine-minute clip is at infowars.com.
[25:28.760 --> 25:29.760]  I suggest you go watch it.
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.840]  Now, you heard him saying, yeah, it looks like it's unlikely.
[25:32.840 --> 25:33.840]  Trouble win.
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.960]  Only because we're being conned, just like they said Iraq had WMDs and they didn't.
[25:39.960 --> 25:42.960]  We're being gaslit.
[25:42.960 --> 25:45.320]  We're being lied to.
[25:45.320 --> 25:51.560]  That was an Obama judge that we knew was going to throw it out without even looking at the
[25:51.560 --> 25:53.640]  evidence in Pennsylvania.
[25:53.640 --> 25:56.680]  And that's what Trump's lawyers said.
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.120]  It's what I said is it's going to the Supreme Court.
[26:00.120 --> 26:04.400]  What did Trump say four months ago with the vote in ballot and the $80 million, he said
[26:04.400 --> 26:05.400]  this is illegal.
[26:05.400 --> 26:06.400]  They're going to stuff it.
[26:06.400 --> 26:07.520]  He said go to the Supreme Court.
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.720]  He's known this the whole time.
[26:09.720 --> 26:12.600]  So have we, how did we say 79 days of hell?
[26:12.600 --> 26:14.280]  How'd we say this was coming up?
[26:14.280 --> 26:18.720]  Because it was all there, but the general public are spectators.
[26:18.720 --> 26:20.520]  They just watch things minute to minute.
[26:20.520 --> 26:23.040]  Don't remember the last thing that happened.
[26:23.040 --> 26:30.720]  And real consciousness is remembering things, is having a continuity and understanding.
[26:30.720 --> 26:33.720]  So here's what I want to go over.
[26:33.720 --> 26:39.720]  I'm going to go to clip five, Roger Stone, Bill Gates, Microsoft, designed election fraud
[26:39.720 --> 26:40.720]  software used.
[26:40.720 --> 26:45.960]  Yeah, we keep talking about Dominion or Smartmatic and they're bad and they've been decertified
[26:45.960 --> 26:47.960]  most places.
[26:47.960 --> 26:54.960]  But a lot of the other companies are using Gates software that all over the world's been
[26:54.960 --> 26:56.560]  flagged and caught for fraud.
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.560]  I mean, Gates is involved in News Guard telling you what news you can read.
[27:00.560 --> 27:01.560]  He's trying to be your doctor.
[27:01.560 --> 27:04.160]  He's trying to tell you how to take these vaccines.
[27:04.160 --> 27:06.520]  He's involved in everything.
[27:06.520 --> 27:10.800]  And now they've announced, Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, that Bill Gates will
[27:10.800 --> 27:18.080]  tell him what to do and be his chief advisor when the UK takes over the rotating post of
[27:18.080 --> 27:20.960]  the G7, incredibly important.
[27:20.960 --> 27:23.960]  So we talk about Bill Gates as your doctor, Bill Gates as your president.
[27:23.960 --> 27:29.120]  Hell, now Bill Gates will be the most powerful G7 president.
[27:29.120 --> 27:30.120]  That's globalism.
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.160]  I mean, Bill Gates is a new world order operative.
[27:33.160 --> 27:34.960]  He's making his move.
[27:34.960 --> 27:36.400]  He's the commander.
[27:36.400 --> 27:37.400]  He's the Darth Vader.
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.160]  I keep telling you that.
[27:40.160 --> 27:41.880]  Here's Roger Stone talking about it.
[27:41.880 --> 27:43.280]  Roger Stone.
[27:43.280 --> 27:49.000]  All the controversy regarding Dominion voting systems is but the tip of the iceberg.
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.640]  Here's the real villain.
[27:50.640 --> 27:53.720]  It's none other than Bill Gates and Microsoft.
[27:53.720 --> 27:59.080]  You see, Microsoft designed a software called Election Guard that's being used by Dominion
[27:59.080 --> 28:07.000]  as well as election services, heart inter-civic, clean ballot, election systems and hardware,
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.480]  B-Pro and Spartmatic.
[28:08.480 --> 28:15.320]  In other words, 100% of the voting machines and voting systems in this country are using
[28:15.320 --> 28:21.080]  the same software that Dominion has been caught using to switch votes.
[28:21.080 --> 28:27.440]  The denial by the mainstream media that there's any evidence whatsoever is ludicrous.
[28:27.440 --> 28:30.760]  The evidence is overwhelming and compelling.
[28:30.760 --> 28:35.720]  Whether Sidney Powell, a fine attorney who isn't given to making claims she can't back
[28:35.720 --> 28:41.600]  up in court, can bring a case without the cooperation of the Central Intelligence Agency
[28:41.600 --> 28:45.560]  and the FBI to come claim remains to be seen.
[28:45.560 --> 28:48.440]  All right, folks, that's the Stone Cold Truth.
[28:48.440 --> 28:54.720]  We'll be right back with more election fraud, what they're going to pull next, how to stop
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.560]  them, then I'm going to shift gears into their larger plan.
[28:58.560 --> 29:02.760]  Remember Hillary Clinton, remember Pelosi, remember Bill Clinton, remember Obama?
[29:02.760 --> 29:07.560]  All of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[29:07.560 --> 29:10.000]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in the landslides as they have
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.480]  the internal polls.
[29:11.480 --> 29:16.160]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[29:16.160 --> 29:22.720]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night
[29:22.720 --> 29:25.440]  and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[29:25.440 --> 29:26.440]  This is completely transparent.
[29:26.440 --> 29:29.480]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[29:29.480 --> 29:32.760]  Trump has not conceded, none of the states have certified the vote, and now all these
[29:32.760 --> 29:38.160]  investigations have been opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come
[29:38.160 --> 29:40.240]  out and already been documented.
[29:40.240 --> 29:44.080]  And in Georgia, officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[29:44.080 --> 29:46.360]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[29:46.360 --> 29:50.320]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[29:50.320 --> 29:53.920]  Now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end of
[29:53.920 --> 29:54.920]  America as we know it.
[29:54.920 --> 29:59.320]  We will be Venezuela in full wars.com.
[29:59.320 --> 30:04.280]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the comics
[30:04.280 --> 30:06.680]  Chinese and the United Nations.
[30:06.680 --> 30:12.080]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[30:12.080 --> 30:16.160]  of complete lockdown so you can't even leave your house for months and months are being
[30:16.160 --> 30:21.480]  announced, and in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons
[30:21.480 --> 30:26.080]  to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put
[30:26.080 --> 30:27.080]  them under her control.
[30:27.080 --> 30:31.760]  That's right, she's been ringing elections for years and years, and the same thing is
[30:31.760 --> 30:33.760]  coming here to the United States.
[30:33.760 --> 30:35.240]  This is world government.
[30:35.240 --> 30:40.000]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.040]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[30:42.040 --> 30:46.440]  This is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due
[30:46.440 --> 30:52.040]  process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[30:52.040 --> 30:57.440]  How long have we warned you about this, but you can fight back America is the last bastion.
[30:57.440 --> 31:10.680]  Stop submitting.
[31:10.680 --> 31:15.160]  Now it's easier than ever to have ban.video on your iPhone.
[31:15.160 --> 31:18.520]  Simply go to ban.video with your Safari browser.
[31:18.520 --> 31:21.760]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[31:21.760 --> 31:25.240]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[31:25.240 --> 31:27.360]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[31:27.360 --> 31:29.620]  I suggest ban.video.
[31:29.620 --> 31:34.200]  You will now have ban.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[31:34.200 --> 31:35.200]  to stop it.
[31:35.200 --> 31:39.320]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[31:39.320 --> 31:43.560]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[31:43.560 --> 31:47.680]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.

[32:35.600 --> 32:36.760]  for God's blessing.
[32:36.760 --> 32:39.160]  But I'm asking all listeners to understand
[32:39.160 --> 32:42.160]  that InfoWars is spending more money than we've ever spent
[32:42.160 --> 32:44.720]  in the fight to expose and stall an election
[32:44.720 --> 32:48.400]  until the 21, the great reset, and the global estate cover.
[32:48.400 --> 32:50.800]  So please visit infowarsstore.com today.

[32:52.320 --> 32:53.320]  that I've extended through the weekend,
[32:53.320 --> 32:55.080]  but then it will end because so many products
[32:55.080 --> 32:56.080]  are about to sell out.

[32:59.480 --> 33:05.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:15.480 --> 33:17.480]  Welcome back. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[33:17.480 --> 33:23.480]  Coming up when we kick off hour number two,
[33:23.480 --> 33:26.480]  the answer to their tyranny is 1776.
[33:26.480 --> 33:30.480]  And that means resisting and not complying.
[33:30.480 --> 33:32.480]  They tell us leave the borders wide open,
[33:32.480 --> 33:34.480]  let child smugglers bring kids across.
[33:34.480 --> 33:36.480]  They tell us let pedophilia be promoted on Netflix,
[33:36.480 --> 33:38.480]  but you can't open your gym up.
[33:38.480 --> 33:40.480]  You can't open your church up.
[33:40.480 --> 33:44.480]  Eight months into this COVID fraud, this COVID deception.
[33:44.480 --> 33:47.480]  Next hour, I've got the videos of the uprising
[33:47.480 --> 33:50.480]  in Europe, in Germany, in England,
[33:50.480 --> 33:52.480]  and in California and New York.
[33:52.480 --> 33:56.480]  Californians revolt, anti-lockdown protests, storm the streets,
[33:56.480 --> 34:00.480]  gather outside, get out of NUSM's home in defiance of curfew
[34:00.480 --> 34:04.480]  after NUSM got caught at huge parties not wearing masks,
[34:04.480 --> 34:07.480]  Chicago mayor, Lightfoot, all of them.
[34:07.480 --> 34:10.480]  Of course it's a fraud. They're criminals.
[34:11.480 --> 34:14.480]  I had a major whistleblower contact us a few days ago.
[34:14.480 --> 34:15.480]  We've confirmed that.
[34:15.480 --> 34:19.480]  I'm not going to say what area they're in,
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.480]  but it's high-level governmental real COVID tracking
[34:24.480 --> 34:29.480]  by hospital groups, and COVID has less than one-tenth
[34:29.480 --> 34:34.480]  of 1% morbidity rate, and they know it's a fraud
[34:34.480 --> 34:37.480]  and they know it's a scam, and they're told to put
[34:37.480 --> 34:39.480]  everybody that dies of something else in the list.
[34:39.480 --> 34:42.480]  It is just incredible to go out in public
[34:42.480 --> 34:44.480]  with little children wearing these masks
[34:44.480 --> 34:45.480]  and going through the rest of it.
[34:45.480 --> 34:50.480]  So I'm going to be covering that next hour
[34:50.480 --> 34:55.480]  on this live Sunday show that's not supposed to exist,
[34:55.480 --> 34:56.480]  that's not supposed to be happening,
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.480]  that's not supposed to be heard.
[34:59.480 --> 35:02.480]  Bill Gates just thinks he'll put out polio vaccines
[35:02.480 --> 35:05.480]  that have live polio in it and kill a bunch of people.
[35:05.480 --> 35:07.480]  It'll be the number one cause of polio,
[35:07.480 --> 35:09.480]  and then we won't actually cover the Indian
[35:09.480 --> 35:11.480]  and the African newspapers,
[35:11.480 --> 35:17.480]  and then his admission to the AP.
[35:17.480 --> 35:19.480]  They think they're going to cover up
[35:19.480 --> 35:22.480]  all the government reports of cancer viruses
[35:22.480 --> 35:24.480]  being added to vaccines to give you cancer.
[35:24.480 --> 35:26.480]  They think everybody's for sale
[35:26.480 --> 35:28.480]  and that everybody will sell out.
[35:28.480 --> 35:30.480]  Think again, this is where it ends.
[35:30.480 --> 35:33.480]  I don't sell out, I don't back down,
[35:33.480 --> 35:35.480]  because I am not in league with Satan
[35:35.480 --> 35:37.480]  and I will not burn in hell with you.
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.480]  You understand that?
[35:41.480 --> 35:43.480]  And that's why this is so serious.
[35:43.480 --> 35:45.480]  This is not a game, people.
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.480]  You're going to see world government,
[35:46.480 --> 35:47.480]  you're going to see the Antichrist,
[35:47.480 --> 35:50.480]  you're going to see a large portion of the world slaughtered.
[35:50.480 --> 35:53.480]  Pull up Revelation, guys, if you can.
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.480]  Revelation verse about the pale horse
[35:56.480 --> 35:58.480]  and he who arrives upon his death
[35:58.480 --> 35:59.480]  and hell follows with him.
[35:59.480 --> 36:02.480]  Pull that up on screen, please, if you can.
[36:02.480 --> 36:05.480]  You will see world government.
[36:05.480 --> 36:08.480]  You will see it all.
[36:08.480 --> 36:10.480]  You're going to be at a point where half the children,
[36:10.480 --> 36:14.480]  you know, by age five are dying with brain tumors.
[36:14.480 --> 36:17.480]  You're going to witness total extermination
[36:17.480 --> 36:20.480]  and you will finally meet God in your mind
[36:20.480 --> 36:23.480]  or you will get on your knees to Satan,
[36:23.480 --> 36:26.480]  but you will go through the fire.
[36:26.480 --> 36:28.480]  No one will escape.
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.480]  Not me, not you, not anybody.
[36:32.480 --> 36:35.480]  Because God is justice.
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.480]  So,
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.480]  Klaus Schwab
[36:44.480 --> 36:46.480]  and Bill Gates
[36:46.480 --> 36:49.480]  and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
[36:49.480 --> 36:52.480]  have made their beds
[36:52.480 --> 36:59.480]  and they are going to have to sleep in them.
[36:59.480 --> 37:02.480]  Let me show you a few headlines, though, in the next segment.
[37:02.480 --> 37:04.480]  Paul Watson's done a really great job
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.480]  of an air something he just put out a few hours ago.
[37:09.480 --> 37:11.480]  There it is.
[37:11.480 --> 37:14.480]  And I looked and behold a pale horse
[37:14.480 --> 37:16.480]  and its rider's name was Death
[37:16.480 --> 37:18.480]  and Hades followed him
[37:18.480 --> 37:21.480]  and they were given authority over one fourth of the earth
[37:21.480 --> 37:24.480]  to kill with a sword and with famine and with pestilence
[37:24.480 --> 37:27.480]  and by the wild beasts of the earth.
[37:27.480 --> 37:29.480]  And I looked
[37:31.480 --> 37:33.480]  and let's read the King James Version
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.480]  and I looked and behold a pale horse
[37:37.480 --> 37:40.480]  and his name that sat upon him was Death
[37:40.480 --> 37:42.480]  and Hades followed with it
[37:42.480 --> 37:45.480]  and power was given unto them
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.480]  over the fourth part of the earth
[37:48.480 --> 37:52.480]  to kill with a sword, with hunger and with death
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.480]  and with the beast of the earth.
[37:57.480 --> 38:00.480]  Revelation, the NASB.
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.480]  I looked and behold an ashen horse
[38:04.480 --> 38:07.480]  and he who sat upon its name was Death
[38:07.480 --> 38:10.480]  and Hades was following with him.
[38:10.480 --> 38:13.480]  Authority was given to them over fourth part of the earth
[38:13.480 --> 38:16.480]  to kill with a sword, with famine and pestilence
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.480]  and with the wild beasts of the earth.
[38:22.480 --> 38:24.480]  Let me tell you who rides that horse
[38:24.480 --> 38:27.480]  who is the spiritual vessel
[38:27.480 --> 38:30.480]  of the Antichrist before the Antichrist comes
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.480]  is Bill Gates.
[38:32.480 --> 38:35.480]  The man who sits on the white horse of Death is Bill Gates.
[38:35.480 --> 38:37.480]  I've told you that for 20 years
[38:37.480 --> 38:39.480]  and now you see it.
[38:39.480 --> 38:41.480]  He is your world ruler.
[38:41.480 --> 38:43.480]  He is the head of the G7.
[38:43.480 --> 38:46.480]  He is the last gate
[38:46.480 --> 38:51.480]  and he will be the executor of you and your family.
[38:51.480 --> 38:54.480]  He will kill you and your family when he's done
[38:54.480 --> 38:57.480]  and you will die.
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.480]  But he can't get your soul.
[39:01.480 --> 39:04.480]  There's the wild horse right there.
[39:04.480 --> 39:07.480]  Total commitment.
[39:07.480 --> 39:09.480]  Absolute satanic will.
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.480]  Total demonic possession.
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.480]  Look upon it.
[39:18.480 --> 39:23.480]  He's coming for you and your family.
[39:23.480 --> 39:27.480]  He sits upon the white horse.
[39:27.480 --> 39:29.480]  Death.
[39:29.480 --> 39:32.480]  And his name was Death.
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.480]  And power was given to him
[39:36.480 --> 39:44.480]  to kill at least one fourth of the planet.
[39:44.480 --> 39:51.480]  And his main target is Africa.
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.480]  God help us truly.
[39:55.480 --> 39:57.480]  God help us.
[39:57.480 --> 39:59.480]  People ask me, are you scared of Bill Gates?
[39:59.480 --> 40:01.480]  No.
[40:01.480 --> 40:03.480]  No, no, no, no.
[40:03.480 --> 40:06.480]  I feel nothing from Bill Gates, but I see death.
[40:06.480 --> 40:10.480]  But I feel God's big powerful heart angry.
[40:10.480 --> 40:14.480]  And I just really feel sorry for that little demon that's Bill Gates
[40:14.480 --> 40:19.480]  because Bill Gates will be in prison with his own spirit
[40:19.480 --> 40:21.480]  for eternity alone.
[40:21.480 --> 40:24.480]  And that is a fate worse than death.
[40:24.480 --> 40:27.480]  I'm going to go to break.
[40:27.480 --> 40:29.480]  And I'm going to come back
[40:29.480 --> 40:31.480]  and I'm going to hit some really important news.
[40:31.480 --> 40:33.480]  The enemy.
[40:33.480 --> 40:35.480]  We don't have Bill Gates financing us.
[40:35.480 --> 40:37.480]  We don't have Ted Turner financing us.
[40:37.480 --> 40:39.480]  Who also wants to kill you and your family.
[40:39.480 --> 40:41.480]  We don't have them financing us
[40:41.480 --> 40:43.480]  and putting up Georgia Guidestones for us.
[40:43.480 --> 40:45.480]  Saying people the stars and love God and love each other.
[40:45.480 --> 40:47.480]  That's what I would put on those Guidestones.
[40:47.480 --> 40:49.480]  We don't have that.
[40:49.480 --> 40:51.480]  We have you.
[40:51.480 --> 40:53.480]  And we have products that are powerful and products that are amazing
[40:53.480 --> 40:55.480]  and products that are game changing.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.480]  And we have a big sale that hasn't ended yet
[40:57.480 --> 40:59.480]  because I've been out of town and busy and fighting 24-7.
[40:59.480 --> 41:01.480]  And it is the Stop the Steel mega sale
[41:01.480 --> 41:03.480]  that a bunch of the products are about to sell out.
[41:03.480 --> 41:05.480]  So I must end it.
[41:05.480 --> 41:07.480]  I got to come in tomorrow morning early
[41:07.480 --> 41:09.480]  and try to come up with a new sale.

[41:25.480 --> 41:27.480]  your stamina, your energy.

[41:39.480 --> 41:41.480]  the amino acids.
[41:41.480 --> 41:43.480]  It's discounted. It's about to sell out.
[41:43.480 --> 41:45.480]  Fish oil, krill oil.
[41:45.480 --> 41:47.480]  I couldn't do any of this without the products.
[41:47.480 --> 41:49.480]  And I just thank God for them.
[41:49.480 --> 41:51.480]  And I thank God for you and your support.
[41:51.480 --> 41:53.480]  And I suggest you go to infowarstore.com
[41:53.480 --> 41:55.480]  while you still can.
[41:55.480 --> 41:57.480]  They do put that would-be dictator,
[41:57.480 --> 41:59.480]  that Chai-Com puppet in.
[41:59.480 --> 42:01.480]  He'll follow whatever orders they say
[42:01.480 --> 42:03.480]  and the word is, they're coming out for me directly.
[42:03.480 --> 42:05.480]  They've got the indictments and all of it ready.
[42:05.480 --> 42:07.480]  So,
[42:07.480 --> 42:09.480]  I would stop stealing your last chance
[42:09.480 --> 42:11.480]  this global crisis to get an info wars t-shirt,
[42:11.480 --> 42:13.480]  to get a water filter, to get an air filter,
[42:13.480 --> 42:15.480]  the storeable foods ready to ship within days.
[42:15.480 --> 42:17.480]  You know, everything we've got is in stock now.
[42:17.480 --> 42:19.480]  Supply chains are breaking down.
[42:19.480 --> 42:21.480]  Don't know about future orders in the future.
[42:21.480 --> 42:23.480]  But we're just going to keep committing
[42:23.480 --> 42:25.480]  to the world.
[42:25.480 --> 42:27.480]  With afterburners on, full blasts,
[42:27.480 --> 42:29.480]  even though our tank is on E,
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.480]  and we're just not going to stop.
[42:31.480 --> 42:33.480]  And if the money doesn't come in, we'll just crash.
[42:33.480 --> 42:35.480]  Like the phoenix into the sand.
[42:35.480 --> 42:37.480]  Just fine with me.
[42:37.480 --> 42:39.480]  Because God's in control.
[42:39.480 --> 42:41.480]  And God is in control of me.
[42:41.480 --> 42:43.480]  I'm a rotting stinking vessel.
[42:43.480 --> 42:45.480]  Like a rags.
[42:45.480 --> 42:47.480]  But God can take rags and tie them around a post
[42:47.480 --> 42:49.480]  and light a big torch that can burn down the new world order.
[42:49.480 --> 42:51.480]  And I'm on fire.
[42:51.480 --> 42:53.480]  I'm coming down fast.
[42:53.480 --> 43:22.480]  And God is in control of me.
[43:22.480 --> 43:24.480]  And we have a digital currency and AI surveillance system.
[43:24.480 --> 43:26.480]  And Imple Wars is on the front lines
[43:26.480 --> 43:28.480]  fighting harder than ever.
[43:28.480 --> 43:30.480]  And we pledge to you to never back down
[43:30.480 --> 43:32.480]  and never give up in the face of this evil.
[43:32.480 --> 43:34.480]  Because we know God is watching
[43:34.480 --> 43:36.480]  and God is in charge and God is on our side.
[43:36.480 --> 43:38.480]  Imple Wars can only stay in the fight
[43:38.480 --> 43:40.480]  and continue to be the tip of the spear
[43:40.480 --> 43:42.480]  if you financially support us
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.480]  by getting great products at the same time
[43:44.480 --> 43:46.480]  at ImpleWarsStore.com.
[43:46.480 --> 43:48.480]  And we have one of the biggest sales of the year
[43:48.480 --> 43:50.480]  about to end up a 60% off
[43:50.480 --> 43:52.480]  with a triple-patriot point in free shipping
[43:52.480 --> 43:54.480]  with the Stop the Shield Special
[43:54.480 --> 44:22.480]  at ImpleWars.com.
[44:22.480 --> 44:24.480]  Joe Biden is president-elect
[44:24.480 --> 44:26.480]  repeating it over and over
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.480]  like a brainwashing mantra
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.480]  when it's up again to the state government
[44:30.480 --> 44:32.480]  to certify those votes.
[44:32.480 --> 44:34.480]  And those votes for being challenged
[44:34.480 --> 44:36.480]  there's massive evidence of fraud.
[44:36.480 --> 44:38.480]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[44:38.480 --> 44:40.480]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front,
[44:40.480 --> 44:42.480]  that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote
[44:42.480 --> 44:44.480]  no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[44:44.480 --> 44:46.480]  Well, a lot of those haven't been counted
[44:46.480 --> 44:48.480]  and there's massive fraud being discovered.
[44:48.480 --> 44:50.480]  So we're going to hold the course here
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.480]  because he's a globalist, he wants carbon taxes,
[44:52.480 --> 44:54.480]  he will destroy this country by design
[44:54.480 --> 44:56.480]  to consolidate power and take control of us.
[44:56.480 --> 44:58.480]  This is war.
[44:58.480 --> 45:00.480]  Urgent warnings are being issued
[45:00.480 --> 45:02.480]  right now about the United Nations,
[45:02.480 --> 45:04.480]  the Davos Group Bank of America,
[45:04.480 --> 45:06.480]  JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sachs.
[45:06.480 --> 45:08.480]  They're saying that the COVID virus
[45:08.480 --> 45:10.480]  is going to cause a global depression
[45:10.480 --> 45:12.480]  and hundreds of millions of starved to death.
[45:12.480 --> 45:14.480]  Incredible. They're the very organizations
[45:14.480 --> 45:16.480]  that ordered the global lockdowns
[45:16.480 --> 45:18.480]  that are causing the chain reaction
[45:18.480 --> 45:20.480]  and causing the mass starvation,
[45:20.480 --> 45:22.480]  not the COVID virus.
[45:22.480 --> 45:24.480]  That is a fact.
[45:24.480 --> 45:26.480]  And all the hero's sheep
[45:26.480 --> 45:28.480]  that wear the mask and go along with this
[45:28.480 --> 45:30.480]  are signing on to mass murder
[45:30.480 --> 45:32.480]  bigger than what Hitler did.
[45:32.480 --> 45:34.480]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention
[45:34.480 --> 45:36.480]  and the Nuremberg Code.
[45:36.480 --> 45:38.480]  This is a medical, world government,
[45:38.480 --> 45:40.480]  tyrannical takeover, causing starvation,
[45:40.480 --> 45:42.480]  setting up world IDs,
[45:42.480 --> 45:44.480]  and coming with forced inoculations.
[45:44.480 --> 45:46.480]  And now Bank of America says global unrest
[45:46.480 --> 45:48.480]  and global depression.
[45:48.480 --> 45:50.480]  That story's on infowars.com.
[45:50.480 --> 45:52.480]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public
[45:52.480 --> 45:54.480]  and to say you're not stand for this
[45:54.480 --> 45:56.480]  or the mass global genocide being caused
[45:56.480 --> 45:58.480]  by the planetary great reset.
[45:58.480 --> 46:00.480]  It's all on record.
[46:00.480 --> 46:02.480]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton,
[46:02.480 --> 46:04.480]  Stanford,
[46:04.480 --> 46:06.480]  they were all hired a year ago
[46:06.480 --> 46:08.480]  and then again six months ago
[46:08.480 --> 46:10.480]  to war game how to get the public
[46:10.480 --> 46:12.480]  to stay locked down during a pandemic
[46:12.480 --> 46:14.480]  and how to get the public to take
[46:14.480 --> 46:16.480]  inoculations.
[46:16.480 --> 46:18.480]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[46:18.480 --> 46:20.480]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[46:20.480 --> 46:22.480]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[46:22.480 --> 46:24.480]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[46:24.480 --> 46:26.480]  And once they get you to lock down for 15 days,
[46:26.480 --> 46:28.480]  you notice now they say it's permanent.
[46:28.480 --> 46:30.480]  That's how it works.
[46:30.480 --> 46:32.480]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[46:32.480 --> 46:34.480]  The serial killer says the woman
[46:34.480 --> 46:36.480]  in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[46:36.480 --> 46:38.480]  No.
[46:38.480 --> 46:40.480]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on
[46:40.480 --> 46:42.480]  and we're in the serial killer's van.
[46:42.480 --> 46:44.480]  He's taking us to his
[46:44.480 --> 46:46.480]  shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[46:46.480 --> 46:48.480]  That's the allegory.
[46:48.480 --> 46:50.480]  We've got to bust out of this thing now.
[46:50.480 --> 46:52.480]  We've got to say no now.
[46:52.480 --> 46:54.480]  We've got to make a run for it now, but we still can't.
[46:54.480 --> 46:56.480]  Once he gets us in that basement,
[46:56.480 --> 46:58.480]  it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[46:58.480 --> 47:16.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.480 --> 47:32.480]  All right.
[47:32.480 --> 47:34.480]  Paul Joseph Watson has put out
[47:34.480 --> 47:36.480]  an extremely powerful report.
[47:36.480 --> 47:38.480]  It's posted a Bandai video.
[47:38.480 --> 47:40.480]  It's posted at infowars.com.
[47:40.480 --> 47:42.480]  It's a 13-minute report.
[47:42.480 --> 47:44.480]  One time to air the whole thing.
[47:44.480 --> 47:46.480]  I'm going to start the second hour.
[47:46.480 --> 47:48.480]  I'm going to lay out the great reset,
[47:48.480 --> 47:50.480]  build back better, the communist fascist.
[47:50.480 --> 47:52.480]  I'm going to explain how that works.
[47:52.480 --> 47:54.480]  Takeover that is here
[47:54.480 --> 47:56.480]  if you don't resist it and say no.
[47:56.480 --> 47:58.480]  But you've got a good chance to stop it,
[47:58.480 --> 48:00.480]  at least less than how bad it's going to be.
[48:00.480 --> 48:02.480]  How far will they push?
[48:02.480 --> 48:04.480]  However far you put up with.
[48:04.480 --> 48:06.480]  But here is part of Paul Joseph Watson
[48:06.480 --> 48:08.480]  breaking down the great reset
[48:08.480 --> 48:10.480]  and what it really means.
[48:10.480 --> 48:12.480]  Here it is.
[48:12.480 --> 48:14.480]  They think you're stupid.
[48:14.480 --> 48:16.480]  They think you're stupid.
[48:16.480 --> 48:18.480]  You know that great reset thing
[48:18.480 --> 48:20.480]  you keep hearing about?
[48:20.480 --> 48:22.480]  You know, that technocratic agenda
[48:22.480 --> 48:24.480]  to exploit COVID to centralize economic power
[48:24.480 --> 48:26.480]  and transform society into a social credit score
[48:26.480 --> 48:28.480]  hypersurveillance transhumanist dystopia.
[48:28.480 --> 48:30.480]  Yeah, that one. Well, it doesn't exist.
[48:30.480 --> 48:32.480]  The New York Times said so.
[48:32.480 --> 48:34.480]  I mean, the World Economic Forum
[48:34.480 --> 48:36.480]  literally celebrated the great reset
[48:36.480 --> 48:38.480]  on the same day the New York Times
[48:38.480 --> 48:40.480]  published this article.
[48:40.480 --> 48:42.480]  They've put it into an entire issue to it,
[48:42.480 --> 48:44.480]  but it still doesn't exist.
[48:44.480 --> 48:46.480]  Just like this video from two months ago
[48:46.480 --> 48:48.480]  of Justin Trudeau heralding the coronavirus pandemic
[48:48.480 --> 48:50.480]  as an opportunity for a reset.
[48:50.480 --> 48:52.480]  By the way, hit pause.
[48:52.480 --> 48:54.480]  Back to some 10 seconds.
[48:54.480 --> 48:56.480]  Let me explain why they do this.
[48:56.480 --> 48:58.480]  They put out to their people
[48:58.480 --> 49:00.480]  what they're going to do to us
[49:00.480 --> 49:02.480]  and then when we say we don't want it,
[49:02.480 --> 49:04.480]  they teach their people how to lie.
[49:04.480 --> 49:06.480]  Watch. We deny it.
[49:06.480 --> 49:08.480]  We're going to steal the election.
[49:08.480 --> 49:10.480]  We put out boxes.
[49:10.480 --> 49:12.480]  We put out 80 million.
[49:12.480 --> 49:14.480]  When they complain, we say it doesn't exist.
[49:14.480 --> 49:16.480]  Or we're going to say there's not two genders
[49:16.480 --> 49:18.480]  or we're going to cut little boys' testicles off.
[49:18.480 --> 49:20.480]  We're going to call sexual mutilization
[49:20.480 --> 49:22.480]  and sterilization trendy.
[49:22.480 --> 49:24.480]  We're going to call it trendy.
[49:24.480 --> 49:26.480]  They're teaching their people.
[49:26.480 --> 49:28.480]  That's what this is.
[49:28.480 --> 49:30.480]  The average leftist now is in on the fraud.
[49:30.480 --> 49:32.480]  Most of them I talk to know they're evil.
[49:32.480 --> 49:34.480]  They know it's all lie.
[49:34.480 --> 49:36.480]  They know it's a great reset.
[49:36.480 --> 49:38.480]  They believe they're going to get money
[49:38.480 --> 49:40.480]  and power out of it even though they aren't.
[49:40.480 --> 49:42.480]  They're useful idiots.
[49:42.480 --> 49:44.480]  Wow. Talk about scum.
[49:44.480 --> 49:46.480]  My uncle, great uncle.
[49:46.480 --> 49:48.480]  I say great uncle is my uncle, great man.
[49:48.480 --> 49:50.480]  He would always say you can't
[49:50.480 --> 49:52.480]  con an honest man.
[49:52.480 --> 49:54.480]  But people that are into evil are very easy to deceive.
[49:54.480 --> 49:56.480]  And so the most deceived
[49:56.480 --> 49:58.480]  are the people thinking
[49:58.480 --> 50:00.480]  they're part of the winning team
[50:00.480 --> 50:02.480]  winning all mother Jones
[50:02.480 --> 50:04.480]  and the New York Times
[50:04.480 --> 50:06.480]  and Washington Post.
[50:06.480 --> 50:08.480]  Oh, great reset.
[50:08.480 --> 50:10.480]  We're using COVID to bring in a utopia
[50:10.480 --> 50:12.480]  and end the family.
[50:12.480 --> 50:14.480]  And then we're like, hey, that's bad.
[50:14.480 --> 50:16.480]  Oh, it doesn't exist.
[50:16.480 --> 50:18.480]  And they think like engaging in that fraud
[50:18.480 --> 50:20.480]  makes them powerful
[50:20.480 --> 50:22.480]  when all they're doing is celebrating
[50:22.480 --> 50:24.480]  their own destruction. Let's continue.
[50:24.480 --> 50:26.480]  Two months ago of Justin Trudeau
[50:26.480 --> 50:28.480]  heralding the coronavirus pandemic
[50:28.480 --> 50:30.480]  as an opportunity for a reset
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.480]  doesn't exist.
[50:32.480 --> 50:34.480]  It's an opportunity for a reset.
[50:34.480 --> 50:36.480]  This is our chance to accelerate
[50:36.480 --> 50:38.480]  our pre-pandemic efforts
[50:38.480 --> 50:40.480]  to reimagine economic systems.
[50:40.480 --> 50:42.480]  He never said that it was all just one empty
[50:42.480 --> 50:44.480]  conspiracy theory.
[50:44.480 --> 50:46.480]  We're seeing a lot of people fall prey to disinformation
[50:46.480 --> 50:48.480]  and if conservative MPs
[50:48.480 --> 50:50.480]  and others want to start talking about
[50:50.480 --> 50:52.480]  conspiracy theories.
[50:52.480 --> 50:54.480]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity
[50:54.480 --> 50:56.480]  for a reset.
[50:56.480 --> 50:58.480]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.480]  for a reset.
[51:00.480 --> 51:02.480]  Conspiracy theories, reset.
[51:02.480 --> 51:04.480]  Conspiracy theories, reset.
[51:04.480 --> 51:06.480]  Conspiracy theories.
[51:06.480 --> 51:08.480]  I mean, Dr. Strangelove here
[51:08.480 --> 51:10.480]  literally endorses in his own book
[51:10.480 --> 51:12.480]  which is called COVID-19
[51:12.480 --> 51:14.480]  The Great Reset
[51:14.480 --> 51:16.480]  implantable brain chips that can read your thoughts.
[51:16.480 --> 51:18.480]  And the onset of Minority Report style
[51:18.480 --> 51:20.480]  pre-crime programs where you're deemed guilty
[51:20.480 --> 51:22.480]  before you've even committed a crime.
[51:22.480 --> 51:24.480]  He admits that COVID is not
[51:24.480 --> 51:26.480]  an existential threat but that it's an
[51:26.480 --> 51:28.480]  opportunity for technocrats
[51:28.480 --> 51:30.480]  to reorder society
[51:30.480 --> 51:32.480]  via a great reset.
[51:32.480 --> 51:34.480]  The World Economic Forum publishes regular
[51:34.480 --> 51:36.480]  promo videos hyping the great reset
[51:36.480 --> 51:38.480]  but it still doesn't exist.
[51:38.480 --> 51:40.480]  That is, if you're criticizing it.
[51:40.480 --> 51:42.480]  If you praise it then suddenly
[51:42.480 --> 51:44.480]  it does exist and it's a good thing
[51:44.480 --> 51:46.480]  because by redistributing
[51:46.480 --> 51:48.480]  wealth as part of the great reset
[51:48.480 --> 51:50.480]  our beneficent overlords
[51:50.480 --> 51:52.480]  are going to fix inequality
[51:52.480 --> 51:54.480]  and help the little guy.
[51:54.480 --> 51:56.480]  Can you pause again?
[51:56.480 --> 51:58.480]  5 seconds please.
[51:58.480 --> 52:00.480]  This is the IMF and World Bank proposing this
[52:00.480 --> 52:02.480]  that go in and engineer
[52:02.480 --> 52:04.480]  third world countries to be poor
[52:04.480 --> 52:06.480]  and not build infrastructure.
[52:06.480 --> 52:08.480]  These are the most ruthless scumbags in the world
[52:08.480 --> 52:10.480]  that created hundreds of trillions of dollars
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.480]  of fake debt that they've signed us on to
[52:12.480 --> 52:14.480]  and now they want to collapse us
[52:14.480 --> 52:16.480]  to end poverty.
[52:16.480 --> 52:18.480]  They all fly on their big private jets to Davos
[52:18.480 --> 52:20.480]  but say you shouldn't have a car
[52:20.480 --> 52:22.480]  or you shouldn't have it air conditioning.
[52:22.480 --> 52:24.480]  I mean, literally they're
[52:24.480 --> 52:26.480]  telling you how chic it is
[52:26.480 --> 52:28.480]  to be a slave
[52:28.480 --> 52:30.480]  and it's all a bunch of weird
[52:30.480 --> 52:32.480]  royalty out of Europe
[52:32.480 --> 52:34.480]  and Nazi heirs and stuff.
[52:34.480 --> 52:36.480]  I mean, these are the people that run Bill Gates folks.
[52:36.480 --> 52:38.480]  This is the real power
[52:38.480 --> 52:40.480]  and they're making their move right now.
[52:40.480 --> 53:06.480]  Let's continue.
[53:10.480 --> 53:12.480]  Wow, so helpful.
[53:12.480 --> 53:14.480]  Thanks to Lockdown, the CEOs of these companies
[53:14.480 --> 53:16.480]  have seen their personal wealth
[53:16.480 --> 53:18.480]  increase by tens of billions
[53:18.480 --> 53:20.480]  while small businesses have lost over
[53:20.480 --> 53:22.480]  200 billion.
[53:22.480 --> 53:24.480]  While cabbies in the UK are on starvation
[53:24.480 --> 53:26.480]  wages. But yeah, this great
[53:26.480 --> 53:28.480]  reset sounds like a workers paradise.
[53:28.480 --> 53:30.480]  Oh yeah, and you know all those rules they made?
[53:30.480 --> 53:32.480]  Lockdowns, face masks,
[53:32.480 --> 53:34.480]  social distancing.
[53:34.480 --> 53:36.480]  Well, apparently the technocrats who made them
[53:36.480 --> 53:38.480]  don't have to abide by them.
[53:38.480 --> 53:40.480]  They don't have to do as we say, not as we do.
[53:40.480 --> 53:42.480]  Some Karen will screech at you
[53:42.480 --> 53:44.480]  in the street for not covering up.
[53:44.480 --> 53:46.480]  But Diane Feinstein is apparently
[53:46.480 --> 53:48.480]  exempt, indoors.
[53:48.480 --> 53:50.480]  Intelligence agencies are using cell phone
[53:50.480 --> 53:52.480]  networks to spy on pleb lockdown
[53:52.480 --> 53:54.480]  compliance. You're being told to cancel
[53:54.480 --> 53:56.480]  Thanksgiving but Governor Gavin
[53:56.480 --> 53:58.480]  Newsom can dine with California
[53:58.480 --> 54:00.480]  Medical Association lobbyists
[54:00.480 --> 54:02.480]  inside
[54:02.480 --> 54:04.480]  a fancy $350 a meal
[54:04.480 --> 54:06.480]  French restaurant in violation
[54:06.480 --> 54:08.480]  of COVID-19 protocols he set
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.480]  for everyone else. And Laurie Lightfoot
[54:10.480 --> 54:12.480]  can attend a Providence.
[54:12.480 --> 54:14.480]  No mask, no social distancing,
[54:14.480 --> 54:16.480]  all crap, all dog training
[54:16.480 --> 54:18.480]  for you. They have a major whistleblower
[54:18.480 --> 54:20.480]  coming up tomorrow over
[54:20.480 --> 54:22.480]  major governmental systems.
[54:22.480 --> 54:24.480]  I'm going to leave it at that. Where they're like
[54:24.480 --> 54:26.480]  it's a total fraud. If flu
[54:26.480 --> 54:28.480]  is way worse.
[54:28.480 --> 54:30.480]  But again, people get habituated.
[54:30.480 --> 54:32.480]  They don't want to admit they've been conned
[54:32.480 --> 54:34.480]  so they get deeper into it. And the force
[54:34.480 --> 54:36.480]  inoculations are coming. We'll cover that
[54:36.480 --> 54:38.480]  next hour, but let's go ahead and go to this.
[54:38.480 --> 54:40.480]  Know the most about COVID.
[54:40.480 --> 54:42.480]  Aren't afraid of it at all.
[54:42.480 --> 54:44.480]  Interesting. Meanwhile, police in Australia
[54:44.480 --> 54:46.480]  are telling people they can't walk their
[54:46.480 --> 54:48.480]  dogs. They think
[54:48.480 --> 54:50.480]  you're stupid. Just enter it out and normal
[54:50.480 --> 54:52.480]  Christmas is out of the question.
[54:52.480 --> 54:54.480]  But wait, the technocrats say that if
[54:54.480 --> 54:56.480]  we behave ourselves, they'll let us out of
[54:56.480 --> 54:58.480]  lockdown for a whole five days
[54:58.480 --> 55:00.480]  over Christmas. Thank you
[55:00.480 --> 55:02.480]  globalists. How gracious of you.
[55:02.480 --> 55:04.480]  It's so
[55:04.480 --> 55:06.480]  grateful. We had locked down for other
[55:06.480 --> 55:08.480]  religions festivals. Yes, we did
[55:08.480 --> 55:10.480]  actually. But why should the Christians
[55:10.480 --> 55:12.480]  get easier? Seriously, why should we?
[55:12.480 --> 55:14.480]  Why should we be the ones that have to
[55:14.480 --> 55:16.480]  have our festival
[55:16.480 --> 55:18.480]  saved when we didn't do
[55:18.480 --> 55:20.480]  that for other religious festivals?
[55:20.480 --> 55:22.480]  Pause again. Back it up five seconds.
[55:22.480 --> 55:24.480]  The Muslims have not been banned in
[55:24.480 --> 55:26.480]  any other demonstrations. The other mosque
[55:26.480 --> 55:28.480]  has been shut. It's been churches. Christians
[55:28.480 --> 55:30.480]  are being targeted. Even the UN
[55:30.480 --> 55:32.480]  has doubled the persecution of Christians
[55:32.480 --> 55:34.480]  that we just saw 10 years ago. This is
[55:34.480 --> 55:36.480]  outrageous. Piers Morgan is a
[55:36.480 --> 55:38.480]  disgusting piece of crap.
[55:38.480 --> 55:40.480]  Back to Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[55:40.480 --> 55:42.480]  They think you're stupid. Why should the Christians
[55:42.480 --> 55:44.480]  get easier? Seriously, why should we?
[55:44.480 --> 55:46.480]  Why should we be the ones
[55:46.480 --> 55:48.480]  that have to have our festival
[55:48.480 --> 55:50.480]  saved when we
[55:50.480 --> 55:52.480]  didn't do that for other religious festivals
[55:52.480 --> 55:54.480]  in the last few weeks? Because we're a Christian
[55:54.480 --> 55:56.480]  country, you utter spoon.
[55:56.480 --> 55:58.480]  COVID-19 doesn't give a flying fuck
[55:58.480 --> 56:00.480]  about Christmas. If you have to make compromises
[56:00.480 --> 56:02.480]  this year, so be it. Oh, you mean
[56:02.480 --> 56:04.480]  like you didn't give a fuck about your son
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.480]  attending a super spread of black lives
[56:06.480 --> 56:08.480]  matter protest? You said
[56:08.480 --> 56:10.480]  you were proud of him. So if we go
[56:10.480 --> 56:12.480]  around to Granny's on Christmas Day, eat
[56:12.480 --> 56:14.480]  the turkey, trash her house
[56:14.480 --> 56:16.480]  and then set fire to it, that'll
[56:16.480 --> 56:18.480]  make it okay, right? Matt Hancock
[56:18.480 --> 56:20.480]  says hugging will be banned this
[56:20.480 --> 56:22.480]  Christmas. Fuck off!
[56:22.480 --> 56:24.480]  Alright, let's stop there.
[56:24.480 --> 56:26.480]  I forgot to tell the guys to bleep
[56:26.480 --> 56:28.480]  Paul Joseph Watson's reports and we were
[56:28.480 --> 56:30.480]  having to delay that, so I don't want to get any
[56:30.480 --> 56:32.480]  stations hearing cuss words. CNN's allowed
[56:32.480 --> 56:34.480]  to say the F word. Everybody else's, but we
[56:34.480 --> 56:36.480]  can't. Which is what this is all about.
[56:36.480 --> 56:38.480]  The royal family doesn't wear
[56:38.480 --> 56:40.480]  masks. They've got giant palaces.
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.480]  The Islamists don't wear masks unless you're a woman.
[56:42.480 --> 56:44.480]  All the leftists don't wear
[56:44.480 --> 56:46.480]  masks, but you're supposed to and your church
[56:46.480 --> 56:48.480]  is going to stay closed. This is
[56:48.480 --> 56:50.480]  totally and completely sick. The full report
[56:50.480 --> 56:52.480]  is at band.videoandinfullwars.com.
[56:52.480 --> 56:54.480]  I sincerely hope
[56:54.480 --> 56:56.480]  you share it and spread it
[56:56.480 --> 56:58.480]  because the real disease they're scared of
[56:58.480 --> 57:00.480]  is freedom.
[57:00.480 --> 57:02.480]  Band.video
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.480]  Band.video, find the full
[57:04.480 --> 57:06.480]  Paul Joseph Watson report and the big
[57:06.480 --> 57:08.480]  massive bombshell Supreme Court
[57:08.480 --> 57:10.480]  preparing to certify Trump's reelection
[57:10.480 --> 57:12.480]  if he properly gets the cases with
[57:12.480 --> 57:14.480]  the five states up to them. It's
[57:14.480 --> 57:16.480]  still a very circuitous, dangerous
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.480]  road and people are going to go crazy
[57:18.480 --> 57:20.480]  when he ends up winning and
[57:20.480 --> 57:22.480]  Biden proved to be a fraud that Trump has
[57:22.480 --> 57:24.480]  a real path to victory. That's why he's
[57:24.480 --> 57:26.480]  doing this. That's why they're trying to discredit it
[57:26.480 --> 57:28.480]  and why they're so scared. Hour
[57:28.480 --> 57:30.480]  number two.
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.480]  Coming up, if you want to defeat the globalist
[57:32.480 --> 57:34.480]  you want to stand against them.
[57:34.480 --> 57:36.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, tell folks on your
[57:36.480 --> 57:38.480]  email, on your text message, on word
[57:38.480 --> 57:40.480]  of mouth now about that local radio station
[57:40.480 --> 57:42.480]  or how you're listening at band.video
[57:42.480 --> 57:44.480]  or infowars.com.
[57:44.480 --> 57:54.480]  We're live next hour coming up.
[58:14.480 --> 58:16.480]  To prove your servitude, contact
[58:16.480 --> 58:18.480]  tracing, forced inoculations
[58:18.480 --> 58:20.480]  coming, but most importantly a
[58:20.480 --> 58:22.480]  new lockdown.
[58:22.480 --> 58:24.480]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame
[58:24.480 --> 58:26.480]  for COVID and claim that only
[58:26.480 --> 58:28.480]  a new lockdown will stop
[58:28.480 --> 58:30.480]  COVID. Then of course
[58:30.480 --> 58:32.480]  when that new lockdown doesn't work, those
[58:32.480 --> 58:34.480]  of us that didn't submit to the lockdown
[58:34.480 --> 58:36.480]  are going to be blamed for it and that's when all
[58:36.480 --> 58:38.480]  the mass arrests start sometime
[58:38.480 --> 58:40.480]  towards the end of next year. This is a
[58:40.480 --> 58:42.480]  permanent martial law plan
[58:42.480 --> 58:44.480]  Trump must repudiate it, expose
[58:44.480 --> 58:46.480]  Fauci and Gates, and the UN take over
[58:46.480 --> 58:48.480]  not play games with it.

[1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.480]  Live from the Infowars.com studios
[1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:36.480]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:40.480]  They may have the four horsemen
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:42.480]  but we got the angel of death.
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:46.480]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:48.480]  I am your host Alex Jones
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:50.480]  and I'm very blessed to be here.
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.480]  Coming up, we have the solution.
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:54.480]  Rising up, fighting back,
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:56.480]  resisting.
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:00:58.480]  But because most of you, including my wife
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:00.480]  have seen all the news
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:02.480]  that all the governors said Trump's full
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:04.480]  of crap in Georgia. While there's no fraud
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:06.480]  blah blah blah
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:08.480]  I thought I'd actually go to some of his
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:10.480]  press conference yesterday.
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:12.480]  They don't want you to see. Here it is.
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:14.480]  Good afternoon.
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:16.480]  COVID-19
[1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:18.480]  has introduced numerous challenges
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:20.480]  to county and state elections
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:22.480]  officials as they work to keep Georgia
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:24.480]  elections secure, accessible
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:26.480]  and fair.
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:28.480]  Given the record number of absentee
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:30.480]  ballots and narrow margin in the
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:32.480]  November 3rd election for president
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:34.480]  in Georgia, I joined many
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:36.480]  in backing a hand recount
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:38.480]  in urging a thorough investigation
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:40.480]  into any voting irregularities.
[1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:42.480]  The Secretary
[1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:44.480]  of State oversaw a complete audit
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:46.480]  which revealed significant errors
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:48.480]  made in several counties
[1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:50.480]  including Floyd, Fayette,
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:52.480]  Douglas and Walton.
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:54.480]  It is important
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.480]  for Georgia's to know that the vast
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:58.480]  majority of local election workers
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:00.480]  did their job well
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:02.480]  under unprecedented circumstances
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:04.480]  and I thank them for their service.
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:06.480]  However,
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:08.480]  it's quite honestly hard to believe
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:10.480]  that during the audit, thousands
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:12.480]  of uncounted ballots were found
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:14.480]  weeks after a razor thin
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:16.480]  outcome in a presidential
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:18.480]  election.
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.480]  This is simply unacceptable.
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:22.480]  I've heard directly from countless
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.480]  Georgians. They expect better
[1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:26.480]  and they deserve better.
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.480]  It's important to note
[1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:30.480]  that this audit only looked at ballots,
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:32.480]  not the signatures on the
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:34.480]  absentee applications
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:36.480]  or the signatures on the ballot
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:38.480]  envelopes.
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:40.480]  The Georgians I've heard from are extremely
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:42.480]  concerned about this.
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:44.480]  So I encourage Secretary
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:46.480]  Raffensperger to consider addressing
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:48.480]  these concerns.
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:50.480]  It seems simple enough
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:52.480]  to conduct a sample audit of signatures
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:54.480]  on the absentee ballot envelopes
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:56.480]  and compare those
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:58.480]  to the signatures on applications
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:00.480]  and on file at the
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:02.480]  Secretary of State's office.
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:04.480]  This morning, the Secretary
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:06.480]  announced his support of strengthening
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:08.480]  photo ID requirements for
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:10.480]  absentee balloting.
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:12.480]  Voters casting their ballots in person
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:14.480]  must show a photo ID
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:16.480]  and we should consider applying
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:18.480]  that same standard to mail-in
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:20.480]  balloting.
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:22.480]  I've heard from many members of the General
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:24.480]  Assembly and I appreciate their
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:26.480]  input and share their concern.
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:28.480]  I look forward to
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:30.480]  working with Lieutenant Governor Duncan,
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:32.480]  Speaker Ralston and members
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:34.480]  of both bodies to address the
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:36.480]  issues that have been raised over the last
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:38.480]  several weeks.
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:40.480]  Earlier today, Secretary
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:42.480]  Raffensperger presented
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:44.480]  the certified results of
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:46.480]  the 2020 General Election to my
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:48.480]  office.
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:50.480]  Following Judge Grimsburg's ruling
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:52.480]  yesterday, state law now requires
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:54.480]  the Governor's office to formalize
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:56.480]  the certification,
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:58.480]  which paves the way for the Trump campaign
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:00.480]  to pursue other legal
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:02.480]  options in a separate
[1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:04.480]  recount if they choose.
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:06.480]  Georgia has runoff
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:08.480]  elections for two U.S. Senate seats
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:10.480]  and a public service commissioner
[1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:12.480]  scheduled to occur over the next
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:14.480]  several weeks.
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:16.480]  We demand complete explanations
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:18.480]  for all discrepancies identified
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:20.480]  so that our citizens will
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:22.480]  have complete confidence in our
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:24.480]  elections.
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:26.480]  In the runoff election, we cannot
[1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:28.480]  have lost memory cards
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:30.480]  or stacks of uncounted ballots.
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:32.480]  We must have full transparency
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:34.480]  in all monitoring
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:36.480]  and counting.
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:38.480]  Every legal vote must be counted
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:40.480]  and the security of the ballot...
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:42.480]  But CNN said there's no evidence of fraud.
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:44.480]  They said
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:46.480]  Biden's our president.
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:50.480]  They've only begun to fight
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.480]  global estate with us.
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:05:02.480]  We're back.
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:24.480]  We're going to find...
[1:05:52.480 --> 1:05:54.480]  Big Brother
[1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:56.480]  Mainstream Media
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:05:58.480]  Government Cover-ups
[1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:00.480]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:02.480]  Well, so does he.
[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:04.480]  Live from the Infowars.com
[1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:06.480]  Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:08.480]  All right, let's talk about
[1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:10.480]  the big brother, Alex Jones.
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:12.480]  Alex Jones,
[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:14.480]  Alex Jones,
[1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:16.480]  Alex Jones,
[1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:18.480]  Alex Jones,
[1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.480]  Alex Jones,
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:22.480]  Alex Jones.
[1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:24.480]  All right, let's talk about solutions
[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:26.480]  right now. It was the head
[1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:28.480]  of President Trump's
[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:30.480]  COVID-19 Task Force that said
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:32.480]  this is all overblown, it's a power grab.
[1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:34.480]  They're counting all these other dead people
[1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:36.480]  of cancer, car wrecks, gunshot wounds,
[1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:38.480]  drowning, skydiving accidents, motorcycle accidents.
[1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:40.480]  They're counting
[1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:42.480]  all of those as COVID-19 deaths. That's confirmed.
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:46.480]  So just creating a chicken little scenario,
[1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:48.480]  they said it's time to rise up
[1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:50.480]  when
[1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:52.480]  Michigan and other states
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:54.480]  announce all the small businesses are closed
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:56.480]  but Walmart
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:58.480]  and Target and Costco
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:00.480]  are open and they're all making
[1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:02.480]  80, 90, 100% extra profits
[1:07:02.480 --> 1:07:04.480]  that you're going bankrupt. I mean, this is war.
[1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:06.480]  They go, oh, it's for the children.
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:08.480]  This is cynical, this is
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:10.480]  sick, this is the establishment
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:12.480]  trying to punish us for not groveling
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:14.480]  to them and now the head of the World Bank
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:16.480]  has said it, the head of the IMF has said it,
[1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:18.480]  that the British Prime Minister has said it,
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:20.480]  the German Chancellor has said it,
[1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:22.480]  the Canadian Prime Minister came out
[1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:24.480]  and said this is a lockdown
[1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:26.480]  for world government to teach us how to be
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:28.480]  poor and to need help from them.
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:30.480]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:34.480]  By the way,
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:36.480]  this isn't me bragging.
[1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:38.480]  This is the converse
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:40.480]  or this is the other side of this thing.
[1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:44.480]  I got calls
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.480]  the last three days
[1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:48.480]  from
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:50.480]  major world leaders,
[1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:52.480]  major people in government,
[1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:54.480]  the biggest people in media
[1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:56.480]  and they said
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:07:58.480]  all of them said the same thing. They said, Jones,
[1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:00.480]  when you go to dinner parties
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:02.480]  or these big Hollywood parties
[1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:04.480]  or with these big events, everyone loves you now
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:06.480]  and everyone's asking
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:08.480]  about you.
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:10.480]  It's not about me.
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:12.480]  It's that I'm just, I represent
[1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:14.480]  the resistance
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:16.480]  and people that are awake.
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:18.480]  It's the opposite of a power trip for me.
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:20.480]  I'm just some guy who goes home, climbs my bed,
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:22.480]  goes to sleep, totally freaked out, fighting all the time.
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.480]  But I am the art type, like you are,
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:26.480]  the common man, the common woman,
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:28.480]  the common human in resistance.
[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:30.480]  So, I can tell you
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:32.480]  the average Hollywood
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:34.480]  star, people worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:36.480]  the average top talk show host,
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:38.480]  the average
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:40.480]  person with the top shows
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.480]  in the country
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:44.480]  are like, okay,
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:46.480]  why is everyone
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:50.480]  at these mountaintop events
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:52.480]  both literal and figurative
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:54.480]  talking about you?
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:08:58.480]  Because they're now realizing
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:00.480]  we were right and they're realizing how much
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:02.480]  danger they're in.
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:04.480]  I take no pleasure
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:06.480]  in being on that side, guys. I am a beyond
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:08.480]  imperfect vessel.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:10.480]  I'm like a colander.
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:14.480]  I've got so many holes in me,
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:16.480]  but I recognize it. But I have now
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:18.480]  lived to the point
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:20.480]  where
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:22.480]  the very people
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:26.480]  going along with this are scared
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:28.480]  and they should be.
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:30.480]  Because this is a post-human
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:32.480]  system being built.
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:34.480]  And I told some of these folks to have kids.
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:36.480]  By the way, all people that call me have children.
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:38.480]  That's why these globals don't have children.
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:40.480]  Another thing
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.480]  if you haven't had children, but the point is it creates
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:44.480]  a metaphysical thing where you're tied to humanity
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:46.480]  even more and your ancestors into the future
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:48.480]  and it's a command
[1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:50.480]  once you have children.
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:52.480]  I mean, you're perfect, but it's a command.
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:54.480]  And these people are all like,
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.480]  I know why you called.
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:09:58.480]  And they go, this happened all three times.
[1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:00.480]  They go, I love my children.
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:02.480]  And one person started crying and said, what do I do?
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:06.480]  And I said, get on your knees to God. I don't know what to do.
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:08.480]  I've already been to this process they've been through.
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  I'm not that important.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.480]  I'm just a focal point
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:14.480]  of this resistance.
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:16.480]  And that's why what we do here is so important.
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:18.480]  Why the listeners are so important.
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:20.480]  And I'm ready to die. I'm ready to be imprisoned.
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:22.480]  I'm ready to put solitary confinement.
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:24.480]  I'm ready to be tortured for the truth.
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:26.480]  Because I realized I can't sign on to the
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:28.480]  pedophilia and the Satanism.
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:30.480]  In fact, it's a very easy, I'm not into persecution.
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:32.480]  I'm not into masochism.
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:34.480]  I don't like pain.
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:36.480]  But I'll take it.
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:38.480]  I'll take as much as they're going to give me.
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:40.480]  Because it's so short compared to eternity.
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:44.480]  Because Jesus Christ is on the other side of it.
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:52.480]  And I wish we could have stopped this.
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.480]  I really wish we could have, but we can't.
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:58.480]  We're going to get hurt for what we've done.
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:00.480]  And what friends we deserve it.
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:04.480]  Doesn't mean Satan's right to be carrying it out.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:06.480]  Satan's the author of it.
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:08.480]  Satan tricks us. Satan greases his kids
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:10.480]  for our bad behavior.
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:12.480]  I want to talk now about solutions.
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:16.480]  I want to talk about solutions.
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:18.480]  Because now we're entering the scary time.
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:20.480]  And it just gets scarier from here on out.
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:24.480]  And the men will be measured.
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:26.480]  And the women will be measured.
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.480]  And we're all going to be measured.
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.480]  We're all going to be put through the fire.
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:34.480]  And I welcome the fire.
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:38.480]  I welcome the fire.
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:40.480]  Because it will cleanse us.
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:44.480]  And it will burn away the lies.
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:46.480]  And separate the metal from the trash.
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:50.480]  And in that fire we will find our ascendance.
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:52.480]  Or we'll find our destruction.
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:58.480]  The real test is now here.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:00.480]  From here on out,
[1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:02.480]  the gates of hell have been opened.
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:06.480]  Christ had the keys.
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:08.480]  But we asked Christ for the keys,
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:10.480]  like bad teenagers,
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:12.480]  to take the car for a ride and open the gate.
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:16.480]  The gates open.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.480]  And now we're going to have that experience.
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:24.480]  So let's talk about a solution.
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.480]  Let's talk about how you fight back.
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:28.480]  Like Dr. Atlas said,
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:30.480]  you need to rise up.
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:32.480]  We do. You need to rise up against fear,
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:34.480]  against hysteria, against this obvious scam.
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:36.480]  Let's play the first clip.
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:38.480]  This is California protests.
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:40.480]  Go to Governor Newsom's house.
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:42.480]  Here it is.
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.480]  It's the same country.
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:06.480]  The point is, that's how this starts.
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:08.480]  It's recognizing the fraud, recognizing the scam.
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:10.480]  It's another clip of folks saying,
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:12.480]  at Huntington Beach, here at the same state, California.
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:14.480]  California.
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:40.480]  So take heart, my friends.
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:47.720]  steal this from us, their doom is even greater. And I don't wish for that, but that is a real
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:55.240]  possibility. So here's another clip. This is in New York, where they try to go to gyms
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:14:00.400]  and restaurants and say, you can't be open, but, oh, everything else can be open. Like
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:04.640]  Newsom's announced, all of Hollywood's open. All of his venues have never got closed. All
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:08.520]  the big strip malls are open. Just your clothes, because you're little. I mean, how obvious
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:14.720]  is that? This is war. So they finally ran off these corrupt cops. They don't worship
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:22.600]  police. The left wants to take over the police. But when cops are doing wrong, they are the
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:43.520]  enemy. Here it is. Armed men come to a gym to tell them you can't be open. No, and look,
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:50.120]  they're not wearing masks. They're out of the cult. They're done. This is all the desperate
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:54.440]  left. They're like, Hey, we love blue lives matter, but we're not your slaves. You got
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:15:03.280]  to go to the road. We will not comply. We will not comply. We will not comply. We will
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:11.000]  not comply. We will not comply. This is a protest, guys. We do not. So the war has
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.040]  only begun. Yeah, your business being open is a protest. You take care of your children
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:21.800]  is a protest. You take care of your body is a protest against Satan. The whole thing's
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:28.080]  a war against life. The whole thing is a bunch of greedy, hateful people that are so hateful.
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:33.000]  They hate themselves. They project their own hate on you. Well, I tell Bill Gates and I
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.300]  tell Bill Clinton, you're going to meet Christ face to face. And you're going to be folded
[1:15:38.300 --> 1:15:43.560]  into yourself and sent to a place by yourself, your own little universe. You can play God
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:49.240]  by yourself with no one to abuse because that's the real Phantom Zone is a whole universe
[1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:54.880]  for you little demigods by yourselves. You will be with yourself forever. You are cursed
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:16:01.000]  and damned. Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.240]  by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations. And now because the slaves have proven themselves
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:11.320]  to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns, you can't even leave
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:16.000]  your house for months and months are being announced. And in Germany, the police are
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:21.320]  using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women and children that protest
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:25.280]  the fact that Merkel, the dictator has put them under her control. That's right. She's
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:30.480]  been ringing elections for years and years. And the same thing is coming here to the United
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:35.520]  States. This is world government in Philadelphia. They've announced four people or more seen
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:39.760]  together will be arrested. They're announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is what the
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:44.800]  Communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due process and
[1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:50.720]  absolutely transform the world into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:57.480]  this? But you can fight back. America is the last bastion. Stop submitting. Remember Hillary
[1:16:57.480 --> 1:17:03.280]  Clinton? Remember Pelosi? Remember Bill Clinton? Remember Obama? All of them said we are not
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:07.240]  going to concede if there's a red mirage. We believe it's going to look like Trump's
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:12.560]  going to win in landslides. They had the internal polls. And indeed, Trump won most of the states
[1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:16.760]  he won last time by an even bigger margin. And when he was set to win the other ones,
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:23.160]  they froze the seven states on election night. And then they brought in all of the reserve
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:27.160]  ballots they had. This is completely transparent. So when they say that he is president elect,
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:31.040]  he's not. Trump has not conceded. None of the states have certified the vote. And now
[1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:35.560]  all these investigations have been opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:41.200]  fraud has come out and already been documented in Georgia. Officials are on record saying
[1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:45.800]  we've already found fraud. So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in. They've run bigger and bigger
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:50.800]  hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed. But now this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:55.000]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America. As we know it, we will be Venezuela
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:08.600]  in full wars.com and when we take this country back, they must be held accountable.
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:26.680]  The games are over. The fighting is over. The fight is now out in the open. World government
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:42.080]  is fighting harder than ever and we pledge to you to never back down and never give up
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:46.080]  in the face of this evil because we know God is watching and God is in charge and God
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:57.560]  is in charge.
[1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:05.200]  Introducing Info Wars Life Pure Turmeric Extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:11.280]  turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:17.120]  taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines. This is absorbed
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:21.360]  under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is absorbed by the
[1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:26.160]  stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different, but
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:30.360]  both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this

[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:24.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the Information War, it's
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:46.040]  Alex Jones. You know, folks, I love to talk and I love to talk to you and I'm very honored
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:53.680]  and blessed to be here. But I happened to be going through some Ronald Reagan clips yesterday,
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:21:00.400]  Saturday afternoon, and I was doing some research and I came across Ronald Reagan's farewell
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:05.800]  address. It's 22 minutes long. You just type in Ronald Reagan's farewell address from the
[1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:10.640]  Oval Office and you'll pull it up. I'm going to air a few minutes of it, but compare this,
[1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:13.920]  because Ronald Reagan wasn't perfect, but not people that knew him. He cared about America.
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:19.680]  You know, he loved freedom. He really cared about the people and compare him to an Obama
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:25.920]  or a Hillary. And then even to a Trump. You know, Trump wants to beat the globalists in
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:31.160]  ways he's better than Reagan, but with Reagan, there's a real genuineness. And notice all
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:38.160]  Reagan's trying to do is unify the people and make you proud of goodness so that you're
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:43.440]  proud of what you've done and proud of who you are. You know, back then the suicide rate
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:50.040]  was 200% lower. I was looking it up as a fraction of the suicides there is now. People felt
[1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:54.520]  good about themselves. I don't want you to be demoralized during these lockdowns and
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:59.640]  feel bad about yourself, whether you're old, white, black, Hispanic. Don't listen to them.
[1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:06.120]  You all are beautiful and God loves you. And your relationship with God is what matters.
[1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:09.320]  And so here's a few minutes what Ronald Reagan had to say. I just felt moved to play some
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:14.640]  of this, but I suggest you go watch the full farewell final Oval Office address. Like, what's
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:21.520]  the exact name of this? It's President Ronald Reagan's farewell address to the nation January
[1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:25.360]  11 1989. Here's here's part of it.
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:32.480]  My fellow Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office and
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:38.040]  the last we've been together eight years now and soon it'll be time for me to go. But before
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:43.720]  I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.
[1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:47.760]  It's been the honor of my life to be your president. So many of you have written the
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:53.320]  past few weeks to say thanks. But I could say as much to you, Nancy and I are grateful
[1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:58.320]  for the opportunity you gave us to serve. One of the things about the presidency is
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:04.380]  that you're always somewhat apart. You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone
[1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:09.680]  else is driving and seeing the people through tinted glass, the parents holding up a child
[1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:15.640]  and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return. And so many times I wanted to stop
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:22.160]  and reach out from behind the glass and connect. Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:28.040]  People ask how I feel about leaving and the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow. The sweet
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:35.400]  part is California and the ranch and freedom. The sorrow, the goodbyes, of course, and leaving
[1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:41.520]  this beautiful place. You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:46.360]  part of the White House where the president and his family live. There are a few favorite
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:51.640]  windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning. The
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:57.040]  view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument and then the mall and the Jefferson
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:02.280]  Memorial. But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to
[1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:08.080]  the river, the Potomac and the Virginia Shore. Someone said that's the view Lincoln had
[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:14.240]  when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run. Well, I see more prosaic things.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.040]  The grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:24.360]  then a sailboat on the river. I've been thinking a bit at that window. I've been reflecting
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:29.520]  on what the past eight years have meant and mean and the image that comes to mind like
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:37.520]  a refrain is a nautical one. A small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor.
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:41.780]  It was back in the early 80s at the height of the boat people and the sailor was hard
[1:24:41.780 --> 1:24:47.480]  at work on the carrier Midway which was patrolling the South China Sea. The sailor like most
[1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:53.760]  American servicemen was young, smart and fiercely observant. The crew spied on the horizon
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:25:00.880]  a leaky little boat and crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America.
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:05.680]  The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship in safety. As the refugees made
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:10.880]  their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck and stood up and called
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:18.880]  out to him. He yelled, hello American sailor, hello freedom man. A small moment with a big
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:24.000]  meaning. A moment the sailor who wrote it in a letter couldn't get out of his mind.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:29.960]  And when I saw it, neither could I. Because that's what it has to, it was to be an American
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:36.120]  in the 1980s. We stood again for freedom. I know we always have, but in the past few
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:42.520]  years the world again and in a way we ourselves rediscovered it. It's been quite a journey
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:49.360]  this decade and we held together through some stormy seas. And at the end, together we're
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:55.680]  reaching our destination. The fact is from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits,
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:01.440]  from the recession of 81 to 82 to the expansion that began in late 82 and continues to this
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:08.080]  day, we've made a difference. The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things
[1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:14.440]  that I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery in which the people of America created
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:22.120]  and filled 19 million new jobs. The other is the recovery of our morale. America is
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:27.120]  respected again in the world and looked to for leadership. Something that happened to
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:32.960]  me a few years ago reflects some of this. It was back in 1981 and I was attending my
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:38.880]  first big economic summit which was held that year in Canada. The meeting place rotates
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:43.520]  among the member countries. The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the heads of government
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:49.840]  of the seven industrialized nations. I sat there like the new kid in school and listened
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:56.200]  and it was all Francois this and Helmut that. They dropped titles and spoke to one another
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:04.760]  on a first name basis. At one point, I sort of leaned in and said, my name's Ron. In
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:10.720]  that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback, cut taxes
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:17.360]  and regulation, started to cut spending, soon the recovery began. Two years later, another
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:22.400]  economic summit with pretty much the same cast. At the big opening meeting, we all got
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:27.480]  together and all of a sudden, just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just sitting there
[1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:34.800]  looking at me and then one of them broke the silence. Tell us about the American miracle,
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:41.320]  he said. Well, back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so different. Some
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:46.320]  pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe. Our views on foreign affairs
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:51.480]  would cause war. Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:59.800]  economic collapse. I even remember one highly respected economist saying back in 1982 that
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:07.400]  the engines of economic growth have shut down here and they're likely to stay that way for
[1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:15.240]  years to come. All right, let's stop there. Why did I play this? Because back in 1988,
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:19.040]  when Reagan's leaving, governments are still in charge. They've got problems, they're
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:23.840]  up, but they're not corporations that are totally ruthless. They're now bigger than
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:28.600]  government. And he could actually chart the world and get people to imitate America. Now
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:33.480]  it's the Chinese, it's the big corporations, it's Apple, it's lobbying against rules against
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:38.000]  slave camps. I've got articles right here. These people are evil, they're bad, they're
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.600]  dangerous. That's why I wanted to play that, talk about what was going on 30 plus years
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:47.040]  ago versus what's happening today. All right, I'm going to get into the big globalist master
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:51.960]  plan. What the reset really means to you and your family and how to stop at deadness tracks
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:59.000]  straight ahead on this live Sunday transmission. The problem with social Darwinism is the
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:06.400]  so-called elites, the most cunning, smart, inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't
[1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:10.320]  exist anymore. They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:15.840]  and power the people. And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses
[1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:20.160]  very, very quickly, you can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own
[1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:26.120]  family like that. And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us. The globalist
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:31.320]  can try to be heartless devil or spurs that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes,
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:35.280]  try to get away from humanity, but really they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:41.080]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but the
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:44.880]  repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:49.880]  structure itself. Wealth is created by loving God. Wealth is created by having connection
[1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:54.840]  to God. God is the source of all creation, all success, all power. We deny that, you'll
[1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:57.040]  be destroyed.
[1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:02.320]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:07.920]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:30:07.920 --> 1:30:14.200]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:20.120]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:25.720]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[1:30:25.720 --> 1:30:32.200]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:39.280]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:45.440]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:51.800]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[1:30:51.800 --> 1:30:55.920]  a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:30:55.920 --> 1:31:02.400]  It really is simple. The left are into being deviant, and I don't mean sexually deviant.
[1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:07.400]  That goes to territory. I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against
[1:31:07.400 --> 1:31:12.880]  their own species, deviant against the order of nature. Even though that deviance is destructive
[1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:17.640]  and poisonous, they still do it because they want to play God. Everything they touch, they
[1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:24.200]  destroy. Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts. Their religion
[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:28.880]  is not taking care of the old, but euthanizing them. Their whole system is designed for the
[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:33.320]  UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor, ballooning populations
[1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:38.680]  and then watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually reproduce the same
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:42.960]  nightmares over and over and over again. They truly are the children of Satan. They are
[1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:46.520]  the children of the devil. And if you look at the slaves that serve the Biden and Kamala
[1:31:46.520 --> 1:31:51.440]  Harris, it really is manifested that being a slave of Satan is not profitable. Sin is
[1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:56.320]  not profitable. I'm Alex Jones, and this is the Info War.
[1:31:56.320 --> 1:32:04.520]  America is in crisis. Emergency lockdown 2 is coming under Biden. Support Info War is
[1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:09.200]  the fighting. It's total economic collapse and Biden's martial law disguised as lockdown

[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:53.360]  Everything's gonna be all right. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We are with God. That's
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:00.240]  all that matters. We have free will and many of our fellow humans have chosen Satan.
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:10.000]  So now, problems of pain. They've got to be shown. They've got to be spanked.
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:18.560]  All right. Let's look at it right now. Let's talk about what's currently happening right now
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:26.080]  and how to fight back against these demons. You know, the greatest failure of all of us,
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:31.520]  including President Trump was when they cut off our communications, when they let big tech,
[1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:36.800]  that's 90% of communication now. People don't talk over landlines. They don't even talk over
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:42.080]  cell phones. That's only 10%. Landlines and cell phone calls. I looked it up just this morning.
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:50.560]  They're about 9.7%. It's estimated a year ago. Numbers are always old. 90% of communication
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:35:00.960]  is on Facebook, is on Twitter, is on Google, is on Apple, or is over some telecom internet.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:08.480]  And when we allowed AI program software and congressional hearings
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:13.600]  to come in and block what you can say and what you can do,
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:19.920]  we gave them everything they needed to make a run at our government, a run at us,
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:24.560]  a run at our economy. And they've so far, with this Blitzkrieg attack they launched
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:32.800]  a year ago, have won spectacularly. Lightning War. 100% profit for Amazon.
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:39.040]  80% profit increased the last year for all the other big techs. They are killing us.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.600]  It'd be one thing if they were making great profits and everybody else got a piece of it. No,
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:48.720]  it's at your expense and it's on record. And they sit there thinking you're an idiot going,
[1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:52.640]  knowing you were trained at a university going, we're going to build back better.
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:56.160]  It's a great reset. You're going to get free stuff any moment now.
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:03.760]  Now, wait for it. We're sending it. And it's so cold-blooded.
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:17.040]  So, we as a civilization, we as a society have to decide, do we want to be chumps?
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:24.160]  And that's my message before I hit this news, to not the 90% that are regular listeners
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:27.600]  that are already informed, not from me, just by their own experiences,
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:32.240]  that tune in because they resonate with what we cover. I care about the prodigal son.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:43.280]  I care about the lost people. And, you know, I have to humble myself and say, I'm sorry,
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:48.240]  I'm not Christlike. I should have been. I should have been more sweet to you.
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:52.400]  I should have been time with you. I should have tried to really talk to you instead of being
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:59.040]  arrogant against you. But I need you to understand something. You're not part of the power structure.
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:03.360]  You're not part of the new world order. You're not part of the winning team.
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:08.720]  When you're in Antifa, or you're in Black Lives Matter, or you're in some leftist organization,
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:15.280]  you're seen as the dumbest chumps in the world by Bill Gates, by George Soros.
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:23.200]  And it's come out from Facebook executives and Google executives that their whole mission
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:25.840]  is to make you alone and weak.
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:35.760]  And that they take pleasure in that. And so my only message to you is
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:46.240]  there's something about the loser where they won't admit they're wrong and they won't admit
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:53.920]  they're conned. But, you know, I still care about you because God, my heart tells me to care about
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:59.040]  you. I know there are people out there that think this is all funny. I think it's all a joke.
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:06.720]  You're on the winning team with Joe Biden, that reanimated zombie, and Kamala Harris, and you
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.840]  think you're running around and you're having victories and, oh, you're on the winning team,
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:16.960]  you're not going to get a dollar out of this. You're not going to get ahead any by this.
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:26.880]  Trump was doing everything he could to quite frankly, decadently flood your ass with money.
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:33.440]  It didn't matter if you were Hispanic, white, black, old, young, Trump flooded things because
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:38.720]  Trump said, why are we giving unlimited fiat currency to rich bankers and then nothing
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:44.400]  is given to the public? Why are we doing that?
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:50.480]  He said, if we're going to devalue currencies worldwide, which is an ongoing race by the
[1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:56.720]  bankers to bankrupt the current system, Trump said, fine, in the final act, let's just pump
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:04.160]  money to the average person. And the general public was in brainwash to say, we don't want
[1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:11.200]  you to give us money. We want George Soros, who started off his adult life, rounding up
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:20.160]  fellow Jews for the Nazis, who bankrupts pension funds and old people's pension funds and says,
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:27.200]  he's proud of it. And you're literally signed on to this soulless entity that doesn't care about you.
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:30.800]  That is truly insane.
[1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:40.880]  And so I have responsibility as a Christian. You know, if I was a globalist, I would see you and
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:45.040]  see you as an animal, see you as trash, and I would feed on you.
[1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:52.080]  But God's spirit leaves me if I start thinking like that. So I'm not going to treat you like that,
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:57.600]  but I will tell you straight up to your face. If you're a Democrat, if you're a leftist,
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:04.960]  if you're an antifa, you're an idiot, literal count Dracula, and then Prince Philip who runs him
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:15.840]  and Prince Charles, who are the Dracula line, literally, literally, this is Hungarian, Romanian.
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:23.440]  These are the dudes for a thousand years. These are blood drinkers. You are literally on your knees
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:30.560]  to the seed of Satan, the dragon. And you think it's going to give you milk and cookies at night?
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:37.840]  It isn't. You are fools, and you are in grave danger, and I'm begging you. I'm begging you for
[1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:44.000]  your own soul. We will destroy you. God's going to destroy you. I'm asking you to get off the side
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:50.240]  of Satan. I don't want to destroy you. I take no pleasure in this. I don't want to destroy you.
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:54.160]  I don't want God to destroy you. I'm just begging you, please stop serving Satan.
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:41:00.880]  Turn back now. There's still time. There's still time. You can do it. You can renounce Bill Gates.
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:06.720]  You can renounce Fauci. You can renounce Ted Turner. You can renounce George Soros,
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:12.560]  and you can accept Jesus Christ. You've got to do it quickly. There isn't much time.
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:23.920]  There is, this is such a serious situation. Please, please turn back now.
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:29.840]  God doesn't want to destroy you. God doesn't want to annihilate you,
[1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:37.760]  but you've got to reject the power of the earth. You have to reject Satan, or you don't have any hope.
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:43.360]  You must reject Joe Biden, telling you you're dirty, and you're bad, and you're all this. These people
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:50.480]  are sick. I want to come back in the final segment. I'm going to hit their COVID lockdown to take over,
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:56.400]  how to stop it, how to resist in my humble view. And then Owen Troyer is coming up with an amazing
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:02.240]  Sunday Live. They only have six minutes to add, because only local ads run. So that'll be coming
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:08.720]  up Sunday Live on all the streams, all the streams, all the streams, all the streams.
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:13.120]  And you'll be able to find that and share that on little radio stations. TV stations,
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:19.600]  Owen Troyer, is coming up for two hours after I leave you. This is such an incredible time.
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:23.280]  And I want to thank the crew and thank everybody that's kept us on air, because
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:30.400]  this is such an amazing point in history that we're all living together. Just please reject Satan.
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:38.160]  You can do it. Break the will of Satan. Turn loose. Join Jesus. I've done it.
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:44.960]  You can do it. Join Christ now. My hand is open. I love you. I care about you. Join us.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:49.120]  Join us for eternity. Go with life. Stay with us.
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:43:01.360]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands of
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:06.720]  years by ancient civilizations. With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:13.760]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:20.400]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products. They're three to five percent curcuminoid,
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:28.720]  but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level. And we have other
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:32.800]  organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells of the body.
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:37.600]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock. And despite that, body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:45.680]  at infowarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping and triple patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:50.800]  It's body's ultimate turmeric formula. If you haven't tried it, learn why it's got thousands
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:44:08.480]  of five-star reviews at infowarstore.com. And you can't lose. It funds the infowar.
[1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:24.960]  The fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control. That's right,
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:30.400]  she's been rigging elections for years and years. And the same thing is coming here to the United
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:35.760]  States. This is world government. In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:40.720]  will be arrested. They're announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is what the communist takeover
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:46.640]  looks like. To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely transform the
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:52.400]  world into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back.
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:59.200]  America is the last bastion. Stop submitting. Urgent warnings are being issued right now
[1:44:59.200 --> 1:45:03.760]  by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sachs.
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:08.320]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:13.840]  millions to start the death. Incredible. They're the very organizations that ordered the global
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:19.280]  lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:25.440]  virus. That is a fact. And all the hero sheep, where the mask to go along with this are signing on
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:30.320]  to mass murder bigger than what Hitler did. That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:37.440]  Nuremberg Code. This is a medical world government, a radical takeover, causing starvation, setting
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:43.280]  up world IDs and coming with forced inoculations. And now Bank of America says global unrest is
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:48.320]  sure to trigger an even bigger depression. That's stories on infowars.com. That's why it's vital
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:53.040]  for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this or the mass global genocide
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:46:22.720]  being caused by the planetary great reset.
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:26.880]  Why shouldn't they? They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars. They never get in
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:30.720]  trouble for the Chinese slave camps. They never get in trouble for all the terrible
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.280]  exploitation in Africa. They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:41.360]  into our country. And so why shouldn't they go for broke? Because so many people are domesticated
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:46.560]  and they're soft and they have Stockholm syndrome. They love their abusers. They can't believe they're
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:52.000]  being lied to. They can't believe they're being conned. And so they're going into bondage. You see,
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.520]  there's always a minority that says no and infowars is that minority.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:35.280]  A bottomless pit, but my hand was made strong. By the end of the almighty, we forward in this
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:44.320]  generation. Try unfairly. Beautiful Bob Marley. Won't you help to sing
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:49.280]  the songs of freedom?
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:03.360]  All right, let's go to this clip. Here's Fauci in 2017, right from Selected, saying he will be
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:09.280]  challenged by a health crisis. And now they've launched it. He ran Wuhan with Bill Gates. He
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:15.840]  is the enemy. He is the author of our destruction. He should be arrested. He is Hitler is that there
[1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:22.320]  is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.520]  diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease. And we have
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:36.720]  certainly a large burden of that. But also there will be a surprise outbreak and that's right.
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:40.560]  That's not the full clip that goes on as it will be a surprise outbreak. And it gets very,
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:44.000]  very obvious. Let's find that full clip for tomorrow. You guys are great. But that's when you
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:52.080]  pulled up. Here is Fauci on 60 Minutes in March saying don't wear a mask. They call this fake news.
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:58.000]  It actually gives you bacterial pneumonia. That's what the real studies he wrote 2008 say.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.480]  Snoop says it's not true. Go read the study. It is true. Again, and then learn the criminal
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:08.560]  actions of snubs for yourself. Here it is. There's a lot of confusion among people and misinformation
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:15.760]  surrounding face masks. Can you discuss that? The masks are important for someone who's infected
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:21.920]  to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now when you see people and look at the films in
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:27.280]  China and South Korea, whatever, everybody's wearing a mask. Right now in the United States,
[1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:32.240]  people should not be walking around with masks. You're sure of it because people are listening
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:36.160]  really closely to this. Right now people should not be walking around. There's no reason to be
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:42.400]  walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:49.920]  make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet. But it's not providing the
[1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:57.600]  perfect protection that people think that it is. And often there are unintended consequences. People
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:02.880]  keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face. And can you get some schmutz sort of
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:07.360]  staying inside there? Of course, of course. But when you think masks, you should think of health
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:13.440]  care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people who, when you look at the films of
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:18.720]  foreign countries and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:23.360]  against it. If you want to do it, that's fine. But it can lead to a shortage of masks. Exactly.
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:28.320]  That's the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks. So what this is is called programming.
[1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:33.760]  Okay. So that's what he actually had to say. Now let's look at the facts.
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:41.760]  His study he wrote 2008 said bacterial pneumonia was the main cause of death and Spanish flu
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:46.160]  because everyone wore a mask. They used to think leeches on your legs were the way to go.
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:52.080]  The truth is all of us breathing on each other, touching each other, gives us herd immunity.
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:57.200]  That's what makes us strong. Other people have already gotten immunity. You give them your immunity.
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:51:01.040]  Nine times out of 10. I mean, I don't want to knock on wood here.
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:09.840]  I've had one fever in five and a half years. One fever. And it was this January from flying on
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:16.400]  planes, a bad cough for about a week and a fever. It was probably COVID. I was tested for COVID on
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:22.640]  Joe Rogan's show. It didn't come up. Doesn't matter. The test only pick up a high viral load
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:29.120]  of any virus. That's on record. So it's a fraud. I mean, I can read the study. I can read. It's like,
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:35.040]  I talked to family about this. Like, how do you know that? I read the study. It's so frustrating.
[1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:40.720]  So again, they told us 4% would die from this. It's less than one tenth of one percent.
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:46.960]  They told us 2.5 million will be dead. It's a quarter million. And most of those died of something
[1:51:46.960 --> 1:51:54.400]  else. It's a fraud. The science doesn't lie. The math doesn't lie. We've got all these epidemiologists
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:52:00.160]  have come out, all these virologists, and they get censored. The heads of university, the heads of
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:09.200]  Cedar Sinai because big tech wants to keep the lockdown going because their companies have had
[1:52:09.200 --> 1:52:15.600]  80 to 100% profit increases because everything else is shut down because you run away and get shut
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:22.800]  down. They don't. I know our listeners get this, but you've got to be aggressive. I went to restaurants
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:27.680]  this weekend. I went to stores. I didn't wear a mask. I got confronted one time in a grocery store
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:34.880]  and I said, listen, the economy is imploding. This is BS. This is a grocery store. Leave me
[1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:40.000]  alone. They said, actually, I know your rise that day. So look at some headlines here. California
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:49.520]  exempts Hollywood movie studios from COVID lockdown restrictions, but says churches, bars, restaurants,
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:53:00.160]  gyms, not well. On a scale of one to five, you get five Hitler mustaches. We should have a new
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:06.880]  thing there. You get five Hitler mustaches, Newsome. Millions of Americans ignore COVID travel
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:14.560]  warning. First vaccination is expected December 11th. Oh, and they admit you have to sign a waiver
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:19.680]  when you take it because it may make you so sick. So there are going to be a lot of COVID deaths
[1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:26.000]  from the vaccine. Get ready. European leader predicts COVID hell will trigger monumental
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:33.280]  populist backlash. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot defends joining crowds celebrating
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:37.760]  Biden Harris win with her mask off with thousands of people. It's all a scam people.
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:43.280]  And again, Newsome got caught flying out to Hawaii with hundreds of Democrats
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:51.600]  paid for by donors with taxpayer money not wearing masks. It's all a big scam. It's all a big joke on
[1:53:51.600 --> 1:54:00.320]  you. Our hypocritical leaders, our hypocritical leaders don't even follow their own COVID-19
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:06.800]  rules. Of course they don't. And we shouldn't leap in and like join them and like, oh, look,
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:11.840]  you're bad. You didn't do it. No, it's all a fraud. You know it's a fraud. It's an economic weapon
[1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:19.040]  to shut us down. Oh, but here's where the real meat and potatoes happen right now.
[1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:29.280]  Look at these headlines. Britons who test negative for COVID twice in a week
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:35.840]  are set to receive a freedom pass run by Bill Gates. The prime minister announces
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:46.080]  the global medical ID now announced. Wow. And who else is promoting it? Oh, oh, look.
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:56.960]  Overhead shot. Xi Jinping proposes global health QR code, which you go to every restaurant now,
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:55:00.400]  they go, oh, we don't have menus anymore. It's a QR code. It's getting you ready for the social
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:06.400]  credit score. Demand a paper menu. Don't do it. Leave. Chinese President Xi proposes global health
[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:13.920]  QR code system to revive coronavirus battered trade and travel. Oh, they'll fix to the travel.
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:20.080]  Just accept this. You'll get your money. No, you accept this. You're over. And it gets worse.
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:26.480]  World economic forum endorsed great reset seeks to eliminate currency and private property
[1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:30.880]  for the general public, except for themselves. They say we will bankrupt you,
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:35.280]  but don't worry. Everything will be free, even though they've exploited the third world
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:42.240]  like monsters. Wow. Incredible. Meanwhile, John Kerry says great reset is needed to stop
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:49.680]  rise in populism. The former secretary of state says it's punishment for Brexit and America
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:57.920]  for not joining the new world order. Wow. He's going to punish us just like Justin Trudeau said.
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:03.440]  Oh, thank you. And the average office goes, punish me, punish me. They're cut.
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:11.440]  You've got all the articles about the great reset. What happened to an academic freedom?
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:18.080]  Scientists fumes as Facebook flags COVID-19 study by a major medical journal saying mass
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:25.360]  do not protect you and give you viral pneumonia. That article is from RT, supplement forwards.com.
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:30.320]  Here's the actual study. The American spectator reported it. Landmark Dana study finds no
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:38.080]  significant effects for face back wearers, except for viral pneumonia. Oh, but again,
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:44.480]  you're not supposed to know that. Oh, and look at Trump. He's so evil. Trump attends his final G20
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:51.600]  summit. Oh, it's final. No, he's the president, not Biden. It's all fraud does not participate
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:56.720]  in pandemic prepared in the session because he knows it's a global martial law fraud.
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:04.720]  He should have gone and exposed the whole damn thing. All right. Oh, and Troyer two minutes
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:09.360]  after I leave here takes over on the audio and video streams and many radio stations.
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:16.320]  Oh, and is an amazing patriot. He's about to take over with Sunday Live. Please stay tuned
