[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.400 --> 00:47.640]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and it is Thursday the 13th day of December 2012
[00:47.640 --> 00:51.560]  we have several special reports are gonna be premiering here on the radio
[00:51.560 --> 00:57.760]  broadcast today dealing with several very important geopolitical issues Dr.
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.840]  Russell Blaylock did not make the show a few days ago but he will be joining us
[01:02.840 --> 01:08.520]  to talk about statin drugs and the neurological disorders increasing and
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.760]  the fact that the media and the medical establishment knows full well it's
[01:13.760 --> 01:17.760]  because people are not getting the healthy fats their brains are made out
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.360]  of that amongst the excitotoxins that are in the diet but we'll first get his
[01:22.360 --> 01:29.120]  take on Obamacare now going into place and I have a big stack of news here
[01:29.120 --> 01:35.160]  just just just in the last three years two and a half years since Obamacare
[01:35.160 --> 01:40.560]  quote became law just in anticipation of it going into effect here in about three
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.240]  weeks two and a half weeks it went up roughly 25% nationwide and I have those
[01:45.240 --> 01:53.320]  numbers here out of Bloomberg and other publications now it's set to double many
[01:53.320 --> 02:02.600]  premiums are set to double on top of not just the general premiums but also the
[02:02.600 --> 02:08.360]  deductibles and much more so we're going to be going over the wonderful free
[02:08.360 --> 02:13.480]  healthcare you're going to be getting yeah you pay extra money to the insurance
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.520]  companies a direct tax to the private mega banks and now government runs
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.320]  healthcare completely and so they will tell the doctors what treatments they
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.360]  can give you just in case you happen to have a good doctor that knows to give
[02:25.360 --> 02:29.960]  you the generic drug or a drug that's old but not the new thing that doesn't
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.600]  really work well the government can now controlled by big pharma and also one
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.280]  by the mega banks can say well take this new expensive drug that doesn't even
[02:40.280 --> 02:45.320]  work so your doctor is now a government programmed computer this is what's
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.640]  phasing in that's why some estimates show that upwards of 40% you can pull
[02:49.640 --> 02:59.160]  this up upwards of 40% of doctors in some fields are leaving they're following
[02:59.160 --> 03:08.760]  my dad is in healthcare and major medical divisions that provide dental care but
[03:08.760 --> 03:13.720]  also other medical care are just shutting down the corporations have made the
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.040]  decision to just cease business I mean America is now entering the phase of
[03:20.040 --> 03:25.160]  where people leave Venezuela corporations leave Russia operations leave
[03:25.160 --> 03:31.040]  other authoritarian systems and so and that's the medium-sized companies people
[03:31.040 --> 03:33.840]  will think of these as big companies because they're you know worth hundreds
[03:33.840 --> 03:37.480]  of millions of dollars that that's actually a medium-sized company so the
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.440]  medium-sized companies are saying well this business is over and government is
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.960]  busy taking over the rest of healthcare I gotta twist my dad's arm to come on
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.600]  air the stuff he could tell you but he doesn't want to do it this is a lot of
[03:52.600 --> 03:59.520]  us proprietary and you know that's the problem is that it is that you work at
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.040]  these corporations and these companies and they tell you you're not allowed to
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.280]  talk about this and and when you're not allowed to talk about something and you
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.840]  sign a nondisclosure and you agree to it that's the way it is the same way I
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.480]  were a journalist and if I'm in a meeting with somebody even if they're a
[04:16.480 --> 04:22.760]  globalist I happen to meet or run into or I accepted you know a meeting with once
[04:22.760 --> 04:26.600]  something's off record it's off record unless it's you know a felony being
[04:26.600 --> 04:31.560]  committed in front of my eyes because if you ever break confidence then you never
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.840]  get the sources again my problem is so many times people tell you stuff and
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.240]  don't say by the way this is in confidence and then you start talking
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.800]  about they're like hey don't talk about that okay so it's actually one of the
[04:44.800 --> 04:52.480]  things that tortures me is trying to always maintain that you know honorable
[04:52.480 --> 04:57.920]  trait all right big news ahead I'll give it all to you straight ahead will

[07:10.640 --> 07:15.360]  toxins being added to our drinking water we're battling the globalist on so many
[07:15.360 --> 07:19.880]  fronts health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all
[07:19.880 --> 07:25.160]  starts with that basic building block of water it is time to purify our family's
[07:25.160 --> 07:29.800]  water the pro pure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best

[08:03.520 --> 08:17.360]  it's Alex Jones I am your host Alex Jones and we are live on this Thursday the
[08:17.360 --> 08:24.720]  13th day of December 2012 and we're reportedly only seven days out in
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.840]  some time zones until the end of the world in fact it's it's getting close
[08:29.840 --> 08:34.640]  to less than seven days on Greenwich meantime and everyone knows that planet
[08:34.640 --> 08:40.640]  Nabooru or planet X will be slamming into the world on Greenwich meantime of
[08:40.640 --> 08:47.000]  course NASA has already put out a video early declaring see the end of the
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.640]  world didn't happen and I just think that it is a lot of people think
[08:52.640 --> 08:59.240]  similarly because that's funny I have a video coming out tomorrow where I
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.280]  basically say see the end of the world didn't happen and it's not a hard call
[09:04.280 --> 09:12.320]  but I expand on it yes we're seven days 11 hours 50 minutes 49 seconds until the
[09:12.320 --> 09:21.680]  end of the world only the super friends can save us but the video we're putting
[09:21.680 --> 09:28.360]  out tomorrow goes over the real threats humanity is facing you see if a giant
[09:28.360 --> 09:36.680]  say 10 mile wide iron ore asteroid slams into the earth it will go directly
[09:36.680 --> 09:42.360]  into the mantle causing even perhaps part of the core to leak out on the
[09:42.360 --> 09:47.640]  surface it will eject with the power of ten million large hydrogen bombs or
[09:47.640 --> 09:56.120]  more billions of megatons of rock will be ejected into space but also into the
[09:56.120 --> 10:04.360]  atmosphere the earth will then freeze solid planetary wide and most life will
[10:04.360 --> 10:15.560]  be destroyed will will will die now now that could happen at any time we know
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.520]  those type of events have happened in Earth's history and that is one of the
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.760]  biggest threats we face also solar flares can be large enough and powerful
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.160]  enough to be directed right at the earth and not just destroy electronics by the
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.760]  different you know particles it's sending out building up an electrical wires and
[10:34.760 --> 10:39.920]  then precipitating out of electronics but actually hit the earth and burn to a
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.160]  crisp whatever side it hits and damage the atmosphere perhaps even destroying
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.440]  the atmosphere there's types of things like that that could happen but see we
[10:49.440 --> 10:58.560]  don't know the hour or the day and there have been calls to put a little
[10:58.560 --> 11:06.280]  peaceful defense system out in deep orbit with weapon systems on board to
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.680]  track large asteroids coming in close to the earth and to destroy them the
[11:10.680 --> 11:13.840]  problem is any system like that could then be turned back around towards the
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.480]  earth and it's also dangerous to get the nuclear weapons into space particle
[11:18.480 --> 11:22.600]  beams we know they have are not strong enough to deflect and change the course
[11:22.600 --> 11:28.640]  or destroy the type of you know two mile three mile a two mile asteroid into
[11:28.640 --> 11:33.960]  the world as we know it three mile into the world ten ten mile ten mile and if
[11:33.960 --> 11:39.640]  it's iron ore or nickel it's going deep it's going real deep it's going you know
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.840]  four five six seven eight miles or more into the earth it's gonna eject all that
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.800]  back some estimates are 20 miles into the earth 30 miles into the earth anyways
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.640]  side issue we're just building up towards 2012 and my point is there's all
[11:52.640 --> 11:59.520]  these non man-made threats to the earth that are cyclical and are hard to
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.880]  estimate when are going to happen there are defenses for it other than super
[12:04.880 --> 12:14.760]  flares off the Sun comments hit the earth asteroids things like that if a you
[12:14.760 --> 12:26.000]  300 yard long asteroid it's the earth and it's metal you'll think that a hundred
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.920]  megaton hydrogen bomb got dropped on your city if it happens to hit there
[12:28.920 --> 12:32.440]  other than that it'll just cause a huge explosion if it's in a rural area and
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.160]  eject a bunch of dust to the atmosphere you could talk about this stuff all day
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.760]  but what I get into in the piece that Aaron and I've been working on all week
[12:40.760 --> 12:44.920]  that we're gonna premiere tomorrow here on the radio a slash video for
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.680]  prison planet dot TV subscribers is the man-made threats we can do something
[12:49.680 --> 12:57.840]  about genetic engineering bio weapons nano tech super cyclotrons like to
[12:57.840 --> 13:05.560]  Hadron in Europe France into Switzerland these are the real things that the earth
[13:05.560 --> 13:11.360]  is seriously threatened by and that's one another reason I get so mad at the
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.640]  globalist who want to say it's humans all day just the general public when it's
[13:16.640 --> 13:22.960]  the globalist that say they want world government to protect us from these
[13:22.960 --> 13:29.040]  type of science is being a developed and a reckless way that and they need a
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.200]  global government to shut down countries doing this but it's globalist
[13:32.200 --> 13:39.360]  nations in Europe England the United States that are racing in pure research
[13:39.360 --> 13:42.520]  with their scientists going well there's a low probability this will cause a
[13:42.520 --> 13:45.880]  unstable black hole that will destroy the earth and but we're going to do the
[13:45.880 --> 13:50.200]  test anyways and 500 more just like this and yes we're going to try to create a
[13:50.200 --> 13:53.760]  strange lit particle and there's a good chance it'll sink to the center of the
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.200]  earth and start and a chain reaction implosion but we're still going to do
[13:57.200 --> 14:03.240]  it kind of like more than half the scientists thought with the a bomb test
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.680]  in 1944 and the 45 the secret test they told folks never mind those giant
[14:08.680 --> 14:13.640]  explosions in the Nevada desert that you know break windows in Las Vegas
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.920]  nothing's going on you didn't see a mushroom cloud in the public said okay
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.800]  we didn't see a mushroom cloud kind of like you don't notice your neighbors all
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.200]  dying of cancer right now because the globalists are killing us you know more
[14:26.200 --> 14:30.840]  on the neurologic let's just people just hey move along it's normal that's why
[14:30.840 --> 14:33.880]  people all the time you see the articles every week in Europe in the US and
[14:33.880 --> 14:36.960]  Australia and New Zealand and in other Western countries it's really bad in
[14:36.960 --> 14:41.120]  China too where you know a woman's raped in public on the middle of a busy
[14:41.120 --> 14:46.040]  street she stumbles around beating ahead with a pipe in Toronto bleeding out and
[14:46.040 --> 14:50.320]  you know at one telecom company the CEO this was in the news a few years ago
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.400]  says don't even call police it's just too much of a bother let her let her just
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.360]  lay out there on the street and die and then but employees did did have fun
[14:59.360 --> 15:03.880]  watching her an attractive woman with her head beat in later went into a coma
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.840]  I mean they did enjoy her naked on the street though that that was a the the
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.520]  company had a reporter like a sub-employee is the ones that reported him
[15:12.520 --> 15:20.680]  and rightfully so that it was great entertainment you see this is the
[15:20.680 --> 15:25.880]  thing I've noticed is that people don't care about each other anymore and and
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.320]  it's seen as a virtue to not get involved when you see somebody have a car
[15:30.320 --> 15:33.360]  wreck a really bad car wreck and you'll watch all the other cars just keep
[15:33.360 --> 15:41.480]  driving they just keep driving and I've had to get on the radio before and I
[15:41.480 --> 15:45.000]  still pulled over and help people and it's not because I'm some hero man I
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.040]  it's an instinct I want you to pull over if I have a bad wreck but it's not
[15:50.040 --> 15:54.240]  like I even think oh consciously I better pull over because I want people to
[15:54.240 --> 15:57.760]  pull over for me it's like oh I got to help somebody but see that's because I'm
[15:57.760 --> 16:01.960]  a bad person though in the new trendy world you don't say hi to people on
[16:01.960 --> 16:05.560]  the street in the new trendy world you don't care about anybody you're real
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.840]  cynical and the more arrogant and snobby you are than the other snobs will
[16:09.840 --> 16:15.560]  think you must have something going but I've already digressed off the point is
[16:15.560 --> 16:19.480]  people individually don't even care about themselves much less others and
[16:19.480 --> 16:24.520]  then it creates a toxic environment a toxic society and we and then we've got
[16:24.520 --> 16:30.640]  Al Gore and others lecturing us all day about how it's the carbon dioxide that
[16:30.640 --> 16:36.560]  we exhale that plants then respirate from and use in photosynthesis see but
[16:36.560 --> 16:44.040]  there's a carbon cycle on terra firma third planet out from our son here in
[16:44.040 --> 16:50.080]  the boondocks of the Milky Way galaxy you have to have four things in the
[16:50.080 --> 16:56.120]  cycle here on terra firma four things first and foremost you've got to have
[16:56.120 --> 17:04.200]  water you've got to have sunlight you've got to have carbon dioxide carbon
[17:04.200 --> 17:10.720]  dioxide and oxygen now the globalists know that you know sunlight's not bad
[17:10.720 --> 17:16.080]  they got a we have a problem but they are talking about solar panel taxes now
[17:16.080 --> 17:19.320]  so don't worry that's that's that's already actually some places have
[17:19.320 --> 17:22.480]  actually started implementing taxes on the solar panels themselves which is a
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.120]  tax on the Sun so I shouldn't say it's coming it's actually here now just like
[17:27.120 --> 17:30.720]  you know meters on wells you've had for a hundred years saying you know that the
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.960]  or saying we're gonna arrest you for rainwater collection things on your
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.600]  farm and then that's now happening and they're taking people's houses when
[17:38.600 --> 17:44.640]  they don't pay the fines that's been in the news recently so they know you know
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.280]  the Sun isn't bad they know you know water well most people if you say
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.480]  should we ban a hydrogen monoxide it does sound scary actually most people do
[17:51.480 --> 17:55.120]  say ban water excuse me like sodium chloride I think they think salty well
[17:55.120 --> 17:59.520]  they don't know what that means so they just think up should we ban sodium
[17:59.520 --> 18:03.320]  chloride absolutely you know you've seen those TV shows where they've done it
[18:03.320 --> 18:07.720]  and people sit there 90 plus percent of a ban salt ban water but so I shouldn't
[18:07.720 --> 18:13.560]  but point is water doesn't sound scary sunlight doesn't sound scary oxygen we
[18:13.560 --> 18:19.400]  know we breathe that even the dumbest idiot knows that our blood when I just
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.080]  sucked air in right there you know fish sins sins water over its gills to get
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.200]  the oxygen and in gulps the primitives thought they you know drank water that's
[18:27.200 --> 18:31.880]  not what's happening there they're they're getting evil oxygen so they picked
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.880]  carbon dioxide because it sounds scary and so they're not worried about
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.560]  genetic engineering open air chemical testing biological radiological
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.640]  Hadron superconducting super colliders and other cyclotrons they're not worried
[18:46.640 --> 18:49.560]  about adding matter weapon production the Air Force admits they've successfully
[18:49.560 --> 18:53.680]  developed but the details are classified so San Francisco Chronicle don't look
[18:53.680 --> 18:59.560]  that up no no no no they're worried about something that is the lowest ever
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.480]  recorded from ice samples and mud samples going back in some cases millions
[19:04.480 --> 19:11.600]  of years it is the lowest ever recorded carbon dioxide the lowest ever recorded
[19:11.600 --> 19:17.240]  in the last hundred years we are starving for it plants grow faster live
[19:17.240 --> 19:21.000]  longer many species of plants are just dying out did you know many species of
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.120]  plants are dying primitive species that were in a more carbon dioxide rich
[19:26.120 --> 19:29.760]  environment are dying on the earth right now look it up just type primitive
[19:29.760 --> 19:36.360]  plants dying due to low carbon dioxide desertification in Africa carbon dioxide
[19:36.360 --> 19:41.080]  it's not a rain issue mainly low carbon dioxide those were plant regions as
[19:41.080 --> 19:45.320]  they've dug up the fossils of them that were in a higher carbon dioxide
[19:45.320 --> 19:49.000]  environment like the first types of plants on this planet need more carbon
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.440]  dioxide than the newer plants that can live in it so my point is is that we're
[19:55.440 --> 20:02.120]  gonna talk about real threats but first some big news coming up we have
[20:02.120 --> 20:06.000]  witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the

[24:10.040 --> 24:14.960]  okay I've been engaging in my customary rant about how the end of the world is
[24:14.960 --> 24:20.800]  not coming on December 21st 2012 it is a way to get people just to feel like
[24:20.800 --> 24:25.840]  there's no point of even being involved in the world so you'll just basically
[24:25.840 --> 24:32.800]  stand down and do what you're told they also use the rapture biblically twisted
[24:32.800 --> 24:36.560]  to get Christians to constantly think the world is ending so you won't be
[24:36.560 --> 24:40.320]  politically involved it's just amazing but we'll be covering that more as I
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.560]  said tomorrow I want to give the number out now then get into news and go to
[24:44.560 --> 24:48.840]  your calls and I will attempt to go to them and I want to open the phones up
[24:48.840 --> 24:52.800]  again for first-time callers who can't ever seem to get through on any of the
[24:52.800 --> 24:57.240]  subjects we've been talking about the unions beating people up and members of
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.320]  the legislature and in Michigan encouraging it and not getting in
[25:00.320 --> 25:05.000]  trouble where do you see that going on the ongoing globalization the
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.360]  announcements of massive tax increases regardless of whether it's the
[25:09.360 --> 25:15.080]  Republican or Democratic plan obviously we should be discussing that the
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.440]  weekly standard reports UN conference slyly introduces resolution to gain
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.640]  control of the internet in the middle of the night yeah we knew that that was
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.840]  coming because they had been saying oh no we're not going to try to take control
[25:30.840 --> 25:34.440]  the internet even though this is what Obama has been trying to do is to give
[25:34.440 --> 25:40.240]  control the internet over to the UN he signed a secret cyber order and has told
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.600]  Congress they're not allowed to see it so just amazing we're going to be getting
[25:44.600 --> 25:55.160]  into that the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 let's go
[25:55.160 --> 26:01.360]  over some of the headlines here as I mentioned UN conference slyly introduces
[26:01.360 --> 26:08.480]  resolution to gain control of internet in the middle of the night in the middle
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.760]  of the night at the UN conference in Dubai the presiding chairman of the
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.480]  international telecommunications union conference surveyed the assembled
[26:18.480 --> 26:22.200]  countries to see whether there was interest in having greater involvement
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.960]  the UN governing the internet a majority of countries gave their approval
[26:26.960 --> 26:32.600]  now let's have other countries run the internet that our country created with a
[26:32.600 --> 26:37.160]  sufficient majority supporting the UN becoming more active in controlling the
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.920]  internet the chairman put forth a resolution the chairman though insisted
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.120]  the survey was not a vote oh no the resolution was supported by Cuba
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.360]  Algeria Nigeria Saudi Arabia the United States opposed it the proposed
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.440]  resolution resolves that the secretary general the UN continue to take the
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.880]  necessary steps for the ITU to play an active and constructive role in the
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.320]  multi-stakeholder model that means globalist megacorporations of the
[27:05.320 --> 27:08.600]  internet according to the draft of the text from your stakeholder that means
[27:08.600 --> 27:13.400]  not you the general public and they are again trying to get an international
[27:13.400 --> 27:18.400]  patent treaty and and and copyright treaty through that they tried to keep
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.280]  secret this year but it came out about six months ago that even mainstream
[27:23.280 --> 27:27.760]  media called Russian or Chinese style net censorship and that's where cyber
[27:27.760 --> 27:34.040]  security is going as well they just publicly opposed the UN getting full
[27:34.040 --> 27:40.720]  control instead they're segueing it over to the UN and NATO and others so
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.880]  that's that news right there but of course the UN denied a few weeks ago
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.560]  this was happening and Politico came out and said anyone saying this is a
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.640]  conspiracy theorist of course even though they're now openly announcing
[27:52.640 --> 27:58.360]  we're under global government look at this article up at info wars.com by Mike
[27:58.360 --> 28:03.760]  Adams and it says every human emotion now classified as a mental disorder
[28:03.760 --> 28:09.360]  in new psychiatric manual DSM-5 yeah previously they said if you don't like
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.440]  authority you're mentally ill or if you feel like you can't trust government
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.000]  that's mentally ill so the founding the founding fathers were all basically
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.760]  mentally ill but continuing here the industry of modern psychiatry has
[28:25.760 --> 28:29.880]  officially gone insane well they do have the highest suicide rate out there of
[28:29.880 --> 28:34.680]  any profession and the lowest life expectancy of any of the medical core
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.760]  virtually every emotion experienced by human beings sadness grief anxiety
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.400]  frustration and patents in patients excitement is now being classified as a
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.120]  mental disorder demanding chemical treatment but prescription medications of
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.520]  course yeah and continuing here this is all part of the new freedom initiative
[28:52.520 --> 28:57.640]  or well-eanly titled that they launched in 2005 and that now is back where they
[28:57.640 --> 29:02.760]  say this was public and board members actually criticized that we're part of
[29:02.760 --> 29:08.080]  the president's commission that's why it became public that they said well the
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.200]  standards are written by big pharma that wants to make billions more and
[29:11.200 --> 29:15.160]  they're saying we're gonna go from 20% of adults and kids on psychotropic drugs
[29:15.160 --> 29:21.640]  or other and Fatima type drugs like Riedland and we want to go to 50% and
[29:21.640 --> 29:27.040]  now they're moving towards that and we're gonna go over the psychiatry Bible
[29:27.040 --> 29:30.760]  when we come back a little bit because they're expanding it but I've seen what
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.880]  they asked the kids in public school but also in college now especially if you
[29:35.880 --> 29:39.880]  get student aid they make you go in to see the shrink and they ask you feel a
[29:39.880 --> 29:44.120]  little bit of anxiety ever get a little upset ever get angry well you need
[29:44.120 --> 29:50.480]  prozac no that's mental illness yeah I asked 12 year olds we're on the March

[33:46.080 --> 33:52.120]  of previously and it's real weird like these psychologists have sent me letters
[33:52.120 --> 33:57.840]  I've been interviewed by one of the people over at psychology today in the
[33:57.840 --> 34:03.760]  big psychology magazine and then the guy said I'm mentally ill there is no
[34:03.760 --> 34:06.840]  world government I said but let me give you proof where they are announcing

[34:14.360 --> 34:18.200]  operative and worked with Al Gore and people so it's just like a joke they
[34:18.200 --> 34:23.920]  just say we're in charge and we say you're crazy we're in charge and we say
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.920]  carbon dioxide's deadly poison we're in charge and we say Obama's a peace prize
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.880]  winner and the eight countries he's bombing its peace we're in charge and
[34:33.880 --> 34:38.680]  Obama said he will not sign the NDA and he's against it of course turned out his
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.360]  lawyers wrote it he secretly pushed for it to get through then he said he
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.200]  wouldn't sign it then he did sign it and and they still go oh that's that's
[34:46.200 --> 34:52.840]  being paranoid now but he did sign it oh you're crazy you think the NSA is
[34:52.840 --> 34:56.840]  listening to you that's illegal we don't do that headlines NSA listening to
[34:56.840 --> 35:01.840]  everyone well of course we have to you're paranoid for not liking it you see
[35:01.840 --> 35:05.760]  and and and again they play this part it's role-playing they go we're in
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.120]  charge you're supposed to go oh you're in charge okay you're in charge now
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.120]  all righty that's what they do and I've had these people walk up me on the
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.320]  street and and and say you're wrong basically I'm in charge I'm in charge
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.920]  I mean I could go declare myself Queen Elizabeth and you know dress up like her
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.120]  doesn't make me Queen Elizabeth it is it is delusional these are delusional
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.840]  people who do not live in the real world and that's why psychologists and
[35:34.840 --> 35:39.160]  psychiatrists and there are some good ones out there there is some truth to
[35:39.160 --> 35:45.080]  union psychology and Sigmund Freud but it all oversimplifies it in their one
[35:45.080 --> 35:51.560]  little you know discipline which then narrowly defines things but there are
[35:51.560 --> 35:56.800]  many other disciplines out there so I'm not saying it's all a complete fraud what
[35:56.800 --> 36:01.720]  I'm saying historically is is it's used as a political tool of control and if you
[36:01.720 --> 36:05.920]  say that they go that's preposterous another you know just just proves you're
[36:05.920 --> 36:11.040]  crazy really Hitler didn't first use the psychiatrists to take over in 1933
[36:11.040 --> 36:17.640]  3435 they were the first people to kill in government institutions I mean
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.240]  anyone who knows anything about history knows that very predatory dangerous
[36:22.240 --> 36:26.120]  people work at state hospitals and work at government facilities and that the
[36:26.120 --> 36:30.080]  inmates are running the asylum and they're there because they can sexually
[36:30.080 --> 36:32.920]  abuse people they can hurt people whatever they're into
[36:32.920 --> 36:38.920]  sadomasochistic sadism torture sex stuff power trips it's these mental
[36:38.920 --> 36:43.200]  institutions and a lot of the people in the mental institutions actually have
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.160]  mercury poisoning major studies you can look them up if shown and that's all they
[36:47.160 --> 36:50.600]  needs a detox but by the time they get them drugged up it's over their lives
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.760]  over or they have brain-borne parasites there's many different types but they'll
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.720]  never even check for that parasite I've seen numbers as many as what 10% most
[37:01.720 --> 37:06.800]  studies show about 5% but as many as 10% of people with cats have a brain-borne
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.240]  parasite that makes you basically insane it's like all that old crazy cat lady
[37:11.240 --> 37:16.080]  yeah that witch she's crazy I saw her barking at the moon let's go burn her at
[37:16.080 --> 37:21.200]  stake yeah she had nine cats now you had a brain parasite but they didn't know
[37:21.200 --> 37:24.080]  that they didn't know why she was flopping around on the ground you know
[37:24.080 --> 37:27.440]  screaming ooga booga they just went and burned her at stake there because they
[37:27.440 --> 37:31.960]  were ignorant well today psychiatry the psychiatry doesn't even know about the
[37:31.960 --> 37:36.320]  brain the the different brain parasites they don't even know about heavy metal
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.080]  most psychiatrist and psychologist because I've talked to them but I've read
[37:40.080 --> 37:43.800]  articles about it they admit it when you read different psychology magazines stuff
[37:43.800 --> 37:47.960]  I read them I take them it's all about my dad used to lock me in a thing and
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.360]  torture me that's why I became a psychologist or you know I had a lot of
[37:52.360 --> 37:58.320]  mental illness in my family my my uncle thought he was st. Jerome so I became a
[37:58.320 --> 38:04.120]  psychiatrist I mean they are nuts themselves they got into it because
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.200]  they're really schizophrenics you see but they're keeping it quiet that they're
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.440]  seeing ghosts and stuff you understand and but then they can't control
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.080]  themselves at 45 and blow their brains out they're crazy people they're crazy
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.520]  people trying to cure themselves and they've got heavy metal toxicity or
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.760]  they've got brain parasites yeah I kind of just digress off of any area or
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.440]  they've got genetic disorders and there are real you know people that are
[38:32.440 --> 38:38.880]  mentally ill out there but they are now coming out and saying everything is a
[38:38.880 --> 38:45.040]  mental illness and Mike Adams breaks it down it goes on here the new upcoming
[38:45.040 --> 38:50.000]  DSM psychiatry Bible expected to be released in a few months has transformed
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.960]  itself from a medical reference manual to a testament of insanity of the
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.240]  industry itself and then we he has links to the latest releases of it mental
[38:59.240 --> 39:04.720]  disorders named in the DSM five include general anxiety disorder you know if my
[39:04.720 --> 39:08.120]  kids are misbehaving and I'm not getting stuff done I have anxiety about it and
[39:08.120 --> 39:12.760]  makes me go get stuff done well that's mental illness or GAD for short GAD
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.400]  can be diagnosed in a person who feels a little anxious doing something like say
[39:17.400 --> 39:23.080]  talking to a psychiatrist oh yeah it they tell 13-year-old girls that if they
[39:23.080 --> 39:26.880]  feel nervous around boys that's mental illness darling you need a serotonin
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.120]  reuptake inhibitor that literally eats holes in your brain thus the mere act of
[39:31.120 --> 39:36.040]  psychiatrist engaging in the possibility of making a diagnosis cause the
[39:36.040 --> 39:41.800]  symptoms of the diagnosis to magically appear this is called quack science well
[39:41.800 --> 39:45.920]  that's where psychiatrists came from was the old old people in the back of a
[39:45.920 --> 39:50.640]  wagon you know selling people laudanum or opium yet it is indicative of the
[39:50.640 --> 39:54.560]  entire industry of psychiatry which has become such a laughing stock among
[39:54.560 --> 39:57.600]  scientific circles that even the science skeptics are starting to turn their
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.240]  backs in disgust so it doesn't matter because they run the schools they run
[40:01.240 --> 40:04.400]  the systems and they make you put your kids on this doesn't matter they're in
[40:04.400 --> 40:10.280]  charge psychiatry and that's how they like it I'm in charge psychiatry is no
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.120]  more scientific than astrology or palm reading yet its practitioners call
[40:14.120 --> 40:19.480]  themselves doctors of psychiatry in order to take and try to make quackery
[40:19.480 --> 40:23.360]  sound more credible how modern psychiatry really works and then he goes
[40:23.360 --> 40:29.400]  over at all it's up at info wars dot com right now oh by the way the former DSM
[40:29.400 --> 40:36.040]  chairperson has apologized for creating false epidemics Alan Francis chaired the
[40:36.040 --> 40:42.520]  DSM for that was released in 94 he now claims it was a huge mistake that has
[40:42.520 --> 40:48.160]  resulted in mass over diagnosis of people who are actually quite normal the
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.760]  DSM for inadvertently contributed three false epidemics attention deficit
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.040]  disorder autism and childhood bipolar writes Alan in the LA Times opinion
[40:59.040 --> 41:05.520]  piece and he goes on folks my children eat pretty healthy but if they eat red
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.320]  dye one of my daughters it's always a piece of candy that has red coating a
[41:11.320 --> 41:16.280]  certain type of red dye turns into a maniac I mean if I give my children a
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.040]  coca-cola they go to a party oh let us have a coca-cola and and some you know
[41:20.040 --> 41:24.880]  yellow or pink icing cake they they they bounce off the walls for an hour
[41:24.880 --> 41:28.280]  then have black circles around their eyes and act like zombies for the next
[41:28.280 --> 41:34.160]  day I mean no kidding ladies and gentlemen I ate a chocolate bar last
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.000]  night because my wife bought some and it's just uncontrolled if she does it
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.320]  and she says we're not doing it anymore but it was these chocolate bars and I
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.960]  went Nate one number one I didn't sleep last night because the caffeine number
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.600]  two I feel like I have a hangover today from a big big big Cadbury dark chocolate
[41:50.600 --> 41:54.600]  bar I shoved down my throat but the point I ate like a pig in about three
[41:54.600 --> 42:00.360]  minutes but the point is man you don't give that to kids folks you don't give
[42:00.360 --> 42:04.760]  it to them but oh it doesn't matter let's give them let's give them aspartame
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.040]  let's give them MSG let's give them all these hundreds of additives that are
[42:10.040 --> 42:13.480]  in things I mean folks if I eat fast food now if we're on the road on a shoot
[42:13.480 --> 42:17.720]  and that's all that's there I've done this by the way in years because I would
[42:17.720 --> 42:22.120]  do it when you haven't been eating a while and feel sick an hour later like
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.520]  I had drunk a gallon of Jack Daniels the day before you're like what is in this
[42:26.520 --> 42:31.840]  McDonald's what is in this Burger King additives folks if they call them
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.120]  additives and they got them approved decades ago it's petrochemicals and
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.560]  stuff it's drugs that's why it's addictive most poisons are actually
[42:40.560 --> 42:48.360]  addictive did you know that look it up many poisons are addictive and and they
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.280]  know what they're doing it's like cigarettes hundreds of additives in the
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.560]  average top brand to make it more addictive to make it go to your brain to
[42:57.560 --> 43:02.680]  unbelievable what they do to you and it's the same type of industries and I'm
[43:02.680 --> 43:08.400]  going to your calls if you knew history folks you would know 200 years ago one of
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.000]  the biggest businesses in Europe and what is the United States and Canada
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.640]  today the US was here Canada was here already as nations Canada not Dwight it
[43:17.640 --> 43:22.800]  was I guess a British territory but the point is all of this is going on and the
[43:22.800 --> 43:28.400]  biggest business was not trapping it was not saw mills it was not
[43:28.400 --> 43:35.040]  manufacturing it was medicine men and they would go around in these big wagon
[43:35.040 --> 43:41.160]  trains shelling opium and cocaine and and every other drug you could imagine
[43:41.160 --> 43:48.120]  hallucinogens you name it they were traveling apothecaries okay you could
[43:48.120 --> 43:51.880]  walk in any drugstore by anything you wanted if you thought rhino horn would
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.200]  help you that you they'd have that an exorbitant price okay 200 years ago look
[43:56.200 --> 43:58.920]  it up it's incredible history read countless books on it can't put them
[43:58.920 --> 44:03.220]  down all the wild you know tales and reprinted newspaper articles from the
[44:03.220 --> 44:07.800]  time because you show up in town the whiskey sellers can't compete with
[44:07.800 --> 44:13.320]  somebody selling heroin wasn't heroin but what became heroin later opium when
[44:13.320 --> 44:16.240]  yeah you got a headache you got toothache drink some of this your problems are
[44:16.240 --> 44:22.000]  solved they became so wealthy the Rockefellers actually made their money
[44:22.000 --> 44:30.040]  John D the first there their daddy ran a big chain you look this up all over the
[44:30.040 --> 44:38.680]  Midwest when that was opening up and the east of wagons selling opium and that's
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.880]  who created big pharma if you track it back it's it's all these opium dealers
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.400]  and people and drug dealers they created big pharma they finance
[44:48.400 --> 44:55.040]  psychiatry they finance our whole world and then they merge with the eugenicist
[44:55.040 --> 44:59.600]  because the royalty who was inbred was like all our kids are dying those that
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.000]  do live are totally insane or mentally ill from the inbreeding like a dog will
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.040]  be you're really mentally ill so so so these crazy royals hired all these
[45:08.040 --> 45:13.520]  psychiatrists and psych warfare chiefs and eugenicists and others to try to
[45:13.520 --> 45:19.680]  cure them of all their deformities and they said well the problem is is the
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.320]  general public their disease we've got to wipe them out as if that was even
[45:23.320 --> 45:27.720]  affecting him it goes back to Malthus and the rest of it so folks that's who
[45:27.720 --> 45:35.200]  runs all this that's why it's so crazy and so deformed and so strange and then
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.120]  as society breaks down as order breaks down people are like well let's send our
[45:39.120 --> 45:44.240]  kid to the psychiatrist and they put your 12-year-old on they put 67 nationally
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.440]  to 69 depending on which year of children and foster care on multiple
[45:48.440 --> 45:53.280]  psychotropic an average of seven W.O.A. I reported it on that broke it down you
[45:53.280 --> 45:57.680]  can look it up yourself I'll go to your calls that shows you when they get you
[45:57.680 --> 46:07.520]  in there their custody two-thirds are put on drugs so so that's their goal and
[46:07.520 --> 46:13.040]  I've known people on these drugs and some people it doesn't hurt them at least
[46:13.040 --> 46:17.920]  mentally physically it does but every time I hear about a mother who drowns
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.600]  her children in the bathtub or puts them in a leg or chops their arms off of the
[46:21.600 --> 46:28.880]  meat cleaver or shoots them or puts a baby in the microwave every time it comes
[46:28.880 --> 46:33.000]  out weeks later in the defense that they were on multiple serotonin reuptake
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.360]  inhibitors and didn't know who they were because I'm sure we've all had that
[46:38.360 --> 46:42.920]  feeling like you know when some guy comes out of a store and bows up has got a
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.800]  problem bud you have an impulse is just punch him right in the throat but you
[46:46.800 --> 46:50.480]  you have impulse control and you learn how to just go no I don't have a problem
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.920]  how you doing man that's good you don't have a problem yes sir what do you mean
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.360]  smart mouth with me no sir see my problems I have to work to be like that
[47:00.360 --> 47:06.200]  that's real discipline real discipline it's a term though yes sir powerful you
[47:06.200 --> 47:09.640]  while you're just thinking you touch me I'm gonna I'm gonna absolutely break your
[47:09.640 --> 47:17.640]  neck but the point is is that is that you put people they're putting police on
[47:17.640 --> 47:21.880]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors they're putting military men on them the guy
[47:21.880 --> 47:25.240]  that killed those 18 people in Afghanistan under psychiatric care didn't
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.360]  want to go back because all his buddies being killed part of his foot was blown
[47:28.360 --> 47:33.120]  off he had a fake foot didn't want to go back for his fourth tour sergeant he
[47:33.120 --> 47:37.960]  blacked out folks he was on a psychiatric drug treatment they won't
[47:37.960 --> 47:44.160]  say what they put a trained killer who had his foot blown off fighting with a
[47:44.160 --> 47:48.800]  prosthesis and watched his buddies blown up that same day and he just he was on
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.680]  a hallucinogen folks those drugs are in the hallucinogen class and you know what
[47:52.680 --> 47:57.240]  they're gonna put that guy in jail that's how crazy psychiatry is let's go to
[47:57.240 --> 47:59.880]  your calls as promised in this segment the next and then the next and then
[47:59.880 --> 48:04.040]  playlock at five after David in Texas thanks for holding you're on the air sir
[48:04.040 --> 48:09.320]  welcome honor of my life and speaking with you no sir honor of my life go
[48:09.320 --> 48:13.600]  ahead oh you're your knowledge of history your love of history your your
[48:13.600 --> 48:18.360]  patriotism and your brilliance are coming together to really form a strong
[48:18.360 --> 48:24.240]  link that we need to the reality of what's going on my my my question is a
[48:24.240 --> 48:29.440]  little bit off your last subject it's not a question actually my personal
[48:29.440 --> 48:36.040]  theory about the nearly 200,000 rounds of ammunition that have been
[48:36.040 --> 48:40.840]  distributed to the various bureaucracies well sir it's 1.6 billion but
[48:40.840 --> 48:46.320]  yeah just it was 200 it was it was it was 200,000 of one type of sniper 308 but
[48:46.320 --> 48:52.680]  go ahead I stand corrected I knew that based on the on the standard MO of the
[48:52.680 --> 48:59.800]  New World Order blueprint for revolution we have seen them spend countless
[48:59.800 --> 49:07.800]  millions in dividing a country covertly bringing insurgency then followed by
[49:07.800 --> 49:14.520]  their arming of the rebels till the country disintegrates into chaos or
[49:14.520 --> 49:20.840]  upon they come in with the big guns and take it over and further their subversive
[49:20.840 --> 49:25.960]  groups and move them on to the next country based on that and based on the
[49:25.960 --> 49:30.080]  fact that I've been I've never heard of any of these bureaucrats being given
[49:30.080 --> 49:37.680]  training in the use of assault weapons I am convinced that these rounds are meant
[49:37.680 --> 49:44.440]  for us and that they might be possibly meant to be used by us well you know it's
[49:44.440 --> 49:49.920]  funny you say that because I've lived so close to this that I've become numb but
[49:49.920 --> 49:52.760]  I looked at that state police guy that pulled me over and I said will you put
[49:52.760 --> 49:58.240]  me and my son in a reeducation camp he started smiling like it was funny folks
[49:58.240 --> 50:01.760]  we have the army manual will you pull it up for me from two years ago where
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.880]  they're training they've hired speaking at 200,000 they're trying to hire and
[50:05.880 --> 50:11.280]  train 200,000 jail guards to be in the army now as a domestic jail guard force

[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:43.200]  anyway I'm a little nervous I haven't called on air the first time yes I was
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.960]  watching a movie that I downloaded last night and have you ever heard of Michael
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:56.880]  Rupert yes I have yeah I watched his film about his take on 9-11 it sounded
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.160]  very convincing that that's how it probably happened and he's a bit more
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:07.320]  of a pessimist he just says basically it's gonna happen get get prepared get
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.960]  ready it's gonna happen I guess I more take on his side I'm not saying that
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:19.120]  what you guys do is not helpful I think if anything you're slowing down the new
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.400]  world order crowd you're slowing them down yeah well you know my my it's an
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:29.480]  interesting fellow my issue is he thinks everything's gonna collapse because our
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.840]  world's unsustainable well the globalist are artificially collapsing it sure
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.280]  there's some problems with our industrial society and it could be clear
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.200]  and better but they're just opportunistically the globalist are
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.120]  using that as agenda 21 to implode things and so they push the whole peak
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.860]  oil thing in the rest of it while they try to shut off coal while they try to
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:54.480]  build more nuclear which is just crazy so you know that's my take on it is that
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.720]  it is globalist propaganda the whole peak oil thing that doesn't mean somebody's
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.480]  bad or somebody's an agent if they believe it it just means I disagree with
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:11.640]  them and I know where that worldview originated from and it originated from
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:17.720]  the globalist you see what I'm saying I would rather be safe than sorry and and
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.160]  I'm not I'm not a fixed income you know I can't help it I'm on disability up
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.360]  here in Canada and I'm gonna do what little I can you know incrementally
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.800]  hopefully the collapse won't happen very soon you know if it does at all I
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:38.000]  mean I just want to be ready for what if and when it happens I mean Canada's run
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.360]  by the Queen and her governor general and so other than social engineering and
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.840]  destroying the family and domesticating people Canada is probably one of the
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.600]  safer zones to be in it's an incredible police state with a velvet glove on it
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:59.240]  very authoritarian but but for the general energy units the human resource
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.640]  units and known as humans there it'll be one of the better zones the globalist
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.700]  plan civil war and mass reeducation and extermination here in the US if they
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:14.040]  get their way they're gonna send us the camps I don't even know if there are
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.720]  camps in Canada oh yeah you have emergency relocation centers that
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.960]  operates as the cover for internment facilities that's on record and there
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:28.160]  isn't you are under Northcom you are under a EU American Union bilateral 2007
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.160]  Northcom agreement so you're actually under Northcom you're in the military
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:39.920]  jurisdiction of the Saxe-Cobart-Gotha Rothschild Rockefeller Combine in an
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:46.760]  area designated as an energy sector and globalist elite retreat yeah I was
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.720]  wondering what what if the US economy does implore does implore which we do
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.960]  believe it likely will happen would be would our dollar become just as what
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:03.200]  was yours no but it will be devalued I mean and and that's a that's a
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:12.240]  probability scenario again you're fully captured and so again you you've never
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.760]  really resisted the New World Order so so you'll be you'll be murdered later the
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.200]  United States after what they're done using us as the Empire is to be
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.120]  absolutely decimated and and and then the population implanted with diseases
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:31.440]  and cancer and just slaughtered up one side and down the other I was more like
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.600]  I don't know if any of those pepper books have anything about more natural
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.480]  farming like 19th century wonderful it's wonderful and globalists are
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.840]  targeting it everywhere while saying they like out on one side of their mouth
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.840]  savagely releasing bureaucrats worldwide to attack it anyway they can they see
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.760]  any natural human activity as the enemy they want you dead after they suck the
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.120]  energy out of you they see you as a human resource energy unit we'll be back
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:05.240]  stay with us you prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if you don't

[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:27.240]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones I remember well interviewing more than a decade ago
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.840]  and so much of what he first talked about has now been documented and admitted
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:37.680]  on the subject of coconut oil helping stop or reverse Alzheimer's the statin
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.560]  drugs were attacking people's brains he developed decades ago the term
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.680]  excitotoxin which is now in the mainline literature he doesn't really toot his
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.400]  horn but he's one of the top medical advisors and writers over at newsmax.com
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:56.320]  and at least he has been in the past and he is just a trailblazer who speaks to
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.720]  giant packed houses all over the country in the world to medical doctors and he
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.840]  has just just pioneered so much of what we now know about chronic inflammation
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:12.240]  in the brain from vaccines you name it dr. Russell Blalock is a registered board
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.080]  certified neurosurgeon and a best-selling author he is a former clinical

[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:56.000]  and in the second part of the interview this hour we'll get into vaccines
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.240]  damaging the brain these low cholesterol diets what that's doing on top of the
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.520]  statins some stuff that can really help people because I'm starting to hear this
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.360]  in mainline radio mainline news and and and folks we need to appreciate trail
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.560]  blazers because I remember when he was on three and a half years ago during the
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.920]  fake H1N1 saying it's all fake it'll increase your chances of getting the
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.000]  flu it's gonna actually hurt people all of that a year later came out and
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.240]  Canadian German studies but he got attacked by the national media for
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.880]  coming on this show and for talking about it and you know the point is is
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.800]  this is a guy who full-time tries to warn people and who's going out and
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.160]  because we've sent people to interviewing me you know in big cities
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.880]  where there's you know 2,000 doctors packing the room sold out where we can't
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.240]  even get seats but we're in the back video taping it you know so we can come
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.560]  back and show it to you here on the news what he breaks down and he is one of the
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.600]  unsung revolutionaries that's going to lead the new renaissance out of this so
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.760]  when we talk about stuff for Alzheimer's this is one of the leading experts you
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.640]  better listen the medical establishment is ignorant at the low level but on top
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.400]  they the system does not want you to know about these treatments that are
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.300]  incredible so I've said that the reason I want to get him on the first part of
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.800]  the interview will show viewers if you're radio listeners this is up at
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:27.360]  info wars.com CEO sees Obama health law doubling some premiums health
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:35.680]  insurance premiums may as much as double for some small businesses etna CEO is
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.720]  saying this health insurance premiums may as much as double for some small
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.600]  businesses and individual buyers in the US when the affordable care acts major
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.440]  provisions kick in and that is what their chief executive said here's another
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.960]  one LA Times blue shield of California seeks rate hike of 20% and then
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.800]  another 20% in 2014 folks my dad manages he corrects me I said a dozen always
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.520]  just say a dozen when I know it's something like that 18 dental offices
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.080]  but he also manages a bunch of other health care stuff non-dental I'm not
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.960]  going to get into it but he's a dentist oral surgeon everything Dr. Blalock told
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.040]  us about Obamacare three years ago is exactly what my dad says but now it's
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.800]  happening up two big medical groups just are leaving the United States they're
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.240]  just shutting down in Texas they're just not going to operate now most the
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.320]  dentists he knows some of them they're 50 years old they got 20 years in them
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:35.120]  they're just retiring they're done yeah I'm gonna have dr. Blalock we have the
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.120]  floor here and tell you what this is going to do of course the government
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.080]  knows it's gonna wreck health care then they take it over the insurance
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.880]  companies wrote this it doesn't cover pre-existing all the fools that they get
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.840]  a free lunch it lets the government say through a computer what treatments you
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.600]  can give and that's why doctors are just I'm done I'm not gonna have a death
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.720]  panel that's what it is as Bill Gates said call it a death panel we need it
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.520]  it the government now runs our health care the government the IRS now gets
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.680]  your health records Nixon was gonna go to jail for having IRS records and he's
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.480]  the president now now it's just on the books that the the giant bureaucracy
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:18.120]  has it I'm gonna shut up now sir go over it all for us here and and and now
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.080]  people are seeing this wasn't rhetoric the fools out there now are gonna see a
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.480]  doubling in the next few years of their health care cost because an industry now
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.640]  can force you to buy their product dr. Blalock well you're exactly right and
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.840]  of course what people need to understand this isn't no this wasn't created
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.080]  under bomb administration this wasn't in the last ten years they have been
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:49.160]  working on this for over half a century these people have been obsessed with
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:53.680]  taking over medical care because medical care is such a huge segment of the
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:58.640]  economy it's important to control people it's important if you want to control
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.880]  populations if they want to implement their ideas which you can read about
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:13.320]  many years ago back in 1910 they were talking about controlling birth killing
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.240]  off old people because they were no longer useful to society so all this was
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.640]  in the plans and had they've been working on it all of this time now as a
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.120]  physician we saw it much earlier than everyone else because they did it
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:33.120]  incrementally and 20 30 years ago I was fighting this when I was in practice
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.880]  my fellow physicians I had more opposition from the fellow physicians
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.400]  than I did the enemies in government and other places the liberal left who
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.440]  wanted this your fellow position who was fighting you the most the reason was
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.560]  they thought well you know we're pretty smart guys and I think if we just work
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.160]  with them we just let them know that we'll help them save cost and we'll be
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:04.760]  reasonable in what we do then they're gonna come around and say okay that's
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.600]  all we wanted you to do is be reasonable I told these physician I said you don't
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.640]  understand socialism and collectivism and you haven't read these papers written
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.320]  by these designers these the elitist social engineers they don't care whether
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:25.000]  you're reasonable or not their intention is total absolute control well we've
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.560]  arrived we're here now now the purpose of doubling premiums and private
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.960]  insurance is to force you into the government total and you said that you
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.080]  said that it's meant to bankrupt the system and for those that don't know
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.040]  they're going after former state medical board doctors and people the states and
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.240]  the feds for those that don't know they're arresting and harassing doctors
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.200]  everywhere that give you the care you need when they don't follow what the
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:57.200]  computer tells them to do some of the cases are just unbelievable of the
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.840]  abuse of the physician because the physician was handed a group of rules
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.240]  when you join Medicare or Medicaid and the rules of course like all social
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.520]  assistance to draw you in it first relax they're not enforced and then once
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.040]  you're hooked then they start increasing the number of regulations the number of
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.680]  laws and then they start picking positions to make examples of well we
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.000]  reached a lot of those cases now there's a case has just recently reported in
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.680]  which a 63 year old vascular surgeon was targeted and they examined over 4,000
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.240]  of his records they found two records in which they said well you know some of
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:48.440]  your language is not proper they he left out a to to and his coding for five
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.080]  patients was challenged by the federal government now if you don't understand
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:59.720]  medical coding everything a doctor does to the the most minor procedure in the
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:07.120]  office to the most complex surgery as a CPT code the government code which has
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.040]  to do with reimbursement you're told as a physician everything you do in which you
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:18.000]  bill the government has to have a CPT code well the problem is there are tens
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.800]  of thousands of procedures for which there's no CPT code so when we asked
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.600]  well what do we do about that they said what's just coded as close as you can
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.920]  physicians took them at their word well now they decided we need some examples of
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.720]  physician abuse so they target people like this vascular surgeon they said as
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:42.440]  you've coded him properly and we're gonna put you in jail and of course he's
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:49.000]  gotten a sentence of 10 months in prison defrauding the federal government now
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.720]  did he defraud the government well this is interesting thing about the law the
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.240]  law says we don't have to show that you intended in any way to defraud the
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:04.600]  government just making an error is evidence of fraud and abuse and that's
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.760]  why all these companies are even getting out of the business now the big mega
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.520]  insiders are left alone it's the smaller and medium-sized companies can be white
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.200]  glove inspected there's no way to operate that's why these companies are
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.960]  just shutting down successful providing good care profitable they're just
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.360]  shutting down which again the socialists know that will bankrupt the whole
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.080]  system and then you'll be forced into total government control that's right
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.520]  and that's what they want you know socialism is about control people need
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.360]  to understand that all these people that are excited about socialism and
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.920]  and collectivism it's about human control you're told what to do if you
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.080]  don't and you're not obedient you're gonna be punished they make that quite
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.440]  plain and this is what the physicians are learning now I told them that 20 years
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.280]  ago they didn't believe it now they're going to prison for very long terms 10
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.680]  years 20 years ruining their life taking their license away and by the way I
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.560]  hear that exact talk for a decade you know the doctors and the companies say
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.880]  we'll just kind of work with them and be reasonable and we're sure we'll be
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:16.240]  alright no there's no way out you're being mafia taken over and they're
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.120]  targeting these people and destroying their reputations destroying their life
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:26.240]  put them in prison with common criminals and you could be killed in prison and I
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.360]  have cases of physicians in which they purposefully tried to do that they moved
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.640]  them across the country so they couldn't be near their families you know this this
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.200]  is just a stuff right out of the Soviet Union and Communist China that we're
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.960]  seeing yeah they're targeting the intelligentsia that has served the
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.920]  system so well they're now just a high-tech lynching like pullpots shot
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.400]  people with glasses who can read here they just take your license and put you
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.720]  in jail we'll be back with dr. Blalock on the other side to break down the

[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:18.920]  we are back alive ladies and gentlemen retired brain surgeon by selling
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.800]  author dr. Russell Blalock is our guest for the balance of the hour that will be
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:28.400]  news and calls in the third hour coming up now again a lot of doctors say well
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.800]  I can't even make money doing this it's too dangerous I'm out of health care well
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.800]  you predicted that that's the plan bankrupted but and it takes a huge
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.360]  majority now to overturn Obamacare really banker care globalist eugenics care
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:47.320]  what do you now predict dr. Blalock is going to happen as people learn as
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.880]  Bill Gates has laughed we may play that clip later that yeah death panels are
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.400]  good name well now we see the social engineering well if we're all
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.160]  collectivized the government's going to say what you eat and where you go and
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.200]  what you do and what surgeries you get and guess what that's what they've
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.720]  already done in England where you wait what 18 months on average for brain
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.800]  surgeries that you need to get it quickly or you're going to die and I've
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.400]  watched the House of Commons debates I haven't how are they going to sell this
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.000]  and keep this in place when it wrecks everything well the idea is every
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.120]  failure is going to be because of sabotage if you look at the Soviet system
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.720]  and all the communist socialist systems they do the same thing when they start
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.720]  to fail it's not their fault it's because people were sabotaging it the
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.800]  doctors weren't playing fair the doctors were cheating the patients weren't
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.120]  doing the right so they just throw more money at it they increased the
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.360]  regulations the control and so the answer is always the problem is we don't
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.560]  have enough control of all the variables which means oppression we have to
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:57.360]  oppress the public and the providers and the whole medical care system and then
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.520]  it'll work and once people take this bitter medicine they realize gee now
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.920]  we've arrived at the utopia you know as I tell people collectivism and
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:13.040]  socialism depends on what's called the big lie you paint this illusion of this
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.880]  utopia that's coming and you tell people just keep your eye on the painting on the
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.800]  mural don't pay attention to reality they're never allowed to look at reality
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.560]  and every time they do they say just just look back at the mural look look
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.040]  what's coming if you just do what you're told so people get on board and every
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.000]  communist country every communist that's escaped it said the same thing they were
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.200]  all true believers in the beginning and very very quickly they understood that
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.840]  we're being deceived we're being lied to we're being led and regimented and
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.600]  controlled and that's what this is all about so of course there's going to be
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.480]  devastation there's going to be death there's going to be people dying there's
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.240]  going to be care denied but they'll say oh this this is just the the painful
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:06.720]  growth pains this is the birth pains as of the coming utopia once we fared all
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.680]  this out it's going to be great and of course all this pain is because of the
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.280]  previous system you know it's just like they always blame bush or they blame
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.720]  somebody else for every system that happens a disaster in this administration
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.440]  is due to the previous administration and so the fact that capitalism existed
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:31.520]  for so long and private property and this excessive freedom that's why we're
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.880]  having to go through these terrible birth pain so they're going to justify ever
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:41.680]  failure just to show how idiotic this thing is there's a law that says if a
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:49.080]  physician charges the taxpayer too little money he is guilty of a crime now
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:53.360]  this is unbelievable the whole idea these doctors going to prison is that
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:59.680]  they were defrauding the taxpayer well here if you actually are saving the
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:05.280]  taxpayer money by undercoding that is coding for a less expensive procedure
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:11.440]  you're also guilty of the kind of crime just the same as if you overcharge the
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.520]  government and for those that don't know that's the age old thing where doctors
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.560]  and the Hippocratic oath Ron Paul's talked about it here on the show a
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.360]  medical doctor that you were told going to medical school you should do about a
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:27.960]  third of your work a discounted or for free on a case-by-case example and if
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:33.960]  it's some equipment or prosthesis or things you should approach a charity to
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.600]  come in and pay for it because this is a sacred honor to be a physician will you
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:42.400]  explain to them the old system and why Ron Paul pointed out nobody ever went
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.880]  without health care citizens just didn't know about it the illegal aliens all
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:52.880]  know about it well when I was in Madison you know for 40 years counting my
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:58.360]  residency we gave away millions of dollars of free care I got up in the
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.920]  middle of the night and operated all night long on people who were indigent
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.960]  or for whatever reason they didn't have money and we didn't charge them anything
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:12.760]  every Christmas we would go through our bills and we would find elderly people
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:16.720]  who were trying to pay their bills off a little bit at a time we would cancel
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:23.480]  their bills we used to give insurance only we would tell patients if they had
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.320]  difficulty paying the charge out of pocket we would say well we'll just
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.400]  accept it stay there let's explain what the old good medicine was that's now
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.040]  been taken over the last 30 years now converting to pure eugenics based death
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:43.560]  medicine death panels they now brag the government runs your medicine unbelievable

[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.920]  i got a star on my car and one on my chest a gun on my hip and the right to
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:17.000]  rest i'm a guy who's a boss on this highway
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.040]  so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.560]  if you break the law you'll hear from me i know i'm
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:28.040]  worrying for the state i'm a highway patrol you know it really hit me yesterday
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.000]  when i got pulled over for reportedly going eight miles over the speed limit
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.600]  i'm gonna challenge the ticket of course it's all fraud anyways
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:40.600]  and the guys said shine here and i didn't have my latest insurance card
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:43.800]  even though their computer showed i had insurance they gave me a ticket for that
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.360]  too and i was just thinking you know they make
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:51.960]  you buy car insurance but then they let the illegal aliens be exempt
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.640]  and it just really hit me that now i've got to go buy
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.320]  healthcare even though i already have insurance and now
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.080]  obviously it's written by the insurance companies it's going to go up in price
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.960]  and they get to charge you more for less procedures and also make sure the
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.760]  doctors and the medical facility get less of that money
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:13.400]  so you know they might charge you a million bucks pretty soon to put a

[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.040]  planet dot tv okay dr blotlock this is a long
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.080]  segment i want to try to shut up and give you the floor here
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.800]  you know for some large spaces to finish up where you see we're going and ways to
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.960]  hopefully reverse obama care because they lied and said it will not
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.600]  increase premiums obviously it would immediately
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.000]  because it was written by the insurance companies uh and where you see all this
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.760]  going ways to fight it and then i want to segue into
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:25.080]  suddenly abc news cbn you name it about coconut oil that you wrote about i don't
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:29.480]  know 20 years ago or whatever and and and other types of good fats
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.800]  and what they're doing for the brains and you know the fact that so many of
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:39.720]  these disorders we see are really just nutrient deficiencies and
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.240]  some of that information because it's something that people can really do
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:50.120]  right now uh yeah go back to the obama care
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.120]  what's coming uh you know the the interesting thing when i first read
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.160]  through the obama care thing that struck me is that
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:03.560]  it really says specifically very little what it does is it refers to
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.320]  literally tens of thousands of other federal documents rules and
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:13.400]  regulation and it leads a lot to arbitrary change
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:18.280]  after the law is enacted now what's coming is and you got to remember when
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:24.120]  hillary first tried to create this system uh when her husband was the president
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:30.360]  she met with all the major pharmaceutical c e o in secret because they
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:35.320]  were going to make a killing out of uh nationalizing healthcare because they
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.640]  would be the sole supplier of all medicines all over the united
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.280]  states no one else could would be allowed uh to supply these medications
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.680]  that would get rid of their competition the same thing holds here
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.160]  and what we're going to see is that the manufacturers of vaccines that have
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:56.600]  been anointed that were anointed during the h1n1
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.120]  are going to be told uh are going to tell the public
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:06.120]  in order to receive this care you have to have all your vaccinations up to date
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.080]  by the way they're already doing that as you know with medical workers anybody
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.280]  that goes to the hospital but they're already saying if you want your
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.440]  welfare check you've got to get all the shots so this is forced government
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.160]  uh medicine medical training exactly and it's all designed
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.480]  to control people so if you go to your doctor for
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:31.400]  uh say a uh a carpal tunnel problem uh you're going to be told well we looked
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.800]  at your record and you haven't had your meningococcal vaccine this year
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.840]  so you're going to have to get it or you can't be treated
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:42.600]  so everyone now is going to be forced vaccinated
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.040]  the the companies like merc and novartis are going to make
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.600]  fortunes if you're vaccinating every human being
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.400]  in the united states and eventually they plan for the entire world unbelievable
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.880]  uh they'll be told what you can eat what you cannot eat
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.720]  you'll be told when to exercise how much exercise to do
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.560]  uh you're going to be told you have to take statins you have to take
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:11.400]  anti-hypertensive medications the children will be placed on these
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.120]  medications this is already being discussed
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.880]  they were even talking about putting these medications in the water supply
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:21.880]  to force everyone to be on these medications whether they wanted to or
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:24.120]  not and by the way as you're talking i just can't
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.960]  help it bud and everything you're talking about is already being phased in
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.480]  with the mayor of new york saying what you can drink what you can eat
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.320]  with with michelle obama my kids were going to private school part time
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.520]  uh and even this christian school two days a week
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.080]  as an academy for homeschoolers it was big they were accredited so
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.040]  they had to do workbooks on michelle obama telling them
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.960]  what was healthy but she doesn't tell you gmo or aspartame is bad
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:54.120]  or msg she tells you you get 850 calories a day
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.160]  and the kids are literally starving i'm sorry it's just it's just they're now
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.840]  doing forced inoculations in california without parental consent
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.480]  everything you're saying is already starting yeah well they have a very
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.520]  incremental program to get the public used to it
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.040]  and they've done an incredible brainwashing
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:17.000]  of the public on the necessity of vaccination for herd immunity her
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.440]  immunity is a complete fraud and i've proved it no one's challenged it
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:25.880]  uh so what they're doing they're building the case
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.720]  that for the public health we have to force people
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.120]  to receive all of these vaccines well it's been shown they have over 125
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.280]  vaccines that they're planning to make mandatory
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:43.480]  this is huge profits for these companies and it's going to destroy the health
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.600]  of tens of millions of americans uh and as you get older and you get these
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.680]  vaccines and your health begins to rapidly deteriorate
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:56.600]  guess what you're not going to be allowed to get health care that you think
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:00.040]  you're going to get because you're going to be on the list of people that's too
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.480]  old to get these these procedures done uh so you're going to be left to die
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:10.040]  there's your death panels now all of this has been talked about on the
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.040]  the health care sites and these tax-free foundations
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:18.360]  for almost half a century people just have not been reading it they're not
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.800]  paying attention you've brought up so many of these
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.400]  things to the public you read these documents you dig
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.720]  these things out but unfortunately it sounds so
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:37.960]  outlandish and crazy and conspiratorial people just can't bring themselves to
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:42.680]  believe it and it's like c.s. Lewis uh and in his book the screw
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.560]  tape letters he said the devil's greatest weapon
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.720]  is that people don't believe in it well the collectiveness and the socialist and
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.840]  the communist greatest weapon is that you don't believe they're going to do
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.200]  these nefarious things well yeah they now laugh and say there's no
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.880]  such thing as socialism or communism anymore even though it's taking over
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.600]  the whole planet well what they do is they do wordplay
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.560]  they said this is not socialism well and a and a technical
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.040]  uh definition and previous definitions of socialism it's not
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.840]  because socialism is the nationalization of all businesses and industry
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.520]  the new socialism which was antonio grancy's
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.560]  idea uh and late and later uh Saul Alinsky's
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.720]  popularized it was that we don't actually take over the company
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:35.880]  we just regulate it and we regulate how much it produces how much it plays as
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.920]  employees uh what is their work hours what are the
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:42.040]  exactly the communists can't ever run anything but a death can
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.120]  so they just sit back and you run your operation and they siphon it off and
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.000]  tell you what to do that's exactly right that's what
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.360]  national socialism was that's what fascism and italy was
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.560]  and that's what we have today what's called corporatism
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:58.520]  now if you look back in the history of collectivism
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.520]  it was based on the corporate model they love the corporation because the
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.040]  corporation has an elite board that makes all the decision
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.960]  regiments all of its employees controls all the systems and
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:14.040]  everything within the corporation and they said what we need to do is produce
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.880]  a corporate america and then a corporate world
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:22.840]  and which a giant corporation rules everything everybody thinks this is
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.800]  government taking over corporations no it's just the
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.680]  opposite it's corporations taking over the government
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.800]  because what you have is council and foreign relations look at the list of
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.720]  people in council and foreign relations it's the ceo's and directors of
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.280]  every major uh corporation in the united states look at the
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.120]  trilateral commission same thing all the major international
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.960]  corporations in financial houses look at bill de berger
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.200]  same list same people uh and it's all corporate
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.160]  now the dream of the rockefellows was that we would create a corporate control
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.840]  of the united states they look at government they said government's
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.960]  inefficient and this is the whole essence of
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.680]  collectivism is efficiency well efficiency means making people do
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.640]  what they don't want to do taking their freedom away
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:17.240]  we know best as an elite they say uh what you need to do where you need to be
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.520]  where you need to live what your occupation should be what you should
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.120]  eat when you should die if you should live
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:29.400]  this is what socialism collectivism is and as you if you pay close attention to
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.120]  what they're saying that's what they're telling you
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.280]  we're the smart people we know how to engineer society
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.400]  society's chaotic under capitalism and freedom
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.400]  we can't stand this chaos anymore we need to have
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:49.480]  social engineering and social control and that's what all of this is about
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:53.240]  how do we fight it how do we resist them i mean one thing is i'm trying to
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.360]  exercise more i'd become a workaholic and gained a
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:00.280]  lot of weight and gotten unhealthy i'm i'm reversing that by the grace of god
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.440]  uh i mean i guess we we get healthy and we exercise and we really get the
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.600]  proper nutrition understanding that there's not going to be a
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.800]  medical system to go to soon and this isn't a joke i mean
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.520]  paul watson's worked for me 10 years this uh this year it's 10 years
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.120]  great shape jogs you know three percent body fat
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.440]  uh lives in england uh writing you know for us
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:30.920]  and i told you the the story last time you were on doc for a month
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.520]  uh he he had some type of strep and cold
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.000]  couldn't get over it had been into the doctor waited two weeks to get in
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.400]  i couldn't imagine having to wait two weeks the few times i've really had to
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:44.920]  go i mean i'm like get me in there now when you're coughing up blood
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:49.800]  uh i mean it was rough and then two weeks into it he finally got in and they
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.240]  gave him a little pack with some aspirin and some ad vil and some
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:57.480]  Tylenol and some lozenges and and some you know
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:01.000]  Kleenex and stuff and you said i guess in the military that's what you gave
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.080]  you i got a lot of emails about that that's what they say they give you the
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:06.200]  military there wasn't like when i go to a private clinic
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:09.960]  boom i'm in in 20 minutes they swab the throat they say we'll call you in two
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.880]  hours and tell you what the prescription is
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.080]  because if it's bacterial or viral they got to find out
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.960]  you know these quack doctors you go to them they just give you antibiotics don't
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.280]  even check but you know the Kleenex places i go they do i couldn't imagine
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.240]  that and then i said why don't you go to private doctors i said i know you
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.680]  have those he goes listen alex you've got to get permission
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.920]  from the government clinic to then go to the private physician
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.440]  i mean this is total control i'm sorry to tell that story again but
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.560]  this is the this is total tyranny well as an example of the regimentation
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.960]  uh you're not an individual the enemy of collectivism is the individual
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.240]  you read all of the literature on the philosophy of of this
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.640]  socialism communism marxism lindonism fascism national socialism
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.000]  it's always the same the enemy is the individual
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.840]  they don't recognize individual they recognize collectives you're a number
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.120]  you're a social security number you're some other kind of number
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:08.600]  and if we have to deny you care or if you die waiting for care
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:12.600]  it's no big deal you were just a number and people
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.720]  are not used to that in the united states you know as a christian we recognize
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.280]  individuals god recognizes individuals and you know
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.040]  you say what can we do well number one we've got to restrink in our faith
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:31.080]  they have spent enormous efforts to convince people there's no god
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:37.000]  that jesus is not the son of god and so uh they've destroyed the faith base
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.120]  of our of the foundation of our country we need to reestablish that number one
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:45.720]  about over everything else we can improve our health
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.240]  so that if we are forcibly vaccinated we're not likely
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.800]  to have the devastating reactions to these vaccines
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:59.080]  we know how to do that now we know how to improve health of the elderly so that
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.960]  they don't get sick they they are seriously ill like they do now
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.520]  many of the neurodegenerative diseases can be prevented by proper exercise
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.440]  and use of nutrients and diet the other thing that we can do is
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:18.040]  nullification that is the most important weapon we have left
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:22.520]  the vote has been taken away by voter fraud so
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.280]  no matter how you vote they're going to change the machine
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.240]  change the vote get people in that are illegal to vote
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:34.920]  etc so what the states have left is the state can nullify laws by passing its
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.600]  own state laws and if you're in a court if you're
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:42.280]  on a jury and it's a federal case they an irs case
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:46.520]  against a citizen or an epa case or one of these medical cases and you're on
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:49.800]  the jury you can nullify it by voting not guilty no
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:54.120]  matter what the evidence shows that's that is the law of the land of the
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.200]  constitution and this was established in the beginning of the united states
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.200]  because the courts had judges that were british
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:05.400]  and american juries you know god bless you i don't know if you heard this a
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.440]  month ago but it made national news i've called for the second american
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.360]  revolution to use the declaration of independence not create a new country
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.720]  but to remove the globalist and reinstate the republic
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:20.440]  it's an instant download re upload and what you're saying is so true there's
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:24.280]  election fraud obama didn't really win i'm not saying romney was good either he
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.880]  wrote obama care for the globalist the point is it was all fixed
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.400]  only admitting that we're under real authoritarianism
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.400]  that now plans to mop us up only admitting how much trouble we're in
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.600]  will beat them the minute we understand they're lying criminal
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:42.200]  authoritarians hell bent on on on enslaving us
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.160]  we turn the tide do you agree with that statement dr blalock
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.080]  exactly you can't compromise with evil these are evil people they have evil
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.560]  intention so this this nonsense of the republican party saying oh well our
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:57.400]  problem is we have too many conservatives oh you're defending god bless

[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:12.200]  we've got two short segments left with Dr. Blalock and then we're going to go to
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.600]  your phone calls those of you patiently holding and then into all the other
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:20.760]  news I haven't gotten to yet but Harry Belafonte went on Al
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.000]  Sharpton's show and said we should quote just lock people up we should just
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.800]  round up the Republicans and like third world dictators do and quote throw
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.080]  them in jail and that's exactly what the weatherman
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.640]  came out in federal court we're planning to do the people that advise
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:39.480]  Obama you see I've studied these people and just like Dr.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.840]  Blalock was just saying this stuff all sounds crazy
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:47.480]  it's because truth is strange with the fiction and the very same crews
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.840]  and the sciences that the Nazis and the Soviets and the Malish use
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:54.360]  are now being used here I've talked to so many former Eastern Europeans
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:59.240]  who are successful businessmen and women who fled here in the 70s and 80s
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.760]  and they are so freaked out they're scared for America
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:06.600]  because they they say I have seen this I have heard this this is a
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:10.920]  this is a blueprint and exactly what Dr. Blalock said folks we've got to
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:15.000]  really understand this is war this isn't just some boss hog corruption taken
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.520]  over these are vicious control freaks anything else on that subject Dr.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.440]  Blalock and then some basic facts on why do you think it's starting to come out
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.640]  that so many of the Alzheimer problems are the statin drugs and the lack of
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:32.120]  good oils well yeah you know the
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.560]  Herobelophonies and these people making these statements
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.040]  they've been empowered by the rise of the left
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.880]  the left is seeing and flexing its muscles because they're seeing that
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:47.640]  they're they're winning essentially and they're winning
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:54.600]  by stealing elections now what we need to do is as I say use the power of
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.960]  nullification on juries you could protect
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.800]  your fellow citizen against these abuses by the federal government
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:08.600]  just serve on a jury now the judge cannot direct you how to vote
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:11.640]  people should get intimidated because they said well the judge gave us
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.440]  instructions well he can instruct all day long so jury
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:17.800]  nullification elaborating on that the point you made before the break though
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:20.040]  and then we'll get into the other issue briefly here
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.800]  when you you know talk about republicans that that is waving the white flag
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.240]  when they were always part of the establishment to say we need to accept
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:29.720]  socialism and you know glenn bet comes out and
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.760]  says we need to push you know basically gay marriage or whatever
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:36.440]  because you know we need to be like the democrats that's how we'll win
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:40.280]  that's all football issues anyways my point is that's a that's a total
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:43.560]  capitulation and and the left says oh great look we're
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:46.840]  totally taking over they're going to give in to us
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.520]  well yes and then and once you yield in one area they'll just force you to yield
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.560]  in another i mean all they have to do is make something else unpopular
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:57.320]  they have to make the fact that you you want to own property unpopular
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.160]  make the fact that you want to own a gun and protect your family unpopular
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.360]  make the fact that you want to choose your own food and grow a garden in your
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:07.640]  yard unpopular and then with each case we're going to
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:12.360]  compromise what we've seen over the last 75 years is we're always
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.040]  compromising towards the left there's never a compromise
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.840]  toward the right we always to the left now those of us that are a lot older
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:25.240]  what we know is that if you look back in 1950s
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:29.160]  when i was growing up if any of these things were even discussed back then
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.440]  people would laugh at you and say there's no way the american people
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:37.560]  would allow that you got to be crazy so if you go back in time in a time capsule
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:42.200]  they would laugh you out of the room and now the official army manuals
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.720]  as we pull those up i want to give the number say they're now preparing quote
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:50.680]  reeducation centers doctor they even use the soviet term
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:55.560]  oh exactly that this is what's so shocking is they even use the terminology
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.040]  that's used by kgb and the chica from the soviet union
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.080]  uh they don't even have any qualms about using this terminology now because
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:09.720]  they feel well we've won there's nothing they can do they've lost the battle
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:12.840]  and we're going to implement our programs against their will that
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.320]  this government today is using executive
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:22.120]  power more than any president has ever dreamed of even fb r

[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.560]  Alex Jones
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:35.400]  it's army manual FM 3-3 9.40 reeducation camps now being established for
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:38.680]  political dissidents in the united states and what do the manuals say the
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:42.040]  political dissidents are gun owners conservatives libertarians
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.920]  christians who believe in the second coming of christ
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:48.040]  uh number one enemy returning veterans anybody they think will fight their
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.640]  armed takeover and uh they're just getting rid of the
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:55.160]  good cops and police and military that know the truth and creating a
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.000]  cadre dr. blalock enclosing on that subject though
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.240]  the soviet union you know before another czars was already a police state
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:06.600]  they didn't have guns nazi germany people are pretty compliant
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:09.560]  in the weimar republic i don't see them fully
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:13.400]  being successful here if it wasn't for our moral decay
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:17.160]  and i'm not on some high horse but like ron paul said the general public
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:20.760]  really are demonic slobs now in this country but that doesn't mean that a
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:26.280]  large minority of us are still going to go quietly into the soviet night
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:30.280]  well uh you know your your moral strength
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.000]  is the is the only protection you have once a country loses its moral strength
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.880]  then you'll compromise with anything you just say well
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:42.120]  uh in order to feed my family i'll i'll go ahead and do this and if
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:46.120]  if they want me to round up people and help them do that or spy on my neighbors
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:49.000]  i'll do that whatever it takes because you have no moral
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.800]  values anymore uh you're into this relativism and you're really stupid and
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.160]  don't know that you always end up getting rounded up later yourself
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:00.200]  and you're going to be targeted because they can't trust you this is one of the
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:05.160]  things you learn if you read the history of the soviet union in china and cuba
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:08.760]  is they kill their own because they can't trust them
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:12.200]  uh kastro killed his best friend because he couldn't trust him
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:17.960]  uh you know a friend of mine denise cutty has written some of the best books
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.640]  uh digging into the the history of all of this
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:26.280]  i would urge your readers to to look up denise cutty on amazon yeah let's get
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.000]  dr cutty back on we only got two minutes left dog you got to come back
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.040]  soon i know you're a busy man briefly the coconut oil thing
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.280]  that's finally starting to break uh what does coconut oil do with all timers
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:39.240]  but some of the other oils and what and what does statins do to your brain
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:45.000]  well coconut oil contains a very high level what's called medium chain triglyceride
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.040]  it's one of the few fuels that the brain can use other than glucose sugar
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:53.800]  we think that what happens in alzheimer's disease is the brain is no longer
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.920]  able to utilize sugar efficiently and so the brain goes into
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:03.640]  periods of hypoglycemia and you become confused it's oriented to lose memory
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:07.080]  if that keeps up it triggers excitotoxicity in the brain
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.160]  it starts destroying these connections well what the coconut oil does
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:15.800]  it reduces brain inflammation which is a major part of all of this process
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.200]  reduces excitotoxicity calms those microglia down
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:23.640]  and it surprises a fuel to the brain so the brain
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.440]  can operate efficiently and will not be producing these huge storms of free
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:31.160]  radicals that occur when it's starving so
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:35.960]  what we see is is that the coconut oil is doing so many things to correct
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.640]  what we know is impaired in the alzheimer's brain but medical
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.640]  doctors won't tell their patients to take it well they don't know about it
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:47.240]  they won't read the literature you know they they wait to be told what
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:51.720]  drug to use they're all waiting for the drug that cures alzheimer
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:55.000]  it really is the intellectual laziness is what's killing us it's not that
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.720]  people aren't smart they're lazy well that the government has them so busy
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.760]  trying to protect themselves they're so busy
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.480]  filling out forms and reading manuals and cpt codes and
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:12.200]  that they don't have time to actually go on and research and they're exhausted
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.960]  at the end of the day after dealing with the bureaucracy all day long
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.560]  uh well that's the truth yeah that's the big difference
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.880]  uh these are not minor things and if you look into the research of alzheimer's
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:28.120]  disease these are the hottest areas of research in the
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.280]  sciences are most excited about it's things like the coconut oil
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:35.240]  debbie you talked about this for you weren't you were one of the first
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:38.920]  weren't you well uh a friend of mine bruce five
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.520]  wrote a book on it and i wrote the forward to his book
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:45.960]  but this is his book is one of the best on this well

[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.440]  i was just reading the london guardian about innocent terror suspects being
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:28.840]  tortured for long periods of time and then raped you see the people that like
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:32.920]  to work at black sites nothing to do with black people folks
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.320]  i mean secret ghost sites secret torture facilities
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:44.280]  at horse stables in romania and underground facilities in london
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:51.320]  and facilities in texas and facilities inside camp x-ray
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:56.440]  in guantanamo bay they like to hurt people
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:01.000]  that's how you end up getting a job as a torture
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:08.440]  and as part of the pay for the torturers they get to hurt and kill little kids
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.800]  guys i'm sure you printed it off but i couldn't find it my stack we printed
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:15.560]  that london guardian article we got linked at infowarstore.com the one about
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:21.160]  sexual torture of the people the stuff they admit they do at these camps i
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.600]  can't even say on air it involves blood it involves satanism
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:30.920]  and when they got caught flying in prostitutes to do
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:35.080]  rituals at camp x-ray this is like eight years ago this came out
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:39.320]  when they got caught it came out some people the camp told congressman i
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.080]  didn't like it they said well it freaks out the muslims
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:48.440]  when we bring the prostitutes in and do this no the truth is you like to get
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.800]  them and have satanic rituals
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.080]  truth is you're devil worshipers
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:00.360]  you see this is all their cover to do this type of stuff so
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:03.240]  i was just looking at that article up at info wars.com i could see it up there
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:06.520]  on screen we came in from break and i was reading it earlier this morning i
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:12.120]  mean it's just unbelievable and they every camp where we get news
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:15.320]  they're torturing people's lives and kids in front of them and then you see
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.320]  jack bowler on shows like 24 where they torture somebody's kid and it stops the
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:23.560]  the nuke going off in LA and all this these sickos sit there watching this
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.080]  snuff film porn all these wimps and all these
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:30.760]  nobodies at homeland security had this a few years ago had this big
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:34.440]  you know ending of 24 party and churnoff was there
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:40.920]  admitting that 24 made them look good and i mean all they are is a bunch of sickos
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:45.160]  and it comes out everywhere who's the democratic congressman
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.960]  it was in the associated press it came out after the show yesterday was up on
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:52.200]  drudge you guys repull that from yesterday's stack for me
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.480]  who had the illegal alien working for him who was a convicted sex offender
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.840]  well of course i mean what do you think is going on up there they're chasing
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:05.400]  their 14 year old pages around they've got illegal alien sex offenders working
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:08.840]  for them it's a folks i've been to dc many times

[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:47.640]  putting up with anything not me individually but as an american i'm
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:53.560]  seen as dinner by government and uh government wants you to
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:57.160]  fear it government struts around their authorities
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.840]  their officials they're not servants
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:07.560]  does that mean everybody in government is a bad person no
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:14.360]  but the the system is predatory now and anyone who's historically
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.480]  intellectual and really knows what's going on
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:20.680]  understands the government's illegitimate you heard dr blalock he is an
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.960]  esteemed best-selling author researcher i'd have him on 10 12 years ago he
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:27.720]  didn't sound like that now he's saying the government's
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:31.800]  illegitimate we're in deep trouble they're going to put us in re-education
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.840]  camps folks folks we've studied history that they're
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:39.480]  bragging about it i mean 15 years ago i'd be in an
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.240]  event fighting for some farmer having their land taken
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:46.200]  i handsome saw stuff like this my camera guy with me people walk over when your
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.080]  camera's off they go listen when we take over we're going to put you in a camp
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:51.960]  working to death we're going to kill you the first time it happened i thought
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:56.680]  that's a weirdo every time i'm at a smart growth
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:01.080]  conference or i'm at an event and liberals because they're not liberals
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:04.200]  come over they tell me they're going to kill me
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.880]  and now harry balafonte says throw people that don't agree with obama
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:14.200]  in gulags played that clip earlier and when you've had them look you dead in
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:19.240]  the eye and go we're going to kill you and you're like
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.600]  and the cops back them up
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:26.040]  i mean these people
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:29.640]  think they're sexy revolutionaries and they're dirtbags
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:33.400]  working for foreign banks that have conquered this country
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:37.080]  and they want they're such cowards they want the power of the government
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.960]  behind them when they go around abusing people and i got news for you
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:45.720]  you're not going to take this country without a fight you dirtbag scum you
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:52.280]  collectivist parasite filth you deindustrialize this country so you'd make
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.280]  people come to you i don't blame people who are on food
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:59.000]  stamps or welfare they have shut the economy down in many respects
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.920]  there are some bad examples of people that abuse it
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:08.280]  but they've done this show that people don't have a choice but to serve the
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:13.000]  system and the answer is what do they target they
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.360]  target real rural communities with co-ops
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.400]  the globalists always claim they're creating co-ops but their counterfeits of
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:23.560]  the real community co-ops real sustainability the answer is go to
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:26.600]  your own wind power and solar and your own community
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.360]  and get out of the system and buy american as much as you can
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:35.000]  and do everything you can to discredit and talk down the government because
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.320]  it's not real it's illegitimate it's an occupying force
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:42.840]  and when bureaucrats of the system get in your face
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.360]  you know say hey i'm not your slave you really like where things are going you
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.040]  really think you're going to have a future with this
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.200]  and and and and and and support people in the system
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:57.960]  that do the right thing and i saw an article and you guys are the best
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.000]  i'll put it back up on screen for me if you can find it i had it meant to
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.240]  cover it where the cop gave the guy a hundred dollar speeding ticket
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:08.520]  and it was only a few miles of the speed limit and the cop said well look i'm on
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:10.920]  camera because that's how it is now that i have no
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:14.600]  you know no no discretion that that's how they phased it in i'm gonna have to
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:18.360]  give you this ticket the guy's like i'm totally broke i'm going bankrupt
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:24.120]  and the cop put a hundred dollar bill in to the ticket
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:28.200]  but the point is is that the globalist no amount of kindness like that will
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:31.160]  reverse it they'll actuary it out with computers it's
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:35.880]  meant to bankrupt it's yeah plaino texas police officer wraps hundred dollar
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:40.280]  bill in traffic ticket but the point is what do you do
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.400]  when you pull over the woman with five screaming kids in the back with snot
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:46.280]  running down their nose and you can tell the woman's working two
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:49.000]  jobs and the guy that got her pregnant ran off a long time ago
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.200]  you're gonna write that woman a ticket yeah you do because now more and more
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:54.920]  they're telling cops you're right people take it no matter what
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:58.600]  even the corrupt new york police have come out and had op-ed
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.840]  articles you know in the newspaper saying we're being ordered
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:07.000]  because they have the cases of the pregnant woman that sat on the bench
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.800]  for five minutes too long because you're only allowed to sit on the other bench
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:15.000]  for 10 minutes or whatever or the uh the uh the i mean i mean
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.720]  they're giving people tickets in new york because their windows are still
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:21.640]  knocked out from the hurricane
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:27.800]  the code enforcers are it's it's the the system has totally lost its soul
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:31.080]  because it's designed to the globalist want ruthless
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:39.320]  enforcers in place so it's going to take just generally
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.240]  generally across the nation a spirit of not going along
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:47.080]  to bring this down because let me tell you if the police raised a trillion
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:49.960]  dollars hypothetically you know that's a huge number
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.480]  off the public the globalist would steal it in five seconds
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:57.560]  they've designed it they they have unlimited money zeros and ones
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:02.120]  the megabanks you understand that they play the monopoly game to get your
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:04.760]  property and to get you under their control
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:07.800]  and to get you bankrupted under government control so they can pump
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:10.520]  vaccines full of cancer viruses into you to kill you
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:13.640]  they're now announcing under obama care in the next phase they're going to make
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:16.520]  you take all the shots like dr blalock was saying we're going to go to break and
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:19.080]  i promise go to bill in north carolina be ready bill
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.520]  very patiently holding then bob in michigan uh then william in new york
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.720]  nathan and angel and others eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:30.280]  we're going to go to your calls right when we come back from break for the
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.480]  balance of the show with a few news items
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:36.600]  it's just that you have to understand they tell the bureaucrats and people
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:39.320]  this is how they raised the rates started restricting the national parks
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:42.680]  15 years ago 16 years ago they came out and they said
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:45.800]  we're going to shut most the national parks we're going to fire the park
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:49.000]  rangers and we're going to do this and that so everybody's scared oh never
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.960]  mind we'll just double the rates and shut down parts of the parks
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:55.240]  and do all this okay we'll do it we'll do it we'll do it you see that's how they
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:59.720]  by controlling the resources they do this and they tell the police because i've
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:03.160]  talked to countless police it's come out the news who are in these briefings
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.760]  we've got to you know get the revenue up and plus you get promoted the city needs
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:11.960]  the money budget shortfall get out there and write more tickets
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.880]  folks that money goes into city bonds and city investments that's never seen
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:19.160]  again most bonds for things to be built never even
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.840]  get spent on what they it's all a crime syndicate
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:26.600]  this country is totally criminally run i just
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.200]  i don't know how else to explain to you we're on fire
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:35.720]  okay this country is going down by design you don't think they don't know
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:39.400]  when they massively increase taxes in california that make all the businesses
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:42.280]  start going belly up and move out of the state
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:47.000]  you didn't think they knew that they want to destroy it and then only the
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.520]  insiders who are exempt from the taxes will survive
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:53.560]  all right we'll come back to this quick break go right to your calls

[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.560]  the notice got through because the republicans want it too because they're
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:35.960]  bought and paid for at the top and you notice what happened there
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.080]  when you look at it tom dashill said no you're above 65 you're not going to get
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:41.800]  eye surgery that money should go to young people
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:44.120]  but they're not going to give it to young people either they play you off
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.920]  against each other they want that money and it's going to be
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:50.680]  used to buy drones and buy off foreign governments and expand the global
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.840]  empire you fools but wait obama gave me a
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:36:00.120]  phone he's going to do more don't you tell me i won

[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:17.800]  going to your calls in that he was playing the part of the
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.560]  conservative the constitutionalist the libertarian
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:25.800]  saying oh yeah small businesses are good small businesses did do that
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:29.880]  lower taxes brings in more revenue
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:35.960]  this is the type of information that we're talking about here
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:41.160]  and so they went oh that's discredited america didn't want that they wanted
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:44.920]  obama and then clear election fraud and now they
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:49.080]  say well there's a mandate yes you want gay marriage folks i don't
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:54.440]  talk about gay marriage here on the show it's not a federal matter
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.360]  the issue is is that's not what they want it for they it's not about people
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:01.800]  having their quote freedom if you go actually study the cia
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.400]  declassifications look it up i've had it with dr michael kaufman on we've
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:08.440]  covered it in in game 2.0 the expanded in game for
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.680]  prison planet dot tv where they admit that they wanted to
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:18.120]  promote people in promiscuous periods so they wouldn't have long-term
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:20.920]  relationships so even if they had children
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:25.240]  they wouldn't take care of the children and so the state could raise them
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:29.080]  like north korea does breaking up families and
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:34.920]  this is what they've done this is their program this is their plan and they
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:38.920]  use it as a political football and make the new civil rights movement
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:42.520]  all about what people do sexually instead of hey the new civil rights
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:47.160]  movement should be why does most my tax money go to foreign banks and bailouts
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:51.480]  why am i being surveilled illegally by the nsa no matter what color i am
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:54.760]  why are they setting up federally funded highway checkpoints no matter what
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:58.520]  color i am see we're losing all our real rights while the government all day
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:01.560]  tells you how they want to make sure you get all your rights because because
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:05.880]  you know because somebody didn't let you you know have this and that and and
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:11.720]  all these football issues that they use to just toss back and forth all day
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:14.920]  while meanwhile they're teaching elementary students nationwide and
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:19.480]  government training camps public schools they're teaching little
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:23.800]  boys and girls that it's fashionable to be out of the other sex
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:29.800]  or be into the same sex you do that folks that is child abuse that is wrecking
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:33.080]  their innocence
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.000]  and just makes me so frustrated to know they're the the the globalist are a
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.560]  bunch of perverts and i don't mean perverts even
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:48.040]  to the point of what their sexual quote preference i mean these are
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:51.880]  people that get off on things that they see as degenerate
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:56.840]  these are crazy people you understand what i'm saying i i mean
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:01.320]  you know anybody in congress that wants to have sex with 14-year-old pages is a
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:05.800]  degenerate i mean look at them they're having sex with
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:09.080]  you know with girls with boys with the whole thing up there constantly
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:12.760]  that's why they're in there you're not let in most the time unless you are a
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.000]  pervert unless you are a pedophile because
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.040]  they can then compromise you fully you got a nine percent approval rating for
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:26.840]  congress do you really believe that people are voting
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:29.640]  for everything that congress wants that people are actually voting for most
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:32.360]  these congressmen
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.400]  no it's a pervert club up there just like i told you the
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:39.960]  entire leadership of the school in pennsylvania
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:43.320]  was involved in the cover-up of course they were folks
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:48.040]  because i've studied this and discovered that the globalists use and it's
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:52.280]  mainstream news that the cia likes to hire people that are engaged in
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.680]  illegal sexual practices because then they can destroy them anytime they
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:00.200]  want but also that's the club look at ancient
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:04.200]  Rome that's what they were all into look at the nazis they were all into a
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:09.000]  bunch of weird stuff because normal people don't want to put
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.600]  other people in reeducation camps do you know why they want to put you in a
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:16.440]  reeducation camp because they get off on coming out
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.160]  to this you know the the jail cells and getting the woman they want or the
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:24.760]  kid they want or the man they want and maybe they just want to torture you
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:29.080]  maybe they want to rape you maybe they want to
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.520]  you know strut around and and tell you they're powerful and have you to
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:36.360]  dinner with them maybe they want to beat your husband
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.880]  to death in front of you maybe they want to pour battery
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:43.160]  acid on small children and rape them like they do at Abu Ghraib on record
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:47.160]  armies own report okay they want to build a
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:50.680]  tyranny so they can pull your teeth out with pliers
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:53.320]  and they're going to do it they're already tasering people everywhere for
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:57.080]  quote not giving the urine sample or not talking to the officer while you're
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:59.800]  chained down they're killing people and restraints everywhere
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:03.240]  because it's what they like and they're going to have more
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:07.480]  and once they get into full power the mass killing begins
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:12.600]  because that's what they want and you are naive historically if you don't
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.000]  realize that's what's now happening okay i'm gonna shut up
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.040]  bob and michigan go ahead and finish your point sir
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:24.280]  hi uh this is bob and michigan and uh again i'm coming from
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:28.440]  fema camp five region yes uh don't look for me in the camp
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:32.840]  because i'm not going uh we're here we're not a joke
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:36.440]  and uh we've been asleep at the controls way too long
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:40.840]  it's time to stand up and stand and those fema camps will be
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:44.840]  good places to put some of these congressmen and stuff that
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:48.600]  are treasonous i mean it's time for us to stop
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:52.440]  think iceland sir no i agree iceland threw him out and they're now arresting
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:55.400]  the bankers and we can put them in the regular prisons let out all the non
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:58.520]  violent people give them all their due process and when
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:02.280]  they're shown to have been involved in treason against this republic with
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.960]  for foreign enemies they'll get the death penalty that is death
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:08.840]  and but we can be lenient because i don't like the government and the job of
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:12.280]  executing people because they can't be trusted i don't even trust ourselves
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:19.400]  i just think uh you know life in prison uh and um or if it's a lesser crime 20
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.160]  years hard labor and then exile of course what country
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:26.360]  want to take scum like this god bless you bob william in new york let's talk
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:29.880]  about smart meters thanks for holding her on the air sir
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:34.360]  hey what's going on alex worldwide broadcast stand to an honor and a privilege
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:37.480]  to talk to the general in the resistance on the war against these
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:42.680]  malevolent forces um listen i saw a report recently
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:46.680]  about these smart meters alex and recently tried to keep it short
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:51.160]  i had one of these replaced because the power company realized
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:55.800]  that it wasn't working and then charged us an enormous bill for the time that it
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.480]  wasn't working and they came and replaced it with a smart meter
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:03.080]  not too long before i saw the report about them so i told i called them and
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:06.280]  i demanded that they take it off my house and i've been getting
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.480]  repeated all we'll call you back we'll call you back we'll call you back and
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:13.240]  never call well it's on record that they they
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:18.600]  interface all the new appliances we tried to go buy a new new
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.800]  clothes dryer and washing machine and everything
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:26.680]  at the lows we went to we couldn't find something made america
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:31.080]  and and then we went to another place that had made america but that too
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:34.360]  was the new smart stuff that the ipad can go in and
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:38.360]  it says it's got smart home sensors and these companies have standardized it
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:41.960]  where the smart meter tracks them and what they're doing wirelessly
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:45.640]  along with everything else in your house that's all admitted
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:50.200]  just like the the tv's watch you and the tvos and the cable boxes and the
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:54.120]  smart phones all admitted last week i told you 15 years ago
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:57.560]  because you know the documents were public and
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:01.080]  these things are literal government spy hubs
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:04.280]  on your house but they can also dial in to the new
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:08.200]  if you heard about data over power line heard about that bub
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:14.040]  no now bub I love that word now i mean it's amazing
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:19.240]  that that now they can send the data not just wirelessly but the smart meter
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.240]  can now go in and the new plugs on most of the appliances
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:27.400]  have a digital chip that actually hooks into the
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:33.480]  the computer brain of the appliance and it communicates through the electrical
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:35.800]  socket
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:41.160]  how do you like that do you think this is a policy alex of them saying that it's
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:43.640]  digital i told them i don't care if it's digital
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:47.480]  i want it off my house my house not their house
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:51.560]  well no nationwide they're putting in the quote smart meters kind of like smart
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:55.320]  growth now to just rebrand hitler and call him hitler smart never want to go
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:00.280]  oh i love hitler it's hitler smart or maybe mal smart malsey tongue smart
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:05.320]  when you hear smart run and again it's not the technology oh you troglodyte
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:10.520]  cave man you don't know i'm sick of also in the price of what i buy
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.120]  having all this spy tech did you know i was reading in a consumer report
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.440]  magazine a few months ago that sometimes 20 to 30 percent of your
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:23.160]  computer or or the electronics in your car or the packages you get
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:26.600]  sometimes thousands of dollars of a car's price
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:31.080]  is surveillance crud that you didn't even ask for in it
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:34.760]  i mean that's what i'm saying your washers your dryers your computers your
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:37.800]  refrigerators everything and the smart
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:44.120]  appliance hooks into the smart meter so yes get them out get them out get them
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:46.760]  out and again they're very expensive they make you pay
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:50.600]  through your bill for their little machine and then they also have
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:54.440]  the cities have wireless meter reading and we've
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.920]  also caught them using those to steal data just like the google cars drive
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.760]  around with the mast breaking the the the
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:05.880]  codes they look for computers password protected
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:09.800]  they look for it and then have codes given to them by the big
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:13.800]  companies this is in the news to break into your computer
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:17.240]  does that sound like a nice organization
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:20.440]  i mean come on i mean and they look forward to people being either
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:24.360]  with the head in the sand or scared
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:31.080]  now is the time see notice they'll pay with a rebate for you to put in part of
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:35.640]  the solar if it's hooked into the grid no we've got to go solar
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:38.680]  that is not in the grid we've got to go when that's not in the grid but guess
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.760]  what they'll send out inspectors now in counties all over the country
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:46.120]  harassing people that try to put in their own
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:50.280]  solar that is not hooked into the grid and they'll harass you and try to make
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:53.960]  you remove it they don't want that they want you under their
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:56.680]  control and then there's also the health effects that have been proven from the
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:59.960]  smart meters folks you think cell phones are bad these smart meters are far
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:03.400]  worse god bless you sir expanding on that
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:06.120]  now all the new cell phones coming out the next few years
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:10.440]  will not have plugs will not have plugs to be charged
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:13.880]  they are they they're going to charge through the air
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:21.400]  from hubs you plug in and i went and did some checking the radiology
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:26.840]  the if you think a microwave transmission is bad folks
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:32.600]  beaming power through the house through the air into your phone
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:36.840]  i mean it is unbelievable what frequency pollution is doing to all of us
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:40.920]  they admit it they knew 30 years ago when they were approving cell phone
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:43.960]  technology it was given the rats brain tumors
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:47.640]  but again we get it we're used to it we use it and we kill ourselves
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:50.360]  it's humans are tough folks we're just designed
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:54.120]  that to adapt to our environment well the globalists give us a false
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:59.240]  environment we just adapt to it and the environment is designed to kill us
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:05.080]  let's talk to Nathan in california Nathan you're on the air go ahead
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:11.480]  well yes sir go ahead okay um i had an incident with a smart meter as well
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:15.880]  but what i'd really like to tell you is there's a hundred percent
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:21.720]  tax in california for electronics in the past three years i've bought three
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:26.520]  iphone they go on sale for 50 bucks and california says
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:29.880]  well we don't want to lose the revenue we would have made
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:33.960]  if it was full price you know a $500 phone whatever
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:40.120]  so we're going to charge you 50 bucks tax i pay $50 for the phone and $50 in
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:42.360]  tax
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:48.680]  i know sir i know it is it is hellish and again when they tax everything
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:52.120]  then they can social engineer with that money as well i mean look at government
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:55.320]  government swagger's around like these people are god
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:59.720]  government bureaucrats swagger more than movie stars i know
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:04.840]  i mean they just they have arrived their government you're scum
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:09.160]  and then they try to brainwash you into into uh this is what you want this is
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:11.960]  what you need well yeah they're doing it for your own good
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.560]  my smart meter let me tell you about the meter
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:20.440]  uh my wife and i got an electric bill that was
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:24.440]  three times the ordinary bill we've been in this house
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:28.680]  for six years and uh i had run a little
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:34.600]  old window air conditioner sir sir you live in cali sir you live in california
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:37.800]  they they admit they monitor all your appliances
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.720]  they can tell off the meter what you're using and when you quote use in peak
[02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:44.680]  times they charge you more and remember they said they're going to control the
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:49.080]  temperature in your house now you live in a state but this is going nationwide
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:53.320]  where the government controls the temperature inside your house
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:58.200]  this is even worse because it's extortion because we don't have a smart meter
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:01.560]  uh they i know that came out the san francisco chronicle too
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:05.000]  they're they're telling people i know well they estimate is what they say go
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.400]  ahead go ahead and tell the story i'll shut up but
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:11.240]  supposedly the technician came out and read the meter
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:15.960]  we got a a bill three times what it was uh my wife called and called
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:18.520]  and i said that's what it is that's what the guy read
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:25.480]  and a month later after she'd been making payments on this exorbitant bill
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:29.000]  they call up or she calls them one of the other i don't know
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.480]  but uh uh essentially they tell her oh that was a mistake
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:36.920]  well hey listen i hope everybody enjoys the triple rights god bless you we

[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:09.960]  government is announcing it like it's normal they're out of control and
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:13.080]  they're going to nuke a city or something and pose the saviors.

[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:50.840]  and I'll tell you the good news though people are waking up
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:54.920]  I mean this show sounds totally insane I know it does because but it's real
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:59.240]  it's real it's real and that's why we're getting on
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:03.640]  so many AM and FM stations because people now figured out this is real
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:06.120]  people that thought I was nuts have figured out wait it's all happening
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:08.200]  that's right that's how we can beat these people
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:11.720]  if you'll just go research it yourself it's now all out in the open and just
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:16.840]  decide that you're going to resist it but you got to get aggressive folks or
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:20.600]  we don't have any hope it's going to go to a civil war
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:23.800]  and we don't want that because it's not going to hurt the new world order
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:27.400]  for us to kill each other we need to wake up the police and military now
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:31.240]  we need to wake up the bureaucrats we need and we need to be aggressive
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:33.960]  I know we got loaded phones here I want to go to angel and others and we'll do
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:36.760]  that and overdrive I've got a lot of calls about smart meters they're going
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:39.160]  in everywhere remember six years ago they were like
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:42.760]  we'll never use it to control the temp now they do that
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:45.720]  we'll never use it to charge you more during peak times that's what it was
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:47.640]  designed for now they're doing it everywhere
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:51.800]  we'll nyan nyan nyan nyan it's for the earth we're going to double your prices
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:54.840]  again in austin nyan nyan nyan nyan meanwhile it's
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:57.800]  globalist power companies are just having their competition shut down
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.240]  so they can make huge profits
[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:06.280]  at our expense you don't need to rob banks folks you just have government
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:09.720]  shut down your competition I was reading about government healthcare and
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:12.360]  david knight was telling me about it he told me the name of the process we go
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:16.200]  run ask david knight the process of where counties if they have their
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:20.280]  own county hospital they won't let a private hospital open
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:24.040]  and say have an MRI or a machine because that competes with them
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:26.440]  I mean this country I forget the name of the process but I've heard about it
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:33.160]  before he was telling me about it I mean it is so beyond it's ridiculous
[02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:36.760]  that when you actually have employees and you actually are involved
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:39.960]  you see it all that's why business owners are so angry the general public
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:43.560]  just gets a check and you know it has no idea
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:46.840]  you deal with the bureaucrats in other ways but I mean it is just
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:51.880]  and to know I'm funding this thing makes me sick sick sick
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:55.160]  and I do little things I move out of Travis County because your tax money
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:59.320]  property tax money you know funds abortion only county in Texas but still
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:02.120]  now they want to expand that district out to where I'm at it's just like there's
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:05.320]  no way to get away from them there's no way to get away from these greedy little
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:08.760]  control freaks you got to spread the word about the broadcast folks on your

[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:02.280]  with um the the kids are not just getting poisoned by
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:06.040]  the vaccines they're they're molding them into
[03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:10.760]  like heroin addict criminal type people no no no no it's a no they admit
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:13.560]  they get them on prozac and riddolin because they're four times more likely
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:16.520]  to end up on illegal drugs and they have the dare people come in and show them
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:19.160]  all the drugs exactly no it and go ahead yeah
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:23.400]  absolutely yes it's preparing them to be institutionalized
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:28.760]  well not only that it's um when when parents feed the children of autistic
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:33.080]  children uh when they see them things like milk
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:37.000]  and gluten that is actually acting as an opiate
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:40.440]  it because the yeast overgrowth in the intestines
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:46.360]  um causes leaky gut syndrome then the the proteins come through they leak
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:49.720]  through those holes the proteins from the milk and gluten they leak through
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:53.960]  those holes and then attached to the opiate receptors in the brain
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:57.560]  well that's true that's why when you drink you know alcohol you get intoxicated
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:01.240]  there's a lot of science showing that and so the the um they have autoimmune
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:04.840]  responses in the intestines and the brain and that's all been pretty well
[03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:08.840]  documented that's why they went after uh you know the doctors that
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:14.680]  exposed that now that doctor's suing them but it's got no media attention
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:18.760]  yeah and they're just they're molding them and plus autistic children
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:23.960]  do not have um they don't have empathy or they have lack of empathy
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:29.400]  um my my son did hardly had any empathy at all until i took him off the gluten
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:34.120]  and the milk um he he took a pencil to his son his um
