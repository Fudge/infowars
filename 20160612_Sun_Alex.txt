[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  It's a fitting song to come in with, a trooper, an Iron Maiden.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  Your fire musket battle will run you through.
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  And when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  The bugle sounds, the charge begins, but on this battlefield, no one wins.
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  Certain death. Yes, it's certain death if they bring 5 million radical jihadis into Europe, 80% of them military age men.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  It's certain death to bring hundreds of thousands in, they've been playing down the numbers, it's in the hundreds of thousands.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  It's in the tens of thousands here in Austin, Texas, we've confirmed in the last year of quote Syrian refugees.
[01:21.000 --> 01:31.000]  That's radical jihadi invaders who went into Syria, got their butt kicked and they made a deal with Turkey to move into Europe with Merkel and the head of the EU Migrancy Program,
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  who of course has been meeting at the Bilderberg meeting in the last week, Peter Sutherland.
[01:35.000 --> 01:43.000]  We have reached total absolute information overload today with the amount of information we're going to be breaking down.
[01:44.000 --> 01:56.000]  Obviously we've got 55 people dead now and more than 60 or so injured in the Orlando nightclub that was reportedly a gay nightclub.
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  I have been harping on the fact that China executes gays, that 11 Muslim countries execute gays.
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  And all I hear is carping and screaming and yelling from the LGBT so-called community, an offshoot of the Democratic Party,
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  that that's a lie and that I am being homophobic or Islamophobic and that the poor little jihadis aren't targeting you.
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  That is how totally over the top insane all of this has gotten.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  This morning I got up and ISIS had already officially claimed responsibility.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  This gentleman was openly claiming responsibility and he had been watched for two years.
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  They knew he was about to do it but were ordered to stand down just like San Bernardino and it took until later in the afternoon,
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  eight, nine hours after everybody got up and knew about this horror for the media to go, okay, it's Islamic terror.
[02:55.000 --> 03:03.000]  But Obama would say that he said it's an attack on us all because an attack on a gay nightclub is the heart of everything so it's an attack on us all.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  And my issue is I hate any group of people being attacked, period.
[03:07.000 --> 03:16.000]  But now we're going to hear the grandstanding on the LGBT training of the kids in school and America did this and this is part of the hate.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  This guy killed more homosexuals than every gay basher has done in the U.S. the last 50 plus years.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  I mean there might be one death a year and they act like it's the end of the world.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  Anybody else gets mugged and killed, it's not even in the newspaper hardly, but it becomes this giant cause celeb end of the world.
[03:34.000 --> 03:47.000]  You get 50 plus people dead at a gay nightclub and it's a jihadi doing it and it's an ISIS operation that they called for three days before and said they were going to hit Florida.
[03:48.000 --> 03:56.000]  They have released this electronic press release that they're going to hit thousands of different groups and thousands of different people.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  They released that last Monday and now it's the month of Ramadan and that's when you've got to go on high alert.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  I had Tim Kennedy here yesterday.
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.000]  Again 15 years of special forces specifically assigned to domestic operations and he doesn't tell me this but I already know this.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  He said yeah that's true.
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  Anti-terrorism operations in the U.S. the highest levels and they all knew this was coming in the month of Ramadan and what you're seeing is the beginning of a sneak attack.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  Just like the Chinese New Year in Vietnam that famous attack was supposedly a ceasefire.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  This is the beginning.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  You notice the attacks are coming at shorter and shorter intervals and are more intense.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  This is probing, this is getting ready and then as they put the orders out there's no cell organization.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's just camp followers and people that go along with the ideology.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  These lone wolves will start activating.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  Then the globalist will invert logic the very ones that allow this to happen will tell us by giving up our freedoms.
[04:53.000 --> 05:17.000]  They will protect us and they will take our guns with the California ruling federal court ruling to take your guns last week.
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  It's up to 99.999% of impurities including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants and hormones.

[06:23.000 --> 06:40.000]  It isn't about tuning our horn but frankly I got tears of rage in my eyes this morning.
[06:40.000 --> 07:00.000]  When I got up at about 8.30 slept late on Sunday using about 6 a.m. and I went into the kitchen and my cell phone was plugged in the wall was just full of probably 100 text from Joe Biggs and Rob Do and my reporters wanting to hear what they should do next.
[07:00.000 --> 07:13.000]  And I love the fact that because I was asleep and they couldn't get a hold of me they just went ahead and did the right thing and Biggs bought tickets and flew to Florida and Rob Do went into motion and started doing his job.
[07:13.000 --> 07:37.000]  But it's not tuning my horn when I tell you that you can go to Google and you can type in ISIS shells being activated, prepared for attack two weeks ago with Tim Kennedy, expert in anti-terrorism, U.S. Army and all of our other guests coming on.
[07:37.000 --> 07:56.000]  And myself saying clearly they're preparing a massive Tet offensive, a Tet two. Brecker, the former Navy SEAL, had him on twice for three hours total saying it's imminent, it's coming, get ready the summer, get ready during Ramadan for the kickoff.
[07:56.000 --> 08:09.000]  There are attacks in Europe. There have been other attempted copycat attacks. They found another guy with automatic weapons and the rest of it going after a gay pride parade out in California.
[08:09.000 --> 08:29.000]  We have 50 plus people dead. We have another 60 or so seriously injured. We have a liberal Democrat registered son of Afghan immigrants, an admitted disciple of ISIS who pledged allegiance to them online two years ago.
[08:29.000 --> 08:43.000]  Driving down from New York where he was a security guard and going in there and killing those people. He had a New York gun license.
[08:43.000 --> 08:58.000]  He was a security guard just like these airports, Charles de Gaulle in France or more than half the people working there are Muslims and most of them are women wearing hijabs and their faces covered are full Burkus.
[08:58.000 --> 09:12.000]  You got the foxes watching the henhouse here and political correctness is so over the top. They are on the news right now saying enough is enough. This is the fault of the Second Amendment.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  They are on the news right now heralding the federal ruling last week that they can restrict guns and the open carry of guns.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  They are on the news right now saying this is a hate crime and I've even talked to people I know that are buying going. Yeah, this is more of a hate crime because it was gays.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  Who do you think Muslims target 11 Muslim countries execute gay men or lesbian women?
[09:36.000 --> 09:47.000]  Islamic State all over the Middle East from Libya to Egypt to Syria when they get control they throw people off buildings is the customary way to kill a homosexual.
[09:47.000 --> 09:56.000]  I literally don't dislike anybody. I'm a libertarian. I get to hear all day because I'm a nationalist and pro second amendment that I hate gay people.
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.000]  That's how the left makes themselves cause celebs and victims and oh look at me. What I hate is all the fake flamboyant. You're going to run society.
[10:05.000 --> 10:16.000]  You're going to tell our five year olds how to live because you know they need some LGBT training because you know there's so much homophobia in the West where you can live in peace and be left alone and not killed.
[10:17.000 --> 10:27.000]  And then you got the very same left allied with radical Islam in the belly of the West has given them all this freedom and they're desecrating it.
[10:27.000 --> 10:37.000]  They're spitting on it. I'm talking about the LGBT crowd that the media speaks for and that speaks for everybody else and that just sits up there and shoots their mouth off all day.
[10:38.000 --> 10:51.000]  You know about how they control the culture. It's a bunch of bullies who bring in even worse bullies and are just running around murdering people in mass.
[10:51.000 --> 11:11.000]  And so I charge the left and I charge Obama and I charge the LGBT community in general with endangering America and with the blood of these 50 plus innocent men and women who did not deserve to die.
[11:11.000 --> 11:28.000]  Who did not deserve to have bullets fired into them and all the other hundreds of thousands of other liberals and gays and others in the Middle East that have been murdered the last five years under the Al Qaeda slash ISIS onslaught that our government and CNN has pushed and said is a good thing.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  The Arab Spring run by Saudi Arabia in the West to bring down the entire Middle East. You people bring down the Middle East.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  You put the radicals in charge of sexually mutilate women. You give them the weapons. You give them the know how Turkey and NATO aid them.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  You attack all these countries. They let them into Europe. They let them into Macedonia. They let them into Turkey and the rest of Europe.
[11:51.000 --> 11:57.000]  And they open the borders up and say you must accept them. We must ban German freedom. We must ban Swedish freedom.
[11:57.000 --> 12:09.000]  We must arrest anybody criticizing the open border, including presidential candidates Marie Le Pen, the son of his hardcore is Donald Trump arrested her for saying this Islamic invasion is as bad as Hitler's invasion.
[12:10.000 --> 12:19.000]  They arrested her. Their answer to the radical Islam is we have to give up our speech or they're going to attack us.
[12:19.000 --> 12:28.000]  That's why the left allies itself, the Salatarian left, the fascist left with radical Islam. Then there's an Imam in Orlando.
[12:29.000 --> 12:38.000]  We've got video shooting his mouth off saying that basically the gays deserve this to happen to him. Man, if a conservative said that they'd get lynched.
[12:38.000 --> 12:50.000]  And he's up there in his black robes with his turban on. Death is the sentence. We know there's nothing to be embarrassed about this death is the sentence news nine.
[12:51.000 --> 12:59.000]  They say go kill the homosexuals. The guy goes and does it and you want my guns.
[12:59.000 --> 13:09.000]  And you'll use it to say, oh, there's all these crimes against gay people. Let us educate your kids so you would sexualize my children and indoctrinate them into your cult.
[13:10.000 --> 13:18.000]  And I'm not saying you're in a cult because you're gay. I'm talking about the gay mafia. That's really a pedophile mafia in Hollywood and the rest of the ones access to our kids.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  And I'll tell you, I don't know who's worse, the pedophile mafia or radical Islam. But you know what radical Islam, they have sexual little kids anyways.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  That sex is legal. Oh, you can have, the Korean says have sex with little boys all day long. Just don't have sex with men with men. I mean, what a freak show, man.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  So I guess that form of Islam, Orthodox Islam, I guess that is worse than the pedophile cult. So there you go.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  Because you're just out in the open with it. I mean, I mean, it's just, you actually start reading the Quran and the Hadith and all the stuff. It is mind blowing.
[13:48.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I've bought copies from official Islamic publications, official certified Sunni text. And it is freak show folks, freak show.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  There's a headline daily caller anti pedophilia bill rejected in Pakistan as anti Islamic boom. Wow.
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.000]  So no wonder the radical lefts out loud with Islam. They're just a bunch of perverts. They want access to our kids to break.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  They want them sexually mutilated or women and put and put hoods over their heads. No, you're not going to do it.
[14:26.000 --> 14:34.000]  So coming up, I've got the Imam shooting his mouth off. I got it all. And then I've got all the stop the violence hashtags out this morning.
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  Oh, oh really turn the guns in so that only the radicals, jihadis have the weapons. They got gun control in a bunch of these countries. Does that stop the radicals?
[14:42.000 --> 14:54.000]  What about Europe? Did that stop all the gun bands in Paris? There's no guns in Paris. Oh, but the jihadis got their guns in because the government let them come in because the government lets these attacks take place to then take the general public's basic freedoms.
[14:54.000 --> 15:07.000]  So here's the battle folks. There's going to be more sleeper cell attacks on schools and nightclubs and facilities like that and in military recruiting centers where they're not allowed to have weapons and military bases where they can't have weapons.
[15:08.000 --> 15:17.000]  That's an oxymoron. There's going to be more attacks and then get ready. Gun owners and libertarians and veterans are going to be blamed. That is the inverted universe.
[15:17.000 --> 15:28.000]  That is the twisted universe. And then they got a bunch of lesbians on their tweeting girls kissing, going love's going to win. We're going to get your guns.
[15:29.000 --> 15:38.000]  Nothing about Islam. Nothing about countries where they kill you the first day you're on the street. Zero. Because these social justice warriors are a bunch of wimps.
[15:38.000 --> 15:47.000]  They want to come into the lap of true open society and freedom and run around bitching at everyone that's done nothing to them and then ally with a bunch of slavers.
[15:48.000 --> 15:58.000]  I mean go read. Muhammad was a slaver folks, a white man that enslaved black people. So of course Muhammad Ali changed his name from that of an abolitionist to that of a slave master.

[20:16.000 --> 20:25.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:33.000]  I have reached overload points. I'm going to have to sit back and calm down for just a moment.
[20:33.000 --> 20:46.000]  I have confirmed from high-leveled forces that there are six cells in six cities preparing to attack homosexual targets.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  That's what ISIS normally does when it rolls out first to get the general Islamic support.
[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  It's target the group that in Islam they all completely agree deserves to die and that's any full grown men or full grown women having sex together.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  Children, it's super A-OK and totally wonderful.
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  I was just showing mainstream news articles. ISIS killed as targets Palm Beach, Treasure Coast, Residence, XFBI agent.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now let me give you high-level intel. We're going to bring Tim Kennedy in here and see if he's gotten the same info.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  But this comes directly from the Pentagon.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  What you're about to hear. In fact, let's get Kurt Nemo, who I know is on this weekend, as one of our writers. I know he's probably listening.
[21:24.000 --> 21:30.000]  Kurt, get ready to write this. This is a big story you're hearing in here. Six cities.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  In the next segment, I'll tell you the names.
[21:34.000 --> 21:42.000]  Obviously, Orlando and LA were two are currently being targeted by cells that have now been activated.
[21:43.000 --> 21:50.000]  And there are anti-terrorism units moving into those areas right now to go after the people inside the United States.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  Now, I want to be very, very clear about this with everybody, OK?
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.000]  I see on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com a lot of comments saying, what is this, the Fox News channel with its fear-mongering?
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  It isn't fear-mongering if it's real.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  When we attacked Iraq, when it was Saudi Arabia involved heavily, that was wrong. I was against it.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  It was meant to stir up the Middle East. Dick Cheney wrote the PNAC document talking about it.
[22:17.000 --> 22:24.000]  Now, they've gone past the class of civilizations. The globalists and NATO are just allying with Islam now to overrun us.
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.000]  The world changes. Alliance has changed. Saudi Arabia is our mortal enemy. I've always exposed them.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  I haven't changed. People aren't sophisticated enough to understand something that's 2 plus 2 equals 4 if they don't get this.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  There are real radical Muslims. There's over a billion and a half Muslims total.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  Wahhabism has taken over Islam. It is seen as the Orthodox Islam now. It is super hardcore and crazy.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  It puts 5-year-old girls in sex slavery for having sex, OK? It's totally schizophrenic.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  A man can have sex with a 10-year-old boy, but he can't have sex with another man. It's crazy.
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  It's devilish. They brought 5 million into Europe. They brought hundreds of thousands in here.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  It's way higher than what they're saying. We've proven that right here in Austin, and they're going to allow them to attack.
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  And they're going to bring in civil emergency for the election unless we stop it.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  There are good elements of the government trying to stop it. The Pentagon and the Army particularly now understands the full plan
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  and has been trying to block it for four years with the Russians. I told you that four years ago, three months ago,
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  Syrsh came on, pulled a surprise winner and said, yes, Alex, thank you for your work. It's been groundbreaking with your guests.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  I'm not bragging. I'm just saying we know what we're talking about. It's true. For four years, the Pentagon has refused to work with ISIS and al-Qaeda
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  in Syria and has been aiding the Russians with satellite data to help take them out.
[23:47.000 --> 23:55.000]  Our military said no to Obama because he's not the president. He is a globalist, Wahhabist, and I used to hear this not believe it. It's true.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  I knew they were manipulating Islam and he was acting like he was for it. I knew he went to Moscow, he was a kid in Indonesia,
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  and I knew he could speak perfect, you know, Pashtun and all the rest of it. People were blown away in Cairo in his first speech.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  But man, Napoleon joined Islam at the end. These double crosses and triple crosses have happened before.
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  And all I know is they brought five million people in the last three years into Europe. 80% of military-aged men, that's Interpol,
[24:21.000 --> 24:33.000]  and a lot of them jihadis. Folks, 10,000 men, a 10,000-man sleeper cell. Can you imagine 10,000 guys with guns going out and attacking nightclubs and schools and everything else?
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  I mean, we're talking five million in Europe. Let's just say 10,000 attacked.
[24:40.000 --> 24:54.000]  What about here? There are no go zones all over Europe where our crew gets physically attacked and run out and they say that Donald Trump's a liar
[24:55.000 --> 25:04.000]  and that San Bernardino wasn't a terror attack. The FBI came out and admitted they were ordered to stand down and to say that that wasn't terror for two days.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  And then a year and a half before, they tried to stop them. Those very two, they were going back and forth to Pakistan and to Saudi Arabia
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  and were ordered to stand down and a criminal investigation was started by the Obama Justice Department and Eric Holder against the two agents.
[25:19.000 --> 25:29.000]  They faced criminal charges if the panel found that they were being racist against the very people that went in there and shot all those folks.
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.000]  So, people say, Alex, you know, you say a lot of terrorist false flag. Yes, it's false flag for NORAD to stand down.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  It's false flag to give the terrorist a visus. And I've interviewed the heads of the embassies and all of it.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  There are criminal elements working with radicalism in our government.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  But it is a false flag in that our governments of Europe and the United States are bringing in record numbers in the fake liberal pretty boy up in Canada, Trudeau.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  They're bringing them all in and when they attack, they come out and say it's your fault.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  It's your granddaddy's fault. We're in the John Deere hat with his rifle.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  It's your fault, the veteran, the gun owner, the patriot, every race, color, and creed.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  They're putting the guilt on us, the outrage, the arrogance, the insolence of these people.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  And then they have an imam in Orlando on TV saying the gays deserve this.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  It is written we must kill them. And it is written you must kill them.
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  I mean, this is so crazy. This is so out of control and so mentally ill.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  But this is how America falls. They bring these people in, they let them attack.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  Then they declare civil emergency and say you're not allowed to talk like you are anymore. You stirred up the Muslims.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  I said that before Merkel did it, before Halan did it in Europe. They've done it.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  And I told you this was coming and now this would happen.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  And you could see that the attacks are becoming more frequent and more intense.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  Tim Kennedy was in here a few months ago. As you pull up the Army Times, I want to show TV viewers.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Just type in Tim Kennedy, ISIS, click news. It's Army Times.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  But he broke it here. He's a fellow Austinite friend of mine, good friend of mine.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  And we were just sitting there talking about it.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  How ISIS says he's a target and they're coming after him.
[27:17.000 --> 27:25.000]  They released Monday thousands of targets inside the United States in this electronic hacker brigade they have that they're going to hit.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  Let me tell you, this is such a bold and sane move.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  They think logic's dead. The globalists have allowed this to take place.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  They think they're going to bring all these people in here.
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  They're going to attack us and then they're going to try to spin it into a hate crime and act like we did it.
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  Because the wife of the other guy, he wasn't from here, but he lived here while I was a citizen.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  She wasn't a citizen yet in San Bernardino. This guy's parents came here in the 80s.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  And he was just a total complete whack jog.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  And there's all this hype, attack, attack, attack. These aren't even cell groups, these terror groups.
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  They are just an ideology like fire ants. They clump up your leg, they release a pheromone, 20, 30 of them, and they all start stinging at once.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  Son of honeybees. Honeybees will release a pheromone that says you're bad and then attack you.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  So they don't get orders from headquarters.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  ISIS puts out videos of how to do stuff and says, you know, home gardening or how to brew beer at home.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  That's what I go and do online or how to fix a carburetor.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  No, no, or, you know, where's the best place to hike when I go to Colorado?
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  No, no, they don't do, or where's the best enchiladas? Where's the best fried chicken on Sunday?
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  That's kind of stuff I go.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  Oh, no, no, not them. It's, let me go see how to dump chlorine gas on a hundred-story building, that kind of stuff.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  Kill everybody inside of it. And they're all just waiting, all just waiting and all just to trigger.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Once one fire ants stings, they all start firing at once. Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  The control demolition of the republic. The door wide open to a jihad army.
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  An exclusive, perfected process.
[29:26.000 --> 29:36.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.

[29:54.000 --> 30:19.000]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[30:19.000 --> 30:29.000]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[30:30.000 --> 30:42.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[30:44.000 --> 30:50.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[33:21.000 --> 33:29.000]  Watch me. I got it. Hey! I got something that makes me want a shot.
[33:30.000 --> 33:39.000]  But I tell you, I have been really upset and angry today because we've had all these expert guests on. I can sit there and read the newspaper like anybody else could.
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.000]  They bring in millions and millions of radical Muslims, 80% of military age men. They bring in hundreds of thousands here, suppress the numbers.
[33:46.000 --> 33:53.000]  They cover up the Fort Hood shooting that killed 13 people. Don't call it terror. San Bernardino, don't call it terror.
[33:54.000 --> 34:01.000]  Army, Navy, Marine Corps shootings, they cover it up. Garland, they try to cover it up. It just caught getting shot in Philadelphia.
[34:01.000 --> 34:15.000]  Jihad, Jihad, the guys are wearing the white night gown, shooting. Nightclub gets attacked up in Toronto. They cover that up. All these attacks across Europe. There were dozens of attacks in France after the Charlie Hebdo attack that they kind of swept from the rug.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  There were a bunch of attacks that night after the attack at the other nightclub. So, this is all going on.
[34:21.000 --> 34:30.000]  And then I, just two weeks ago, we've got the clip. I'm not going to play it. I'm going to play it tomorrow during the weekday show. Tim Kennedy, you know, headlines. Top Special Forces soldier.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  ISIS sleeper cells now in the US preparing to activate. That was the headline. I mean, he was in here this week talking about it.
[34:37.000 --> 34:45.000]  So, but everybody's talking about it. And then the attack happens and Obama comes out and says, this is a hate crime. And it's, oh, it's the thing.
[34:45.000 --> 34:54.000]  Well, yeah, Islam throws gays off cliffs. We were talking about that two weeks ago when he was here. They murder people and it's not compatible.
[34:55.000 --> 35:05.000]  So what is the government thinking? But then I have the information we just showed it from the Associated Press FBI agent says that this is just the beginning that there are other sleeper cells.
[35:05.000 --> 35:16.000]  Well, that's my sources. And of course, the Pentagon has been saying this as well. The CIA came out a few weeks ago and said that there are sleeper cells, but they're saying that there are major targets in different areas of the United States.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  Orlando was one. LA was one where they just caught some guy trying to do this. San Fran, New York, Boston and Miami.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  And so, Tim Kennedy obviously has been involved in a lot of high-level anti-terrorism operations. 15 years of Special Forces currently does some of that.
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  But that's also super secret. It's also one of the hosts of the hit show, Hunting Hitler and the top UFC fighter as well.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  And one of the top snipers in the world and a fellow Austinite and good buddies of mine, a good friend, Shane Steiner.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  So here he is in the Info War. Glad to have you here with us, Tim. Thank you.
[35:45.000 --> 35:45.000]  Thanks for having me.
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  I'm all wound up with this E-mom saying, you know, in Orlando, the gays deserve to die. People saying, you know, attacking Trump, saying this isn't Islamic.
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.000]  Tim, what do you make of all this and where this is all going? You heard me go over some of my sources. Is that accurate from what you've heard if you can speak about it?
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  That's 100% accurate. You know, this is one of those, you know, we were talking about this like two weeks ago.
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.000]  This is one of those moments where I did not want to be right about this. You know, I didn't want to be right about killing of more Americans.
[36:15.000 --> 36:24.000]  Now, you know, a tragic part is that the LGBT group has kind of had been brushing elbows with Muslims saying, hey, we're both being persecuted.
[36:25.000 --> 36:35.000]  You know, like we can be pals about this. I promise there is no friendship from the Islam community towards the gays, lesbians, bisexuals, travesties.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  They don't care. They want them gone. They're going to throw them off roofs.
[36:38.000 --> 36:46.000]  It's in their book, Quran chapter seven verse 80 to 84. It says kill Muslims or to kill gays. That's what they want. That's what they do.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  You're having a Freudian slip there.
[36:49.000 --> 36:57.000]  The imams preach it. It's in their book and that community needs to wake up. LGBT wake up.
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  We talked about that two weeks ago, the videos on info wars. I think the headline was Muslims throw gays off buildings.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.000]  You've been over there. You've seen they're doing it all over. Why is there this leftist love of Islam?
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  That awkward silence is because I have no idea. Besides, it's another opportunity to destroy our country.
[37:19.000 --> 37:30.000]  That's why, you know, if, if you're going to find a group that wants to destroy everything about America, that we, that we, you, Alex and I, and all the other patriots love, Islam hates.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  They don't, they don't like tolerance. They don't like for you to have freedom of religion, sexual preference. They don't want any of that.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  And the authoritarian left can't take over America because despite its problems as better than anything else, the engine of free market, they can't compete against it.
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  They just want to blow it all up politically, bring in other allies because then they think they'll rule it.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  There one chance.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  What horrible despicable people. Don't they understand that radical Islam or mainline Islam wants to kill them?
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  We can't, we cannot, we can't, we can't say radical Islam anymore. It's a disservice.
[38:06.000 --> 38:06.000]  It is Islam.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  It is. You know, like, I get it. You're going to call me a bigot. You're going to say I'm racist.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  At this point now, how many, how, how many attacks later? How many, how many has there been? 20, 30, 40, 50?
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  And they can't cover them all up.
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  They can't. You know, 50-some people died last night. San Bernardino, countless, Paris, countless, Cologne, Germany, countless, Berlin, Stonings.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  You know, we're not even talking Syria, Iraq.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  Not to mention all the radical Muslims running around or Muslims raping all the women.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  This man in Orlando, he comes from a moderate Muslim family.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  There's nothing radical about him.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  There wasn't. The FBI looked at him in 13 and 14.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Yeah, let's put this guy on screen and play some of the gunshots in the background for TV viewers.
[38:45.000 --> 38:52.000]  We don't know what happened in 15. You know, maybe he was radicalized or whatever that could mean.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  No, it is the moderate Muslim community not keeping track of their own.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  I have worked with some of the most remarkable Muslims ever.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  Translators in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan that have been truly courageous humans.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  And they fought because they knew what terrorism was and they knew the difference.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  Listen to every single Muslim that's listening to this.
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  Your religion is going to die in the next 10 years if you guys don't start controlling these people.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  I believe in freedom of religion, as does Alex, as does every barrel-chested American.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  But your religion is going to die because you're letting it die because you're letting the extremists win.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  And that is what is happening.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  Well, I totally agree. Even though it's fair con, I went and interviewed him.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  He said, no, Islam needs a reformation. It's failed.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  And he admitted that he gets that he used to shoot his mouth off some about violence and things.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  Now he gets, this is going to create a conflagration.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  And I'm telling you, Islam isn't going to be left standing at the end of it.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  No.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Violence spawns violence.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  And let's face it, nobody does it better than the West once we get going.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  It blows my mind.
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  You're picking a fight with people that dropped, the only group of people that dropped nuclear bombs on somebody else.
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  That was us.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  You come and attack us at Pearl Harbor.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  We're going to level your cities.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  We're going to climb cliffs.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  We're going to come on your beaches.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  We're going to halo from the sky.
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  This is the greatest fighting force on the planet.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  And you're about to piss us off.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  And it's the American culture that came out of a thousand years of war on the continent, Europe and then here.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  They just don't get it.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  You're not going to beat us that way.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  You're going to piss us off.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  Now there is an element to the American spirit that we're going to take care of our week.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  That we're going to take care of those that can't take care of themselves.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  You know, it's in me.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  That's what justice is, right?
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  But they play that off on us and then just say, well, now accept us and let us put hoods on women's heads.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  And you're going to have to, oh, you shot that video with us Friday for the news that was powerful about, you know, Ramadan means you have to give up your freedom.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  And you use just a few examples of, you know, waitresses serving alcohol.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  So, you know, a Muslim on Ramadan spikes her head day one into a table.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  And they said, oh, give us more examples.
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  What do you mean? There's tens of thousands of examples where they want us to conform to them and it's wrong.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  You know, under Ramadan, okay, they're not supposed to have alcohol, right?
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  They're not supposed to be eating meat.
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  They're supposed to fast during the day.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  They're not supposed to partake in any sexual activity.
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  They're not supposed to fight.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  Last night, we had what is a Muslim that went and killed 50-something people.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  Why do they tend to attack so much during Ramadan?
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  Even though they're not supposed to fight?
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  They're not supposed to fight?
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  Because it's not considered fighting because they're killing what they're been told to kill.
[41:36.000 --> 41:36.000]  Infidels.
[41:37.000 --> 41:37.000]  Infidels.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  It's not against, it's not a sin.
[41:40.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's encouraged.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  It's actually like a pat on the back.
[41:44.000 --> 41:44.000]  Good job.
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  Even though this is a time for reflection and peace, you just killed some men.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  I want to play a clip before we go to break and then come back and go through all the details of this and talk about more targets.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  But let's play this E-mom.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  This is Ian Orlando.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  This is up on infowars.com.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  Emondbroderport.com as well, Tim Kennedy is here with us.
[42:00.000 --> 42:00.000]  E-mon, speaking on Orlando, said gays must be killed out of compassion.
[42:02.000 --> 42:02.000]  Here's that clip.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  Death is the sentence.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  I mean, look.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  It's nothing to be embarrassed about this.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  Death is the sentence.
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  Well, we have to have that compassion for people.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  Homosexuality is the same.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  Out of compassion, let's get rid of him now.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  Out of compassion, we killed him.
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.480]  kill him. He's so slimy too, so creepy. I don't want that guy anywhere near my daughters.
[42:28.480 --> 42:33.600]  I don't want that guy on the face of the planet. That's because you're a homophobe. You don't
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.680]  want him to kill the gays, so you're the bad one. See, that's why I don't get the left hates us
[42:38.240 --> 42:43.600]  because we don't want to kill them. I want to save them. This is your chance.
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.480]  If you're part of the LGBT community, rally together and realize this is going to be the
[42:48.480 --> 42:53.520]  fight for your life, not against conservatives, not against the GOP, against radical Islam.
[42:53.520 --> 42:57.760]  Absolutely right. Just come on, people. Come up for oxygen. We'll be right back.
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.800]  Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.440]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them. Today, everything the
[43:33.440 --> 43:38.880]  government does at every level is concealed from us. We have trade deals to manage our economy
[43:38.880 --> 43:43.040]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see. Later in life, Patrick Henry
[43:43.040 --> 43:47.440]  looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was
[43:47.440 --> 43:53.760]  different. Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort,
[43:53.760 --> 44:17.520]  when we should be demanding liberty. Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites,
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.240]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now,
[44:22.240 --> 44:28.240]  with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[44:28.240 --> 44:31.360]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things
[44:31.360 --> 44:35.600]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.480]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm glad
[44:40.480 --> 44:43.920]  we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday,
[44:43.920 --> 44:48.160]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your

[46:06.960 --> 46:12.880]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze. It's an energy-efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification system. It has
[46:12.880 --> 46:17.920]  a four-stage purification process. It has a HEPA filter, pre-filters, and a carbon-activated
[46:17.920 --> 46:23.200]  filters. And the most amazing thing about it is it has this patented ion cluster technology
[46:23.200 --> 46:28.720]  that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water. So this is non-toxic.
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.640]  It's a beautiful unit. It really looks good. I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a
[46:32.640 --> 46:38.720]  corner. The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan. It's super quiet. The cheapest equivalent
[46:38.720 --> 46:44.960]  unit costs $259.95. And there are other units that are up to $899 to $1,000 to do exactly what this
[46:44.960 --> 46:50.960]  unit does. But they're not as quiet because this one has a silent mode, which runs at 16 decibels.
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.600]  Go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside all the time. Great job, Alexa Pure,
[46:55.600 --> 46:58.400]  infowarsstore.com. Buckley, thank you so much, my friend.
[46:58.400 --> 47:05.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:05.520 --> 47:22.800]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[47:28.320 --> 47:31.920]  All right, I'm gonna try to slow down here and go over everything with Tim Kennedy. He's riding
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.560]  a shotgun with us a lot in the next hour, maybe longer. We're gonna have a rob do from Europe
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.000]  over there covering Bilderberg, the very group that opened the borders. He stabilized them at
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.960]  least brought in the Islamists. This is part of an admitted destabilization program. Tim Kennedy's
[47:44.960 --> 47:50.240]  been here three times last month. Warning of exactly this effect. Tomorrow we'll have more of the crew
[47:50.240 --> 47:54.720]  and actually go get those clips with all these predictions down coming true. So during that
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.520]  three minute break, we covered a lot of key stuff that should be on air. Let's start with the nature
[47:59.520 --> 48:07.760]  of the targets they hit. The frequency getting faster, the attacks being more intense. The FBI
[48:07.760 --> 48:12.400]  we know was ordered to San Bernardino to stand down to not go after these folks two years before.
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.080]  Same thing with this guy. So Tim Kennedy, I know you can't get into classified stuff,
[48:16.080 --> 48:19.840]  but you do anti-terrorism stuff, not just overseas, but obviously domestically. We'll just
[48:20.720 --> 48:26.160]  leave it at that. With your best expertise or probably is out there, let's walk through why
[48:26.160 --> 48:32.160]  they hit this target. What's coming next? First, we're looking at who they're going after.
[48:32.960 --> 48:36.480]  They're going after somebody that was fundamentally against their religion.
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.560]  That was the lesbian, gay, transvestite community. They're like, ah, we don't like them. We're looking
[48:42.560 --> 48:49.200]  for any way to kill somebody that doesn't align with us. Artheology. And groveling to them didn't
[48:49.200 --> 48:57.280]  mean anything. Even though the LGBT community has been supporting the Muslim call for the racism
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.280]  and the prejudice like, hey, we have a similar cause. It's not the case. They specifically
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.280]  targeted you and they're going to continue to do that just like they were in LA. So first was who
[49:05.280 --> 49:13.200]  they're going after. It was the LGBT. Second was the location. It's a soft target. They're cowards.
[49:13.200 --> 49:18.320]  They are complete, gutless, impotent worms. And they're never going to go after you.
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.200]  They're not going to go after me. We're here in Texas, right? We have our houses that have
[49:23.200 --> 49:27.600]  elements of security that we're not going to talk about. They're going to a place that
[49:27.600 --> 49:33.840]  no guns are allowed. They know that at a bar in the United States, business that primarily
[49:33.840 --> 49:38.320]  sells alcohol, you're not allowed to have a firearm. So it is a gun-free zone. That's what
[49:38.320 --> 49:43.440]  Pulse is. And he was a registered Democrat with a New York firearms license as a security guard.
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.720]  So he went through all the hoops. He followed the law perfectly. They want to pass more laws.
[49:48.720 --> 49:52.880]  They don't follow the law. He broke the law by going to a nightclub with a gun where there
[49:52.880 --> 50:00.240]  were no other guns to stop him. What stopped the guy with the gun? Dudes with guns. Outside
[50:00.240 --> 50:06.160]  Dallas and Garland. Keep going. And same here. The way that we stopped this shooter was we shot
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.800]  him. He was going to keep shooting people. It wouldn't have been 50. It wouldn't have been 100.
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.280]  It would have been 200 or 300 had he not had a bullet go through his body.
[50:15.280 --> 50:20.080]  This guy is such a demon. So continuing, getting into the, you heard me list those cities they
[50:20.080 --> 50:26.640]  say are the next targets. What's being deployed? So fortunately, they're not the smartest people.
[50:27.440 --> 50:32.240]  When they're recruited, ISIS is recruiting the weak, the unintelligent, the impoverished,
[50:33.200 --> 50:36.560]  the people that they can actually plant seeds in fertile soil that they can
[50:36.560 --> 50:42.640]  try to convert into radical Islam. And so the level of sophistication,
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.080]  so this guy had a bomb vest, couldn't even use it. He wished he could have,
[50:48.080 --> 50:51.200]  instead of it being 50, it would have been a few hundred when he finally ran out of bullets. But
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.480]  LA, they're trying to do the same thing. Just like they're going to try to do in San Francisco,
[50:56.480 --> 50:59.120]  just like they're going to try to do in New York, just like they're going to try to do in Boston,
[50:59.120 --> 51:02.320]  just like they're going to try to do in Miami. But it's a very decentralized,
[51:02.320 --> 51:09.040]  kind of indirect form of control. So what you do is you identify somebody that is
[51:10.400 --> 51:14.880]  radical enough, extreme enough to go kill somebody else. And once they identify that
[51:14.880 --> 51:19.200]  person, then they empower them. They try to connect them with an Imam that can give them the tools
[51:19.200 --> 51:22.080]  or the little bit of maybe like the push off the cliff.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.040]  The spiritual backing.
[51:23.040 --> 51:25.440]  Yeah, what we'll call it spiritual backing, but really it's-
[51:25.440 --> 51:26.160]  The brainwashing.
[51:26.160 --> 51:35.440]  Yeah, the ideological infusion into their soul that will go and just kill helpless people,
[51:35.440 --> 51:38.720]  women, children, people dancing in a nightclub unarmed.
[51:40.400 --> 51:44.800]  So once that decentralized activation goes, then it's kind of like a
[51:46.480 --> 51:50.960]  bees or ants with their pheromones, right? It's not like I'm telling a cell in LA,
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.040]  go do this, go kill these guys. I'm saying, all right, here's an opportunity.
[51:55.040 --> 51:57.600]  As we had this conversation earlier, you talked about, I came in here and repeated it
[51:57.600 --> 52:00.960]  with folks here this is the second time, but that's a good allegory. It's like the bees
[52:00.960 --> 52:01.600]  with the pheromones.
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.240]  Yeah, it's perfect. You definitely hit the nail on the head. They're not coordinated enough
[52:06.240 --> 52:10.000]  to, they're connected, but not coordinated. They're not, can you do this at this time?
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.800]  Let's sync our watches. Here we go, three, two, one. It's not to that degree a sophistication
[52:14.800 --> 52:20.560]  like army special operations. They wish that they were, but you watch ISIS recruiting videos
[52:20.560 --> 52:21.440]  or they're special ops.
[52:21.440 --> 52:22.560]  Looks like clowns.
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.800]  Yeah. Clowns and black robes. Yeah. That have mental problems. That's really it is.
[52:28.800 --> 52:30.880]  That is the level of sophistication. I don't want to make jokes.
[52:30.880 --> 52:34.880]  So what do you expect to happen? I mean, from the Intel, we're getting the, they,
[52:34.880 --> 52:37.760]  they plan to hit at least four or five more cities.
[52:39.440 --> 52:42.560]  I was here right after Paris and I said, it's going to, it's, it's getting going.
[52:42.560 --> 52:47.920]  San Bernardino, same thing. I'm like, don't, don't stop. Don't slow down. It is two weeks ago.
[52:47.920 --> 52:52.000]  You said, we can pull the video up. You said they're activating the cells. Get ready.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.360]  Why did you say that? Cause I mean, I guess you can't tell us, but the point is,
[52:55.360 --> 53:01.440]  is that just a hunch or no, it's not. I can't, I can't say, you know, where I'm getting or
[53:01.440 --> 53:05.920]  who's telling me or how I know, but I'm telling you, it's about to get worse.
[53:06.720 --> 53:10.240]  This is not the beginning. This, we are, we, you're the quiet professionals.
[53:12.240 --> 53:15.520]  It's not like they're knocking on the door. They're through the door. We already let them in.
[53:15.520 --> 53:17.040]  I say we, I didn't let them in.
[53:17.040 --> 53:19.760]  But good people in the government of tracking, and that's my point earlier.
[53:19.760 --> 53:23.280]  We know the FBI, federal marshals in, in this case, and San Bernardino
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.240]  and major Asan are all ordered to stand down. Why is Obama ordering him to stand down?
[53:28.240 --> 53:30.720]  He'd be a hero if you let him take them out. What's going on there?
[53:31.920 --> 53:35.840]  They're, so they're being tracked. We know this guy was being tracked in 2013, 2014.
[53:35.840 --> 53:38.480]  We don't know what happened in 2015. He kind of dropped off the radar.
[53:38.480 --> 53:41.520]  Same thing with the San Bernardino guys. Like they were being tracked and they said,
[53:42.160 --> 53:45.280]  maybe we'll just leave them alone. Cause we don't want to, you know,
[53:45.280 --> 53:50.240]  seem like we're being prejudiced, but they, the dogs are being called off.
[53:50.240 --> 53:53.680]  There are guys in the FBI, in the CIA, in local law enforcement
[53:54.400 --> 53:58.960]  that will go and hook and book these guys. Cause there's enough evidence to say they want to do
[53:58.960 --> 54:02.880]  bad. Are we a nation though that just because we think they're going to do something bad,
[54:03.600 --> 54:04.400]  we're going to stop them?
[54:04.400 --> 54:08.160]  Well, here's the problem. If you pledge allegiance to a foreign power, like ISIS,
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.400]  a foreign citizens own state and, and, and then he, they admit a year and a half ago,
[54:12.400 --> 54:14.800]  he pledged allegiance arresting right then. If you have the proof.
[54:14.800 --> 54:16.240]  He's a traitor. That's it.
[54:16.240 --> 54:21.440]  He says he's aligned with a foreign power and is intending to go out and, I mean, it's a done deal.
[54:22.160 --> 54:25.840]  In my, in my mind, absolutely. Not only a done deal in the sense that,
[54:27.280 --> 54:31.440]  he should have cuffs and be sitting in a jail, but as a soldier, he's an enemy.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.440]  I'll, I'll bury that guy.
[54:33.440 --> 54:36.240]  That's the problem. His parents were from Afghanistan. He was a citizen.
[54:36.240 --> 54:40.000]  So overall, we know the danger, but if we have the proof, I mean,
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.160]  what jury isn't going to evict this guy of conspiracy?
[54:42.160 --> 54:45.120]  And he says, I pledge allegiance to ISIS. You just pledged allegiance to a group
[54:45.120 --> 54:47.360]  who says its code is to go and kill everybody.
[54:47.920 --> 54:52.160]  Then his dad says, man, you know, we were walking down the street and he saw him.
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.880]  He, you know, he saw these two guys kiss and I, and he got really mad about it.
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.960]  You know, and maybe that's what set him off. That was a couple of months ago.
[54:58.960 --> 54:59.920]  His dad's making excuses.
[54:59.920 --> 55:04.640]  Yeah, he is. Absolutely. He, he is his dad. Who's, who's a Muslim? You know,
[55:06.560 --> 55:11.600]  let this happen. His dad knew that his son had been radicalized.
[55:11.600 --> 55:14.640]  He knew that his son had pledged himself to ISIS.
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.000]  He knew that his son wanted to hurt gays.
[55:18.720 --> 55:20.640]  Well, let me ask you this then. And then he let it happen.
[55:21.360 --> 55:23.520]  Obviously the frequency is getting more intense.
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.280]  The amount of people getting killed is more intense.
[55:25.840 --> 55:26.880]  What's the metric here?
[55:26.880 --> 55:30.480]  Just your dead reckoning or, or, or, I mean, America needs this warning.
[55:30.480 --> 55:32.480]  What's the intel and how bad this is going to get?
[55:32.480 --> 55:35.040]  Because I'm no rocket scientist. We bring 5 million into Europe,
[55:35.040 --> 55:37.600]  hundreds of thousands in here that's suppressing the real number.
[55:37.600 --> 55:39.760]  Because we've gone and documented every school in Austin's got like
[55:39.760 --> 55:41.360]  a high school where I went.
[55:41.360 --> 55:45.360]  Anderson's 232 people from Syria just this year.
[55:45.360 --> 55:46.640]  Every other high school's hundreds.
[55:46.640 --> 55:48.240]  That's just the high schools we call the other schools.
[55:48.240 --> 55:50.160]  Yeah, we've got hundreds. They're freaking out.
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.000]  A school of 2,000 has hundreds of people from one country there saying,
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.280]  take care of them in Arabic.
[55:55.280 --> 55:57.680]  They're telling girls, don't wear short skirts. Everybody's freaking out.
[55:57.680 --> 55:59.600]  The number must be giant, Tim.
[55:59.600 --> 56:02.480]  And, and, and so I'm saying you have 10% are radical.
[56:02.480 --> 56:05.520]  And in the polls, 25% say they support suicide bombing.
[56:05.520 --> 56:07.360]  So let's say 25% are radical.
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.200]  Let's say 1% act on that.
[56:09.200 --> 56:11.520]  We're still talking about tens of thousands of combatants here.
[56:11.520 --> 56:11.920]  Yeah.
[56:11.920 --> 56:13.280]  So, so what's the metric?
[56:13.280 --> 56:14.800]  I said that same question two weeks ago.
[56:14.800 --> 56:18.960]  And I said, you know, in my mind, there's very few options.
[56:19.520 --> 56:22.480]  There's get them out, kill them, or convert them.
[56:23.120 --> 56:24.160]  Convert, I'm not saying like they,
[56:24.160 --> 56:25.360]  Yeah, we just convert them to freedom.
[56:25.360 --> 56:26.160]  What is their problem?
[56:26.160 --> 56:26.640]  That's what I'm saying.
[56:26.640 --> 56:27.760]  I'm not saying they have to be Christian.
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.480]  I'm saying they cannot be the, the, wherever that line is,
[56:32.480 --> 56:34.640]  what radical extreme Islam is.
[56:34.640 --> 56:37.760]  It has to be recognized by the Islam and Muslim community.
[56:37.760 --> 56:40.560]  And it has to be bastardized.
[56:40.560 --> 56:43.920]  It has to be, it has to be recognized to be a threat to their.
[56:43.920 --> 56:44.560]  I'll say this.
[56:44.560 --> 56:46.880]  I finally saw the National Islamic Council,
[56:46.880 --> 56:48.640]  whatever on TV, halfway apologizing,
[56:48.640 --> 56:50.000]  say this isn't Islam when this is.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.360]  So, I mean, they better start really getting their stack together.
[56:54.240 --> 56:57.040]  And that half-ass apology is that does not do it.
[56:57.040 --> 56:58.240]  When you're saying it's not Islam,
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.240]  you now have to say this has taken over what Islam was.
[57:02.240 --> 57:05.360]  Islam might have been a beautiful religion.
[57:05.360 --> 57:06.400]  It is no longer that.
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.160]  Here, and I'll take you on further.
[57:08.160 --> 57:09.040]  I'm really angry.
[57:09.040 --> 57:11.360]  And I mean, physically angry at the left,
[57:11.360 --> 57:14.080]  saying my guns are to blame, veterans are to blame,
[57:14.080 --> 57:14.960]  gun cultures to blame.
[57:14.960 --> 57:16.240]  It's all over the news.
[57:16.240 --> 57:18.960]  Take my guns and then act like I did something
[57:18.960 --> 57:21.840]  so I could be killed by these radical jihadists you're bringing in.
[57:21.840 --> 57:24.880]  I mean, they just killed 50 plus of your people
[57:24.880 --> 57:26.320]  who I have nothing against.
[57:26.320 --> 57:27.440]  And then you're blaming me.
[57:28.480 --> 57:29.600]  I mean, this is wrong.
[57:29.600 --> 57:30.800]  This is out of control.
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.120]  Get your basic instincts for survival back.

[57:42.720 --> 57:44.400]  and back in this whole Islamic invasion.

[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.960]  From his central Texas command center
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.280]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.680]  Tim Kennedy, terrorism expert, 15 years special forces
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.800]  part of some of the most secretive elite units out there.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.440]  And I obviously can't get into all that
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.120]  but let me tell you, he's the guy to talk about this.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.960]  He's the guy to break this down and hopefully,
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.960]  this is unfolds the next few days,
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.520]  we can get some intel or even file reports from the road.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.160]  We have Joe Biggs, he's on the ground,
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.440]  he's trying to get to the site of the nightclub shooting,
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.360]  50 plus dead, over 60 wounded.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.680]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.400]  Rob is joining us but you're making other amazing points.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.040]  Tim, in the last 70 seconds of break,
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.160]  go back to what you were just talking about
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.840]  being in Kuwait 11 days ago and you're all over the world
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.040]  and what they admit to you, how they export the terror
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:01.920]  all over the world.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.720]  It was a basic conversation with some of the representatives
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.320]  of the Kuwaiti government that was with us
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.600]  about why there are few instances of terrorism
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.160]  in the Arab Union, countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.040]  And flat out they said, well, when somebody gets radicalized here,
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.400]  we just export them.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.280]  What do you mean, export them?
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.200]  These are Kuwaitis that were raised here in moderate Muslim
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.640]  and then they get to a point where we're really
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.800]  liking religion but they want to hurt other people
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.920]  that don't like the religion enough.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.720]  So then you send them somewhere else to go do these dastardly deeds.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.320]  And they're like, yeah, absolutely matter of fact.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.200]  It was just commonplace that they just didn't want it
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.120]  to happen in Kuwait so they have enough money
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.800]  that they just ship them somewhere else.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.600]  Exactly, which then actually spreads their radical form,
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.200]  now the dominant form, regardless of Islam,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.400]  to take over the world.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.360]  And that's why you can Google this, Associated Press.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.760]  Saudi Arabia has not taken one quote Syrian refugee,
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.560]  not one, that's their failed invasion force
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.920]  where they take their families with them
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.400]  to steal the houses and swimming pools and everything else.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.720]  So they fail, then Turkey brings them in.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.960]  In fact, we can put that on screen for TV viewers.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.840]  This is incredible.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.600]  Tim Kennedy, big picture.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.160]  Why is Obama doing this?
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.920]  I know you work for him, you're still in the military.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.000]  Why are they doing, I mean, I know this is the big debate,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.640]  the military.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.200]  I don't know why.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.240]  I think the simple answer is that
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.240]  when we're all looking at one thing,
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.560]  it makes it so easy to do anything else.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.840]  So if we're all looking at radical Islam,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.320]  which we should be because they're killing us
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  and they're destroying our way of life,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.880]  while we do that, it gives them a reason
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.480]  to do all the things that they want to.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.840]  They try to take our guns.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.640]  They give us to break into iPhones and say,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.960]  oh, the San Bernardino terrorists had an iPhone.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.680]  So we should be able to have access to all iPhones.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.400]  But they ordered the FBI to stand down,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.120]  going after the people.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.360]  No, that's it.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.480]  So they're going to use this attacks.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.360]  It's like Europe's already done.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.680]  We know to take the liberties and say,
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.600]  Germans, you can't criticize radical Islam.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.520]  We're going to arrest you or Islam, period.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.520]  We're going to find you.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.720]  I mean, our reporters have video,
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.800]  people trying to hand out nationalist flyers,
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.720]  mainline stuff against open borders,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.880]  are being fined or arrested in Germany.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.920]  It's happening here.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.640]  I have a friend, it's an ongoing investigation,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.320]  so I don't want to throw him under the bus here.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.000]  There's a prior Special Forces guy
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.880]  that he was a human guy.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.480]  So he worked human intelligence.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.600]  He worked informants.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.680]  And he was told that a mosque here was-
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.480]  It's awesome.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.680]  No, no, in the United States,
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.720]  I'm not going to get specific,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.880]  was radicalizing, specifically training
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.320]  and preparing people to go do terrorism.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.200]  So he went to that mosque and confronted them.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.560]  He is being charged with a hate crime.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.040]  Wow.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.800]  It's happening here, just like it.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.360]  So talking to a group of a known religion
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.280]  that's pushing world by death,
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.640]  the attacks on Christians have doubled.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.840]  The UN admits that.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.760]  Hundreds of thousands killed last year alone.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.480]  And you go and say,
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.680]  hey, I hear this is going on,
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.280]  and then you can charge the hate crime for your speech.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.120]  This labeling thing that we're doing too,
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.600]  where we're calling it a hate crime or workplace violence,
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.320]  it's all the same damn thing.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.080]  Oh, I wonder if Obama will call
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.680]  the Orlando shooting workplace violence,
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.680]  like he did San Bernardino.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.040]  Or even if he calls it a hate crime,
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.440]  because it was against gays.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.400]  It's just anything but.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.080]  He has now, it's terrorism,
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.760]  and Obama's calling it a hate crime.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.640]  It's the same thing.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.360]  I don't care if you call it workplace violence,
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.160]  it's still terrorism.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:36.640]  I don't care.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.640]  Let me ask you this when we come back from break,
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.240]  Tim Kennedy, and I want you to think about this.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:40.960]  This is a short break.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.560]  It's a 60 second break.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.360]  I want to ask you this question
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.480]  when we rejoin some stations.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.000]  What are they going to do
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.560]  when it's not 12 or 14 or 15 attacks,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.000]  but 100, 200, 300?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.360]  Because we know the metrics,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.800]  the numbers it's building towards that.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.760]  What are they going to do?
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.200]  How are they going to spend that one?
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.040]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.600]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.440]  Please listen carefully,
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.720]  because I'm about to point out
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.040]  three things that will save you a lot of money
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.720]  while you get high quality products
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.080]  and fund the info war.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.360]  A 360 win.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.080]  Number one,
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.080]  when you choose auto ship before checkout,
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.920]  we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.560]  Number two,
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.160]  you're also able to get items
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.120]  that are out of stock
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.640]  when you sign up for auto ship,
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.840]  because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.880]  Number three,
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.480]  we're giving you free shipping
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.880]  on all orders above $50.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.120]  Listeners have been requesting this for years,
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.800]  because it's so easy to forget
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.960]  to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.640]  Just go to infowarsore.com,
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.640]  select your favorite product or products,
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.680]  click on auto ship,
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.800]  and choose how often
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.720]  you want us to send you another order.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.600]  As you know,
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.360]  I coined the term 360 win,
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.800]  and with the new auto ship feature
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.080]  at infowarslife.com,
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.520]  this is a sure win.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.040]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.440]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com,
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.360]  free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.040]  And all out of stock items
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.080]  are never out of stock
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.360]  when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:08.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:19.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.080]  Look, folks, you can say what you want
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.760]  about the United States mid-east policy.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.960]  You can say what you want about any of this.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.360]  There's only one Stone Age region of the world
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.800]  that actually has the power
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.160]  to launch attacks in other nations,
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.040]  and that's the Middle East.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.520]  And women are property there.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.800]  It is literal hell on earth.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.200]  The few areas that weren't that radical
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.160]  have been invaded
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.520]  and our government's backing it.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.880]  Anderson Cooper from the CIA, formerly,
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.280]  he would sit there and praise the Arab Spring,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.560]  you know, kicking out our allies
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.240]  where people can live in peace and,
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.600]  you know, putting in the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.560]  the South Qaeda light.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.360]  And so our own military the last four years
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.080]  has told Obama,
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080]  we're not going to back ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.360]  I don't care if he changed the name in Syria.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.720]  So instead, Saudi Arabia has turned to proxy armies
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.520]  flooding the West.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.320]  And I believe, it's clear the West has done this,
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.160]  that criminals in our own governments,
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.800]  NATO and others allied with Saudi Arabia,
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.640]  have intentionally brought these people in.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.960]  They've advertised and are actually using it
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.080]  as a way to threaten political decapitation
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:38.560]  in the West.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.400]  Because even if these are ham-fisted operators,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.440]  if you activate, let's say,
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.200]  conservatively in Europe, 100,000 jihadis.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.360]  And I think out of 5 million, 80% military,
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.880]  I think that's a very conservative number.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.680]  Tim Kennedy's an expert,
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.160]  am I wrong?
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.200]  Let's just say 100,000.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.680]  That would be a crippling effect,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.480]  especially in this culture of just, you know,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.080]  they're talking about a civil emergency
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.200]  in Florida right now.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.680]  The governor once won over 50-something dead.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.640]  Imagine 10 attacks in your town a week.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.000]  Because they got the people.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.160]  I mean, I go to the domain up here in North Austin,
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.320]  it looks like I'm in Islamabad.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.760]  I go to Barton Creek,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.920]  there's just women wearing full burkas.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.960]  And I'm like,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.720]  I actually had an anxiety attack about a month ago,
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.360]  my daughter's there,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.240]  because they were looking at us weird,
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.520]  and there were all these men laughing at me,
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.360]  and I turn a corner, there's more, and I'm like,
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360]  and it's just like, it's so alien, folks,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.960]  to have women as prisoners.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.960]  But it's, oh, it's trendy in the liberal sites,
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.360]  oh, here's how you wear a hijab, and how you do it.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.920]  I mean, it's freaking me out, I don't like it.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.800]  It's clearly a plan to destabilize everything.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.160]  How do we expose that?
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:38.960]  That's the question.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.240]  And then I was asking you a question too,
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.160]  before the break, and I, Jim Kennedy,
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.200]  I forget what it was.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:43.840]  What was it?
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.960]  It was some big question about,
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.840]  why are they doing it?
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.040]  How big is it gonna get?
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.480]  Do you remember?
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:48.800]  Yeah.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.640]  And the answer is,
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.160]  it's gonna continue to grow until we, as a people,
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.880]  grab our balls and do something about it.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.040]  We can't be politically correct.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.200]  We can't demonstrate tolerance.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.400]  We have to,
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.760]  we are at war for our existence right now.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.120]  When you can walk down the street,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.080]  and there's a Burkini,
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.440]  which is like a swimsuit that covers somebody from head to toe.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.280]  Being sold in downtown Austin,
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.560]  so you can go onto the river
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.120]  and enjoy your beautiful Austin weather,
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.640]  covered in black garments.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.440]  We're in a fight for our life.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.880]  And so what do we need to do?
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.600]  We, as a people, need to get strong
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.200]  and appreciate that there's now an implied responsibility
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.520]  for us to, we got to be activated.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.920]  We have to get turned on.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.120]  We have to wake up.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.400]  We have to start training.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.360]  If somebody's gonna walk in
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.120]  and has the ability and the capability
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.120]  to start mowing down 50,
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.800]  now 110 people,
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.480]  is that how many people he shot total?
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.880]  50 some are dead, 60 now wounded.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.160]  If there's one person like me there,
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.600]  one person like our friend Shane,
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.640]  one person like my partner,
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.840]  Blank from Sheepdog,
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.800]  it would have changed,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.200]  it takes one person to change-
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.360]  Tell folks about Sheepdog response.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.560]  It's not that it needs to be plugged.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.360]  You have waiting lists to get involved in it.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.480]  But we were talking about this Friday
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.800]  when you were here about getting back to us being men,
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.640]  being prepared, being involved.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.600]  That's the answer.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.320]  So when somebody attacks a nightclub or whatever it is,
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.600]  folks are shooting back.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.000]  That's the answer is to have a security plan,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.960]  not to run up a white flag to these people
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.880]  like the left is doing, saying right now,
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.160]  blame the Second Amendment.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.800]  That's to me what is so incredibly outrageous.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.400]  Idiotic and moronic.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.200]  When you look, I don't know how many gunfights I've been in,
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.320]  but I'll tell you that I have watched al-Qaeda,
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.680]  I've watched Taliban,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.080]  I've watched ISIS walk into villages,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.160]  mowing everybody down effortlessly
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.120]  because there's not one person that would stand up to them.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.800]  But the moment that one person,
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.800]  it takes one, one person, shows resistance and shoots back,
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.640]  it changes the chemistry of everything.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.520]  Well, look at Benghazi,
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.600]  what was it, at least over 500 groups,
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.800]  seven or eight ways.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.160]  500 dudes, yeah.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.480]  Again, how many, 10?
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.920]  Yeah, 10 shooters.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.920]  It took 10 guys to stop up to 500 terrorists, right?
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.480]  So we have one shooter in Orlando,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.000]  two shooters in San Bernardino,
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.440]  what was it, eight in Paris?
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.560]  It is not that many,
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.760]  it just takes one or two dudes with the training
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.600]  and the prepared mind to stay.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.440]  Obviously the problem is Islam,
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.800]  it's not our Second Amendment,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.160]  how obvious is that?
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.560]  It's our Second Amendment that is gonna save us.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.360]  It's Islam that's trying to kill us.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.160]  Now, again, I go back to this then.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.760]  What is the thinking in the military?
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.360]  What is the thinking, again,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.960]  of good people that want to protect this nation,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.360]  who I know, who are great folks,
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.920]  to then see Obama saying,
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.360]  this isn't Islam, we need to let more people in.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.360]  He doesn't let the Christians in, though.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.480]  Even though they're 20% and are trying to get out of Syria,
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.720]  it's less than 1%, he lets in.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.520]  It's 0.7, clearly they're out to get Christians.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.720]  What is the thinking?
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.120]  I mean, because I get we're supposed to,
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.920]  people in the military like yourself follow orders of the president,
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.720]  but what happens when those orders violate common sense,
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.720]  the Constitution, and just basic humanity?
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.120]  There's definitely degrees of frustration
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.120]  and trying to figure out the best solution.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.720]  So we know what our problem is, right?
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.720]  When we say, oh, we got to,
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.320]  just like the FBI in San Bernardino,
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320]  we know that these guys are bad
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.720]  and we figure out a way to maybe do something about it,
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720]  but they just couldn't figure out a solution.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.720]  It's kind of the same with the military right now,
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.720]  where they're saying,
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.920]  it doesn't matter what the name is of the group in Syria,
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.120]  we're not going to support them.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.720]  You can call them ISIL, you can call them ISIS,
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.920]  you can call them al-Qaeda,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.920]  you can call them whatever the hell you want.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.920]  We're still not going to support them.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.920]  But here, we're trying to, you know, we're frustrated.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.920]  The military is frustrated.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.920]  We're trying to find a solution
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.920]  that means that we can still keep our oath,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920]  that we can do the right thing,
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.920]  that we can follow orders,
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.920]  but most importantly, we can stay true to our morals,
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.920]  our integrity and our ethics,
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920]  and protect justice and freedom.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.920]  But it is hard, right?
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.920]  Let me ask you this question,
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.920]  and this was the question before the break,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.920]  the key one that ties us all together.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.920]  What is the metric if,
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.920]  I mean, how many from the statistics,
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.920]  I mean, many polls,
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.920]  excuse me, about 25% in Europe and here,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.920]  say they sympathize with suicide bombers,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.920]  that's just Muslims pulled across the board.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.920]  What are the numbers?
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.920]  Are just dead reckoning a low estimate
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.920]  how bad are these sleeper cell attacks going to get?
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.920]  Because as you said,
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.920]  it's just as they turn up the heat,
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.920]  as ISIS orders the attacks to take place,
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.920]  it happens, the media tries to cover it up,
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.920]  how many attacks will it take
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.920]  until the government that has brought these people in,
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.920]  in Europe or here,
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.920]  is held accountable?
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.920]  Because here's the thing, Obama,
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.920]  you're not blaming the Second Amendment
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.920]  that our forebears fought for, everybody else fought for,
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.920]  and the First Amendment and our free-open culture
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.920]  piss all over.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.920]  You're not going to sit there and blame
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.920]  what happened in Florida on us.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.920]  Do you understand, you son of a bitch?
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.920]  I don't usually talk like that,
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.920]  but it's clear there's about to be a bunch more attacks.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920]  And I'm not going to sit here and take the blame for it,
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920]  because the Daily Beast and Media Matter says so.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.920]  You're declaring war on this country
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.920]  with a bunch of jihadis you brought in.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.920]  You did it, you son of a bitch.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.920]  I'm sorry, but that's what it comes down to.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.920]  And the games are over.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.920]  I'm not going to sit here and have my family
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.920]  and this country scapegoated
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.920]  because you're a slimeball that hates this country
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.920]  and is allied with a bunch of people who are in nightgowns.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.920]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.920]  You said it all.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.920]  You did.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.920]  We have to start fighting back.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.920]  We're going to rob you after the break,
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.920]  and then Biggs is getting in position there at the nightclub.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.920]  Other angles to this.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.920]  I rarely get this mad, folks.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.920]  I mean, I'm really getting tired of this.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.920]  It's a nightmare. It's like logic has been killed, Tim.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.920]  They have allowed these people in.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.920]  They're attacking us.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.920]  And then the news blames us.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.920]  You asked, how bad is it going to get?
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920]  It's going to get way, way worse.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.920]  It is statistically proven
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.920]  as Islam increases
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.920]  percentage-wise in the nation
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.920]  as does the terrorist attacks.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.920]  So we were
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.920]  one, two percent over the past decade.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.920]  Now we're at three to four percent.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.920]  And we are on trend when we reach the eight to nine
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920]  that we should be at the end of next year
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.920]  will pretty much be tripling
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.920]  the number of terrorist attacks that we had this year.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.920]  So we had
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.920]  eight this year.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.920]  That they couldn't sweep under the rug.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.920]  Yeah, that we absolutely,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.920]  without an unequivocal doubt,
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.920]  conclusively know that we can call these terrorist attacks
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.920]  regardless of what...
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.920]  So what happens next year? What's the metric?
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.920]  Fifty?
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.920]  Fifty big ones.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.920]  And then the next?
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.920]  Five hundred?
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.920]  And the thing is, they laugh two years ago
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.920]  and say, we're going to flood you with migrants.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.920]  And Merkel goes, ah, ISIS said they were going to flood Europe.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.920]  I mean, the thing is, they tell us what they're going to do.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.920]  They do it. And they do it.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.920]  And our president opens the door.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.920]  Tim Kennedy is our guest.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.920]  Keepdogresponse.com, Alex Jones.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:17.920]  Hello, our reporters from Europe straight ahead.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.920]  Pro Max shower filter from Pro Pure today.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.920]  3-3-1-3-9
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.920]  We have a biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.920]  These are all parasites.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.920]  Tell us about all the stuff we said. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.920]  You have the neem in there.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.920]  You have the organic clove bud.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.920]  The organic wormwood.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.920]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.920]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.920]  because I'm going back on it today.

[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.920]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.920]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.920]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:54.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:05.920]  And we're talking Orthodox Islam is what we're seeing here.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.920]  Sure. It's the new dominant Islam. It's the old Islam. It's back.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.920]  And Tim's right. It's not just radical Islam.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.920]  That is what is dominating Islam today.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.920]  And it says it's going to kill everybody that doesn't convert.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920]  And it's bizarre.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.920]  It's crazy to see the Second Amendment all over the news.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920]  From CNN to even Fox, blaming the Second Amendment.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.920]  We see all these training manuals and home lands curty.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.600]  When there's no metrics of terrorism from those groups, that's who Homeland Security is geared up
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:37.740]  Against I think political correctness is bit off more than they could shoot trying to make this alliance with Islam
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.980]  And and the low-level folks that want to grovel to it and kiss its butt
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:45.480]  They're going to be absolutely attacked because Islam attacks weak targets
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.880]  I mean, it's really clear that these jihadis really are cowards and Tim personally
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880]  He doesn't want to say the numbers that has killed hundreds of himself
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:59.440]  Okay, and he can attest to that and it's very frustrating to me who doesn't claim that you know, I'm the toughest guy in the world
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.660]  But I've never backed down from a fight if somebody wants to have one
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.840]  But I like it at the time. I saw this lady. I told the story hundred times choking to death in the Madeleine restaurant
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.640]  My son was like a year old. I'd gone to the bathroom. My wife was out there
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:17.000]  I come out like two minutes later. Everybody's saying call 9-1-1 like parents like 50 people around this table
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.160]  This woman's turning blue on the table. She's dying. I was on a swim team
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.920]  I was taught by the fire department basic Heimlich maneuver and I
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.240]  Did a Heimlich and she coughed out a big thing of food and she lived and they thought that was so weird
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.840]  I mean like 50 people and they were like, no, no, no, we've called 9-1-1. She'd be dead in four minutes
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:42.200]  So I just see America dying on the floor here and they're trying to shove more potatoes down our throat to make us choke
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.280]  We're gonna go to our reporter Tim Kennedy's right shotgun the rest of the hour. This is just so crazy
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:54.000]  Uh Tim at the top. I mean, I I don't I rarely use French and get in the president's face
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:23:01.640]  But clearly they hate this country so much. They're doing this because it's so dangerous for Obama and the Democrats and others to bring in
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:08.400]  The Islamists let them attack to see the attacks escalating and then think they're gonna spin it and blame the second amendment
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.200]  No, you're not gonna do it Tim Kennedy. I
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.040]  thought I was criminal in
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.320]  In Benghazi when we left our guys there to die, right?
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.600]  Radical terrorists because the religion of peace was coming. Yeah religion of peace
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:28.280]  But much of radicalized terrorists Muslims were coming to kill our ambassador and their people now
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.320]  That was really really far away. That's in Benghazi
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.440]  We're now talking about San Bernardino on the west coast and Orlando on the east coast
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.680]  This is not on the other side of the world. This is here in our backyard at our pool party
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.600]  They're murdering us and they're they're murdering our week. They're going to unarmed
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:53.280]  Women children places that you're not allowed to have guns bars gay nightclubs, you know, and then and what's
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:00.640]  Infuriating is that not only are they then spinning it and that blaming, you know, this guy was had easy access to a gun
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.840]  Yeah, but he was in a gun-free zone. I think he got a license
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.480]  He was a gun-free zone and the only thing that stopped them were other men with guns now, you know that I
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.400]  See all these people now with the gay pride flags on their Facebook pages
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.440]  It doesn't matter what the group was. It doesn't matter if they're gay. They were
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.360]  It's it's horrific that they were targeted. They were Americans
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:30.080]  Those were Americans killed on American soil a coward by a coward by a
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:38.040]  Terrorist on our soil in an act of war. We've been we are at war with terrorism and we have been for 15 years
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.760]  Well, if I was at war with the government and this is hypothetical
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:46.520]  I'm not thinking this before they put me in a file Obama does I would go after who I thought did it like I would go after
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.480]  Soldiers, I would go after politicians. I would go after hard targets because that's what a man does
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.240]  Yeah, I would attack the fighters. Yeah, no, I wouldn't attack the women and children not them
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.280]  They don't have the balls to do that. They also have the intelligence to pull off
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.800]  Sophisticated attack. They did it once 9-11
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.640]  You know, but they had lots of funding resources a lot of doors were opened. Yes for them
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:11.840]  Now they have to decentralize execute at that they're easy that they're at their convenience
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:17.400]  And that's going to be the unarmed. That's going to be the women the children the journalists gay nightclubs
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.120]  soft easy targets
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.560]  That is such a cowardly target. They know there's no guns allowed with liquors being served and they pick a
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.320]  Bunch of gay people to go kill. Yeah
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.760]  Groups they know aren't gonna have guns. You can't why has the media told gays
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:37.600]  You're supposed to talk with a list but have a gun and be a whim. I mean, why have they told you this is your identity?
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.760]  Why it's like feminists don't have guns women. That's how women are empowered is having guns annoying on a fight
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:49.000]  Yeah, I'm begging the LGBT community right now. Call me get my email go to go to info wars
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.000]  Get in contact with me. Let me give you tools to save them your Twitter. Give them your Facebook
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.800]  Give them your sheetback response. They're gonna they are you don't get this. They are coming to kill you
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:02.680]  The that religion does not want you to that's the first group. They target in the Middle East
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.680]  Don't you get it? They throw you off roofs. They throw you off cliffs. They shoot you in nightclubs. They're gonna burn you alive
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.440]  They're gonna bend you their Bible tells them to stone you to death
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:18.800]  And they follow it fight for your life. Okay, you cannot you cannot I don't I get it
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.160]  But here's the deal don't blame us don't blame don't blame gun owners and myself
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:28.520]  I mean that we didn't do this my arms are wide open saying I will give you every resource I have to save your life
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.960]  But you got to come to me. You got to come to us this community the right the
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.840]  Patriots want you to live. You're an American just like me. Don't die
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.160]  Unarmed and helpless in a night and sure as hell don't worship, you know like a it's Stockholm syndrome
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.040]  I predict that they're gonna worship the Muslims now
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:52.200]  It's gonna be a big kumbaya with prayers circles and we have all this garbage. We know that tolerance is really well respected
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.400]  By the Muslim community, they're like no what happens is the most radical for over a thousand years
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.880]  Compete with each other to take over society and enslave and henpeck and boss everybody around because it's a frickin cult
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:12.560]  When they see tolerance when they see just like you're saying the Stockholm syndrome if the LGBT community then says with open arms
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:19.320]  Hey, we love you. We forgive you. We support you. They view that as weakness. They don't view that as kindness and strength
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.440]  That's weakness and they'll continue to murder you at their convenience and their leisure
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.640]  And they're gonna do it all the damn time
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.720]  We're gonna go to break here in a moment and come back with Rob do who is in Dresden, Germany
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.160]  He I think you may go into Prague now. He got incredible footage of General Petraeus at Bilderberg
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.320]  He walks up and portrays runs from him and I'm not attacking Petraeus. I think it was wrong
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.760]  He got in trouble and Hillary didn't but the point is that's how scared he is about the secret meeting
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.760]  He runs then Peter Thiel
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.560]  Multi-billionaire that founded PayPal and a bunch of other stuff
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.760]  He actually talks about Bilderberg for the first time ever and and again, this is the group pushing for one world government
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.760]  What's ally with radical Islam?
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.240]  This is the enemy folks
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.840]  I don't mean you're all bad if you go to Bilderberg
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.240]  But it's the folks that set up the EU the global government project all of it do you're over there to cover
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.160]  These are the folks that open the door to Europe. What's coming up after the break Rob?
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.640]  Well, I think we could talk about a lot of things chasing down General Petraeus
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:16.600]  We didn't want to talk about Hillary's email scandal Peter Thiel actually confronted James A. Johnson here at the end of the
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:23.040]  Festivities at Bilderberg, but right now Alex. I just want to show you here's what's looking at like in Prague in the old town square
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.960]  We're live in Prague check Republic right now. It's about an hour and a half
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.240]  From Dresden. This is where we're flying out tomorrow a bit of a cheaper ticket
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.600]  But this is the old town square amazing place a lot of these people built this stuff to last
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.600]  There's a celestial clock just around the well
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.080]  They also built it to a stand Islamic invasion
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.880]  They also built it was standing long Islamic invasion. They were bad
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.480]  They should have just opened up giving their daughters over and we could all be living in mud huts right now
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.440]  How dare them build those cathedrals? You know, that's you know, the big
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.960]  Turkey in Istanbul Constantinople
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:04.160]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.120]  To wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption. It's necessary consequence
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.480]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.400]  Consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government. Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:24.160]  We now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.040]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people but rather the initiation process
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:35.680]  Politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.960]  We're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.360]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the other
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:51.000]  Conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said enlightened the people
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.760]  Generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.200]  This is Kit Daniels with info wars.com

[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:24.900]  We now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.280]  Rallying Patriots worldwide
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:35.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.200]  By the way the incredible video is up on info wars calm and prison planet calm
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.280]  It's just over the top is linked on drugs report calm over the weekend, then they got overshadowed
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:58.280]  Unfortunately by the tragic events in Orlando 50 plus dead 60 plus wounded Tim Kennedy terrorism expert
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.680]  current special forces
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.720]  Operator, and of course we have Rob do there in Germany
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:10.360]  Paul Watson and others. They've done a great job. We sent them there to show the shadow government Bilderberg group
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.840]  openly
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:20.920]  Opening the borders advertising for military age men to come in allowing them to attack and then declaring civil emergencies and arresting Germans
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.360]  And others that criticize the only country not going along with this is
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:32.160]  To a certain extent Switzerland and now the UK is trying to leave the euro. They never they never even voted to be in
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:37.520]  So I was just talking to Tim Kennedy you're in the break, and I'll play this Petraeus clip Rob
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.160]  Do why do you what do you think the play is the end game?
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:46.760]  I mean logic must be suspended or the West the governments will get in trouble for doing this
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:53.000]  Is stabilization, but if they can just blame our free speech or our guns they win and and so I guess they think we're that dumb
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.480]  They're gonna pass all these hate speech laws get rid of free speech in Europe in the United States on the backs of the radical crazy
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.800]  People they brought in Rob do what do you think's happening? Well?
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:08.480]  I'll tell you what Alex the people I've met in Dresden, Germany about half of them agree with the migrant policy
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.200]  They think it's great
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.440]  They think they could take as many migrants as they want which I don't understand
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:18.600]  They're suicidal brainwash liberals. They're just they just are committing suicide. They are and they don't they don't realize that
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.360]  They say oh, you're wrong. You know, you know, we tell them hey most of the crimes are committed by migrants
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:25.920]  Oh, that's fake. Well, it's from the German government. How fake can it be?
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:34.360]  So you're dealing with that type of dichotomy and then you almost got Rob last week on video at the train station with them jumping around you and
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.800]  Look everywhere. Yeah. No, they were drunk. There were kids coming up. They're from Algeria
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:47.600]  It it's crazy what's going on in Europe and they've brainwashed half the population at least maybe even more to believe that the migrant the
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.960]  Migrant solution by bringing more people in is good and they've been told, you know with Peter
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.960]  So the southern and others that
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.960]  There is no borders
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:00.560]  We're just gonna have open borders and migrants can come freely, but they don't want to assimilate
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.120]  They don't want to you interviewed that guy that said I want the free money
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:09.560]  But I hate the Germans and we're gonna take over and he's literally a cartoon character from Bugs Bunny going I had take over
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.000]  my country your women mine
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:21.360]  Hoping to post here's how to wear a hot jib. It says sexy if you're liberal wear one to make the Muslims more comfortable
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.920]  And a have sex with Muslims because now we got to bring them in and have sex with them
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.440]  Oh, yeah, the German government came out said have sex Hitler told the German women have sex with the
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:36.560]  Soldiers have more kids which made sense. They're killing all everybody, you know, they had to reproduce for all the soldiers that were dead
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.120]  I'm not defending Hitler. That's just a fact
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.520]  But instead now the mother telling if you heard this the German government says have sex with Muslim in
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:48.640]  Attempt Kennedy that's premonoctes. It's not like a new thing, you know, the the British did it with the Irish and the Scottish
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.880]  It's when you're trying to we can't defeat them. We'll just breed them out. Ah, it's a great plan
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.380]  but first you got to take their guns and and then
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.580]  You're absolutely right that there's no such thing as assimilation when it comes to Sharia law
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:07.100]  There's one solution and that is the complete annihilation of anything that does not subscribe to your theology. It's the board
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:13.340]  You will assimilate. Yeah, or you'll die or we'll kill you. We'll burn you. We'll drown you. We'll throw you off cliffs
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:16.340]  We'll behead you. We'll do anything if you don't assimilate
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:22.220]  The this isn't a culture that ever put up with anybody having any free will it's totally monotheistic
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:28.660]  Dictatorship run by men and them and and the cuckold glorious Steinem's love it
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.540]  the
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:37.300]  You it blows my mind that you know, I was just in Berlin and I was wearing a shirt that had
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.940]  The noon the letter N in Arabic on it
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:46.540]  Which is being painted on Christian and Jews doors that ISIS is going to target
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:51.980]  I was wearing the shirt intentionally because I just want to see what reaction I would get within minutes of walking down the street
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:57.620]  Berlin I had groups of Middle Eastern men that were kind of following me around. Oh, I wish you that that was that's what happened to
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:02.840]  My crew they follow you around. They can't all that last night. Yeah, I saw the exact same thing here in Austin, Texas
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:09.460]  Not in Berlin not in Syria not Iraq. I saw it here in Austin the rot rally is going on
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:15.260]  It's a big motorcycle rally and there are a lot of motorcycle clubs have veterans in them
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:20.500]  And they wear the patches that say what units that they were and they were in the Marines or they're in the Army 101st Division
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:26.260]  They deployed Iraq to deployed Afghanistan. Well, these groups of middle Middle Easterners here in Austin, Texas
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:27.700]  We're kind of
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:33.980]  posturing and following these veteran groups around passive aggressively kind of trying to intimidate these guys letting them know
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:37.220]  Hey, we know we know that you guys went and killed some of our friends
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.380]  But it's not going to happen anymore because we're here now and that's like
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:44.300]  I mean shaved heads beards white shirts
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:50.620]  They're their wives or girlfriends or whoever were with them in their burkas just about a block away could see them and I could
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:53.300]  Saw their together because they're looking but oh my god
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.180]  They were showing off to them. Yep downtown Austin like a gang look at this ladies
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.540]  I'm gonna creep up to some veterans who don't even know what's going on
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:03.460]  I guess it's like 1980 in LA and it was the bloods in the crypts like I don't know no look
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:10.580]  I'm here like a can I show folks the photo you sent me about a week ago. Which one the the domain. Yeah
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:14.900]  Yeah, here here. Is that okay? Yeah, it's fine here document cam shot for TV viewers
[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:18.420]  This is exactly what I saw at the domain a few weeks ago
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:22.980]  And I also saw this at Barton Creek where I've been going since I was a little kid when I visit my grandparents and folks the thing is
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:28.220]  They're there. You know, they weren't burkas. They're wearing hajibs. They're bugging their eyes out at you
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:31.220]  They're literally setting up and having picnics out there
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:36.220]  Just like it's the Middle East or whatever at the middle of the mall and another thing against these poor people other the fact that
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:41.140]  They literally they are in a cult and think I should submit and this is just everywhere
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:46.900]  Yeah, look at the age so the significance of this picture not not that I was downtown Austin at a really swanky
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:53.260]  Outdoor mall type place the age of them, right? They're all somewhere between the 20s and 30s
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:59.100]  But that is prime fighting age. Where are their husbands? Did anybody see him? No, I was about to say that's what happened
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.900]  I turn one corner and the women all have to wait
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.820]  They're not allowed to even walk around and then I'd see the groups of men
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.800]  They've all kind of adopted kind of gangster culture like a weird mutation. So this guy's like
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:15.100]  And then meanwhile the women are all over here and it's just like what the hell? Yeah, we have to start understanding
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:19.140]  You know, it's it is a unique culture. They do things differently. They speak differently
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.480]  When I say they speak they're speaking English often times now, but they communicate in ways that
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:32.220]  You know just like the abonics in 1980s of the Bloods and the Crips unless you're part of the game task force
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.060]  You couldn't understand what they are taught. So what was the point?
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:41.700]  This stalking the veterans at the rot rally. Was this just Caling Coo showing off the ladies? It was one of two things
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.700]  It was either to try to
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:49.860]  Test resolve, you know, if you posture and to see what a response is and maybe even had something kicked off
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:55.300]  Had their their women video it the point is I've lived here my whole life
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:41:00.940]  There's like Muslims everywhere now in full outfits in Austin the center of central Texas
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:06.660]  And I've read phase two once their numbers get high enough then they all start wearing it. They're getting us ready and
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:11.860]  Once once we don't submit once we don't still assimilate
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:20.060]  They kill us so so did I mean do these vets notice what was happening to them the vets were there enjoying the rot rally
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:27.240]  They're drinking. I don't drink ever in public. I'm always armed and you know, and you're not supposed to drink when you're carrying so
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.560]  You know, I was just watching these guys from behind as they were posturing against these vets
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.960]  And I was like, um, I'll shoot these guys in the back if this actually kicks off
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.760]  No, not in a fight like if they weapons weapons. Yeah, something pulls something out
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.360]  They're gonna get buried right there. That's the veterans were just kind of trying to enjoy themselves
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.800]  They're just like hey, we're downtown Austin on 6th Street, you know with our motorcycles having a great time
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.920]  What were you down there for a movie from Arizona?
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.160]  Oh another TV show that's gonna be coming out and I suppose promoting it man. You are so busy
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.280]  Yeah, I love the fact you work even more than I do most people look at me sometimes over like 18 hours
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.820]  They're like, why do you do this? Like I can't help it. It's like there's so much stuff to cover and do
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.520]  Rob do we're going to break in a moment. All I can say is get ready for a big bonus
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:14.980]  I hope people buy some products and then for store.com so I can afford it. We've got a lot of new products out there
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:22.860]  At m4slife.com that fund the whole operation but living defense only came in once back during December and was so popular
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:26.300]  It's parasite cleanse that it's sold out in two days
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:32.220]  We ordered three times the number took a six months to get it because it's got 27 ingredients and the past California standards
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:37.740]  We totally clean it's hard to get those 27 ingredients. That would be totally organic. Well, we finally got it together. We have a
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:41.240]  Supply of this but selling out the next few days
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:48.100]  Yeah, it's 120 capsules and we're discounting at 25% off even though it's selling out because I want you to take advantage of this

[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.060]  The most important bit of information
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:41.380]  That you're going to get you know like in a in a kidnapping the first few minutes so vital
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.420]  So right now what the FBI and the CIA is doing?
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:49.660]  They're scrubbing his phone. He died unfortunately, so we can't interrogate him. They're going to his family
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:52.900]  They're going to his friends. They're going to every single person. He's talked to in the past five six days
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:56.260]  His Twitter feed his Facebook feed and those are live
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:03.900]  Active investigations right every single one of those you can like think of it like a like a threat of a virus like a
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:08.100]  If those if their weeds and the seeds had just pollinated and they're flying
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.540]  They're trying to catch every single one of those because there are little bits of information
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:18.220]  That could potentially save other American lives and we know for a fact that if there's one they can't do it alone
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:21.740]  The lone wolf thing I don't believe in it. I don't think it's true
[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:26.740]  I believe that they're they are segregated that they are organized cellularly
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:29.740]  But that does not mean that they're lone wolf because they're so there's support groups
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:33.300]  Yeah, like they're they're they're e-moms are encouraging them
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:36.380]  They're even connecting them with other people showing them how to
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:43.020]  Purchase a weapon legally how to get a license how to get money from the government how to say the right things the right time to the
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:45.740]  Right people so they can stay kind of off the radar
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:51.700]  And we have this e-mom right there in Orlando saying the very things we saw just happened
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:57.940]  I wonder if he's getting investigated or maybe maybe Obama will have her the White House. Yeah, I listen this and what we say
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:00.600]  Investigated there's one way that you talk to this guy
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:08.340]  That is he's bent over a sink with a towel over his head your porn water on his face and beating him. He just
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:16.460]  Encouraged radical radicalized Muslims to kill gays to kill Americans on American soil. He's a terrorist
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:20.740]  He's part of the problem. He's fighting a war and he's one of the warriors
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.740]  Interrogate him. Well, here's the bottom line
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:27.500]  Bob Trump comes out and says that and gets attacked but he said there will be more Brussels
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:32.940]  There will be more San Bernardino's in fact you guys queue up one of those and and they're already in the media attacking him
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:36.140]  Where somebody congratulated him for being right?
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:40.500]  He said well, thanks for the congratulation as if he's congratulating the attack. No, he's saying thanks for saying I'm right
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.500]  But I mean all he's saying is common sense
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:49.060]  Definitely not the best act and how he speaks but Donald Trump always speaks the same way
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.500]  But what he said was right
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:54.860]  It's the same thing that you said same thing that I said that there were gonna be more attacks and they're gonna be more vicious
[01:50:54.860 --> 01:51:00.340]  They're gonna be more violent. They're gonna be more lethal and and I'm saying it again today that there are gonna be more attacks
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:03.140]  And if we don't do something there more people are gonna die
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:07.140]  I've had different doctorates and folks on that are experts on Islam and its whole history
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:11.020]  And they said there's a metric that once they get to like five ten percent it varies in the country
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:15.940]  That then there's a confidence level you're not gonna be able to kick us all out and all of our liberal behavior apologizing
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:24.780]  Encourages now folks who say okay. It's now time for us to activate and start the attacks. Yeah, we last you're right at that
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:30.060]  The ratio the percentage of you know got three to four percent. We're somewhere between that five to ten percent this year
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:36.740]  That that that is fearless that is go start killing Americans anybody that doesn't agree with you
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.580]  That's Americans so and then they hope there's a tax on other Muslims back
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:46.300]  Because then that will spur the radicalization of the other Muslims and then then the full jihad zone. Yeah, well jihad is on
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.460]  It's on right now
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:49.580]  So I mean they're looking for a fiery conflagration
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:56.780]  Ally with the left and the George Soros crowds Joe Biggs is out in front of the nightclub where 50 plus people were killed last night
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:52:02.060]  Joe Biggs a great job getting up early this morning from Texas and getting on all those flights out there
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:04.060]  You're now in the rain Joe Biggs
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.500]  Roger that Joe Biggs here with info wars.com now
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:11.500]  We just arrived in Orlando and as you can see there's a lot of police vehicles right here in the center of the road
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.180]  The nightclub's actually right down to maybe about 50 so yards from us at this point in time
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:22.900]  You know what we're seeing right now so far as I'm reading through articles on the flight here as everyone's one attack the second
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:25.300]  Amendment what happens though if we take those guns away
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:27.300]  What's gonna happen these guys are gonna build bombs
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.860]  I can't even have to argue with these people
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:35.580]  But stop attacking American freedom had a vest on guess what if he would have had a bomb and it would have went off
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:41.220]  That would have been way more people like 200 people and said I'm sitting here driving through Orlando listening to everyone
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.900]  Apologize how we need to not blame Muslims for this. We don't need to blame
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:48.980]  Oh pulse was a gun-free zone pulse was a gun-free zone
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:54.940]  We're too scared to call this what it is radical is on we have a problem the borders are wide open
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:58.780]  We have a president that could care less about the American people
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:06.620]  Christianity is being attacked American values are being attacked men in America are being attacked and we're allowing these terrorists to come in here
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:10.940]  And now we have sleeper cells starting to wake up. They're being activated
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:15.900]  We almost had another attack a large one in LA at another gay pride parade today as well
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:18.060]  So this is gonna continue happening
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:22.580]  I heard some of things Tim said earlier before I got on the flight to leave Austin to come here
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:25.260]  And he said he believes it's gonna get worse before it gets better
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:30.380]  And I do agree with that from the things I've seen and how these people are because we don't have secure borders
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:31.460]  Sure
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:37.820]  By the way, Rob Jacobs is there running camera doing a great job as well Rob feel free to pan around zoom in while Joe's talking for TV
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:40.820]  Viewers ready illiterates go to info wars.com forward slash show
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:46.100]  Sure, great job guys. Yeah, just show more what we got on the street pan around. Let's try to zoom in on the nightclub
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:48.820]  Please continue and jump with any questions Tim
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:56.380]  I think a key point that that big just brought up both the both the guy in Orlando and the guy in Los Angeles
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:59.420]  They both had bombs those were not guns that they bought
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:05.580]  They had bombs both of which would have been more lethal than the guns that they had the guns were a secondary plan
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:10.260]  And they're both and they're both also I think you guys can probably go through the line and go on for the media
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.220]  Also your press also we have to expand on this Joe
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:21.540]  These people are registered Democrats. These are liberals. These are people that are allied with Islam
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:23.020]  So these guys are liberals as well
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:28.780]  They're Democrats and then they strike at their very bosom of the people that are trying to aid them and help them
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:31.060]  showing the cowardice
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.380]  Tim
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:39.860]  Yeah, it's so despicable like you can't even process like so they killed the unarmed
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:47.380]  People at the nightclub that were primarily gay that have been trying to support them for the past
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:53.420]  Three four years and facilitate their movement as immigrants here and saying hey, we have we have like fights here
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:55.860]  You know, we have similar causes. We're both prejudice
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.380]  We're gonna be stabbed in the back job eggs
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.860]  I hear you're trying to jump in great point Tim and by the way breaking news
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:03.740]  Just what Tim was tell what we're talking about earlier for my source that Tim was confirming
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:07.220]  eight people on a ISIS Orlando kill list
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:12.340]  And of course the FBI told you you're on that kill list job eggs, please continue
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:17.260]  Well, one of the interesting things is we're being told continuously that this is a religion of peace
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.340]  So we need to be understanding of what's going on that we should in fact
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:28.020]  Apologize because this attack is our fault because that these guys have to grow up in such a hateful environment because
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:36.900]  Islamophobia exists and that's why this happened. No, this guy hated homosexuals the entire religion hates homosexuals and guess what happened
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:41.540]  This guy saw two guys kiss it flipped his lid and he went out and carried this out
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:44.060]  He took advantage of the fact that he had the security clients
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:47.260]  He went and got guns like you said if that bomb would have been off
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:52.540]  It would have been ten times worse and they would have still gone the whole left would have been like well, you know
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:57.500]  We need to be more progressive. We shouldn't blame them and then they bring sure that's his dad's cover story
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.260]  He knows the whole deal the guy pledged lesions
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:06.380]  I had the dad is to blame the dad should be held accountable for son's actions because he knew what the hell was going on that guy knew
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:07.580]  That this son was radicalized
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:10.500]  I said the same thing father and Sam Bernardino just like the father
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:15.500]  I'll say who else Obama and the Democrats letting these people in and the Republican leadership doing it, too
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:20.900]  What's gonna happen when there's hundreds of attacks Tim and Joe they're not gonna be able to spend this forever
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:24.020]  So we see a reoccurring theme here, right?
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:31.060]  We have we have won't we have two shooters two different instances both West Coast East Coast both on hit on hit on not hit list
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:35.060]  I wish both on lists from the CIA and the FBI as
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:40.100]  Being caused for concern right but the years later now two years later
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:44.980]  They were able to execute their plan and then kill America just like Major Assange. Oh, you're doing a great job
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:49.580]  Follow more reports. We'll put them to info wars.com everything. We're doing is going viral right now

[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:57.900]  We have left

[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:07.620]  This is radical Islam people need to be vigilant people need to watch your backs just because you watch these interviews everyone goes

[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:14.700]  These guys are activated and we need to be on alert
