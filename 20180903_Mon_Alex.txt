[00:00.000 --> 00:14.560]  Certainly, for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[00:14.560 --> 00:20.520]  that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[00:20.520 --> 00:27.200]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:27.200 --> 00:32.640]  He predicted 9-11, and if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA
[00:32.640 --> 00:37.120]  asset in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need, and this was a welly and phony system.
[00:37.120 --> 00:49.520]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove, he educated us about the
[00:49.520 --> 00:55.400]  relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalist prison planet dominated by a ruthless
[00:55.400 --> 00:57.040]  gang of control freaks.
[00:57.040 --> 01:00.160]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.800]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites!
[01:04.800 --> 01:09.680]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[01:09.680 --> 01:11.680]  Valley.
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.280]  They falsely edited him.
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.520]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[01:20.520 --> 01:28.680]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video, and now he is being de-platformed
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.520]  by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[01:32.520 --> 01:37.320]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.120]  And then we get hit and say, you no longer use our software.
[01:41.120 --> 01:43.960]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[01:43.960 --> 01:45.280]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[01:45.280 --> 01:46.760]  They just killed our stream.
[01:46.760 --> 01:47.760]  Really?
[01:47.760 --> 01:48.760]  Yep.
[01:48.760 --> 01:52.640]  Americans are actually celebrating this.
[01:52.640 --> 01:54.920]  This is America in 2018.
[01:54.920 --> 02:04.320]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.760]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:08.760 --> 02:10.720]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:10.720 --> 02:19.040]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:19.040 --> 02:48.000]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:54.400 --> 02:55.400]  You can smell it.
[02:55.400 --> 02:56.400]  You can see it.
[02:56.400 --> 02:57.400]  You can feel it.
[02:57.400 --> 02:58.400]  History is happening right now.
[02:58.400 --> 03:03.320]  The destiny of humanity, to a great extent, will be decided at least how the breaks are
[03:03.320 --> 03:06.520]  going to work with this midterm.
[03:06.520 --> 03:11.760]  World is awakening to the true new authoritarian threat, organized governments, and multinationals
[03:11.760 --> 03:16.320]  working with big tech and big banks to bring in one world government.
[03:16.320 --> 03:20.600]  Valiantly, President Trump and other leaders across the world, from Eastern Europe to Latin
[03:20.600 --> 03:27.920]  America, from Africa to Asia to Russia, are fighting hard, and you are waking up.
[03:27.920 --> 03:28.920]  I am waking up.
[03:28.920 --> 03:31.920]  We are all waking up and realizing this together.
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.920]  I am very honored that we were the first to be completely banned four weeks ago, three
[03:35.920 --> 03:39.600]  weeks ago, but now it's everyone, everyone.
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.280]  They're all being shadow banned 96% where no one can find them unless you go to the page,
[03:44.280 --> 03:52.200]  and other people like Rush Limbaugh, President Trump, Matt Brudge, Ann Coulter, Michele Malkin.
[03:52.200 --> 03:53.200]  Hundreds of pages.
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.440]  In fact, I need that article that came out years down, Coulter, she's on today.
[03:57.440 --> 04:03.520]  Hundreds of pages of attacks and disinfo is put up front on purpose against you.
[04:03.520 --> 04:09.120]  So anyone trying to search you only sees horrible lies.
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.120]  It's defamatory.
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.640]  It's organized crime.
[04:11.640 --> 04:15.640]  It's just total and complete fraud.
[04:15.640 --> 04:20.000]  Just the headline was, look at how YouTube just changed this algorithm, and it was an
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.040]  article that got a lot of attention in your state, but it's every conservative.
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.720]  It's Prager, it's Coulter, it's Sean Hannity, it's Tucker Carlson.
[04:28.720 --> 04:32.040]  It's everybody, and it's the head of the election.
[04:32.040 --> 04:34.360]  This is true election meddling.
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.360]  Suppressing Americans is talking to each other, and it's a huge time, and Trump has now gone
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.240]  both barrels on him, and we'll cover it all, so the battles join, and yes, I've gotten
[04:44.240 --> 04:45.240]  a lot of briefings to the President.
[04:45.240 --> 04:48.840]  I'm going to get a lot more to him, and that's why they banned me three weeks ago, but it's
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.840]  well worth it.
[04:49.840 --> 04:58.400]  They were going to ban us all in the end anyway, so.
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.440]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.680]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[05:06.680 --> 05:09.680]  every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[05:09.680 --> 05:13.320]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with
[05:13.320 --> 05:14.320]  one system.
[05:14.320 --> 05:20.200]  The Pro Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact
[05:20.200 --> 05:26.640]  filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants

[05:32.880 --> 05:37.320]  toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.

[05:42.200 --> 05:44.880]  and refreshing water all over your home.
[05:44.880 --> 05:49.840]  Head to infowarstore.com, and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're

[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.240]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S. resistance
[06:03.240 --> 06:07.920]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with
[06:07.920 --> 06:11.560]  the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.880]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[06:15.880 --> 06:18.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.440]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[06:20.440 --> 06:21.440]  This is all confirmed.
[06:21.440 --> 06:22.640]  This is not a drill.
[06:22.640 --> 06:26.600]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[06:26.600 --> 06:28.320]  They've officially become state-run.
[06:28.320 --> 06:34.320]  Apple 100% Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide
[06:34.320 --> 06:35.320]  censorship.
[06:35.320 --> 06:39.720]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones,
[06:39.720 --> 06:40.720]  to do that.
[06:40.720 --> 06:41.720]  This is happening.
[06:41.720 --> 06:45.880]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[06:45.880 --> 06:49.360]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[06:49.360 --> 06:54.440]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.440]  previous attacks.
[06:55.440 --> 07:01.360]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation, using adapt to overcome
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.360]  subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[07:03.360 --> 07:08.440]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[07:08.440 --> 07:11.960]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[07:11.960 --> 07:17.840]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[07:17.840 --> 07:22.520]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[07:22.520 --> 07:32.760]  It is the virtual reality AI platform system now attacking the United States with traders
[07:32.760 --> 07:37.560]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.160]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-com slash big tech banking combined
[07:42.160 --> 07:43.160]  emergency situation.
[07:43.160 --> 07:46.920]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.800]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[07:49.800 --> 07:55.040]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[07:55.040 --> 07:58.600]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[07:58.600 --> 08:03.120]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw
[08:03.120 --> 08:04.120]  man.
[08:04.120 --> 08:07.560]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make
[08:07.560 --> 08:08.560]  me a herder of children.
[08:08.560 --> 08:13.160]  And then they build me into this line to then set the distraction while they're actually
[08:13.160 --> 08:18.600]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones so even if I didn't sell out to
[08:18.600 --> 08:24.320]  them, they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[08:24.320 --> 08:28.960]  I am now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.960]  used against you.
[08:29.960 --> 08:34.880]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[08:34.880 --> 08:41.520]  I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[08:41.520 --> 08:48.840]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[08:48.840 --> 08:51.160]  the mind of man.
[08:51.160 --> 09:05.440]  Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[09:05.440 --> 09:11.200]  70 days until the most important election in world history.
[09:11.200 --> 09:13.960]  Humanity now prepares its settles at the crossroads.
[09:13.960 --> 09:18.480]  The time for talk is over, we have entered the crucible.
[09:18.480 --> 09:20.720]  It's now up to you.
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.640]  Globalist forces are spilling out their full might and hatred against humanity.
[09:25.640 --> 09:29.200]  Their psychological warfare and deception has never been greater.
[09:29.200 --> 09:37.720]  And if we stay steadfast against it, through this dark time will come our greatest moment.
[09:37.720 --> 09:40.640]  It's here.
[09:40.640 --> 09:42.680]  You can feel the victory.
[09:42.680 --> 09:44.520]  The enemy can feel their defeat.
[09:44.520 --> 09:50.680]  We are going to win the midterms unless there is criminal fraud we couldn't imagine which
[09:50.680 --> 09:51.680]  is happening.
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.280]  But regardless, we've won the battle, we've won the war already by standing through and
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.480]  the seeds that are planted now of censorship, the seeds of bullying and the seeds of oppression
[10:01.480 --> 10:07.560]  will give root to mighty oaks of liberty that will stand the storms of the future.
[10:07.560 --> 10:13.080]  That when our ancestors look back on now, this will be seen as a time of calm, a time
[10:13.080 --> 10:18.280]  of plenty, a time of ease as we face the real crises that are coming.
[10:18.280 --> 10:20.720]  This is only a preparation for the future.
[10:20.720 --> 10:27.920]  If we can't beat John Podesta and Hillary Clinton and the Rockefellers and people like
[10:27.920 --> 10:30.640]  George Soros, really, who are we?
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.720]  We're going to face far more superior, far more powerful foes in the future.
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.540]  And by then, when we face those foes, we will be stronger, though most of us will be six
[10:40.540 --> 10:43.040]  feet under.
[10:43.040 --> 10:53.120]  I was very frustrated yesterday because I know that we have the chart to get out of
[10:53.120 --> 10:54.280]  this.
[10:54.280 --> 10:58.680]  I know we have the path and I know we're right because I've read the enemies on statements
[10:58.680 --> 11:01.920]  and I've seen their own plans and I know how to beat them.
[11:01.920 --> 11:11.480]  And so I get mad at myself that 100% in my mind, I hold their entire battle plan and
[11:11.480 --> 11:14.640]  I know how to beat it like that.
[11:14.640 --> 11:21.880]  And so much of the victory depends on me and you and all of us together executing on the
[11:21.880 --> 11:26.920]  information we have, and that means laying it out in a step-by-step format.
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.400]  So by the middle of next week, we're going to put out a four or five-page memo, very
[11:30.400 --> 11:35.320]  simple with bullet points with proof, because I tend to give you too much information.
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.680]  Now, that's good to do, but at this point, it needs to be battle plans, information warfare,
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.680]  information truth.
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.680]  And then I just get caught in the total minutiae of wanting to prove every point when we know
[11:46.680 --> 11:51.920]  we're telling the truth and we have all the facts, and then I get very, very angry.
[11:51.920 --> 11:57.560]  And I really get angry because the president is surrounded by a bunch of cowards.
[11:57.560 --> 12:09.720]  The president is a lion surrounded by hyenas and jackals and warthogs and cobras.
[12:09.720 --> 12:12.040]  And it's totally real, it's so epic.
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.040]  Evil doesn't just exist right when the evil was about to take over, something good rises
[12:16.040 --> 12:19.880]  up that's stubborn and willful and ready to execute the truth.
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.240]  Doesn't matter what the vessel is, you expect, look at the Bible, most of the vessels God
[12:24.240 --> 12:31.120]  raised up to crush evil were more evil than evil, but they were not wicked in their heart.
[12:31.120 --> 12:39.280]  And so we are now, ladies and gentlemen, at the most epic moment ever.
[12:39.280 --> 12:45.120]  And the knives are not for the president because he proved they were suppressing the economy
[12:45.120 --> 12:46.280]  on purpose.
[12:46.280 --> 12:52.120]  He proved the fraud and he showed you 4.6 growth rate.
[12:52.120 --> 12:59.560]  He said in the campaign, China's got 10 for decades, we're America, we could have five.
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.960]  They said, you lunatic, you'll never get three less than two years out.
[13:03.960 --> 13:06.960]  He said 4.6.
[13:06.960 --> 13:09.880]  The truth is, we can build anything and do anything we want.
[13:09.880 --> 13:15.760]  We have to have motivation, we have to believe in ourselves and the enemy has been demoralizing
[13:15.760 --> 13:16.760]  us.
[13:16.760 --> 13:19.640]  You study propaganda, you study authoritarianism.
[13:19.640 --> 13:26.320]  What the media and the government and the Democrats do is 101.
[13:26.320 --> 13:29.960]  Those that didn't go to college, not that it means anything, but that means the first
[13:29.960 --> 13:30.960]  level.
[13:30.960 --> 13:38.720]  101, first day at class, they demoralized your ass.
[13:38.720 --> 13:47.880]  And I knew the globe was evil, but I'll be honest with you.
[13:47.880 --> 13:52.680]  I guess the spiritual conversion rate is quicker now because 20 years ago when I was covering
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.320]  stuff, only on top people were really bad.
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.480]  Low level Republicans were bad, low level Democrats were bad, but they were misled.
[14:00.480 --> 14:03.760]  They weren't inherently evil.
[14:03.760 --> 14:10.560]  Democrats now, because that's where the universe works, things divide the two sides, have chosen
[14:10.560 --> 14:13.160]  pure evil.
[14:13.160 --> 14:15.680]  And I don't mourn it that it's a hard enemy to beat.
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.880]  I'm mourn it because I feel their spiritual death and when I see them do horrible things
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.640]  to me or my family or you, I don't take, they think they're hurting me, but not in the way
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.440]  they think because they're Satanist.
[14:30.440 --> 14:31.440]  They're all about themselves.
[14:31.440 --> 14:32.440]  It's not that.
[14:32.440 --> 14:33.440]  I mourn their loss.
[14:33.440 --> 14:36.320]  I, oh my God, there's that many of them are corrupt.
[14:36.320 --> 14:42.400]  They think, I mean, almost all of them want to destroy everything.
[14:42.400 --> 14:51.920]  They revel in being liars and trying to stop prosperity and Trump and I get to know what
[14:51.920 --> 14:58.040]  Trump's going through because no one after Trump, except for, I don't say this with pleasure,
[14:58.040 --> 15:04.000]  no one is attacked like me, except for Trump.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.320]  And why is it because the enemy started saying like two years ago, Trump and Jones are channeling
[15:09.320 --> 15:10.320]  each other.
[15:10.320 --> 15:11.720]  They're the same spirit and they're all under the occult.
[15:11.720 --> 15:13.680]  I'm not into that stuff.
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.840]  But then I thought, oh, that's just propaganda and then I realized that I've run into them.
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.400]  They think I'm Trump and they think Trump is me, but in a weird metaphysical thing,
[15:21.400 --> 15:22.400]  it's actually true.
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.200]  There's always the big thing up here, then there's the rebel, the outlier that has the
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.600]  power and it's a thing in the metaphysical.
[15:30.600 --> 15:33.000]  And so they figured this out now.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.760]  They figured this out and so they're trying to destroy me as a symbol to get to you.
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.720]  But then they don't think about a Matt Drudge like the 10th planet coming through.
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.680]  They don't think about other foreseen forces and the way God works because it's not just
[15:47.680 --> 15:48.680]  Trump.
[15:48.680 --> 15:49.680]  It's not just Alex Jones.
[15:49.680 --> 15:50.680]  It's you, the people.

[20:01.640 --> 20:12.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:12.640 --> 20:15.520]  The answer to tyranny is the human spirit.
[20:15.520 --> 20:20.280]  It's 1984, God's light shining through our sails.
[20:20.280 --> 20:24.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:24.360 --> 20:33.560]  Human souls are but mirrors of God's consciousness like ships upon an endless sea with the consciousness
[20:33.560 --> 20:40.800]  of God blasting out, filling their sails, travel through space and time.
[20:40.800 --> 20:48.560]  All dimensions, all time, all understanding when you're ready for it, a true stairway
[20:48.560 --> 20:49.880]  to heaven.
[20:49.880 --> 20:54.760]  Not one offered by Hollywood, crank this up, not one offered by the globalist, not one
[20:54.760 --> 21:01.360]  offered by drugs in the system or power over others, but through staring into infinity,
[21:01.360 --> 21:09.280]  staring into the burning bush, and removing the bush, and staring into the mind of God.
[21:09.280 --> 21:12.720]  Lest ye be ready, you will surely die.
[21:12.720 --> 21:18.720]  But sure, soul will go on.
[21:18.720 --> 21:26.600]  Our shadows taller than our souls.
[21:26.600 --> 21:42.920]  There was a lady we all know who shines false light, who once the light shows, never goes
[21:42.920 --> 21:49.680]  away does it, because you can see God, you can also see the devil.
[21:49.680 --> 21:51.840]  The devil is the light bearer.
[21:51.840 --> 21:55.000]  You don't look at God, the devil's the bush.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.800]  The devil then tells you he's God, but he's not.
[21:59.800 --> 22:06.360]  The great mysteries now are unlocked to the world as we enter the final age of Earth.
[22:06.360 --> 22:11.320]  The age of the universe begins.
[22:11.320 --> 22:17.280]  Just God's finger reaches down to give us the fire of heaven, the Promethean fire.
[22:17.280 --> 22:19.520]  But who will take it?
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.280]  Not the big tech giants, not the globalists, they decided their God's here on Earth.
[22:23.280 --> 22:27.560]  They don't want that finger to reach down.
[22:27.560 --> 22:31.200]  Ancultors joining us were, I'm a bad guy, I forget to tell the folks to promote that
[22:31.200 --> 22:32.200]  Ancultors coming on.
[22:32.200 --> 22:34.120]  She had been on like 15 years.
[22:34.120 --> 22:37.920]  I wasn't a left winger, I wasn't a right winger, but I would just kind of get little,
[22:37.920 --> 22:40.720]  you know, bonus points attacking her when I got her on.
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.240]  I talk to her briefly at the RNC, but you know, I think overall she's a good lady, very
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.200]  smart lady, very influential lady, and the real reason I want her on is I want to try
[22:48.200 --> 22:57.080]  to brief her just briefly and have her talk as well about the whole situation with the
[22:57.080 --> 23:02.440]  globalists and the deep state takeover that finally the president is listening to.
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.840]  So I am super, super excited about Ancultor set to join us for a nice interview coming
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.240]  up in the next segment.
[23:10.240 --> 23:16.240]  But again, she's totally buried, she's shadow banned, but then they also bury in Google
[23:16.240 --> 23:20.080]  her hundreds of searches where you see anything she has to say.
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.480]  She's on C-span, it's banned.
[23:22.480 --> 23:29.600]  She's on Fox News, it's banned.
[23:29.600 --> 23:33.880]  So you're going to get to actually hear from her, that's what they do, they ban you, then
[23:33.880 --> 23:40.680]  they misrepresent what you have to say.
[23:40.680 --> 23:49.120]  So really breaking them all down with her coming up, but 70 days out from the election,
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.360]  what are we going to do?
[23:50.360 --> 23:55.640]  70 days out with everyone being shadow banned, a lot of people being totally banned.
[23:55.640 --> 24:02.040]  I mean, Swedish national campaigns that are about to win, you know, the prime ministership,
[24:02.040 --> 24:06.240]  they're being banned, Christian parties in Africa are being banned.
[24:06.240 --> 24:13.840]  Facebook, Google, YouTube, it's subsidiary, Apple, they are on a jihad.
[24:13.840 --> 24:18.760]  And Twitter had been one of the worst, and they knew they were one of the worst.
[24:18.760 --> 24:23.560]  And so they knew people were watching them very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.560]  very close.
[24:24.560 --> 24:29.840]  And so they went, oh, we won't ban Alex Jones because I'm already shadow banned, 90 plus
[24:29.840 --> 24:31.000]  percent.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.440]  You won't do that.
[24:35.440 --> 24:39.000]  And so they act like I'm the token person that's there, but I love how tech giants met
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.440]  last week in secret.
[24:40.440 --> 24:42.760]  Print me that article, please.
[24:42.760 --> 24:46.680]  To stop election meddling, oh, the Russians are all powerful.
[24:46.680 --> 24:50.360]  We'll ban all the conservatives to make sure Russians don't do anything while they're
[24:50.360 --> 24:52.040]  manipulating the election.
[24:52.040 --> 24:59.120]  Shadow banning conservatives, 96%, it was 93% last week because the polls keep showing
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.880]  a huge red wave, and so they're being forced to act like authoritarians, they're being
[25:03.880 --> 25:08.680]  forced to act like dictators, they're being forced to openly ban conservatives free speech
[25:08.680 --> 25:16.800]  across the board in an attempt to get people to behave and go along with what they want.
[25:16.800 --> 25:19.960]  But people are like, we don't care if you totally censor us, we're not going to stop
[25:19.960 --> 25:23.040]  and we're going to go on local radio and we're going to buy ads in the paper and we're going
[25:23.040 --> 25:26.280]  to call C-SPAN and we're going to call the Congress and we're going to go out when Trump's
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.160]  there at rallies and go, they're not censorship, they're not censorship, they're blocking
[25:30.160 --> 25:36.760]  you and now the president is on your tail with antitrust executive orders and banking
[25:36.760 --> 25:43.360]  executive orders and sanctions, real sanctions, and top Republicans are signaling they're
[25:43.360 --> 25:49.120]  ready for Trump to fire sessions.
[25:49.120 --> 25:55.560]  And so you guys, I'll tell you this, I'd give us a 60-40 chance.
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.080]  You win the midterms and you guys get totally devastated and indicted for this because the
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.960]  quarter is not being given now, you guys pushed too far, you went after Trump's family, you
[26:04.960 --> 26:08.560]  all of it, when you're involved with the Russians, everything else.
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.920]  But even if you were to steal the election and get through, I've looked at every possible
[26:13.920 --> 26:22.160]  destination along your planned permutations and your entire operation and I've looked
[26:22.160 --> 26:35.800]  at every outcome and let me just say this, there isn't any outcome where you win.
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.640]  And I have an evil laugh because I know you don't like it because I can, you know, I just
[26:39.640 --> 26:45.400]  like to get to me but the point is that you guys think you're going to execute this, you're
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.680]  not going to execute crap and the globalists know I don't just make statements on here
[26:50.680 --> 26:54.440]  that aren't true or that aren't backed up.
[26:54.440 --> 27:02.080]  You are facing hammer-war, you are facing, you are bringing down the gates, you think
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.720]  taking down these controls is destroying us, you are removing gates that we don't remove
[27:07.720 --> 27:15.800]  because we know who we are but once you remove the gates, once you let us in, we will visit
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.040]  judgment on you politically, economically, culturally, lawfully and that's why you're
[27:21.040 --> 27:27.200]  so scared of my voice because you know it's judgment, it's judgment day.
[27:27.200 --> 27:34.080]  Judgment day cometh, judgment day is so close and justice is good, justice is right.
[27:34.080 --> 27:43.600]  It's a quote metallic, can we come in with justice for all next segment?
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.080]  We just want to have our families and live and have prosperity but you've got to control
[27:48.080 --> 27:52.760]  the prosperity, you've got to control us and that's where we will never let you control
[27:52.760 --> 27:53.760]  us.
[27:53.760 --> 27:59.880]  You will, you lesser things will never run our lives so now you have summoned us to
[27:59.880 --> 28:02.160]  destroy you politically.
[28:02.160 --> 28:09.560]  You have gone to the altar and you've prayed on gods, ancient gods, you've summoned the
[28:09.560 --> 28:14.440]  Titans and they will arrive.
[28:14.440 --> 28:17.640]  Now that said, we'll get into the politics of this, the mechanics of it but Congress
[28:17.640 --> 28:21.640]  must act, the president must act now to defeat them quickly before we go into the next phase,
[28:21.640 --> 28:26.840]  the next phase is the next phase, these people that did this are delusional, they'll run
[28:26.840 --> 28:30.280]  from what they're about to release, we must stop them now.

[33:01.040 --> 33:08.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:31.040 --> 33:41.560]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.240]  the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it
[33:46.240 --> 33:49.680]  was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hub, it
[33:49.680 --> 33:51.320]  was the wonder of despair.
[33:51.320 --> 33:53.840]  We had everything before us, we had nothing before us.
[33:53.840 --> 33:57.320]  We were all going direct to heaven, we were all going directly the other way.
[33:57.320 --> 34:03.040]  In short, the period was so far unlike the present period that some of the noisiest authorities
[34:03.040 --> 34:08.800]  insisted on it being received for good or evil in the superlative degree of comparison
[34:08.800 --> 34:11.000]  only.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.360]  Ann Coulter, a true icon of Americana, joins us.
[34:14.360 --> 34:19.160]  First time she was on 15 years ago, I was just trying to make points I guess, but I got
[34:19.160 --> 34:23.280]  to meet her in person at the RNC and at an interview, I appreciate her joining us to
[34:23.280 --> 34:29.120]  talk about the onslaught, the Blitzkrieg against the First Amendment, the other cowards in
[34:29.120 --> 34:33.320]  Washington are scared to cover it, they all want jobs I guess with Google or Facebook
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.080]  or Apple later with $3 trillion between them, but Ann Coulter has hundreds of videos on
[34:38.080 --> 34:44.240]  YouTube that are negative about her, force fed, show to eye, 96% of conservative sites
[34:44.240 --> 34:50.840]  are buried, they block everything, shadow bandings at over 93%, I'm completely blackballed,
[34:50.840 --> 34:58.040]  and the left has openly come out when Obama saw that Trump won and set up this office
[34:58.040 --> 35:03.440]  of countering propaganda in the Pentagon, but it's part of the CIA and that I've learned
[35:03.440 --> 35:08.520]  is the group with no attention that is working with the leftists and the media to have the
[35:08.520 --> 35:15.440]  mainstream media fact check all conservatives and ban us and then put their results on top
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.760]  ahead of manipulating the election and then Senator Warner, Wyden, and Murphy are all
[35:20.760 --> 35:26.320]  in Obama's defense authorization saying they would run the counter to Trump, so Trump
[35:26.320 --> 35:31.200]  needs to remove this, this is a cancer, and Coulter joins us to talk about being one of
[35:31.200 --> 35:35.800]  the most banned people in the world and where she thinks this is going with only 70 days
[35:35.800 --> 35:40.600]  left before what I think is the most important election, not just in US history, but world
[35:40.600 --> 35:43.080]  history, and Coulter, thanks for joining us.
[35:43.080 --> 35:47.400]  Absolutely, good to be in the bunker with you.
[35:47.400 --> 35:50.800]  We're in the bunker, you heard my little two minute rant, you're the expert on this,
[35:50.800 --> 35:54.800]  what would you call this period in history?
[35:54.800 --> 36:01.520]  It is like nothing, I think this country's seen before, I mean what they've done to you
[36:01.520 --> 36:09.840]  and many others, the left's the resistance, a military term by the way, if Trump had lost
[36:09.840 --> 36:15.640]  the election and as Hillary did, said, I'm joining the resistance, they would have said
[36:15.640 --> 36:23.040]  this is a dog whistle to the KKK, it's a military term, and then imagine if right wingers started
[36:23.040 --> 36:28.720]  beating up Hillary supporters, as we have seen, left wingers and anti-fog beating up
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.320]  Trump supporters, I think the country would recognize we're in the middle of a fascist
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.040]  uprising, but no, because the fascist uprising is being cheered on and encouraged by the
[36:38.040 --> 36:47.440]  mainstream media, it just goes without comment, but for the resistance to suddenly act as
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.440]  if they don't like conspiracy theories, I at least actually, well I argue against conspiracy
[36:54.440 --> 37:01.320]  theories, I don't try to ban them, I'm thinking that argument and free speech works on that.
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.920]  When we're living through the biggest conspiracy theory of all, this Russia nonsense invented
[37:06.920 --> 37:12.320]  by Hillary, as she always does, when she's caught in some sort of scandal, she did with
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.560]  Jennifer Flowers, she went on TV and talked about some man in Arkansas.
[37:17.560 --> 37:19.060]  Fast right wing conspiracies.
[37:19.060 --> 37:24.200]  Right, up for it, we do explain Monica Lewinsky, both of which turned out to be true, when
[37:24.200 --> 37:29.840]  her healthcare plan went down, she accused the media of buying into and promoting right
[37:29.840 --> 37:35.480]  wing talking points, because you know how the media just hangs on, well, my every word,
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.680]  whatever I put out there, they're repeating right there in the New York Times.
[37:39.680 --> 37:44.360]  It's just been absolute madness, though, and from her, every time she's caught in some
[37:44.360 --> 37:51.040]  scandal, she finds some mysterious bad actor, malefactor, Linda Tripp conspiring against
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.720]  her and her husband, so when the Democrats are caught in the middle of WikiLeaks, which
[37:55.720 --> 38:02.440]  was very embarrassing for the Democrats there, they were sabotaging Bernie Sanders, Democrats
[38:02.440 --> 38:04.720]  all over Capitol Hill were furious with...
[38:04.720 --> 38:09.080]  They were running Google, they were gaming everything, they were getting the questions
[38:09.080 --> 38:11.680]  beforehand from CNN.
[38:11.680 --> 38:18.680]  And that's when Hillary concocted the conspiracy of Russia and Trump conspiring to steal the
[38:18.680 --> 38:19.840]  election from her.
[38:19.840 --> 38:24.800]  At the time, as you'll read in my book, Resistance is Fusile, how the Trump-hating left lost
[38:24.800 --> 38:32.160]  his collective mind, at the time all the mainstream press, the New York Times, was utterly skeptical,
[38:32.160 --> 38:38.920]  could barely control their laughing over Hillary's conspiracy theory about Russia saying, well,
[38:38.920 --> 38:42.720]  paraphrasing, wow, even the John Birchers didn't come up with something like this.
[38:42.720 --> 38:46.400]  Well, yeah, they said that, they pointed out Hillary has the Russian problem with Uranium
[38:46.400 --> 38:47.400]  1.
[38:47.400 --> 38:53.360]  Oh, she has plenty of problems, including colluding with Russia for that Russian dossier put
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.320]  together by Christopher Steele.
[38:55.320 --> 39:01.280]  It was only after Trump won the election that suddenly all these respectable news outlets
[39:01.280 --> 39:06.040]  that had ridiculed Hillary's Russian conspiracy theory at the time, when she was using to
[39:06.040 --> 39:12.360]  deflect from the Wikipedia leaks, suddenly they went back and, oh my gosh, maybe there's
[39:12.360 --> 39:14.040]  something to this Russian business.
[39:14.040 --> 39:21.400]  Now, they're the ones dragging this country through a completely demented conspiracy between
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.520]  the Trump campaign, there was no Trump campaign.
[39:24.520 --> 39:26.920]  I mean, it would be weird enough to say...
[39:26.920 --> 39:29.640]  It was Donald Trump, I mean, that was it.
[39:29.640 --> 39:30.640]  Exactly.
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.160]  He didn't have advancement and pollsters and expensive campaign consultants, his idea
[39:35.160 --> 39:40.760]  was, I know, I'll fly around the country giving speeches and pushing popular ideas, and that'll
[39:40.760 --> 39:41.760]  win me the White House.
[39:41.760 --> 39:46.600]  They laughed at him throughout his campaign, and then when it worked, oh my gosh, there
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.320]  must have been a secret conspiracy with a campaign that didn't exist.
[39:51.320 --> 39:52.320]  You're absolutely right.
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.360]  Let me ask you this, Ann Coulter, because you're one of the most banned people after
[39:56.360 --> 39:57.360]  me.
[39:57.360 --> 40:00.640]  I don't even like that distinction, but I'll go with it.
[40:00.640 --> 40:01.920]  Why are you so banned?
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.360]  Why is Prager, he's as banned as you and I?
[40:06.360 --> 40:07.720]  Why are they doing this?
[40:07.720 --> 40:13.280]  It's so authoritarian, and then they call for us all to be banned in thousands of articles.
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.240]  Then CNN goes, Friday, Trump's crazy, no one's banning anybody.
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.160]  When anybody can look at the numbers, it's like 96%, so what's going on there?
[40:23.160 --> 40:33.400]  Oh yes, well, you have about 800 million followers, that's why you're banned, and with Prager
[40:33.400 --> 40:40.160]  and me, they tried to, I don't know about Prager, I know very specifically how the
[40:40.160 --> 40:42.160]  media has treated me throughout my career.
[40:42.160 --> 40:44.840]  So talk about yourself, because you're one of them, you're the top five most banned
[40:44.840 --> 40:45.840]  people.
[40:45.840 --> 40:54.600]  I suspect that's true, when I first started going on TV for slander and treason and god
[40:54.600 --> 40:59.840]  listen and so on, their idea was, okay, we'll bring her on TV, we'll treat her like she's
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.040]  David Duke, so we can just what they did to Trump, we'll communicate to the public.
[41:04.040 --> 41:08.920]  Do not read this person, do not listen to this person, we'll scowl when she walks on,
[41:08.920 --> 41:12.920]  we'll yell at her, we'll take some joke out of context and blow it up into a huge big
[41:12.920 --> 41:13.920]  deal.
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.040]  Every time they did that, people would hear enough of me on TV to realize that they believed
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.160]  me and not the media, whomever the interviewer was would end up looking bad, I'd sell lots
[41:24.160 --> 41:25.160]  of books.
[41:25.160 --> 41:30.040]  So I'd say about five books back, they just decided, that's it, we're going to pretend
[41:30.040 --> 41:35.880]  she doesn't exist, and I mean, the only solace I have is it's got to be driving them crazy
[41:35.880 --> 41:38.920]  as I keep writing these books, they must have interns running in.
[41:38.920 --> 41:43.560]  Look at what she says here, we've got to attack her, settle down Dennis, we're not putting
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.560]  her on air.
[41:44.560 --> 41:47.680]  Well, I was about to say, let's talk about your new book, Resist This Futile, with a
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.240]  great title, but that's it, they couldn't beat you by misrepresenting what you said,
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.640]  so now they are just banning you completely, even though it's killing the NFL, it's killing
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.680]  Hollywood to ban conservatives, to be anti-American, they're all really destroying themselves in
[42:04.680 --> 42:05.680]  the process.
[42:05.680 --> 42:11.840]  Well, the danger is, I mean, it hasn't happened yet, but I have to say I've worried about
[42:11.840 --> 42:18.440]  this for some years now, it sounds like a science fiction nightmare of mine, that I
[42:18.440 --> 42:24.920]  just wake up one day, try to click on to, you know, the Breitbart report, or email with
[42:24.920 --> 42:28.400]  Matt Drudge, and it would just shut down, I wouldn't be able to get through, there would
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.600]  be no Breitbart.com, there would be no Daily Caller, we won't be able to communicate.
[42:33.600 --> 42:38.920]  Well, stay there because de-platforming and the Chinese social score model is what they're
[42:38.920 --> 42:44.360]  bringing here, they're trying to cut our software off that runs info-wars.com, inculter inculter.com,
[42:44.360 --> 42:49.040]  her new book, we'll talk about it, show on the other side, resistance is futile, an amazing
[42:49.040 --> 42:52.200]  headline, but an amazing name, can't wait to read it, and then we'll talk about what
[42:52.200 --> 42:57.440]  does Trump need to do with 69 and a half days left to counter this purge.
[42:57.440 --> 43:02.160]  We knew it was coming, the whole thing was for me like, first demonize info wars, lie
[43:02.160 --> 43:07.360]  about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake
[43:07.360 --> 43:13.520]  strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia,
[43:13.520 --> 43:20.160]  and then voila, two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.200]  where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.

[47:02.080 --> 47:19.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.120 --> 47:23.240]  All right, in culture one of the top selling political authors of all time is with us her
[47:23.240 --> 47:24.240]  new book.
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.120]  His resistance is futile, we're an amazing title, I've read many of her books.
[47:28.120 --> 47:31.360]  Thank God for in culture helping get the ground ready for Donald Trump.
[47:31.360 --> 47:38.280]  But Trump's not perfect, but he's under attack because he's a real president and specifically
[47:38.280 --> 47:44.080]  the Democrats have met with Senator Warner, Wyden and Murphy and I've got all that we're
[47:44.080 --> 47:45.080]  going to put it on screen.
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.760]  Executive orders Obama signed before he left office taking defense authorization money,
[47:50.760 --> 47:56.160]  Pentagon money and using it to quote counter right wing media, which they all call Russian.
[47:56.160 --> 48:03.720]  So when you see CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times involved this project Veritas exposed in everybody's
[48:03.720 --> 48:05.800]  accounts censoring us.
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.520]  It's the perfect storm of dying media, the Democratic Party and big tech all merging
[48:10.520 --> 48:12.520]  to steal the 2018 election.
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.160]  They admit they're doing it and I know you're aware of all that.
[48:16.160 --> 48:18.400]  You've been shadow banned, you've been completely blocked.
[48:18.400 --> 48:22.600]  They put nothing but negative search results, 10 pages deep in front of you used to you'd
[48:22.600 --> 48:25.280]  be number one with what you did because it was popular.
[48:25.280 --> 48:28.560]  They've broken their algorithm to try to steal this election.
[48:28.560 --> 48:30.640]  I think they've jumped the shark.
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.040]  I think it's going to backfire when Hillary couldn't control the media when she tried
[48:34.040 --> 48:35.200]  to control Google.
[48:35.200 --> 48:36.200]  It didn't work.
[48:36.200 --> 48:41.960]  Now they've openly taken the dying dinosaur media who aren't just now failed news.
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.720]  They're now anti free speech stasi and put them in charge.
[48:46.720 --> 48:49.840]  This is beyond like you said a science fiction novel.
[48:49.840 --> 48:55.240]  So A, what's your take on that and B, as you're being unpersoned like I am?
[48:55.240 --> 48:59.120]  What do you think the president who's the only guy in government speaking out against
[48:59.120 --> 49:00.120]  this?
[49:00.120 --> 49:01.120]  What do you think he should do?
[49:01.120 --> 49:02.120]  What should Congress do?
[49:02.120 --> 49:10.600]  Well, there are things that can be done and just to reiterate what you just said, consider
[49:10.600 --> 49:14.760]  how strong liberals consider their arguments.
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.960]  They've got all of the mainstream media, 100%, ABC, NBC, CBS, all of the cables, the major
[49:20.960 --> 49:26.200]  news, newspapers, the major news magazines, they've got Yahoo, AOL.
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.320]  They have the swamp in Washington.
[49:28.320 --> 49:29.960]  They've got Hollywood.
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.560]  They have Silicon Valley and now they're down to the last corners of the internet.
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.440]  Oh no, conservatives can speak to one another.
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.440]  We must shut it off.
[49:39.440 --> 49:44.040]  I have to say, if I were advising liberals with their insane opinions, I'd say, yep,
[49:44.040 --> 49:45.040]  that's what you've got to do.
[49:45.040 --> 49:53.160]  You've got to shut off free speech on the internet and it reminds me of Robert Mueller's
[49:53.160 --> 49:59.000]  indictment of the 13 Russians, which I describe in my book.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.560]  The most interesting thing about that indictment and that Mueller being terrified of these
[50:03.560 --> 50:10.720]  Russian bots and their woke blacks Instagram account is that the Office of Special Counsel
[50:10.720 --> 50:15.600]  knows less about social media than even the Senators questioning Mark Zuckerberg.
[50:15.600 --> 50:21.680]  They have no idea how it works and the argument is basically that 13 Russians, with a few
[50:21.680 --> 50:29.080]  Facebook ads, managed to overwhelm the entire American media, which also kind of had its
[50:29.080 --> 50:32.280]  finger on the scale, making very clear you are not to vote.
[50:32.280 --> 50:36.960]  Oh, New York Times, 98% chance the Hillary was going to win and so instead of saying
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.840]  America had a populist movement, oh, it's the Russians.
[50:40.840 --> 50:41.840]  Oh yeah.
[50:41.840 --> 50:42.840]  Oh yeah.
[50:42.840 --> 50:43.840]  And 13 Russians.
[50:43.840 --> 50:47.960]  You know, if 13 Russians can overwhelm our entire media, I got to tell you, Alex, I hope
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.200]  they're running our country because things would run so smoothly.
[50:51.200 --> 50:53.200]  No, I agree.
[50:53.200 --> 50:55.560]  Are they giving us 4.6% growth rate?
[50:55.560 --> 50:58.880]  Are they giving us a rebuilt military, thousands of factories?
[50:58.880 --> 51:02.560]  Wow, the Russians really love us.
[51:02.560 --> 51:09.320]  And they put Trump in the presidency, so thank you, Russia.
[51:09.320 --> 51:12.440]  There are things that can be done, but the overall point, I think.
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.680]  But that'll be the headline, deceptively, not sarcasm, and culture thanks Russia for
[51:18.680 --> 51:19.680]  electing Trump.
[51:19.680 --> 51:26.960]  Yes, they've become, that's one of my favorite parts of the resistance, how they always make
[51:26.960 --> 51:33.760]  fun of right wingers for being Christians, someone who's afraid, someone in some places
[51:33.760 --> 51:34.760]  is having fun.
[51:34.760 --> 51:35.760]  No, that's them.
[51:35.760 --> 51:39.120]  They have become the moral scolds.
[51:39.120 --> 51:45.480]  They have become the man, the big office, and the big grief case going in, and no, humor
[51:45.480 --> 51:51.120]  is gone, they have no sense of irony, sarcasm, they're the ones who will go on and patrol
[51:51.120 --> 51:54.880]  social media tweets and apparently bots.
[51:54.880 --> 52:03.760]  But the end result is, I think, these huge avenues of First Amendment speech, Google,
[52:03.760 --> 52:11.280]  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, they have to have the First Amendment applied to them.
[52:11.280 --> 52:16.520]  These idiot conservatives at certain places, I won't mention like National Review, they
[52:16.520 --> 52:21.080]  think they're so brave and brilliant saying, well, it's not the government, so it doesn't
[52:21.080 --> 52:22.320]  violate the First Amendment.
[52:22.320 --> 52:28.000]  No, I'm sorry, at some point, when you have a total monopoly on how people can communicate
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.680]  with one another, we do have legal concepts like natural monopolies and utilities.
[52:35.680 --> 52:41.400]  And unless they start living under the First Amendment, I think the law should force them
[52:41.400 --> 52:42.400]  to.
[52:42.400 --> 52:46.520]  Right now, the law is written in such a way so that they are simultaneously publishers,
[52:46.520 --> 52:51.240]  so they will determine who can be heard or seen on their airway, so they're acting
[52:51.240 --> 52:52.240]  like a New Yorker.
[52:52.240 --> 52:53.240]  And immune.
[52:53.240 --> 52:59.840]  Yeah, and also immune, yeah, totally immune from suit, so I'm sorry, you don't get those
[52:59.840 --> 53:03.240]  kinds of privileges in a country that still believes in free speech.
[53:03.240 --> 53:08.720]  Well, exactly, they ran a Hill article, a fake poll at the methodology, and then they're
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.480]  paying for it as an ad.
[53:10.480 --> 53:14.600]  Majority of Americans say, Van Allen Shones, they took me as a target, misrepresented what
[53:14.600 --> 53:19.080]  I said, now they're banning everybody else after me and thank God Trump's trying to move
[53:19.080 --> 53:21.840]  against him and culture is our guest.
[53:21.840 --> 53:24.880]  Talk a few minutes about only like four minutes left, I hope you'll come back soon, there's
[53:24.880 --> 53:31.160]  so much is happening 15 years is too long about your term, resistance is futile, obviously
[53:31.160 --> 53:32.160]  that's from Star Trek.
[53:32.160 --> 53:33.160]  I've made that point.
[53:33.160 --> 53:37.720]  The universities, the left, everything is, they're saying resistance is futile, but like
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.000]  you said, they've already banned us everywhere, Hollywood, TV, everywhere.
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.240]  Now they want to control people talking to their cousins on Facebook, I think they've
[53:47.240 --> 53:48.240]  jumped the shark.
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.240]  I think this is backfiring.
[53:49.240 --> 53:56.120]  I certainly think over all the resistance is backfiring, I mean, I find myself reacting
[53:56.120 --> 53:57.120]  this way.
[53:57.120 --> 54:01.320]  I've been a little testy with the president for not even starting the wall, his central
[54:01.320 --> 54:06.360]  campaign promise, and then, and then the left goes off on some crazy, you know, the access
[54:06.360 --> 54:09.840]  Hollywood tape, oh, he admits to committing sexual assault on it.
[54:09.840 --> 54:10.840]  No, he didn't.
[54:10.840 --> 54:15.840]  He said they let you do it, that is by definition, it's like Elvis, he said the women are jumping
[54:15.840 --> 54:16.840]  on you.
[54:16.840 --> 54:21.920]  Yeah, it was, it was, he was actually talking about celebrity culture and with some degree
[54:21.920 --> 54:25.920]  of disapproval, all of which I go through in my book, the craziness over Charlottesville
[54:25.920 --> 54:31.920]  and how it was in a dog whistle to, I don't know, again, the Klan, it's always the non-existent
[54:31.920 --> 54:32.920]  Klan.
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.560]  Most people in the Klan are putting in expense reports with the FBI.
[54:36.560 --> 54:37.560]  Exactly.
[54:37.560 --> 54:43.320]  By saying both sides, both sides, both sides, they come out with these outrageously unfair
[54:43.320 --> 54:46.080]  attacks and they drive me right back into his corner.
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.400]  Now, you know, look, if, if Democrats care about their fellow Americans, the working
[54:50.400 --> 54:57.280]  class, the middle class, even computer programmers who are losing jobs to the, to the H-1B workers,
[54:57.280 --> 55:03.040]  can't we join together and, and, and do good things for the people already here?
[55:03.040 --> 55:05.160]  It's not like Trump is a down the line Republican.
[55:05.160 --> 55:07.880]  It's not like we don't have one of the most open borders already, exactly.
[55:07.880 --> 55:09.640]  Somebody asked this question.
[55:09.640 --> 55:12.040]  What happens if they win the midterms of Democrats?
[55:12.040 --> 55:13.440]  What happens if they lose?
[55:13.440 --> 55:14.440]  That's the key questions.
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.200]  Well, A, what is your prediction for the midterms and what happens either way?
[55:18.200 --> 55:24.320]  Well, I'm worried the, the historical odds are that we are going to have a blue wave.
[55:24.320 --> 55:30.600]  Um, so the odds are Democrats do at least win the House, um, since the Civil War.
[55:30.600 --> 55:33.280]  Well, they'll definitely impeach him.
[55:33.280 --> 55:34.640]  They'll impeach him for a hangnail.
[55:34.640 --> 55:35.640]  It doesn't matter.
[55:35.640 --> 55:37.240]  Their base is white hot.
[55:37.240 --> 55:40.920]  And I think it'll pretty much be the end of a lot of the Trump agenda on the, on the
[55:40.920 --> 55:46.600]  optimistic side, um, they will look crazy if they impeach him and most of the things
[55:46.600 --> 55:50.960]  Trump promised during his campaign, he doesn't need Congress for, he doesn't need Congress
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.960]  to build a wall.
[55:51.960 --> 55:52.960]  He's the commander in chief.
[55:52.960 --> 55:54.600]  Look at your pocket constitution.
[55:54.600 --> 55:56.520]  It's his job to protect the borders.
[55:56.520 --> 55:59.560]  So maybe he could get back to the things he promised during the campaign.
[55:59.560 --> 56:05.680]  If he, if once, once Congress has completely cut off to him, so you're kind of predicting
[56:05.680 --> 56:11.000]  because since the Civil War, the demo, whoever's, you know, in power loses the house, but things
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.160]  are a little different now.
[56:12.160 --> 56:13.160]  Gut level.
[56:13.160 --> 56:14.160]  What do you think?
[56:14.160 --> 56:15.160]  Yeah.
[56:15.160 --> 56:17.680]  I really don't know.
[56:17.680 --> 56:18.680]  I don't know.
[56:18.680 --> 56:20.180]  So, so they win.
[56:20.180 --> 56:21.180]  They're good.
[56:21.180 --> 56:22.180]  I say when I don't know.
[56:22.180 --> 56:23.180]  I agree.
[56:23.180 --> 56:25.560]  So, so if they, if they win, they go crazy.
[56:25.560 --> 56:27.680]  What happens if they lose?
[56:27.680 --> 56:30.920]  Um, well, they'll, it'll be a lot of fun.
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.520]  They'll go crazy, but it won't be the end of the Trump agenda.
[56:34.520 --> 56:37.640]  They'll still, and by the way, we were probably going to hold the Senate that much.
[56:37.640 --> 56:38.640]  I'll predict.
[56:38.640 --> 56:41.480]  And it also depends a lot on what Trump does over the next few months.
[56:41.480 --> 56:44.800]  I think he needs to go back to campaign mode, do nothing.
[56:44.800 --> 56:46.800]  His calendar should be blocked off September.
[56:46.800 --> 56:47.800]  No, I agree.
[56:47.800 --> 56:50.160]  How do people go against the president?
[56:50.160 --> 56:52.440]  It's given him a 4.6 growth rate.
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.320]  How do you piss on prosperity?
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.880]  That's true, but, um, you never know what's good.
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.360]  I mean, I was just down at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, um, asking them, come
[57:03.360 --> 57:04.360]  on.
[57:04.360 --> 57:05.840]  It's all, there's gravity.
[57:05.840 --> 57:08.040]  It can't keep going up forever.
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.520]  And oh boy, watch out when, when the stock market falls.
[57:12.520 --> 57:13.920]  All right.
[57:13.920 --> 57:17.880]  The new book is resistance futile and culture in culture.com.
[57:17.880 --> 57:18.880]  Great to have you back on.
[57:18.880 --> 57:21.040]  Hope we don't totally get put in a gulag here.
[57:21.040 --> 57:23.000]  We're both being massively censored.

[57:29.720 --> 57:30.720]  There you go.
[57:30.720 --> 57:33.520]  What a heretic joining the most banned show in the world in full wars.com.
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.840]  Roger Stone has come out and said he does now believe he's about to be indicted.

[59:51.600 --> 01:00:11.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:29.400]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting over the wide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:50.760]  Hard to turn that music off, it was Junior Brown, surf medley, trying to get Roger on
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.760]  this guy.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.680]  I know he's thought he's pretty close to being indicted by Mueller, that his house surrounded
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.200]  this weekend, and I saw a headline that he says he's about to be indicted, so I wanted
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.400]  to get him on to get into that.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.400]  I did not plug any last hour, any products or anything, because I get so busy, I get
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:16.560]  so obsessed with the news, I don't plug, I don't sit there and then plug every segment
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.600]  like other talk shows do, and that's my biggest problem.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.400]  I'd have done that over the years, before all the shadow bang and the rest of it, we'd
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.360]  be sitting on top $20 million or something to fund ourselves for a few years, but we're
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.360]  not.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  We're not.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.240]  So I'm asking listeners to get products you need that are really high quality, the best
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:43.280]  supplements out there, the best air filtration, the best water filtration, and to go to infoworkstore.com.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.640]  By the way, when you have the top of the line products, like bodies, that we can click on
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:02:00.960]  right there for TV viewers, and it's 95% curcumin, the leading competitors are 3%, curcumin
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.240]  comes from the turmeric, so good for you on so many fronts.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:14.480]  When you go for something that's California standard, which almost no one can pass, and
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.440]  that is the best 95%, and you may have contracts with the companies that they're going to test
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:27.000]  it, and it's going to be at that, well, it's been five, six months since we got more in.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.960]  And so I've been flipping out on these companies saying I'm going to go to somebody else, even
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.680]  though you're the top company, and so they got us 3,000 bottles of it, and it's going
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.920]  to sell out in a couple of weeks, and then it might be October until we get more bodies
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.720]  in, folks, leading competitors are $60, $70, because it's patented to be able to have curcumin
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:52.120]  at 95%, it's got other ingredients that accelerate it, and it's so good for inflammation, antioxidant,
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:58.400]  just, I mean, turmeric's amazing, it's curry, but it's the concentrate.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.360]  I mean, in one tablet, it sounds like the equivalent of eating a whole bag of curry, basically.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:11.720]  So bodies, we got a limited shipment after being sold out, and it's about to be gone,
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:19.640]  and my guys are like, listen, it has 4.9 stars, 98% reviews, nobody else has got that, everybody
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.000]  loves it, Alex, shall it at full price, we need to fund the operation.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.960]  I believe in selling it 50% off, because when it comes back in in October, I want to say
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.760]  it's been sold out and then have a bunch of it and everybody use it, and then love it
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:40.720]  and sign up for auto-ship and get an additional 10% off, just how I operate.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.760]  Bodies, joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support,
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.280]  my wife played competitive tennis for a long time, did a lot of weightlifting, she heard
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.120]  her hip or elbow, she's able to get back into weightlifting after she went to medical doctors
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.440]  to prescriptions, you name it, none of it worked, she went on bodies, she was taking regular
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.000]  turmeric, and I said baby, that's not real turmeric, I looked up the brand, it's like
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.880]  10% maybe, I said how about this, a month after she was on it, she's back in tennis,
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.400]  everything else, this is like five months ago.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.200]  So she had a baby and some things as well, but the point is, from our research, this
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:25.080]  is the very best turmeric compound out there, 95% are cumanoids, Boswella, Satara extract,
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.480]  organic, experiment, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, peppering from black pepper, it's
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.760]  all there, m4store.com, m4slime.com, and it will be sold out for a while when it's gone,
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:44.920]  so if you want bodies, get a 50% off at m4store.com, and of course, there's also 50% off, really
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.720]  it's more than that, the ultimate bone broth formula, read about how great that is, and
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.200]  it funds our operation, so we've got super silver, 25% off as well, m4store.com, Roger
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.200]  Stone straight ahead.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:01.840]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from m4store.com, when you spread the videos,
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.800]  you are changing the world, it's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist, it
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.360]  is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.240]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world,
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.120]  and that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word,
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.120]  you are the info warrior, and now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:31.600]  important than ever that everyone go to m4wars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email,
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.400]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.800]  news, intel, you name it, and so now I ask you more than ever to share the m4wars.com
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.120]  articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to,
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:51.960]  so bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at m4wars.com forward slash
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:06:21.880]  newsletter, we are the renaissance, and we are winning.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:27.080]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, Cody Wilson, the inventor of the 3D printable gun that's
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.520]  all over the nose, and me in studio, whether this is a fellow Austinite, crumbs weighed
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.960]  in on it, don't agree with what he's saying, but there's so much to cover.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.920]  In the brief time we have, Roger Stone, thank you for joining us, she's got a dental appointment
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.760]  I know for broken tooth, it's in the news that you're saying you now believe you will
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.920]  be indicted by Mueller, we talked this weekend, you weren't sure, is that accurate in the
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.280]  Hill in the Wall Street Journal, and then let's also get into Trump finally going, millions
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.160]  are being censored, it's criminal, they've banned 96% of conservatives, yeah, they're
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.000]  stealing the election, so let's cover both those topics, Roger Stone, former head of
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.680]  the Trump campaign.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.440]  Well Alex, it's kind of a conundrum, because first of all I know that the special counsel
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:15.340]  has no evidence of Russian collusion on my part, or trafficking in allegedly hacked emails
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:21.480]  with WikiLeaks, that didn't happen either, any other nonsense pertaining to John Podesta's
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.480]  emails.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.480]  On the other hand, I'm a realistic man, I know that I've been under government surveillance
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:33.800]  since June of 2016, no probable cause for that of course, I know the special counsel
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:39.960]  has had full access to all my financial and bank records, I know that at least 12 of my
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:46.680]  current or former colleagues have been interrogated by the FBI, I know that at least four of
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:52.240]  my current or former colleagues have been dragged in front of the grand jury, and we
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:59.200]  both know that a runaway special counsel with a political agenda can indict the proverbial
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.200]  ham sin.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.560]  And he's desperate to cover up his real uranium one ties and the rest of it, so let me ask
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.600]  you this, what if they are going to indict you, what's the time frame, and what do you
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.960]  think it'll be, not obviously Russia's just like everything else, that they're going to
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.800]  claim obstruction, are they going to claim that you lied to the FBI, what are they going
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]  to say?
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.800]  Well, I've never been interviewed by the FBI or the special counsel, I don't know.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.400]  Will you try to say perjury to Congress?
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.760]  No, because there is no perjury, my testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Adam
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:35.840]  Schiff and Alec and Eric Swalwell notwithstanding is 100% truthful and accurate and I stand
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:42.560]  by every word, no, Alex, it's a conundrum, they're frieversly looking for a pump.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.560]  Like Manafort?
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560]  IRS?
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.320]  No, I don't think so, because I've paid my taxes and I didn't...
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.320]  No, I understand you didn't do anything, I'm saying, what do you think they're cooking
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.320]  up?
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:58.840]  Yes, perhaps some bogus campaign finance violation, because I've been active in American politics
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  for almost four years.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.120]  Yeah, we know that's what they're looking into as you and the Danny Williams stuff,
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:06.680]  all totally legitimate, when we know they've asked people about me and you and money in
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.680]  campaign.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.360]  Oh, no, there's no question, it's interesting that all 12 of my former associates have been
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.320]  questioned by the FBI, I've been asked about my relationship with Alex Jones and my relationship
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.080]  with Infowars.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:28.080]  It's a witch hunt and when I go out to start to raise the money to defend myself because
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.040]  this threatens to destroy me, Alex, it threatens to destroy my family.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.200]  I'm not wealthy.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:40.400]  You can go online and see a story that says, Roger Stone is worth $20 million in your dreams.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.560]  That's a planted story, probably put forward by David Brock or some other...
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.560]  Oh, let's go forward.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:51.720]  They have articles saying Americans say Ban Jones and then, oh, they agree in polls, it's
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.800]  a fake poll, it's an advertisement they're putting out in a huge media body.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.720]  No, no, I know your finances, you're almost bankrupt, we don't want to get into it.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.800]  I'm not worth the money they say I am, they count the equipment in my office, maybe three
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.680]  or four million, but that's all equipment.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:12.360]  So exactly, this is total fraud and what's scary is, they're asking about me constantly,
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.200]  they have the New York Times, the Washington Post, camped out in Austin, and they keep
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.400]  asking everyone, where's the money, Russians, campaign money, where's Alex's campaign money?
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.920]  I've never taken any campaign money, but you can see them just trying to have that New
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.040]  York Times hit piece come out the day I'm arrested.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.000]  Yeah, I think that's exactly what they have in mind.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.960]  Look, let's break this down for our audience.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.960]  We both know what my crime is, what your crime is.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.800]  Our crime is very simple.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.440]  We supported Donald Trump for president and we helped defeat Cook at Hillary.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.520]  There's our crime in the nutshell.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.200]  Now the question is, will the witch hunt get us in the meantime, or will the president
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200]  act first?
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.400]  I'd say we'll pay back by this witch and her criminal crew work.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.400]  No it won't.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400]  Trump must take action.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.400]  Well, so how does he do that?
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.840]  Well, there's a number of things he can do.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.800]  Let's start by firing Don McGahn, the White House counsel who keeps urging him to take
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.480]  no action and who's gone over the side, 30 hours of interrogation, or I should say 30
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:20.080]  hours of interviews with the special counsel, 30 hours, that's longer than an entire day.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.680]  What could he possibly have to say about Donald Trump in that 30 hour period?
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.520]  I would can him so fast his head would spin.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:35.560]  Secondarily, declassify all of the government documents pertaining to the illegal unconstitutional
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.360]  FISA warrants.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.280]  Number three, declassify all of Hillary's known emails.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:50.360]  Number four, declassify all of the emails that Huma Abedin forwarded to her husband,
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.480]  Anthony Weiner.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:58.120]  We now know of 700,000 emails, only 3,000 of them were reviewed by the FBI, and those
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.200]  were handpicked by none other than Peter Strock.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.000]  Step number four, fire Jeff Sessions.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.120]  Step number five, fire Rod Rosenstein.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.200]  Step number six, fire as deep into your Justice Department as you need to to find a man or
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.440]  woman committed to the rule of law.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.480]  Those are the steps the president must do, and then go on a massive offensive in guiding
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.480]  all these enemies.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.960]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.040]  And take all their, notice they're all groveling for their security clearances and they use
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.480]  that to direct their operatives still in government.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.960]  Take all the Obama people, 50 deep, all of their clearances.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.840]  Well, in order the immediate arrest of Bill, Hillary, and yes, Barack Obama, because you
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.800]  see Alex, no person is above the law.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.480]  Remember when they told us that endlessly after Watergate, those sanctimonious liberals,
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.080]  no person is above the law?
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:58.240]  Well, Barack Obama sold weapons to ISIS in violation of the law, and he should be prosecuted
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]  for it.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:05.400]  President Hillary profited from a massive criminal scheme called the Clinton Foundation.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.360]  And don't forget Haiti.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.040]  You know, Haiti just goes on and on and on.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.080]  So you have to turn this on them.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]  It should have been.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.080]  I agree.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.080]  This is total offense.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.480]  They have their knives sharpened for the president, his family.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.240]  The only option is total political war.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.400]  Well, and, you know, again, I did say here on Info Wars that very good sources told me
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.200]  that Robert Mueller is targeting Donald Trump Jr.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.040]  I didn't say that because I don't like Donald Trump Jr.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.200]  Now, you broke that a week and a half before.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.400]  It's all confirmed now.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.840]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.160]  They're looking at him for some kind of process crime.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.320]  Originally I was told it was lying to the FBI.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:50.080]  Now I'm told they're going to try to implicate him in Michael Cohen's payments to Stormy
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.440]  Daniels.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.720]  Payments that I believe, based on vast experience...
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.600]  Even the former head of the Federal Election Commission says they're totally legal.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.600]  Perfectly legal.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.600]  Was private money.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.600]  Perfectly legal.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.040]  So, you know, it is the president's got to get off defense and on offense.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.640]  He has the power.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640]  They don't have the power.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.120]  Even the LA Times and others, the San Francisco Chronicles say, and even Hayden has said, and
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.960]  the Democrats even, you know, they've said, leave him alone.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960]  You're about to make Trump mad.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960]  Let's get him.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.600]  If we win the midterm, stop, stop, they go, you're about to piss him off.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.600]  Exactly.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.840]  He's got all the power now.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.640]  Use it.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.640]  Could not agree more.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.760]  Look, the president appears to be reaching his boiling point.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  He seems to have figured out the internet censorship issue.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.880]  He's going with his gut.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.880]  How good is that?
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.520]  And he talks about us without mentioning our name.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:45.240]  Those whose names I can't mention have been banned on social media.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.680]  You can't ban one guy.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.680]  That's wrong.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.480]  The fake news is CNN.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.480]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480]  So, Mr. President...
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.480]  He's confirmed.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480]  He's ordered everybody.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.400]  He doesn't care what Kelly said.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.560]  Anything we send now goes right to him.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.760]  Well, and that's why it's essential that he take action to protect his own family, to
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:08.440]  protect his own administration, protect those who have been taking the point for him.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.240]  We are the revolution here and they seek to silence us.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.360]  Above all, the takedown of Info Wars was part and parcel of their efforts to mount some
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.320]  bogus prosecution of Roger Stone.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.320]  That's why people need to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.040]  Yes, I am building a war chest.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.520]  Yes, I need your help.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.000]  This is the fight for the Republic.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  I agree.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  This is the fight for the Republic.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  People better double down or nothing.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.920]  InfoWarsStore.com, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.000]  It's all about funding this war if you want to win.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.800]  And look how we're able to advise the President.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800]  We're able to have victory.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.200]  They're so scared of us because we're in the fight, but we need you to stand with us.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.320]  Roger Stone, God bless you.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.320]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.080]  And we'll be back with Cody Wilson, 3D gun printer, TreadAhead and so much other news.

[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.600]  Remember?
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:46.120]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:53.120]  They so pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:59.000]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most

[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400]  Hear that?
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:31.840]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.760]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:13.600]  You know, Australia is a good example, Canada is a good example, the U.K. is a good example.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.600]  Why?
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.480]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:24.520]  They somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue, but this is something
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.520]  we should politicize.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.080]  I'm not going to carry a gun, I don't want to be involved in a gunfight.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:37.320]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.840]  up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:50.240]  Go ahead, make my day.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.560]  So the notion that gun laws don't work is not borne out by the evidence.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:00.320]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.640]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.960]  from Afghanistan or Iraq will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.240]  still get their guns.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:21.760]  In many cases, the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:27.320]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.960]  their family from violence.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:36.280]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards, 24 hours a day, seven
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.280]  days a week.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.560]  The average American does not have that.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:45.560]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:59.840]  I mean, look at the team of security you got.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:06.520]  This is the most banned news transmission in the world, and we've got one of the most
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.920]  dreaded individuals as well from the left, the man who first launched five, six years
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:15.200]  ago here in Austin, Texas, the plan for a 3D printable gun.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.560]  And Trump's pro-second amendment, but he likes to be law and order, he's saying he doesn't
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.360]  know this is a good idea.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.920]  Criminals are going to get guns regardless.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.760]  He's put tweets out, Cody Wilson's here with us in studio.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.040]  He's got some big announcements.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:31.360]  He's going to exclusively share with us right now, Amazon, of course, is banned books that
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.640]  even promote what he's doing, so what a time to be censored.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.080]  Few people have been censored as much as I am, but you have, Cody Wilson, great to
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.080]  have you here with us.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.080]  So good to see you, man.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.080]  Good to see you again.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.400]  Well, go ahead, tell us what's currently happening here, where we're both in the center of the
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.400]  news here.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.160]  Man, when I saw you get deplatformed, I was like, uh, Alex, no, I couldn't even read
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:55.200]  the think pieces about why it was a good idea before I got kicked off of my e-commerce
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]  and my stuff got kicked off.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.920]  Oh, I was the first domino.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920]  You were.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.240]  And that we, you literally, our, our intelligentsia doesn't even have the time to formulate justifications
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.040]  for why it's permissible before they're onto the next domino.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.520]  I mean, it's, that's wild to me.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520]  They're making their move.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520]  We're moving so.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520]  I didn't call her on.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.920]  She's a great, I'm like, hey, tell people they're making their move on everybody.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.400]  It's not like cool to be banned.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.120]  They're going after everyone.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.320]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.480]  They're contractors of the state where the state can't go.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.360]  They're happy to just push you, uh, themselves and, and then the way they did it to you.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.480]  I know plenty of people explain to you over, over the months, but the, like viscerally
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.480]  react, the demonization, the brainwashing that they could all move in concert within
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.280]  a, what a four or five hour window together and not have to, which is admitted Sherman
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:38.440]  any trust accession to, and that's what all this just cut and dry illegal, which shows
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.280]  they're going for broke.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.480]  Just wild that they think they could display that, that flex of strength, right?
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.480]  That they're confident.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.480]  You're right.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.480]  It's like having a gold grill and driving a Mercedes.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.480]  They're flexing.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.520]  They get to unperson you and you're a big guy, man.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.840]  If they can unperson you, they can unperson me like that.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:56.760]  What the real message was we're doing it to him, everybody better line up.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.400]  It's a test ahead of the midterms.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.760]  I completely agree.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.200]  And you saw, you've reported here though, these meetings that they're all having before
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.560]  in advance of the midterms.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.080]  I mean, this is, this is clear out in the old, they don't even hide it.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.720]  So why do you think Tim Cook, who runs the slave factories in China, meets with them,
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.920]  launches it all, does it, and they don't care because I think they're scared.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.320]  I think it's showing strength in the face of fear.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.320]  I think that's true.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.280]  They wouldn't move so blatantly if, if their, if their team wasn't in need of signs of
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.280]  strength like that.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.480]  But at the same time, it's also a realization of power, which is new.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.480]  They do have the power.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.480]  In your total, right?
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:37.880]  All 26 companies that banned me in one day or two days comes out to about 4 trillion.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.840]  But the top four companies is $3 trillion.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.920]  So $3 trillion decided we're destroying you.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.920]  Market cap.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920]  Yeah.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920]  I mean, that's, it's the big four companies, right?
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.960]  That are basically the commons.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.840]  So my books and, and even though all my files, everything's a leak, like legal for you to
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.080]  have Facebook won't let you share the links, right?
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.080]  You can't share the links.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.080]  Yeah.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.080]  They're all coordinated.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.760]  And I noticed the new thing is they're banning other people like me or you in concert.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:07.160]  It's like, it's like, they, it's like the, and that's why they all met.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.520]  They're now coordinated.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.240]  Rapid fire without the need for justification.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.120]  When I was dropped from my e-commerce platform, right?
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.840]  That was, that was hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to me done immediately
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.840]  without justification.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.440]  And it did to us too, and so that shows in our advertising platform, this shows they've
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.440]  committed.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.440]  This is a criminal commitment.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.840]  So how does the president strike back?
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.160]  Look, I'm, I'm not willing to say yet that it's imperative that we regulate Facebook.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.840]  I'm not willing to go there.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:31.840]  I don't know what the results are.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.800]  But understand, you can have regulations saying there isn't regulation.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.280]  Regulation just means there's a, they've already under CHICOM and globalist control.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.920]  So libertarians are pure as they go, oh, we can't censor this.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.320]  They're already censoring.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.880]  They're already doing it, Cody.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.280]  So then the president says, no, you can't censor unless it's illegal.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.120]  The answer is saying regulation to say no regulation.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120]  You understand that, right?
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120]  I certainly understand the argument.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.720]  It's like saying, rabbit season is open.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.440]  I hate rabbits.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.000]  I mean, censorship season is open to stop the censors.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.960]  You have to say the law is no censorship.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]  I think what we-
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.120]  See how that isn't, that's not censorship, that's not control to say no.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.400]  When Alex, like Alex, when, when Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress, these, these subtle
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.760]  maneuvers that they make to indicate they want to be regulated, fine.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.840]  Let them put the noose around their own neck and then fine.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.840]  It's open.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.840]  See-
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.120]  Well, they want to be regulated by Mark Warner that runs the whole show.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.880]  They want all kinds of regulation.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.800]  Google wants to build AI for, you know-
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.680]  No, I hear what you're saying that they want to use regulation for their plan, but I'm
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.400]  saying instead of going that route, the Democrats have threatened regulation and just by fiat
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400]  said do this.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.120]  So we're already under EU, Chinese rules.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.240]  They're already standardizing to that and the Democrats, so Republicans go, we're libertarians
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.680]  when the vacuum, like, let's say I'm all for freedom, which I am, then you leave the
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.280]  door open and pirates come in and rape and kill your family.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.840]  To watch the conservatives react to your unpersoning, right?
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.200]  They were happy that it was done, right?
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.280]  They're happy to have the left to work, do the work that they wouldn't do to you.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.880]  And so it's, each side is doing each other's work right now.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.600]  I don't want to be involved in allowing-
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.800]  Well, main line conservatives go after the straw man they built about me and they want
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.440]  to virtue several of the left.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.440]  They still think mainstream media is cool.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.040]  No, no doubt.
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.200]  I just don't want to be guilty of doing the work to allow at some point some regime to
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.800]  tell some social media platform-
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.480]  Okay, so Cody Wilson, the 3D printable gun launcher, the icon of that, with all the big
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.560]  news we'll come back to the next segment and get into what's happening currently with
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560]  you.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.560]  But what do we do then?
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.480]  I think, look, my answer here is a technical and financial answer.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:35.160]  If you have settlement in the browser with cryptocurrency, you can drive financial incentives
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.080]  that prevent consortiums of these interest groups from bounding together, like on YouTube-
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.880]  So you're saying acting as market forces together with free will, we dominate them?
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.760]  I literally believe that Bitcoin is also the answer to questions like this.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.520]  If you make the exchange happen, not at the level of clicking the ad, but at the level
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.360]  of visitation, of unique IP, right, of visitation in the browser, what you do, what you interact
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.880]  with in the content, if that's the settlement layer of the financial internet payment layer-
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:01.880]  It's direct.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.880]  Right.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.040]  And you have to then be as open a platform as you can because that's the only way to
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.440]  survive financially.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.120]  So forcing this- They're forcing us to go point blank.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:13.360]  So honestly, this is a good opportunity for people to build the infrastructure in crypto
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.360]  current.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360]  No, I agree.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.680]  They're extincting themselves, but they've thought about that, which means the moves
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.800]  they're making, Cody, means they're going to a total authoritarian model now as China
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800]  and Europe have.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:28.680]  We have to go to the total libertarian anarchic capital, sort of a call it model now.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.000]  I think that's our only hope.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.040]  I don't know that we'll get there, but their ambition couldn't be clear.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.040]  I agree.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.000]  I always wanted to phase into this because I knew it would take time, but they're forcing
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.840]  us to go through the radical evolution.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.920]  But as you know, this is a great opportunity for growth and strength, right?
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.160]  It's great to build your own stuff.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.800]  I mean, it's- It is, but then when we're popular number one, they're like, Jones, you're number
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.600]  one on both apps on Android and Apple.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.000]  You're just, we're going to de-list you.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  It's all game.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.160]  Alice, we must imagine Sisyphus happy.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.360]  We'll be right back.

[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.440]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:37.800]  laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.800]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winner Sun vitamin D3.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.580]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.740]  brain function.
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:56.400]  Something the globalists are targeting, visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.800]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.520]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.020]  to detoxify the body.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:11.880]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.400]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:18.320]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.160]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.400]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:26.880]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.560]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]  get.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.760]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:40.800]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:46.040]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.880]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]  prayers together.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.880]  We're changing the world.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:33:21.720]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:33:48.560]  here in studio, kind of the ground zero of what the establishment calls disruptive
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.840]  technology as humanity builds towards this singularity and they attempt to suppress
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.840]  the fact in the future.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:59.680]  You can just have your own 3D printable system build a spaceship to take you to Alpha Centurus
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.280]  or give you a new, you know, brain or cancer treatment.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.680]  And so this is the real Renaissance we're talking about.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.600]  And so Cody Wilson's here, he's made a big announcement to Reuters just a few minutes
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:11.600]  ago.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.640]  He's going to make it here on air right now and then I want to ask him how do we counter
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.880]  the draconian takeover of the election, massive election meddling, the crushing of all conservatives,
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.160]  libertarians, Christians, nationalists, pro-Trump people.
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:29.360]  I mean, it's just unprecedented at a Chai-Com level.
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.880]  And then the media is trying to go, how dare Trump even criticize it when it's also naked
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:34.880]  and real.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.040]  But so let's get into just this moment in history we are right now.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.800]  I love that the Chai-Com meme is real now that, you know, a Dianne Feinstein's driver
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.040]  was literally a PRC asset for 25 years or so.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.720]  Oh, the whole thing, the Democrats are Chai-Com operatives.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.720]  It's so great.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.120]  You know that the politician Lee, I forget his first name, but he was busted selling
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.120]  AKs.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.280]  This was gun control politician, he was busted selling AKs to the triads, you know, in Shanghai
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.280]  and stuff.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.200]  Like, I'm sure there's going to be a, you know, we're talking about Russian collusion
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200]  month after month after month.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.040]  I'm sure we'll discover a massive PRC, Chinese, Democrat.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.560]  Oh, the Chinese communists, I mean, they are the Democratic Party.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.560]  Yeah.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:12.800]  And my friend, my co-founder, Dino says one day the PRC tanks will just roll into the
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.000]  streets and it'll all be complete.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.800]  There'll be a military wing of this anti-hack.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.600]  But it'll say Black Lives Matter, someone will just bow down.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.600]  Oh!
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.520]  The social justice operation will be complete when the Chinese boots are on the ground.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520]  I love that meme.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.520]  I think it's so good.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.520]  And not wrong, right?
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.120]  Like, it won't even be funny because it's so close to the truth that it hurts.
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.120]  It is insane.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.120]  So make your big announcement.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.120]  My big announcement.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.680]  Guys, let's zoom in on this guy, not me here.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.680]  He's looking at me too much.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:38.680]  Look, a federal court.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:39.680]  Where do you want me to look?
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:40.680]  Right over there.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.680]  Camera four.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.680]  Damn.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:46.920]  So Washington has been celebrated for issuing an order yesterday saying that no American
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.280]  has the right to post, of course me, and no American as well as me, has the right to
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.320]  post blueprints for guns on the Internet.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.280]  I've had this fight for many years with the State Department, but now the state governments
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.040]  would come in and get a judge to give them this kind of order.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.680]  Importantly though, his order doesn't prevent me from doing many other things.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.200]  And one of those things is what I've announced today.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.040]  I'm simply, if I can't post the files online, I'll simply sell them online.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.720]  Protection Force is a good example of this, there's no way to prevent the sharing of this
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.720]  information.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.040]  So you can go to my website right now, defcat.com.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.080]  You can visit, you can peruse the files, you can click on them, and you can have them
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.080]  mailed to you.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.240]  And of course this judge has permitted me to email them to you, transfer them to you.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.680]  I ask you, what's the difference at that point?
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.480]  And you're following the judge's orders.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.800]  And Reuters put this announcement out, they'll spend it that Jones is selling illegal guns
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.680]  by letting you have your free speech, just like Reuters did.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.040]  So that's just every level they twist and engage in fraud.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.040]  That's right.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:45.920]  Yeah, the AP story that I saw today says, well, he's posting them despite the federal order.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.240]  No, no, I'm posting them according to the federal order.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.240]  Do you understand?
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.360]  The judge gave me the authority to do it.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.720]  I'm not contradicting the judge, I'm only carrying out his authorization.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.680]  And that's the thing is they spend whatever we do just constantly.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:36:59.680]  It's incitement.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:00.680]  It's incitement.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:01.680]  They want somebody to sue me, right?
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.440]  Because they see themselves as an element, right?
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.680]  And you fifth column, you know.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680]  And you've been sued a bunch.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.680]  Oh, so much.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:09.160]  20 states in this union are currently suing me.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.280]  Now, isn't it funny that no matter how much they sue me, no matter how many courts they're
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.680]  bringing me into, I can still give you my files today?
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.000]  Isn't that wild?
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  They've sued me 20 plus times.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.800]  Have they sued you 20 times at the same time?
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.000]  No, no, I think you got me beat here.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  But I mean, it's insane.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.200]  No, you're getting, look, man, you're in court.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.120]  I see your stuff all the time and I'm always like, you know, Alex Jones.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.400]  And a lot of your stuff is free speech stuff.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.400]  A lot of our stuff is simply about this.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.400]  They always make up.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:42.000]  The reason a bunch of stuff's been thrown out is that when it finally gets down to brass
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  tax, we show the judge we didn't say this.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  It's just lies.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.600]  What the problem is that anyone can just come into court and sue you anytime they want
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.760]  and you have to spend two years sorting it out when it was nothing, you know.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.760]  And this is what at the end of the day, the states have decided to do for me.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.200]  Because of course, I didn't lose when I sued the State Department for five years.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.400]  I ended up with a license to publish my files.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.720]  Yeah, remember, Obama had the State Department say no.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.720]  You're right.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.720]  I had to suffer that for five years.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.560]  They claim to some export deal, even though you are a U.S. citizen in America, they claim
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.640]  because it's the web, they claim that you were a foreign distributor.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.640]  That's right.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.640]  An exporter.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.640]  Yeah.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640]  And I had to beat that.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.640]  It took me five years to beat that.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.640]  Now, I built another company.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.640]  I had fun, right?
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:24.400]  And I grew because of that oppression, right?
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.960]  And now I put my files online and these state courts would come in and say, what?
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.320]  I don't have the right to share that with Americans.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.760]  And we've already won the case.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.440]  And that's what the left doesn't get.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.200]  We're not into victimology.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.040]  We're not victims, as Tommy Robinson says.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.040]  We're targets.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.120]  And I don't think they understand metaphysically.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.120]  They think everybody's losers like them.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.120]  The more we get attacked, we get the more hardcore folks that actually support us.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.160]  That's right.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.240]  Every single setback in my career, I think like yours, has only been an opportunity for
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.360]  further expansion, for further participation.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.560]  Because you were a winner and didn't crawl in a hole.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.560]  Right.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.560]  And I'm not going to crawl in that hole.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.000]  A lot of folks crawl in a hole.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  Of course.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.640]  Look, when 20 states rained down on your head, Alex, I had, in Pennsylvania, I had 45 minutes
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.760]  to prepare for a TRO hearing with a federal judge.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.760]  Right?
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.760]  I mean, that's, they just, it's law fair.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.720]  They just want to hit you, hit you, hit you until you shut up.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720]  That's the point.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.160]  That's the one thing that you, then you can't do.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.360]  I'm about to say, say what you want about you.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.800]  You're a maverick and a trailblazer.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.640]  You have been beating the snot out of them, not even using a bunch of big lawyers, which
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.600]  which my lawyers are great, but I wish I could do it like you're doing.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.120]  I mean, you're, they are really got to hate you.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.880]  They really got to hate your ass right now.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.880]  Yeah.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.000]  They're upset because what, what do you do?
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.560]  I have this, let's say that here's the prop.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560]  I have this license, right?
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.560]  Just think the license from the state department.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.320]  The state government can't come into federal court and strip that from me.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.880]  So the battle's even worse than it was.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:45.880]  Yes, exactly.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.880]  It's your creation.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.880]  It's your thing.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:48.880]  And if people, exactly.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.600]  It's a, they have quite a hilt decline because they know it's killing America to ban a design.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.760]  Frankly, yeah, they would do anything to stop this culture, our American gun culture, even
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.240]  going into federal court and saying, your honor, any computer assisted speech of any
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.160]  kind has no first amendment value.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.880]  These are the literal things that they file in federal court.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.360]  Cause it's like the file tells me how to drill out their own system.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.880]  It's like they're saying it's, it's like trying to ban a book that tells you how to make dynamite.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.880]  Right.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.880]  Right.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.880]  Which Amazon has no problem doing.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.920]  Someone posted a book of my plans, right?
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:18.920]  Amazon takes it right off.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.120]  I mean, you, they're happy to do it all.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.000]  And then once it's dynamite, then it's conservatism, Christianity, family.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  And then that's what it is.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.760]  It's like, once they set that precedent easily, easily, and without justification, right?
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.120]  Oh, here's a, here's a book on the American gun culture.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.120]  Amazon from Amazon.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.120]  What's the justification?
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.120]  Well, you know, violets are.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.960]  And by the way, now that they've been banning you and me, it's suddenly, it's an avalanche.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.440]  It's everybody, which I think is going to backfire.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.920]  I mean, they're banning everybody and their mama right now.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:45.680]  At least we can see it so publicly.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.360]  I think that's what's so valuable about it.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.560]  Let your enemies show you who he is.
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.560]  No, no, I agree.
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:57.760]  And so Cody Wilson and, of course, a defense distributor website, DEFDIS.org, DEFDIS.org.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.680]  Why are they being so naked and brazen and crazy right now?
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.960]  Again, I think it's like we said about social media.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.320]  At some point, these Democrats, they feel like they have a certain lock on the, on cultural
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.160]  power and that if they just knock one or two people off, they've, they've got it.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.760]  But this contradicts their religion, which is that one day they'd finally end American
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.760]  gun culture.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.000]  They'd finally suspend it.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.920]  But of course, we're presenting that the exact answer.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:20.920]  It's bigger than ever.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.840]  We're, we're presenting that it's going to explode, right?
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.440]  It's going to expand the free exchange by deal.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.760]  So is this their battle of the bulls for those who don't know, like we take them to the beaches,
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.760]  we were about to go into Germany proper, they, the Nazis launched their counter offensive.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.240]  I mean, I think the Democrats and all this, this has a smell of Zeb Dietrich and battle
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.240]  the bulge.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.720]  There's some sincere desperation here.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.480]  They understand if they lose this one, that this is the second amendment online.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.480]  Those were the front line.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.480]  It's going to be a fight.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.480]  We better get ready.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480]  Hey man, and I don't take it lightly.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.840]  Like you said about lawyers, my lawyers aren't cheap and this, this ain't some kind of like
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.480]  student council, you know, after school thing that we're doing here.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.680]  This is, we consider very careful because these judges want you to lose, right?
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.680]  They're with the states.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.800]  You have to outlaw your them two to one to even have a chance.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.840]  And that's what we've had to do for many years.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:06.840]  Defcat.com, you can download, you can buy the files, or you can't download them, but
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.720]  you can buy the files and we can mail them to you and other things.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.400]  That supports our legal efforts.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:14.600]  That's how we're going to beat this.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.480]  Has anybody ever committed a crime with one of your printable guns?
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.480]  I'm sure if they had, someone would have brought it to my attention.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.600]  I was about to say, I mean criminals don't go print guns off.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.400]  It's, it's an extraordinarily difficult thing.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.400]  And frankly, you have to be.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.720]  No, they, they steal it out of your house with your own vacation.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.840]  They want criminals are smart.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.000]  They want a real gun that works.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.440]  They steal out of a police car.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.560]  They pick them up out of trash cans.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.160]  Printing guns is still a very difficult activity.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.360]  Now where do you get guns from a police buyback?
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  That's dude.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.720]  But I'm out of the police corruption, but I kind of get cops selling guns at the back
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.560]  door like old ladies bring like $20,000 shotguns and give them away and the cops like, we're
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560]  not destroying this.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.960]  I mean, how would you take and destroy it?
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.000]  We'll, we'll be right back.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  Stay with us.

[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:03.440]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.780]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:11.280]  children and Islamophobia.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:17.920]  And then voila, two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.320]  where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.

[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.160]  and point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:00.440]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.480]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with

[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.560]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:19.000]  It's got the preglonone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.400]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids so you can upload it.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:28.120]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine four
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.680]  to five toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle that's a spray you do, you can also
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.680]  swallow it.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:40.800]  It's a supplement with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more without you.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.800]  We couldn't do it.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:47.200]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.640]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.640]  the word.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:59.120]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:26.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:33.040]  We're going to take your phone calls today on what do you think Trump should do to stop
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:39.120]  internet censorship, what's the right move, 69 and a half days out, we're going to give
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.600]  the number out here in just a few minutes and we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.560]  But let me get this out here because I'm on air and I'm so busy I barely been plugging
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.760]  you that if I don't plug we won't be here.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:57.320]  We have 95% curcumin and curcuminoid, the leading competitors in turmeric products have 3% on
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320]  average.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  It's a total joke.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.960]  It's a total fraud.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:06.720]  We have 95% curcuminoids, but it's very hard then at California standards to be able to
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.480]  bring you this.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.080]  So we're even looking at a new manufacturer, even the manufacturer we have from the top
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.120]  or gang manufacturers in the country, they just can't get enough of it.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.080]  So we have a couple thousand bottles left of this and it may be until October or maybe
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.080]  even November or December until we get more, but despite that I want you to see how great
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:28.000]  it is for joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammatory support,
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.320]  immune support, turmeric root extract, 95% curcuminoids, baswala, satara extract, organic
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:41.680]  experiment, sage, lemon balm, and thyme leaves, and pepperine from black pepper and so much
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.680]  more.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.960]  So go to infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, look at the hundreds and hundreds of reviews,
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:49.120]  five-star reviews, 98% ratings.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.520]  This is the strongest we could come out with and other folks sell it for really expensive
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:56.680]  and then rip you off with seven, eight, nine, especially in turmeric.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:02.480]  Sometimes they have some companies mark it up 15 times because if you put 3% curcumin
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.880]  in there and everything else, the bottle costs more than what's in it.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:06.880]  Not with us.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.880]  You're getting, the bottle is just full of two months supply, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:17.080]  We also have the ultimate bone broth formula that has the turmeric and the chaga mushroom
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.520]  and the bee pollen and the alfalfa powder and so much more.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.520]  That's $19.95.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.200]  That's very close to cost, but I did a quadruple order on this because it's been sold out for
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]  five months.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:28.280]  Mix it in with your whey, mix it in with your smoothies.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.800]  It is incredible.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:36.480]  The collagen, the bone, all of it that is in it, it's amazing.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:41.040]  So find out about that at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, but whatever you do support

[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.760]  of $50 or more, so be sure and take advantage of that as well.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.600]  Okay, getting back to Cody Wilson, I want to take Trump to the woodshed.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.480]  I know he wants to sound judicious.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:15.320]  His tactic, and I've talked to folks close to the president, very close to him, and I've
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:19.280]  talked to people like Ted Nugent on tape, and he said, don't worry, Trump will say
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:25.200]  what they want to hear to neutralize the opposition, and then he moves forward.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:28.560]  But you know, he is, bump stocks, he doesn't think do anything, they're pretty much worthless,
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.040]  so he says, go ahead and ban those.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.440]  I don't like that philosophy, but I get what he's saying from a political perspective.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:37.600]  That's the same thing he came out, we've got a tweet here we can put on screen.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.480]  I'm looking at 3D plastic guns being sold to the public, already spoke to the NRA, doesn't
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:45.080]  seem like to make much sense.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.800]  Now maybe he's saying you compete with the gun industry, and maybe they don't like it,
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.880]  so answer the question of what you think of the president, and then you're inside baseball,
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.600]  you're the top expert on this, is the gun lobby against you, or what is Trump thinking?
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:03.360]  I don't think there's a lot of daylight between me and the gun lobby on this issue, really.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:07.880]  What's the issue here in this litigation is a set of rules about transfer of authority
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.640]  from the State Department to the Commerce Department, it's all very dry, administrative
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:11.640]  law stuff.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:12.640]  Federal.
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:17.120]  But ultimately it affects actual exports of weapons and stuff, and their related technical
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.120]  data.
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:23.320]  So look, it's just a side effect of this transmission of authority that my company and other people
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.320]  like us.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:28.160]  But I could transfer and sell the plans for a Remington 700, and it would take a machinist
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:31.720]  to do it, and a metalsmith, but they wouldn't try to block that.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:32.720]  They want to.
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.720]  They actually want to.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:34.720]  That's what some of this is about.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.960]  But actually what's controversy in the court is not whether that we can sell it, it's
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.440]  whether you can just put it on the Internet.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:43.200]  And of course you and I both know that these plans are all over the Internet, they've always
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.200]  been.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:45.200]  But you know, we want...
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.600]  So they want to penalize people that hold the files.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.880]  They'd like to, but they'd also like to...
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.320]  So this is book burning.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:53.440]  They want to penalize you from putting it into the Internet, right?
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.080]  This definition of this as an export, though the State Department has given up this power.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.760]  Don't they get it if they ignored you and it got nowhere, that it makes it sexier that
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:00.760]  they're on this jihad?
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:05.640]  Look, I get it, I don't know when they'll get it, but this will continue, obviously.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:10.760]  More people will download my, or will buy my plans at DEFCAD.com because of news like
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:14.920]  today, because they know that people don't want them to have it, that's the primary driver
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.920]  of the interest.
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:19.800]  You're never going to make an AR-15 from scratch, you're never going to do that.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:23.680]  But you might want the blueprints because you know the Attorney General of Pennsylvania
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.400]  doesn't want you to be able to do it.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.160]  They're never going to stop the flow of information.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.000]  This is really the canary in the coal mine for the singularity.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.680]  Talk about that, I mean, explain from your view the singularity and what this means.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.320]  I mean, you're never going to stop any of this.
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:38.320]  I did.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.320]  It's interesting to use that.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:44.240]  Yeah, I named this operation Integral Accident, and in theory that means if information can
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.040]  be shared in any way, in this age, it can be shared in every way.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:50.200]  So there is no limitation.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:54.560]  There's only the explosive, immediate speed of information from any corner.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:57.840]  So of course, if I'm able to sell it to you, if I'm able to email it to you and send you
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:58.840]  a link to it.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:01.360]  This is virtually as good as you being able to download.
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:05.520]  So don't they get by the Streisand effect trying to suppress that it takes something
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:10.040]  from a signature explosion and then duplicates it to a whole other level?
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.080]  When these states came into court to stop my website a month ago, I just had meager
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.560]  downloads in the hundreds, and they pushed it, right?
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.480]  They drove all that traffic there.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:22.080]  Everyone knew they came to court to shut it down, and it went to the hundreds of thousands,
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.080]  right?
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:24.240]  It went to the tens and tens of thousands.
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:28.200]  Other websites popped up who say, I don't know if you can trust this, who say millions
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.200]  of downloads.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:30.200]  Well, let me explain this.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:32.480]  Let me bring it myself.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.720]  As above so below, yes, the power of the digital spreads the key, but it also gets the technocrats
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.000]  the power to kill it.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.160]  We have now, it's like 2 million downloads on Apple, a million downloads on Droid.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:44.920]  We can look at the, for our new thing, it came out like a month ago right before we
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:45.920]  got banned.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:46.920]  We have a new app come out.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.400]  We're number one on both news apps, top 20 apps worldwide.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.200]  They just delisted us, Cody, where you've got a hand search that you can find it.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.440]  So it's like I won the ND500, but they said it exists.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:02.000]  So the power of digital is two fold, I guess when you're on their platform, because we're
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.680]  number one and five stars, but you don't see it.
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.520]  I'd use that in reverse.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.720]  The power that this judge had to tell me not to share files online is the power to authorize
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:14.880]  me to sell them.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:17.360]  So look, everything contains its own antithesis.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  The catastrophe conceals the opposite catastrophe.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:21.880]  Every action has Newtonian physics.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:22.880]  Yeah, it's just how it is.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.360]  And when we live in an internet age and you don't, you don't get to vote on that.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:33.960]  So let's go back to the zenith or the genesis, the progeneration of when you first had this
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:37.640]  idea of what you want to UT or whatever six, seven years ago or how long ago.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.640]  Yeah, it was a long time ago.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.640]  Yeah.
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.640]  Six years ago, maybe.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.640]  Yeah.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.640]  All right.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.640]  So tell us about that.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:44.640]  Well, look, I was at UT and I had this idea.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.360]  I decided that it was really Assange.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.360]  It was WikiLeaks.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.960]  You know, I didn't have a word for it, but it seemed like what Assange was doing in Cablegate
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.440]  was more important than Romney and Obama and all the stuff I was watching on TV.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  That wasn't politics.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.440]  That was non-politics.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:00.480]  This was like the horse and buggy being replaced with a Model T.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:05.760]  What Assange was doing was real, present, immediate activism, which affected the life
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.760]  of nations, you know, and it's affected real politics.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.480]  And I thought, my God, you know, it's the internet.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:14.200]  What could you do with WikiLeaks that could affect other aspects of the political?
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:17.440]  And I thought, what is WikiLeaks for guns?
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  And that was it.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.600]  I've been on that road for six years.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.040]  And to show you were able to have one of the first 3D printable guns, popularize it,
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.200]  all from just in your dorm thinking about this.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:28.200]  That's right.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200]  It cost me nothing to build that gun.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.880]  It cost me 18 grand in a few months.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.200]  Oh, it was like an M4 rather AR-15.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.200]  I did build parts.
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:37.200]  You're right.
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.720]  I would come in here and be like, look, Alex, I built the AR-15 part.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:42.480]  So, it was the first 3D chambering.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.400]  We built parts, but then eventually in 13 we got to, we built an entire gun.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.720]  Every single component was printed on a 3D printer, and that was what really expanded
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:50.720]  people's minds.
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.720]  They were like, oh, no.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:54.640]  And that's like going from handwritten Bibles to printing press.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.200]  We don't think of it as a big deal, but it's like Gutenberg.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:01.040]  Conceptually, it was like, whoa, it was the whole concept, the whole proof of concept.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.160]  And they challenged that for years.
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.600]  Just the idea that you could do it, the idea that you could share it and tell the people
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.600]  how to do it.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:08.600]  And there it is.
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:09.600]  That's the gun.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.600]  I remember this right outside Austin.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.240]  That was the first gun, well, credited as being completely printed on a 3D printer.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.920]  Now, I don't regard that as an especially important gun.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:20.320]  It doesn't work well, but it was its information that was it.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:21.320]  The concept.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.320]  Mm-hmm.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.320]  And it was a demonstration that was.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:28.560]  But the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, it wasn't an F-18 or it wasn't a stealth bomber.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.720]  I'll let you say it.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.720]  But I do.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.880]  No, but I mean, it's still the first one's what counts.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.680]  We think of that at the Smithsonian as is more important than, you know, an SR-71 Blackbird.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.680]  It's been called.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:41.920]  Because only 50, 60 years later, we got an SR-71 Blackbird.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:43.720]  It shows human trajectory.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.840]  I think this is what's being challenged in court as well.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.840]  The state's saying.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  It's human trajectory.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:48.840]  They say future developments.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:49.840]  We have to stop future developments.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:50.840]  Sorry.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.600]  You don't have a cause of action to stop future developments.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.600]  You don't get to come into federal court on that question.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.600]  Jesus Christ.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:56.600]  Excuse me.
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.040]  I've we have a lot of Christian stations.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.040]  I am a Christian.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.320]  I have verbal control and I was I was I respectfully say I'm not taking Lord's name in vain.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:08.520]  I'm saying, wow, the God is amazing that we're made in God's image as creators.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:14.360]  And whatever we can imagine, there were physicists 150 years ago with equations for atomic weapons.
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:18.760]  And 67 years later, they have, I mean, just think of the power of the human mind.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:19.760]  It's amazing.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:22.520]  And we've been through this controversy legally in the Cold War.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:23.520]  You know, there was.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.520]  Yeah.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:25.520]  What about the guys that drew up plans for atomic bombs?
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:27.520]  I mean, you're like, you know, you have a court stop them because their brain came
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  up with it.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:31.240]  The Supreme Court has said, no, of course, there's a First Amendment interest in publishing
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.680]  secrets for the H bomb.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.520]  Is a plastic gun as dangerous as an H bomb?
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:40.920]  Can we handle the Promethean fire of the gods?
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.920]  Cody Wilson, final segment straight ahead.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:50.520]  Then your phone calls spread the links.

[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:22.240]  Thank you.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:29.520]  What would you call this point in history? We are whoa, that's a big question. I don't know. Is this the i-generation that I mean
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.320]  I don't God how to oh
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:36.280]  We're on a bridge and the other side is a bridge. We can see the post liberal world order. We can see it now
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:41.320]  I don't know what it looks like, but we can see it and that's got everybody upset because all politics has been and they're trying to
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:46.720]  Hold us back and they can't do it. Mm-hmm. Everything's been about maintaining the the post war liberal world order, right?
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:51.920]  And this is why I think you're so great about it because you've you've got what you've conditioned people for this mental template
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.480]  That there is an info war. Absolutely. What's happening to me in court? It's a war over the information related to guns
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.680]  It is a literal info war in Virilio's terms. I'm happy to be here, man
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:04.480]  They are preventing the new politics of the future from me from happening
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.840]  You know what they want it's stillborn
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.080]  They would if they could take any power because the real future will be the real college of ideas and a real
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:16.600]  Individualist collectivism where individuals take action, but everyone then votes really on what's real and the best and we just go
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:20.480]  There's a I mean it's like can you say it like limitless
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.960]  Asymptotic accelerations of of science techno science economic powers. I'm begging for me
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.960]  If you're gonna do this they have a little goblins come out
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.160]  It would be my honor
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.200]  Thank you
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.640]  If I could I just pray someone makes something out of that and send it to me, please
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:52.480]  I love it. That's my favorite thing in life is I'm making memes out of it
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.600]  They used to pay to have anti the mean memes against me
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.080]  Yeah, and they didn't get I liked it then they finally figured out and stop funding them Alex
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.080]  There was a special mission that I know of an Austin to
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.120]  Convince you that Bitcoin was a good thing. It was a special they were gonna meme you into believing in Bitcoin
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.560]  Did it did it work? Did it take I mean I take cryptocurrencies are great. Is that right? Yeah
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:17.120]  Do you do can you buy things in your store and cryptocurrency? We I think so. Yeah, but if you can't use BTC pay server
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:21.480]  It's great open-source software. I would love to see him for his accept Bitcoin
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:29.680]  That's good stuff, man
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:31.680]  What can I tell you though? What else can I tell you?
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.360]  About what you wanted me to ask you to say something about Trump. Tell me your favorite color. Yeah
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.160]  Black man
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:40.160]  That color. Yeah. Yeah
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.040]  It's all colors. What's your second favorite color blue. I'm wearing a lot of blue. Blue's nice. Yeah
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:49.080]  You're a fan of that. Do we not have a stream on Facebook? Is that is that we they just pulled us down?
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:54.920]  I think as you were on you. Yeah, damn, you know what happened me on YouTube yesterday. Oh, it's they're doing to everybody
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:00.080]  It's yeah, it's like a fight that they're making it's all subjective like I went to college. I'm an sj
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.720]  Don't want you charge for our son's me. I saw something. I guess that green one. I have powers
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.720]  50,000 people are watching no
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:16.800]  Let me you are related. You are a Nazi. I'm funded by sorrows are well-known to you by I said you are
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.240]  That's fantastic
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:23.680]  If there's a if there's one thing you're allowed to say on in the internet
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:29.000]  It's what food you like what music you like. What else that's about it. I think what's your favorite music. Yeah
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.280]  I think that's the that's the accessible. That's that's the range of public discourse now
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:35.960]  And even then you got to be careful not to like some type of music. That's cultural appropriation, of course
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:42.760]  Well, here's the deal you're stepping into a wider world of crud and adventure Cody Wilson and other fellow Austinite
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.480]  And we salute you were the best websites for people to find your evil information

[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.800]  So well look at I mean it it is made to be isn't it? There's a it's evil
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.720]  There's a real screen against it
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.400]  But we maintain the highest professional standards of defense distributed
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.280]  We are a defense industrial technical company equal opportunity employer and you work very hard
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:29.000]  We work in Austin, Texas for the advancement of all for the common man
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.280]  Well, we should come by your factory and do a report on the Wilson. I'd love that good to have you here with us
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.440]  We're gonna come back in the number out get into. Oh, have you heard the latest on South Africa?
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.980]  I don't think you've heard this yet. It's on news wars.com. It's quite
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.880]  The little jewel effect. I had that an hour ago and ever covered it somebody reprint it. Help me. I'm weak
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:49.720]  We'll be right back stay with us. Thanks Cody. Good to have you here
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:57.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Lelani estates
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:02.960]  But a lot of us on the big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:10.360]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:15.640]  To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkali
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:22.520]  Diddy and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:30.040]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:38.640]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:46.280]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:51.640]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:06:05.320]  From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:15.120]  The Cape of Good Hope
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:21.920]  The first white settlement on the African continent was settled by Dutch farmers in the 17th century
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.240]  The lineage of these Dutch farmers are known today as the bore or as
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:30.120]  africaners and
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:36.080]  For many years they have established themselves as much as any of the many tribes living in the Cape today
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:43.680]  When the Dutch arrived at the Cape in 1652 the land was too arid for crops
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:50.000]  And was only inhabited by a small few pastoral nomads known as the koi koi
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:56.520]  The Dutch settlers proved themselves to be masters in the art of dry land farming and
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:01.400]  Dedicated their lives to fostering the region into abundant farmland
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:11.240]  Over the years South Africa grew in abundance and dozens of African tribes migrated to join the growing settlement in the Cape of Good Hope
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:18.440]  Aside from being the only white people the bore blended in with everyone else and for generations
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.160]  They lived in relative harmony
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:27.440]  They had their issues, but conquest of land was respected and honored by local tribes
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:32.680]  It was Britain who most rigorously challenged the bore's existence there
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:40.080]  Once the French invaded the Netherlands England sought control of the Cape in South Africa
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:46.920]  The Bores were devout Christians who found deep purpose in the stewardship of their farmland
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:51.440]  And they had serious disdain for British rule
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:56.200]  Britain began imposing taxation upon the colony
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:03.240]  They sent missionaries in to stoke the flames of discord between the africaners and other local tribes
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:09.120]  And in 1795 the British invaded the Cape of Good Hope
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:13.320]  This led to what is known as the bore wars
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:18.560]  The bore's resistance against the British was greater than most
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:21.320]  But after killing 30,000
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:25.920]  Africaner women and children in the first ever concentration camps
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:29.880]  The British had finally broken the bore's spirit to resist
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:35.920]  South Africa officially became part of the British Empire in 1910
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:44.320]  And almost immediately following this the British government began imposing some of the most racially divisive laws in history
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:50.320]  By 1948 these divisive laws gave birth to apartheid
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:56.320]  Which was defined by an authoritarian political culture based on Bosco
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.960]  white supremacy
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:05.720]  Apartheid created so much racial division between the africaners and the african tribes
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:13.720]  That by the 1990s violent communist party the ANC had easily risen to power
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:19.720]  The ANC took orders from communist Russia and they trained in the art of revolution
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.720]  They proudly sing songs about killing all the white farmers
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:29.720]  And create laws that legalized the theft of private property
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:34.720]  Racism is not the problem in South Africa
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:40.720]  Before the racially divisive laws implemented by British rule there was relative harmony
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:48.720]  What this is is yet another communist takeover of a once great sovereign nation
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:54.720]  What we are witnessing now is perhaps the classic communist move
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:57.720]  Kill the farmers, starve the nation
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:03.720]  Mass murder of the population so that the communist control freaks can carve up the remains
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:10.720]  And take whatever is left for themselves before the whole thing slides into the abyss
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:16.720]  The mainstream media desperate to keep their audience from awakening to the truth
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:20.720]  Remains mostly silent about the South African crisis
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:24.720]  Aside from spinning it as a so called right wing conspiracy
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:33.720]  But to the many who are waking up today this only reveals their devout capitulation to the thieves and tyrants who own them
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:56.720]  This is Greg Ries reporting for infowars.com
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:05.720]  And we are back live. Powerful peace by Mr. Ries. That's really the communist secret program for the world
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:13.720]  Go into a place that almost no one lived in 400 years ago that white settlers came to build farms in the middle of the wasteland
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:20.720]  Africans move in from all over Africa. African populations explode. You go back to the history books people got along very well
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:27.720]  The African tribes still fight with each other but the Christians kind of navigated that and Christianized a bunch of groups
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.720]  And then the British come in, they take over not against the British people but the British Empire
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:37.720]  Because the gold and silver and diamonds that were there are more than anywhere else in the world
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:46.720]  And they take over and then they create the racial laws that blacks don't have rights to create the division for control
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:57.720]  And then all these years later you've got the brainwashed communists blacks and whites and others hating the white Africaners
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.720]  And here's the next big piece of news. Bombshell, it's on newswars.com
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:11.720]  Bombshell, South Africa forcing farmers to repay bank loans on seized lands
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:20.720]  Did you hear me right? They're taking not just old farms but farms that people bought, the scrub brush
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:27.720]  And they're saying we're going to take your land. This is another South African news
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:37.720]  But then if you owe millions of dollars or millions of South African currency for it you still got to pay it back
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:42.720]  No one's ever done that. Even the Soviets and the Nazis they took your land
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:48.720]  They would just ignore bank loans or whatever. So this is next level but the Commies always work with the banks
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:57.720]  Bombshell, South Africa forcing farmers to repay bank loans on seized lands and white farmers will still be expected to repay loans on land
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.720]  Even if it is seized by the South African government according to statements made by Ned Bank
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.720]  We'll pull this up on newswars.com so I can show folks a screenshot please
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:19.720]  A screenshot of an email ostensibly sent by a Ned Bank client services resolution manager asserts that borrowers with mortgages on expropriated property
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.720]  Again the South African say we're not going to steal it, we're going to expropriate it
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.720]  We're not going to kill you, we're going to make you dead. I'm sorry
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:42.720]  A screenshot of an email ostensibly sent by Ned Bank on the biggest banks in South Africa client services resolution manager asserts that borrowers with mortgages on expropriated property will be obligated to continue bond payments
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  Whether they are compensated by the government or not
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:56.720]  Dear customer, thank you for your query, your question. You have raised with regard to the impact of land expropriation to your bonded property
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:07.720]  Ned Bank is not privy to what provisions may or may not be for land purchasers whose land is encumbered and what the proposed review committee would come up with to address this
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:16.720]  However, we believe a balance needs to be achieved between the parliamentary agenda and the particular law of contracting. You're sure the banks are involved in all this of course
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:26.720]  It is important to note that home loan agreement is subject to a contractual agreement and bond payments remedy due to payable until such a time that the bond is paid in full
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:30.720]  Irrespective of any form of land appropriation
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:34.720]  Of course that's an act of God, the government taking it so you're null and void
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:37.720]  This is just fraud my view with a with or without compensation
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:40.720]  So you're gonna pay with with or without compensation
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:48.720]  We would encourage you to continue with bond payments until such a time as determination is made the time of which is also unknown to us
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:52.720]  We trust that our response meets with your expectation
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:57.720]  It's like telling Jews being sent to a death camp
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:02.720]  We're gonna pull your teeth out for the gold and take everything you got. We already took your house five years ago
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:04.720]  And if you got any bank loans
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.720]  We're gonna still say you owe those even in death
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:19.720]  So death and taxes how about how about that ladies and gentlemen and then it just gets worse from there

[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:59.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:19.720]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:44.720]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:21:08.720]  We should get Shooter Jennings back on. He hadn't been on in years. He defended me real nice. I'm Joe Rogan
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:17.720]  By the way, at the end of the shower, I got a statement to make on Joe Rogan. I talked to him at length
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:40.720]  Saturday morning, so he gave me a call and you guys got to remind me or I won't remember to do it. It's important because he reaches hundreds of millions of people a month and he's been a big controversy or a bunch of stuff. I think Joe's a great guy. So I got a statement to make at the end of the shower on that if the crew reminds me. You guys remind me to do that?
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:48.720]  Because you know me out of sight out of mind. You guys give me a Roger on that. I could just remind me.
[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:58.720]  We got Larry, we got John, we got Joe, we got Jeremiah, we got Mike. Here's what happens. I started out on talk radio 23 years ago.
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:12.720]  And I would just, the calls came in and I didn't even have a call screener. I'd say call in and when I go to break, I had one guy run on the board, but he went to call screener.
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:27.720]  I'd say where are you calling from? And just I'm going to go to you right when you come back. So I'd go to the calls and I love calls. Then I started doing a show out of my house with GCN with the satellites and it was always like remote. They were up in Minnesota. I was in Texas.
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:42.720]  And we'd take the phone calls and someone's they sit there for 30, 40 minutes. He had a bunch of phone lines and it was always different. I'd have to announce the caller and have the person there put them on air and it becomes a little annoying.
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:47.720]  So I kind of went crazy yesterday and I apologize. I got a lot of my mind and I'm trying not to be a jerk.
[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:56.720]  Callers wouldn't be there or callers wouldn't be ready or callers phones are bad or the radios are on and you do five or six those in a row. I go crazy.
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:06.720]  But John Harmon, I've worked with for 15 years now has come down to M4s in Texas for Minnesota. We've got a great crew out there and he does affiliate relations.
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:16.720]  But for the next week or so, he's going to sit in when we take calls an hour a day. And so we get you ready and I get to you and you're not holding more than 20, 30 minutes and you're off.
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:21.720]  And then if you're already holding, we just shut the phones down and open them up again. That way nobody ever holds more than 30 minutes.
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:35.720]  And the spirit of that we're going to go to Aaron, Mike, Joe, John, Larry and others right now on the incredible stuff happening in this country. Trump fighting back against the censorship. Praise God. What does he need to do next?
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:42.720]  70 days out from this election. All the amazing things unfolding. What a time to be alive. I mean, they are censoring everybody and their dog.
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:54.720]  I mean, and they're admitting they're doing it. It's so illegal. It's so organized with big tech together and they've taken 70 days out. Republicans doing nothing as a green light to go crazy.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:24:06.720]  I've made this my big issue. They shadow banned me and then fully banned me first person in world history on a geopolitical level. It's happened to because they feared it three and a half weeks ago because they feared you.
[02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:17.720]  And I think it's backfired on them, but it's still up to all of you how concerned you are about this and the stories that are on info wars.com. But I'm betting on you. I believe in you and I love you.
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:28.720]  And I thank you. So let's go to a caller in Canada. Let's go to Mike in Canada, Michael on the air. Thanks for calling. Hello. Yes, sir. Welcome. Oh, I'm in New Hampshire.
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:39.720]  It doesn't matter. You're on air. So see how you doing? It's happening now. At least the state was wrong, but it's okay. You got my name. That's all that matters right now.
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:58.720]  I was calling about the censorship as well. I mean, I'm on, I mean, like a Facebook group to like, because like, if I post something on my Facebook, you know, I don't really want people to see it at all. But I mean, I'm part of a group and I do it there. And that group literally got like quieted down.
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:12.720]  I didn't see anything from the group at all. And then I guess it got shadow band. So they made a new one. But I mean, we're doing it on that one now. But speaking of like that, I have a few friends that are like Democrats and all I mean, on Facebook and that's fine.
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:24.720]  You don't bother me. But this stuff is always at the top of my feed and this stuff is everywhere. Boom, boom, boom, boom, all day long. Democrats this now this thing on Snapchat or.
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:34.720]  Well, totally. I mean, if you look at Ann Colder's feed, my feed, Trump's feed, hundreds of pages of their garbage were nowhere. And like you said, the last few months, suddenly you had all these friends you were talking.
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:43.720]  Americans aren't allowed to talk. You sit down and shut up prisoners. Suddenly, nobody can talk to each other because you're all shadow man. But does that make you vote Democrat? No, I think it makes you get pissed.
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:53.720]  Yeah, I mean, my, to be honest with you, my parents are kind of Democratic and look at me. I'm listening to Alex Jones, you know, I'm tired of it. So I mean, I mean.
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:00.720]  Hey, your parents, does your son deserve to not be able to talk to other friends on Facebook? Is that American parent and they should really vote for Trump?
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:08.720]  No, I mean, like my dad, he voted for Trump. But I mean, like, you know, like just the things he says, I'm like, dude, you're a Democrat sometimes.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.720]  Well, is your dad proud now that the 4.6 growth rate and I mean, it paid off.
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:17.720]  He is. He is proud. He is proud of that.
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.720]  So what about your mother? Is she going to side with you and your free speech or side with the censors?
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:27.720]  Is he going to side with trillion dollar companies trying to rob you of your birthright or is she going to side with you?
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:35.720]  I'm putting her in my truck and I'm taking her there and she's voting. So she ain't going to vote Democrat this time, but it's all right.
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:41.720]  But anyways, I mean, like Facebook thing, I just couldn't believe it. Like every single one of my Democrat friends.
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:49.720]  I mean, I don't got problems with them, but it just drives me crazy all day long, you know, and then a few friends of mine that are concerned to share something.
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:52.720]  It's like one to every 25, you know.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:27:05.720]  Brother, I see it on my own iPhone that, you know, and iPhones are glitching out and I know this weird spam and crazy stuff flying up and CNN's always popping up at MSNBC without me asking and just it's in the feed.
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:11.720]  I turn it on. It's like, it's just like, wow, you know, it's crazy, isn't it?
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:19.720]  Yeah, I think sorry to interrupt. I have an idea. I think maybe I know it's going to be a big idea, but maybe because when I voted for Trump years ago.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:27.720]  I'm in New Hampshire and I voted for Kelly Ayotte because she was the Republican and I got home and she goes, I wrote for Mike Pence and the presidency.
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.720]  I'm like, you got to be kidding me. So I was wondering if, and she ended up losing because she didn't vote for him.
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:40.720]  But anyway, I was wondering if you guys can maybe make a list of like who the Patriot is in every state, you know.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:48.720]  No, I hear you. You know, folks who've done that, just look at whoever Trump endorses. Not all of them are perfect, but I trust the president. He's smart. I'm going to say it. He's smarter than I am at 72.
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:57.720]  He's got more stamina and when he endorses us, who I'm backing, he isn't perfect, but we've just got a backing because he's in the center of things. God bless you.
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:01.720]  We're going to go to break. Thank you, Mike. And they did say to Hampshire. I don't know why the hell I said Canada.
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:08.720]  See, even when they do a perfect job, I screw up. So I just got to stop caring so much. The truth is I care so much, folks.
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:13.720]  I mean, we advise the president. We've got all the documents. We've got the proof. Other people are scared to tell him what's going on.
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.720]  And they're coming down on me because they know it. And I've kind of not said it the last year.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:25.720]  I hope they'd, you know, figure. I wasn't, you know, actually as influential as I am, but they had got everything tapped, you know.
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.720]  So they're coming down on me because Trump's the real deal, folks.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:34.720]  We come back. Larry, John, Joe, Aaron, Chuck, Rodney, bam, bam, bam. You're called straight ahead.

[02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:02.720]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:10.720]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:13.720]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:21.720]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:32:21.720 --> 02:32:31.720]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:32:32.720 --> 02:32:42.720]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.

[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:23.720]  Give me liberty, or give me death, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:32.720]  This was the anthem of the 2016 election here at InfoWars.
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:41.720]  He's bounding down, loaded up in truckins.
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:52.720]  I gotta tell you, Smokey's got his ears on.
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:34:01.720]  He's out on your trail, and he ain't gonna rescue you in jail, so you gotta dodge him, you gotta duck him, you gotta keep that diesel truckin.
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:10.720]  Just knock that down a hand and give him hell.
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:14.720]  You gotta listen to that when I drive out of the office today. Some good stuff right there.
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:22.720]  Charlie Reed. Oh, that's good. I wanna go to Corey and Gracie and everybody here in just a moment.
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:30.720]  Here's the deal. I don't wanna wish Yellow the Dead, even at all, Hitler, even though he was a really bad guy, or John McCain. It's just bad luck.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:46.720]  But the worship festival, John McCain eating five, Isis al-Qaeda backer, open borders, anti-gun, favor the Democrats, Trump's main enemy calling him a traitor, and just Lindsey Graham worshiping him for like the last hour on Fox News.
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:53.720]  Do we punch that up for TV viewers? I mean, they're trying to kill the First Amendment and steal, I guess he just finished.
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:35:06.720]  And steal the election right now. I mean, they're trying to do everything they can, and all I'm hearing about is John McCain.
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:17.720]  What about the First Amendment? Could we have five days in laying in state for that? Maybe flags that have staff? I'll tell you what, let's give McCain five years that have staff.
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:27.720]  In fact, let's take flags down forever, because he's like God. Stole $500 billion, you know. You name it, he's a great guy, anti-American guy.
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:33.720]  I agree. He's the best person since, you know, I mean, he's, I guess, according to them, better than Jesus.
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:43.720]  Can we just have a week at half staff for the First Amendment? No, I'm sorry, it doesn't matter. Everything our veterans and our ancestors fought for all being flushed out of the toilet. No.
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:53.720]  I think we should burn the Bill of Rights and Constitution in offering to John McCain and his father and his father corrupt admirals.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:02.720]  Because throwing the election to Obama and saying Obama isn't connected to radical Islam and all that lies, well, that's a good thing.
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:13.720]  Because everybody said so. So I want to apologize for America even existing.
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:22.720]  Now, like the old Vikings did when their wife and kids died, they'd kill them and burn them up on a boat with them.
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:30.720]  I'm not saying do this, but maybe I'm being hateful to McCain if all of America isn't blown up with nuclear weapons because of his death.
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:39.720]  Just nuke the entire, blow the planet up, because this old corrupt, lying, globalist piece of trash is God.
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:53.720]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborators, said so. I mean, should we, I'm asking the question, should the Earth be, should they use the fission fusion anti-matter weapons?
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:37:02.720]  The Air Force admitted 12 years ago they have to forget the planet, blow up the solar system. Hell, forget the solar system, the galaxy.
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:13.720]  How about the universe? And like a royal Viking pirate, destroy creation because of McCain.
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:23.720]  Walking around, I was going, he was powerful everywhere. I mean, just what a corrupt joke and all these fawning, sick of man's worshiping him.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:32.720]  I mean, please God, I tried to be nice about it, but Lord, and then Trump says he's a great guy and his family's great and all this stuff and they attacking for it.
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:37.720]  It's like, good Lord, this guy is a globalist, a new world order.
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:46.720]  We're going to go to Colorado, California. We're going to go to Corey right now. Corey, thank you for calling today. You're on the air.
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:55.720]  Sir, it is an honor to be riding co-pilot with you right now in the spear against the spearhead against globalism and tyranny.
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.720]  It's good to have you. Do you agree with me that maybe the Pentagon should blow the planet up in honor of McCain?
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:06.720]  I believe they should. I believe they should. Let's just go full nihilist and just take it all out.
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:13.720]  He's so good. He's so close to Satan's heart. I mean, he's such a good person. The news said so.
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:20.720]  You know, I'm sorry.
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:27.720]  I have friends who were actually casualties of his war that I fought next to in Iraq.
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:35.720]  And the lies that he said, that he sold us to get us into Iraq, it's really hard to look over.
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:42.720]  And you know, I watch the CIA propaganda machines spewing out the, let's deify John McCain.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:47.720]  It works. Even on a woke individual like me, I almost had a tear stream and I'm like, oh, he died.
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.720]  And then I'm like, I wake up and I'm like, no, screw this. This isn't going to happen.
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:55.720]  Well, you know, McCain blew up the Death Star.
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:58.720]  Oh, how did he do that?
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:05.720]  He just defeated Darth Vader, but look, he helped found out the modern ISIS. He's on record doing it.
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:12.720]  I mean, the guy was a monster with a voting record like the Democrats, but oh, McCain, McCain.
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:18.720]  Why are there so much McCain worshipping? Oh, oh, I love him. He's so cool.
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:24.720]  I know why there's the worship and it's because of that wonderful executive order that you had brought to light the other day.
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:29.720]  That limelighting that you should limelight it more, that one that Obama had signed.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:33.720]  Yeah, the executive order countering propaganda. Exactly. And he helped get it through.
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:39.720]  So it's just all of that. It's like naming the end of the First Amendment, the John McCain Superhighway. Exactly.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:46.720]  It's like on the first amendment's tombstone, you say John McCain countering disinformation and propaganda. Yeah.
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:50.720]  Yes. In cahoots with the Clintons and the Obamas.
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:54.720]  But the way Trump can beat this is to resend the executive order.
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:02.720]  You said it yourself the other day, sir, and you have to limelight that and beat it into their skulls politically and spiritually.
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:08.720]  We have to take back that executive order, cut the head off the snake and watch it die in front of us.
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:14.720]  I agree. And as you call it limelight, you know, the great technology calls it spotlighting cockroaches.
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:19.720]  And that's what we're doing. And look, I hope McCain's in heaven. I hope he had a better day.
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:24.720]  He was horribly corrupt. He said it'll be on my tombstone, the Keating Five. No, it's not.
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:29.720]  It's the whole devil media worshiping you because you tried to derail Trump. God bless you, Corey.
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:37.720]  And, you know, Trump took the high road and got pissed in his face basically.
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:44.720]  Where are you going to Canada now? We're going to talk to Gracie. Gracie in Canada, thank you for holding her on the air.
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:46.720]  What's on your mind today?
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:52.720]  A conservative vegan, if that's even possible. And we listen to every day here.
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:56.720]  I'm a vegan as well. Every time I finish a giant steak.
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:59.720]  Now, it probably gets healthier with all the stuff for the meat today, but go ahead.
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:02.720]  Don't judge. I know that meat has healing qualities, too.
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.720]  So I'm one of those people who's very, very nice. Go ahead.
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:06.720]  So go ahead.
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:13.720]  Now, there was a fully rocked Athena who was vegan online, who promoted your secret 12, your V12.
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:15.720]  That is vegan.
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:19.720]  And she was completely censored and delisted for promoting your V12 online.
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:23.720]  So I wanted to bring that up. She's quite possibly a fan, fully rocked Athena out of Houston.
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:33.720]  The third thing I wanted to mention was that one way to deter the upcoming false flag on Trump supporters and Trump supporting media
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:40.720]  is to have a countdown. The moment that one opens your website, gets onto your page, the countdown comes in.
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:48.720]  69 more days left for Democratic operatives to stage false flag, to blame Trump supporters.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.720]  I think that's a great idea. We should have a countdown of the election, countdown to false flag, because you can see them setting it up.
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:00.720]  That's right. And also, yes, a rolling scroll underneath your videos.
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:06.720]  Your live stream on your website. That brings people to Bitshoot.
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:11.720]  No, I agree. I have even rolling screens on the walls, all the studios.
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:19.720]  We just have to every day, not put one generic thing in, but load our headlines in, interspersed with newswars.com, prisonplanet.com,
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:23.720]  and then aim the cameras at that to remind folks, you're absolutely right.
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:30.720]  Yeah, it's over there on that side right there. That's a big thing that lights up right over there. It's over on the other side, towards my right, over there.
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:35.720]  We've got it in all the studios, and it's a great point. Well, Gracie, you are awesome. Thanks for the call from Canada.
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:39.720]  She had a lot of great ideas. We might want to turn on all the stuff we've got.
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:47.720]  And we need to just load the daily top headlines, like banks announced South African farmers have their land taken, must still pay the loans back.
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:52.720]  That's a pretty big headliner. Trump promises to go after illegal Google censorship.

[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:15.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:48.720]  I've been good friends with him. He's a really smart guy. He's always been a comedian. He's always been an entertainer.
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:55.720]  He never really wanted to get into politics. He always wanted to stay out of it. I'd call him pretty much a libertarian. He's on a conservative. He's on a liberal.
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:47:59.720]  He's a pro-gun guy, but he's also socially liberal.
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:10.720]  He started his podcast like 10 years ago or whatever, and now it's one of the biggest podcasts in the world. I never really pushed hard to be on it, but he had me on last February, not this year, but last year.
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:22.720]  It was the biggest podcast he ever did at that time. Then they delisted it. They didn't allow you to see it on iTunes like they've done with us having the number one iPhone app for news on iTunes or Android.
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:30.720]  We were number one on both after just a few weeks of us being banned, so they delisted it. You can still download it at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:44.720]  It's been delisted. I started getting irritated because the media makes such a big deal about the Joe Rogan interview, and again, there were 40 million views total, about 6.5 million on YouTube.
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:53.720]  I know that Joe's a great platform where I could be able to set the record straight about a lot of disinfos. He has a very wide audience.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:59.720]  He had Shooter Jennings on a few weeks ago, and I hadn't seen the interviews since last Friday, so it took me about a week to see it.
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:12.720]  Shooter was offending me, but Joe said, yeah, while Alex is in all this turmoil, I'm not going to really get him on because I don't want to be in the middle of all of this.
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:17.720]  What was the word he used when he called me Saturday? Chaos.
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:25.720]  That's what it comes down to, but Joe said, listen, the chaos is so crazy. I guess I got to get in the middle of it because it's not stopping. It's not going anywhere.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.720]  He said he's having me on a show, and I can do it subject to dates, but I'm pretty sure I can do it.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:38.720]  In late September, we're talking a month from now, I'll be on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and that'll be a good deal.
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:47.720]  I've said some negative things. Joe said some negative things. One of his friends told me that Joe's family had been threatened, and when I talked to the friend, they were like, well, I think he was threatened,
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:51.720]  so that wasn't accurate that he was threatened not to cover the New World Order.
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:50:00.720]  Joe isn't afraid to have me on. He seriously is trying to keep control of his show and not turn it just into a political thing, and I respect that.
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:09.720]  But because it became such a big deal, now he wants me back on, and obviously I want to go on there because I like to go on and hang out with Joe and get out from the censors.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:17.720]  So Joe's a man of his word. He said I'll be on in late September, so I look forward to going out to Los Angeles, which I really don't look forward to, but I look forward to going to see Joe.
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:26.720]  One of my most unfavorable places is Los Angeles. Sorry if you live there. I guess you could pay me not to go there, but I will go there and talk to 20, 30, 40 million people.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:32.720]  And I think this interview, and I said, Joe, let me sneak up on it. Let me just show up because they'll try to manipulate and protest or whatever.
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:36.720]  He said, I don't care what they do. I'm not being threatened and not having you on. I want you on.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.720]  He said, go ahead and promote it. So here we are like three or four days later. I'm finally getting around to it.
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:47.720]  So there you go. I'll be on the Joe Rogan experience, and he's not censoring anybody. I appreciate you having me on.
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:52.720]  Coming up on the late part of next month, so stay tuned for that.
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:56.720]  Okay, let's go ahead and take more calls.
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:03.720]  We see Justin and Larry and Jessica and Joe and Susie and Ron and Aaron and Steve and Chuck and Kevin and Rodney and Chase.
[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:06.720]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:09.720]  I guess that would be Justin.
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:13.720]  Justin and Georgia. Justin here on the air. Welcome. Go ahead.
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:15.720]  It's an honor. Welcome.
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:28.720]  You've been asking for input on how we should deal with the Internet censorship, and I just wanted to say that I think it's important that we reflect back on how did we get to this point from 1776?
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:40.720]  You know, when the founding fathers were incensed over relatively small incursions into our liberty, like, you know, not much different from the taxes you pay when you buy groceries.
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:47.720]  Well, the big thing is they had monopolies where you couldn't even get into land management or business or any manufacturing unless you were a British Lord.
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:50.720]  So it was that monopoly that really made them mad.
[02:51:51.720 --> 02:52:01.720]  Okay, well, yeah, you know more about history than me, but I think, like, I think it was Lenin that said basically that they wouldn't be able to take America down by brute force.
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:04.720]  They'd have to sabotage us from within.
[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:12.720]  And that's exactly what he said. And that's what globalism is. And then you see Bill Maher and you see Cuomo saying, we want to sabotage America. America sucks.
[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:19.720]  They don't even hide it. And the crowds go, yeah, if America bankrupted, yeah, we hate America. I mean, my God.
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:23.720]  Then they say, we're Russian agents because we're making it great again. Yeah, right.
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:38.720]  And we see these things like the censorship at the, you know, the high institutional level we see like a spirit, you know, taking control of the arms of government and the big tech corporations.
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:47.720]  But it's like a virus where you can keep kind of cut those tumors off. But if you don't get to that little piece of DNA that's circulating from cell to cell.
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:54.720]  No, I agree. And look, the heart of it is Satanism. It's Luciferianism. It's hate of God. We were found as a Christian nation.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:58.720]  And at the end of the day, it really is an occultic attempt to dominate America.
[02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:03.720]  Yeah, I want to, if you don't mind, I want to read you one of the Proverbs of Solomon.
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:05.720]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:16.720]  Yeah, because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily. Therefore, the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:19.720]  And I'm not saying like...
[02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:23.720]  No, that means they don't have the fear of God in them or the fear of Godly men. They have no fear.
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:28.720]  We, I'm not saying like we're, we're, we're, you know, I'm not talking about...
[02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:35.720]  Not going to, but their wicked works manifest, they procreate, they grow, they multiply, they invent evil.
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:47.720]  I'm saying we have like perverted the role of government. We have, we've changed the duty of government from punishing evil to trying to prevent evil.
[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:49.720]  And what do we do?
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:52.720]  It's beyond that. It's trying to preserve evil. It's protecting evil.
[02:53:52.720 --> 02:54:01.720]  Yeah. When a, when a school shooting happens, when some atrocity happens, what do we do? We cry out for more rules, more regulations, more chains.
[02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:06.720]  And I think if we do that with internet censorship, we're just going to get more of the same problem.
[02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:12.720]  Well, I mean, if you look at Hillary or Peter Strock or any of these people, I mean, these people look like psychotic serial killers.
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:22.720]  I mean, they act like fruitcake, lunatic asylum people. Well, they all look like something we all know what they, they look like, you know, folks that they have a lot of trouble right now in Pennsylvania.
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:27.720]  And that's what it comes in. That's who they are. They're a cult. God bless you, Justin. I appreciate your call.
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:33.720]  All right. Let's talk to Susie in Ohio. Susie, Susie. Thanks for calling. Thanks for holding you. Go ahead.
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:35.720]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:36.720]  Hi.
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:38.720]  I love you. I just wanted to talk about the censorship stuff.
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:42.720]  Like, I feel like more mainstream conservatives need to make a bigger deal about it.
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:46.720]  And they're like doing it to everyone. And I think it's going to, it's looking bad on them, though.
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:50.720]  Oh, no, I agree. It's the number one issue. And it's only Trump talking about it.
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:53.720]  And Congress is asleep at the switch. They are banning everyone.
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:57.720]  They're violating your civil rights to talk to people and bragging. And they think you're idiots.
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:04.720]  Yeah, like even on YouTube or anything, like I've had all my, my, a bunch of comment censored and stuff, I can support you.
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:10.720]  And I notice how people will support you on there. But then on Facebook and Twitter, they're afraid because it's linked to the real name.
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:16.720]  Well, yeah, that's the message is, hey, you'll all be banned if you don't leave, leave Jones in the dark.
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:19.720]  But then notice their ban next. That was the test.
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:25.720]  Demonize Jones. Can everybody to desert him? Drudge didn't desert us. The president did desert us. You didn't desert me.
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:31.720]  So now we've got a fighting chance. But yeah, I have to tell you that what's neck and neck, though, people don't get upset about this.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:33.720]  They can win.
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:38.720]  Yeah. And also, what about the transport on your phone, Alex, or you were going to talk about that?
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:40.720]  Say that again.
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:44.720]  Transport on your phone. That's all they keep talking about.
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:47.720]  And you know, I saw a couple news articles about that. It's ridiculous.
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.720]  I was like looking up some reporter we're trying to hire today and punched in some number and it popped up porn on my phone.
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:56:02.720]  Everybody's had porn popular phones hundreds of times. So I'm sitting with a phone on air showing it to everybody because I couldn't get a URL up in the studio.
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:08.720]  And then like something pops up and like, oh my God. And I looked at it wasn't the news blurted out because there was nothing there.
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:12.720]  They blurred it to then say something was there. Then you went to it was some porn menu.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.720]  I probably had porn menus pop up 500 times on my phone. So I appreciate your call.
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:22.720]  I mean, it's insane, ladies and gentlemen, there's two types of people, people that look at porn and people that lie about it.
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:28.720]  But I wasn't looking at porn on my phone. I don't take phones on air that I look at porn on.
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:35.720]  And so I saw all that. I didn't respond to it. I mean, if I respond to half the attacks on me, it'll, but then they spun it in one article I saw.
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  I saw a whole bunch of only red one. It was like Jones who hates gay people or trans people is just like looking at this stuff.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:50.720]  And it's like, I never said I hate anybody. I said, if you're heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is, leave kids alone.
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:57:02.720]  But the LGBTP community, not all the LGBT, but the LGBT, the LGBT community, LGBTP is LGBT pedophile.
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:07.720]  And they literally promote sexualization of kids and say, let us sexualize your kids and you're transphobic.
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:12.720]  So that's the whole entryway to try to teach kids that there are different sex and ruin their lives.
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:18.720]  Who said that? What's her name? She's a lesbian, liberal, but I grew a lot of her writings.
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:23.720]  That's a fat. Yeah, Camille Paglia. So I mean, there you go. I'm a libertarian.
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:29.720]  They tried to sell that the article I saw, like I was like, you know, I'm this big right wing or whatever.
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:32.720]  And I got caught ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:39.720]  But I'll say this, the Amazon ads, the Viagra ads, the weird non-plastic bag ads are taking my iPhone over.
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:43.720]  iPhones didn't used to be that bad like Androids. It's full of spam now.

[02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:09.720]  You are the InfoWard.
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:16.720]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:24.720]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:25.720 --> 02:59:32.720]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to,
[02:59:32.720 --> 02:59:39.720]  but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:39.720 --> 03:00:06.720]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:13.720]  Yeah, our news director Rob Dugas ran in here for the last two minute break and I've talked to him about what the last caller called him about.
[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:24.720]  I have been so focused on the president countering censorship and 96% of conservative news being blocked and all these people getting de-platformed and kicked off.
[03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:40.720]  I haven't responded to the news stories that I'm robbing people or that I'm running illegal radio stations which isn't true or that I destroyed evidence or that I'm a Russian agent or any of this.
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:48.720]  And then Duke came in and he goes, I'm glad you responded to that because the lady called in because he's like, it's on Newsweek, it's on this and I'm getting a bunch of emails.
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:54.720]  And what is it? Anybody that's got a phone knows you're surfing around the Internet typing in URLs.
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:04.720]  They have these traps if the email isn't right or the text isn't right where you type in that's like Amazon or Viagra ads or mortgage ads.
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:09.720]  Lately it's non-plastic bags has been taking my phone over because I'll type something in and I'll get it wrong.
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:17.720]  And so I'm sitting there searching Genovese is a company we're promoting. Yes, because I said the morning I'm having a sponsor on.
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:23.720]  I want the URL typed on infowarsys.com and Genovese, I'm saying it right. Yes.
[03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:29.720]  I typed that in and I'm like, so they're going to break something pops up says you've got a virus and I'm like, boop, boop, boop.
[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:36.720]  And I'm like, okay, whatever. I finally get infowarsys up and I go look and then pops up some screen with like some word on it.
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:43.720]  And then later they call me that after they go, hey, I want us to not put these videos up because 4chan says it's, you know, some type of porn.
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:48.720]  They sent me an image and I'm like, that's like blurred white page.
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:50.720]  I said, put it out. I don't even know what that is.
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:58.720]  And then it becomes Jones who's a big homophobe and you know, who's a Puritan and never had sex with a woman.
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:02.720]  He who was totally obsessed with this stuff is blah, blah, blah.
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:05.720]  And then I went and looked on my phone and couldn't even find what they said.
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:09.720]  I found one menu that was a Tinder.
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:13.720]  So I guess that's what it loaded and just starts going all this porn.
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:16.720]  And it's like, you want guys, you want women, you want trannies.
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:18.720]  Can't say that on Twitter, transsexuals.
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:21.720]  And I'm like, okay, I got a Tinder out of my phone.
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:25.720]  I'm not the Puritan here. I'm the libertarian.
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:29.720]  I say, do whatever you want in your own bedroom as long as you don't hurt somebody else.
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:31.720]  But it becomes this big national news story.
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:34.720]  Janus. Okay. I say it wrong.
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:37.720]  Janus. That's why I tied it like Genoese and you know, whatever the point is.
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:39.720]  I mean, I know it's great products and everything.
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:42.720]  I'm teleprompter free. I go from memory and they were here that morning.
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:44.720]  I go, where are my URLs?
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:46.720]  I want them typing it on screen.
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:49.720]  I was throwing fits on air about it like everybody's had that happen.
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:57.720]  But the point is, then they spent it at Jones, the super right wing Puritan pastor who leads, you know, major congregations of churches and says,
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:02:59.720]  executes the such and such and does this.
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:01.720]  And it's not even true.
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:08.720]  I'm not Jimmy Swagger saying if you're with a woman out of wedlock, you're going to hell and then you catch it with hookers.
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:10.720]  That ain't me, man. Everybody knows that.
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:19.720]  So I never even responded to this, but now it's just day after day after day because they want to distract me from the censorship.
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:21.720]  And I'm going to introduce this with Paul.
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:23.720]  We come back. We got loaded phones, but I got to go because Paul's here.
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:31.720]  The war rooms coming up about 55 minutes, but I'm going to put out special reports at info wars.com on 96% of conservatives being censored.
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:34.720]  Them trying to steal the election by reports. The president.
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:41.720]  It's unbelievable. We even thought about doing a trolling deal that 4chan would catch like one second of some pop up.
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:47.720]  We even thought, by the way, like I said this morning, they must have a virus on my phone.
[03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:52.720]  It didn't torture me too much. I mean, but I was on Tinder for five minutes. I've never actually had a membership on that.
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:57.720]  My God. Again, I was looking up this female reporter. We're talking about hiring from London.
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:03:59.720]  I put her name in and it's not even her.
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:06.720]  And it's, you know, adult friend finder, you know, that you want, you know, we got guys a mile away.
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:08.720]  We got chicks two miles away.
[03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:11.720]  And it's like, it's like babies.
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:14.720]  I've always said that I've had gay friends.
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:18.720]  I've always said I don't dislike, you know, dudes that take hormones that want to be a woman or whatever.
[03:04:19.720 --> 03:04:23.720]  I just said, don't sexualize children like the Catholic priests and all this crap going on.
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:28.720]  So, you know, maybe I should just pull a stunt and go to a live broadcast from a gay bar.
[03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:33.720]  I mean, if they'd even had me in one of them, like, here I am, you know, I mean, it's, it's, it's ridiculous.
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:39.720]  I don't dislike anybody that's pro freedom, but the left is a cult and it's trying to sexualize our children.
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:46.720]  And I am against the LGBTP. That's right. Add the P at the end for pedophile.
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:05:10.720]  I am against pedophiles and I'm proud of it. I'm pedophilophobic.
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:36.720]  I'm pedophilophobic.
[03:05:36.720 --> 03:06:04.720]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news. It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:23.720]  All right, I know I got loaded phone lines and I was good today. I took a lot of calls, a lot of great callers.
[03:06:24.720 --> 03:06:26.720]  We love you. We appreciate you. Everybody hold it.
[03:06:26.720 --> 03:06:39.720]  If you want to give us your address and where you are, we're going to send you a free info wars.com octagon info wars new logo t-shirt in the size you want a $20 value and buy those shirts at info wars store.com.
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:52.720]  I didn't really plug last hour. Paul Watson is about to take over, but everybody around this office knows I am laser beam focused on the number one issue and that's free speech worldwide.
[03:06:52.720 --> 03:07:03.720]  We have in Germany, we have in Sweden, we have everywhere in Brazil, you name it. Populous governments getting elected. Macron is about to get unceded. It's all happening.
[03:07:03.720 --> 03:07:22.720]  Why don't they just get unceded? They're parliamentaries. They're all hanging on by their fingernails right now and that's why they're trying to distract us everywhere into Amorosa or into the stuff they're trying to do with us.
[03:07:22.720 --> 03:07:37.720]  And it's just a joke. Paul's got a big report coming out tomorrow as important as the 96% of conservatives. It's not just 96% of liberal sites or your search. That means the majority of 96% of conservatives are knocked out.
[03:07:38.720 --> 03:07:47.720]  That's what that really means. And so everyone's learning about this, how they only put the negative results up, how they don't let you talk to people on Facebook, Twitter had a total shadow ban on most people.
[03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:53.720]  We had to actually go to the page. Now they've lessened up because President said it's illegal. Now he said the rest of this stuff's illegal.
[03:07:54.720 --> 03:08:03.720]  And so we're going to have big special reports on infowars.com and newswars.com in the next few days laying out how it's happening, who runs it, what's going on.
[03:08:03.720 --> 03:08:16.720]  But it is a stay-behind network in the CIA, in the Justice Department, in the Board of Governors, the FCC to quote, counter foreign propaganda. But then they just list us as foreign propaganda and come in and try to shut us down.
[03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:26.720]  So Paul, I know you've got a big raft of things at PrisonPlanet on Twitter. Editor at large, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. I wanted to get your take on what's coming up.
[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:33.720]  But just first, good news. I never even got this on the show today, even though I freaked out about it. I want to show a few of these tweets after you talk about it.
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:43.720]  What do you make of Trump coming out bold saying it's illegal? You're censoring millions. You leave fake news like CNN out, but you're crushing the election. This is serious censorship.
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:54.720]  We are going to go after you. This is some tweets from a couple days ago here. Let's pull up the new ones if I can. I'm going to do whatever it takes and I'll actually get the ones from today.
[03:08:54.720 --> 03:09:04.720]  Social media giants are siling millions. Yeah, that was the one from a few days ago. It's the big ones today. And whatever happens, I'm going to stay here as late as I have to tonight to get this out.
[03:09:05.720 --> 03:09:17.720]  Here it is. Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media. In other words, they have rigged for me and others so that almost all stories and news is bad.
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:26.720]  Yeah, no, no positive news. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican conservative and fair media is shut out illegal 96%.
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:39.720]  Results on Trump news are from national left wing media. Very dangerous. Google and others are supervising voices, suppressing voices of conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:46.720]  They're controlling what we can and cannot see. This is very serious situation will be addressed. It goes on to say, is it illegal?
[03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:59.720]  So, Paul, what does the president do at this point? I mean, you've got an article you wrote today at infowars.com, YouTube, Metals and Swedish Election by deleting right wing content and sites put up by the opposing party.
[03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:12.720]  I mean, this is the new global corporate police censor and you've got mainstream media dying dinosaurs like CNN, New York Times, actively as the watchdogs, the Stasi going around flagging what gets taken down.
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:20.720]  And then Oliver Darcy adds insult to Andrew and says, no one censoring you. It's crazy when he's been the captain of it all.
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:34.720]  Yeah, CNN put out an article saying there's no censorship of conservatives. That's a conspiracy theory. He was the guy lobbying for the past six months in meetings with Facebook and YouTube in direct contact with Google, YouTube and Facebook,
[03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:41.720]  telling them, oh, by the way, this violates your policy, this violates your policy, censor them, censor them. But there's no conspiracy to censors.
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:56.720]  Google has responded since Trump put out these tweets, Alex, and said that they don't rig their algorithm because they're biased. They improve their algorithm and improve it to produce, quote, high quality content.
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:11.720]  Just so happens that that high quality content is NBC is CNN is the New York Times. So it's not that 96% of the sites coming up when you type in Trump news or left wing or anti Trump, it's that they're high quality.
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:22.720]  Who decides what is high quality? Google, the company that was in bed, according to the WikiLeaks emails, the pedestrian emails with the Hillary Clinton campaign from day one.
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:34.720]  So you can trust them. It's just like when they say, oh, we've got these independent fact checkers, they're nonpartisan. Who are they? Oh, it's snopes.com, the most partisan left wing website you could ever imagine.
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:41.720]  So it's just Alex, it's just high quality content. There's no censorship. These are the masters of the universe. We just need to trust them.
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:54.720]  And let's be clear, they're not just pushing all the global CNN stuff at the top and suppressing 96% of conservatives. That's what it really means. They're also then flagging and blacklisting and blackballing and shadow banning and outright banning.
[03:11:54.720 --> 03:12:10.720]  Anyone they don't like who's too effective that beats the algorithm. So Ann Coulter, Matt Drudge, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Paul Joseph Watson, you were 96%, no, no, 97% banned. We look, we can see the algorithms. We had Google Analytics and Facebook.
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:18.720]  You were 97% banned a year ago, Paul, when you came out and bragged that we'd won and dominated and the Financial Times and others went, holy hell, it's true.
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:29.720]  I'm not mad at you, but because we do chew their horn, it's not bad until folks were winning. But they took you announcing that as a herald because they know we don't lie as the big victory.
[03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:33.720]  And so since then they've been beavering away, but I think they've gone too far, Paul.
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:47.720]  Well, of course, it was Congressman Quigley, a Democrat who was in a committee session with a Twitter executive complained about one of my tweets featuring in a trending news section about a completely genuine real story.
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:54.720]  He claimed it was fake news. It wasn't fake news. They said, Oh, no, don't worry. We've taken care of that. So yeah, they've been doing it all along.
[03:12:54.720 --> 03:13:06.720]  The Facebook video views were another thing that they changed at the beginning of the year. I mean, usually my videos on Facebook would probably get at least 300,000 overnight, maybe more after a couple days, maybe half a million.
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:12.720]  Now it's like 20,000 after like two days. They so obviously gamed it in their favor.
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:26.720]  And now, as he said, in Sweden with this is not just censorship. This is election meddling. Alex were 12 days away from a massive election in Sweden with the Sweden Democrats, the anti mass migration party tip to do really well.
[03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:37.720]  They've banned a documentary or a short skit, which was a comedy cartoon about the prime minister of Sweden. They've banned a video by alternative for Sweden within like two hours.
[03:13:37.720 --> 03:13:45.720]  They banned a video last month by the Sweden Democrats within hours. They're banning all the nationalists in Brazil that are like Americana pro gun.
[03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:55.720]  Yeah. In Brazil, you've got Bolsonaro who is basically the Brazilian Trump. He's probably going to win. They banning huge amounts of Facebook groups, YouTube channels.
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:02.720]  This is election meddling. It's gone way beyond censorship or shadow banning. This is election meddling. There's no evidence.
[03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:07.720]  Let me bring this up and I'm going to get out of here because you're here to host and everybody loves you. Trump is getting all our stuff.
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:12.720]  I'm not going to get into how or what. I got law firms, everything every day. We're just flooding him. They're really pissed, but it's happening.
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:17.720]  He's listening, Paul. So you got a big report coming out tomorrow listing all the stuff they've done and how to counter it.
[03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:23.720]  But I know you got guests coming up and want to cover, but in a minute and a half we're going to break. This is the big issue, Paul.
[03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:28.720]  This is tyranny. This is illegal. What should Trump do right now? Because we've got to take action.
[03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:36.720]  Well, we gave him some suggestions in that document we put out in consultation with media lawyers in D.C.
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:42.720]  You can at least hire a panel of free speech experts and have them make recommendations. You can have a digital bill of rights.
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:47.720]  You can look at the Communications Decency Act, which already has some teeth in.
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:54.720]  And let me say again, you have all these people in these conferences lying and saying no one's shadow banning when we have their own internal documents.
[03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:57.720]  We have them lying to Congress, Paul.
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:03.720]  And by the way, there's just gone up just in the past hour or so, a big new White House petition.
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:08.720]  Remember, we did that petition. It's on change.org left wing website. They were literally deleting signatures.
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:14.720]  Well, we've got a new one in coordination with some other big personalities up on the White House website.
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:19.720]  So they can't game this one. It's already got thousands of signatures within just a couple of hours.
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:26.720]  There's an article which I just wrote on infowars.com. New White House petition demands Congress pass legislation protecting online speech.
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:30.720]  Sign that petition right now. It's easy as quick. Do it now.
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:38.720]  Let me explain this. Senator Warner, Wyden and Murphy threatened a month ago to take down big tech and nationalize it if they win the election.
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:46.720]  So they rolled over the Democrats. Trump must exert pressure. We're not for regulation, but the lack of regulation saying there is no regulation is allowing the regulation.
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:50.720]  Understand that? We must act to protect free speech now.
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:53.720]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:15:54.720 --> 03:15:58.720]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best. Get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:03.720]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:06.720]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[03:16:07.720 --> 03:16:12.720]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:16:12.720 --> 03:16:22.720]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work, and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:16:23.720 --> 03:16:24.720]  Why take another pill?
[03:16:25.720 --> 03:16:28.720]  Many people use our Sunny Bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:33.720]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:36.720]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:41.720]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:16:42.720 --> 03:16:44.720]  You can easily find Sunny Bay heating pads on Amazon.
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:17:06.720]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay heating pads.
[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:17.720]  We're here in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.
[03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:43.720]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[03:17:47.720 --> 03:17:55.720]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:02.720]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:18:03.720 --> 03:18:07.720]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:17.720]  The Pro Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home,
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:20.720]  removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:29.720]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:36.720]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.

[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:59.720]  it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Whole House filtration system today.
[03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:17.720]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:19:18.720 --> 03:19:26.720]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:36.720]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:43.720]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:44.720 --> 03:19:46.720]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:19:46.720 --> 03:20:08.720]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarstore.com.
[03:20:17.720 --> 03:20:26.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:31.720]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:32.720 --> 03:20:36.720]  As I mentioned before the break, that big petition up on the White House website is live right now.
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:49.720]  It's got thousands of signatures within just a couple of hours, unlike the change.org one, which had a good trajectory at the beginning, but then suddenly, mysteriously, these thousands of signatures began getting wiped off.
[03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:53.720]  The article is up on infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[03:20:54.720 --> 03:20:57.720]  New White House petition demands Congress pass legislation protecting online speech.
[03:20:57.720 --> 03:21:04.720]  The petition, it's short and sweet, it reads as follows, the internet is the modern public square.
[03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:11.720]  It's where political campaigns are fought and won, where journalism is created and distributed, where grassroots movements are born.
[03:21:12.720 --> 03:21:17.720]  Yet the free and open internet has become a controlled, censored space, monopolized by a few unaccountable corporations.
[03:21:18.720 --> 03:21:25.720]  By banning users from their platforms, these corporations can effectively remove politically unwelcome Americans from the public square.
[03:21:25.720 --> 03:21:29.720]  That is repugnant to our shared values of free speech and freedom of the press.
[03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:39.720]  The president should request that Congress pass legislation prohibiting social media platforms from banning users for first amendment protected speech.
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:47.720]  The power to block lawful content should be in the hands of individual users, not Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey.
[03:21:47.720 --> 03:21:58.720]  So that is up right now on the White House petition website. If it gets 100,000 signatures and it needs to get 100,000 signatures within a month,
[03:21:59.720 --> 03:22:02.720]  it goes to the White House, they have to consider it, they have to respond.
[03:22:03.720 --> 03:22:10.720]  We already know that they're considering some kind of action, but again, this keeps the pressure on and it generates even more media interest.
[03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:16.720]  Protect free speech in the digital public square. Go and sign that right now.
[03:22:17.720 --> 03:22:23.720]  If you keep refreshing it, the signatures change, but I think we've got about 2,000 so far once they're all accounted for.
[03:22:24.720 --> 03:22:31.720]  There's also going to be a special day long live stream and it looks like that's going to take place on Saturday right now.
[03:22:32.720 --> 03:22:38.720]  We're doing that in coordination with Breitbart. It's going to have a ton of huge guests, a day long stream.
[03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:44.720]  I'll probably be hosting some of it and again, just a huge number of great guests that you'll all love and want to hear from.
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:52.720]  That's probably going to be on Saturday, so obviously we'll announce details of that in advance and it's all about drawing attention to this petition
[03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:56.720]  because we have stories like this, which again, I mentioned before the break.
[03:22:57.720 --> 03:23:01.720]  YouTube medals in Swedish selection by deleting right-wing content.
[03:23:01.720 --> 03:23:12.720]  This is not the first time they've done this and they're doing it again and they're doing it in response to coordinated brigade campaigns by left-wing pressure groups
[03:23:13.720 --> 03:23:16.720]  in abuse of their own terms of service once again.
[03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:21.720]  Google-owned YouTube has been caught meddling in the Swedish national election on the eve of the vote.
[03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:26.720]  The election is in about 12 days time by repeatedly deleting right-wing content.
[03:23:26.720 --> 03:23:32.720]  So somebody posted a satirical cartoon that made fun of the Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Lovren.
[03:23:33.720 --> 03:23:41.720]  You can't do that. It was deleted within two hours because it was deemed to contain hateful content once again.
[03:23:42.720 --> 03:23:45.720]  It's not a slippery slope. It's a cliff edge.
[03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:48.720]  When everything is hateful, then you can have no opinion.
[03:23:49.720 --> 03:23:53.720]  You can't even make a cartoon that makes fun out of the Prime Minister of Sweden.
[03:23:53.720 --> 03:23:57.720]  That's hate speech. You can't do that. That's bullying. That's harassment.
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:02.720]  Like when we call Brian Stelter mean names, boo-hoo. That's also bullying and harassment.
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:10.720]  The short film entitled To Make It Right made fun out of numerous Swedish politicians to their obsession with being politically correct.
[03:24:11.720 --> 03:24:12.720]  Can't do that. Hate speech banned.
[03:24:13.720 --> 03:24:16.720]  Apparently, this now qualifies as hate speech in the Scandinavian country.
[03:24:16.720 --> 03:24:24.720]  Now, there was also a second example of this where the right-wing alternative for Sweden party had, last month, had its entire channel deleted.
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:26.720]  It was restored eventually after pressure.
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:31.720]  But then just yesterday, they had another video removed.
[03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:38.720]  Again, 12 days before the election, it was made unavailable for viewing in Sweden.
[03:24:39.720 --> 03:24:44.720]  So you could see it outside of Sweden, but obviously, if there's a Swedish national election, that's not much help.
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:48.720]  Again, deleted within hours, a right-wing, right-wing content video.
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:59.720]  Earlier this month, a video by Sweden Democrats, who of course are basically the number two or number three party right now expected to perform really well, was deleted without explanation.
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:09.720]  That video was an hour and 40 minutes of quotes and historical background on the social Democrats, which is the number one party in Sweden, and their links to Nazism.
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:14.720]  So it's okay to point the finger at the right-wing all day and call them Nazis, even when they're not.
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:23.720]  But if you dig into the historical links between big left-wing parties and Nazism in Sweden, then you get deep-sext within hours.
[03:25:24.720 --> 03:25:29.720]  That video had over 190,000 views, and it was canned by YouTube.
[03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:32.720]  The party said they were waiting for an explanation.
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:34.720]  I'm not sure whether that came back.
[03:25:35.720 --> 03:25:36.720]  Again, that was a month ago.
[03:25:36.720 --> 03:25:40.720]  But again, it's all about continuously having to complain about this.
[03:25:41.720 --> 03:25:48.720]  If they've continuously got you on the ropes to the point where every day you're just whining about being censored, it's hard to get your message out.
[03:25:49.720 --> 03:25:50.720]  It's hard to get your policy platform out.
[03:25:51.720 --> 03:26:01.720]  And of course, this all happened in Sweden after a Swedish corporate media group called the Bonnier Group met with Google and demanded that they remove hateful content.
[03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:11.720]  That meeting, that private meeting happened back in March, and ever since then, just by coincidence, all these right-wing Swedish political parties.
[03:26:12.720 --> 03:26:15.720]  Again, this is now at the level where they're censoring political parties.
[03:26:16.720 --> 03:26:26.720]  Not just individuals have had their content removed by YouTube after this corporate left-wing pressure group met with Google to demand exactly that.
[03:26:26.720 --> 03:26:39.720]  So again, it's all about creating this precedent where any criticism, any making fun of left-wing politicians is seen as hate speech, is seen as harassment, and your content gets wiped off of Google.
[03:26:40.720 --> 03:26:48.720]  This is happening 12 days before a massive election in Sweden, which once again goes to the point, this isn't just about censoring individuals.
[03:26:49.720 --> 03:26:50.720]  This isn't just about censoring groups.
[03:26:50.720 --> 03:26:55.720]  This is about election meddling, and this is why it's so important.
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:27:00.720]  We've talked about Robert Epstein, who has done studies into democratic elections.
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:10.720]  For example, in India, the largest democratic election in the world and found that the simple rank of Google search results can shift millions of votes.
[03:27:11.720 --> 03:27:15.720]  What Facebook users see on the day of an election can shift millions of votes.
[03:27:16.720 --> 03:27:17.720]  This is why it matters.
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:19.720]  So it doesn't matter whether you're on Twitter or not.
[03:27:20.720 --> 03:27:22.720]  It doesn't matter whether you use Facebook or not.
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:24.720]  You might not use any of those platforms.
[03:27:25.720 --> 03:27:29.720]  You might not care, but this changes the results of elections.
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:31.720]  That's why it matters.
[03:27:32.720 --> 03:27:34.720]  Once again, everything they do is about power.
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:36.720]  It's not about enforcing their terms of service.
[03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:40.720]  It's not about protecting people from bullying and harassment.
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:42.720]  It's about raw power.
[03:27:42.720 --> 03:27:49.720]  Now, of course, Donald Trump today complained on Twitter about Google's bias search results.
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:28:00.720]  They responded to his complaints by saying that they don't have a bias in their algorithm and that their algorithm has merely had, quote, improvements.
[03:28:01.720 --> 03:28:02.720]  They've just improved it.
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:04.720]  It's not politically biased.
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:08.720]  It merely ranks higher quality content above others.
[03:28:09.720 --> 03:28:10.720]  What is high quality content?
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:11.720]  Oh, well, imagine my shock.
[03:28:12.720 --> 03:28:13.720]  It's CNN.
[03:28:14.720 --> 03:28:15.720]  It's the New York Times.
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:17.720]  It's NPR.
[03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:33.720]  It's the very far left hysterical news organizations that hate Trump, that have been proven to put out fake news about Trump as CNN has been caught doing once again with this Cohen story, which they refuse to clarify, which they refuse to back down on, even though it's been proven completely fake.
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:35.720]  We'll get more into it on the other side.
[03:28:35.720 --> 03:28:39.720]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:28:40.720 --> 03:28:40.720]  Don't go away.

[03:33:11.720 --> 03:33:27.720]  We have an update on the Madden Tournament Shooter, and we're going to get to that after this video, which I put up on YouTube yesterday, getting into the reasons behind why we keep seeing these mass shootings.

[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:05.720]  Let's go to this video, which I put up yesterday. It's called Atomized Why Our Culture Creates Mass Shooters.
[03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:12.720]  And then I'm going to get into some more news about this David Katz, the Madden Tournament Shooter, after we roll this video. Here it is.
[03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:19.720]  Another mass shooting and another opportunity for everyone to exploit the tragedy by blaming their political enemies.
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:27.720]  Gun control now. This is the NRA's fault. Vote Democrat in November. But the shooter was a left-winger who hated Trump supporters. Vote Republican.
[03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:31.720]  Is any of that going to explain why mass shootings happen?
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:37.720]  No, listen to how announcers described 24-year-old gunman David Katz.
[03:35:37.720 --> 03:35:44.720]  You are not going to see much emotion from our guy Brett. This dude is a man David Katz keeps to himself.
[03:35:45.720 --> 03:35:51.720]  He's a man of business. He's not here for the experience and to go out just out in the third. He's not here to make friends.
[03:35:52.720 --> 03:35:58.720]  He's all business. He's focused to even get him to open up to talk to you about anything. It's like volunteers, man.
[03:35:59.720 --> 03:36:03.720]  David Katz was clearly a product of his diseased society and culture.
[03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:08.720]  A culture that has lost faith in itself and offers nothing but empty, meaningless nihilism.
[03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:18.720]  A neoliberal dystopia that indoctrinates young people to shun authenticity, community and family in pursuit of vapid consumerism and fleeting fame.
[03:36:19.720 --> 03:36:26.720]  A culture that informs narcissism-prone young people that anyone can gain instant notoriety by generating enough controversy.
[03:36:26.720 --> 03:36:33.720]  A culture that celebrates serial killers. A culture that monetizes gruesome barbarity.
[03:36:34.720 --> 03:36:38.720]  Helen Henry reports on the new walking tour offering Jeffrey Dahmer history at a discount.
[03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:45.720]  Word about the Dahmer tour surface this week on the Daily Deal site Groupon which offered two tickets for 25 bucks.
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:50.720]  A 58% discount. A deal so hot it's sold out in hours.
[03:36:50.720 --> 03:36:57.720]  A culture that repeatedly tells young white men that because of the sins of their ancestors they have no legitimate place in the world.
[03:36:58.720 --> 03:37:06.720]  No right to an identity. That they have no right to a sense of belonging and that their only destiny is to become increasingly atomized.
[03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:12.720]  A society that has normalized and accelerated the evisceration of the family unit.
[03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:19.720]  Creating a generation of aimless, disconnected, angry young men from broken homes like David Katz.
[03:37:20.720 --> 03:37:28.720]  Atomized, disparate, lonely losers whose only way of redressing their own pain of isolation is to inflict physical pain on others.
[03:37:29.720 --> 03:37:39.720]  Thomas McGrath writes, where once a family or community group may have picked them up or supported them, they fall deeper into their failure placing it entirely on their shoulders.
[03:37:39.720 --> 03:37:45.720]  And that in itself makes it easy to sacrifice everything when you have nothing to lose.
[03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:48.720]  Look at the locations where mass shootings happen.
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:55.720]  They're all places where the public has organized itself into a community, workplaces, schools, churches.
[03:37:56.720 --> 03:38:00.720]  In this case a video game competition where the participants all share the same interest.
[03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:06.720]  The shooter takes revenge for being rejected by the community, for being atomized.
[03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:18.720]  And as these communities become weaker and more sparse with civic participation in rapid decline, the smaller they become and the more atomized, isolated individuals they push away to the fringes.
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:21.720]  People are going to look at the ashes of West emergency.
[03:38:22.720 --> 03:38:28.720]  Now there is a school that's self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because the school was society.
[03:38:29.720 --> 03:38:33.720]  This wasn't just a case of Katz suddenly snapping because he lost a video game.
[03:38:33.720 --> 03:38:36.720]  He traveled from Baltimore to Jacksonville with his gun.
[03:38:37.720 --> 03:38:38.720]  He planned this in advance.
[03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:43.720]  Court records show that Katz had significant medical problems and health care needs.
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:53.720]  Was he on SSRI drugs that are known to kill empathy by putting the user in an emotionless, trans-like, disassociated state of mind?
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:01.720]  The majority of mass shooters in the United States were on or had recently been on some kind of anti-depressant medication.
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:05.720]  Will the media ever give this factor the attention it deserves?
[03:39:06.720 --> 03:39:18.720]  Well, given that pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil spend $2.4 billion on direct-to-consumer television advertising every single year, don't hold your breath.
[03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:24.720]  Will the media ever stop making celebrities out of mass shooters with their breathless coverage?
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:39.720]  They've had 20 years of mass murders, throughout which I have repeatedly told CNN and our other media, if you don't want to propagate more mass murders, don't start the story with Sirens blaring.
[03:39:40.720 --> 03:39:43.720]  The school day had only just begun, but the attacker struck.
[03:39:44.720 --> 03:39:45.720]  Don't have photographs of the killer.
[03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:49.720]  The 17-year-old's three-hour rampage ended in his own death.
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:52.720]  Don't make this 24-7 coverage.
[03:39:52.720 --> 03:39:56.720]  The German chancellor is about to give her reaction. We'll bring that to you live.
[03:39:57.720 --> 03:40:02.720]  Do everything you can not to make the body count the lead story.
[03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:06.720]  Carnage in the classroom. 16 people are dead.
[03:40:07.720 --> 03:40:10.720]  Not to make the killer some kind of anti-hero.
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:14.720]  Dressed in black combat gear, the gunman opened fire at random.
[03:40:14.720 --> 03:40:21.720]  Do localize this story to the affected community and make it as boring as possible in every other market.
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:28.720]  Because every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder, we expect to see one or two more within a week.
[03:40:29.720 --> 03:40:35.720]  But instead of giving mass shooters the posthumous celebrity they crave, maybe we should just tag them with embarrassing nicknames.
[03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:42.720]  Maybe that will dismantle some of the dark, romanticized mystique that the media whips up around these killers.
[03:40:42.720 --> 03:40:45.720]  Why are we fascinated by these psychotic losers?
[03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:53.720]  Because whenever mass shootings occur, it provides a kind of thermometer reading for how sick our society has become.
[03:40:54.720 --> 03:41:03.720]  As philosopher Guy Debord said, in societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles.
[03:41:04.720 --> 03:41:08.720]  Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.
[03:41:08.720 --> 03:41:18.720]  Mass violence provides a depraved societal need for the consumer spectacle, just as lynchings in America and public hangings in Europe did in the past.
[03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:30.720]  So long as our culture continues to offer nothing whatsoever of substance, authenticity or meaning to young men, they'll continue to appropriate meaning via any means possible.
[03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:40.720]  So long as young men are taught to be ashamed of their identity, they'll continue to seek out violently transgressive ways to establish their identity.
[03:41:41.720 --> 03:41:51.720]  So long as family, community and civic society continue to wither and collapse, young men will continue to fall through the safety net that would otherwise have offered protection.
[03:41:51.720 --> 03:42:00.720]  Young men, like David Katz, will continue to become more and more atomized.
[03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:21.720]  Now, you will have heard in that video report I asked the question, was the shooter on SSRI drugs headline out of Daily Caller report Jacksonville shooter was hospitalized for mental illness.
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:31.720]  He was prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-depression medication, the same medication that's been linked with the vast majority of mass shooters in the United States.
[03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:42.720]  Will the media ever give this angle the attention it deserves? No, they haven't and no, they won't because those big former dollars are just too much to resist.

[03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:18.720]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:19.720 --> 03:47:31.720]  Basically what happened is that the mainstream media lobbied for months to ban info wars. They lobbied big tech to ban info wars. They finally caved. They finally did it. And what effect did it have?
[03:47:31.720 --> 03:47:43.720]  It provoked President Donald Trump into starting a national conversation about not only social media censorship, but election meddling. This is the real story here is election meddling.
[03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:57.720]  So really we should be thankful that we were kind of the canary in the coal mine that set this all off and got them finally to pay attention to something that I've been talking about for well over a year now, which is the importance of the algorithm.
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:48:10.720]  We've got a headline here. Kudlow. We're taking a look at regulating Google. While speaking to reporters on Tuesday, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow stated that the Trump administration is taking a look at whether there needs to be some form of government regulation of Google.
[03:48:11.720 --> 03:48:19.720]  And we'll let people know what they plan to do. He said, we'll let you know we're taking a look at it. We'll let you know. Oh, but Google is a private company. You can't regulate a private company. No, it's not.
[03:48:19.720 --> 03:48:31.720]  Okay, they're meeting on a regular basis. They're being pressured by lawmakers, by politicians. They're a monopoly. They are basically the Internet at this point. They're not just a private company.
[03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:40.720]  It's like if the phone company terminated your contract because they didn't like what conversations you were having with people on the phone. That's abuse.
[03:48:40.720 --> 03:48:54.720]  That's basically corporate fascism. They're working hand in hand with power brokers to silence people's First Amendment rights because the Internet, the Googles, the Twitters, the Facebooks of this world are the public square.
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:49:05.720]  If you're not there, then you're nowhere. So no, it's not just a private company. And finally, at least they're putting pressure on them. At least they're putting them on notice.
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:15.720]  Of course, now Google has come out and said, oh, there's no bias in our algorithm. We've just improved our algorithm, literally. I could search for an info wars headline, which I wrote a few months ago.
[03:49:16.720 --> 03:49:25.720]  The exact search term, even with the quotations around it, which is supposed to only bring up that headline, it's not there. It happened last week.
[03:49:25.720 --> 03:49:36.720]  I had to go on another forum that had posted the info wars story to get the link to the original info wars story. Okay, this is Orwellian memory whole behavior.
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:47.720]  Oh, but they came back and said, there's no bias in our algorithm. We just improved it so we could ensure that high quality content appears in response to users queries.
[03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:56.720]  What's the high quality content 96% anti Trump left wing, just by coincidence, CNN, New York Times, NPR.
[03:49:57.720 --> 03:50:03.720]  So again, they basically admitted to what Trump charged them of being behind, but just wrapped it in this vague language.
[03:50:04.720 --> 03:50:12.720]  Oh, just just an improvement to the algorithm, an improvement that skews every perspective on every single issue a few months before the midterms.
[03:50:12.720 --> 03:50:17.720]  Again, this is election meddling. And by the way, that petition.
[03:50:18.720 --> 03:50:23.720]  Headline on forwards.com new White House petition demands Congress pass legislation protecting online speech.
[03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:33.720]  Last count, it was passed about 3500 signatures. Go and sign that today. It's simple. It's easy. It literally takes 30 seconds.
[03:50:33.720 --> 03:50:42.720]  We need to get that petition past 100,000. Oh, what's the point in signing petitions that don't do anything? Well, if it gets past 100,000, the White House has to respond.
[03:50:43.720 --> 03:50:49.720]  And again, this generates media interest. This keeps the ball rolling. We have to build up a pressure movement and it's currently happening.
[03:50:50.720 --> 03:50:53.720]  There's going to be a big live stream on Saturday with a lot of your favorite personalities.
[03:50:54.720 --> 03:50:56.720]  So I'll announce more details on that in due course.
[03:50:57.720 --> 03:50:59.720]  Moving on to global news right now.
[03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:14.720]  The Prime Minister of Britain, who is a complete joke and needs to resign immediately, has publicly supported publicly supported the racist criminal policy being enacted by the South African government or at least threatened to be
[03:51:14.720 --> 03:51:32.720]  enacted of seizing white owned land in South Africa, either at one tenth compensation or zero compensation whatsoever. As we've documented, this is a policy that could lead to mass starvation of both white and black people as it did in Zimbabwe in the 90s.
[03:51:33.720 --> 03:51:40.720]  And of course incentivize widespread murder of white farmers. She's actually come out and publicly supported it.
[03:51:40.720 --> 03:51:57.720]  Headline out of Breitbart. Theresa May announced the support for South African no compensation land reform. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced her backing at the controversial South African proposal to strip farmers of their land without compensation as long as the process is done in a legal manner.
[03:51:58.720 --> 03:52:06.720]  So as long as they put it in the constitution, that they can just seize your land without compensation at gunpoint. That makes it legal. That makes it okay.
[03:52:06.720 --> 03:52:15.720]  No, it's morally repugnant. It's racist. It's criminal. Why on earth are you backing this absolute embarrassment to the country?
[03:52:16.720 --> 03:52:29.720]  The UK PM support for the land reform expropriation without compensation, which is currently not possible and requires changes to the South African Constitution to implement, which they've said is going to happen, came during her first trip to the African continent this week.
[03:52:29.720 --> 03:52:42.720]  She said the UK has for some time now supported land reform land. That's what they call it land reform. Literally the government sending people letters showing up on these farms saying we'll give you one tenth the amount it's worth.
[03:52:43.720 --> 03:52:53.720]  If you're lucky, if you say no, men with guns will come to seize the land. Just just a little bit of land reform. No, that's criminal. That's absolutely criminal.
[03:52:53.720 --> 03:52:59.720]  Absolutely criminal. And the long term consequences could be an absolute disaster for the country.
[03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:12.720]  Gerald Batten of UKIP responded. He said Theresa May says she supports land reform South Africa that is legal. Many countries in the world have taken actions which are legal, but that doesn't make them morally right.
[03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:23.720]  It's reprehensible that Mrs May is standing shoulder to shoulder with the leader of a country who enacts these racist policies. This government has no credibility whatsoever when it speaks of protecting human rights.
[03:53:24.720 --> 03:53:32.720]  If it looks the other way, when I suppose it international partners commit abuses, white farmers are having their land taken away. They're being attacked and murdered for no other reason than their white.
[03:53:32.720 --> 03:53:42.720]  It should be the duty of international leaders to speak up against what is a form of ethnic cleansing, not condone it by mealy mouth references to legality.
[03:53:43.720 --> 03:53:49.720]  And isn't it ironic? In fact, we put a video about this a couple of hours ago. It's up on my Twitter.
[03:53:49.720 --> 03:54:07.720]  The Bowers, the Afrikaners actually got on with the South African black tribes for generations. It was only when the British came in that they truly ruined the country and created this colonial resentment that led to this clamour for land reform, as they call it, and these murders, these attacks on white farmers.
[03:54:07.720 --> 03:54:23.720]  Now, the complete joke, the complete clown of a prime minister who is trailing in the polls to somebody who literally sympathises with terrorists and worships Venezuela, Jeremy Corbyn, an absolute joke of a prime minister that should have been kicked out of office months ago,
[03:54:23.720 --> 03:54:42.720]  is now publicly supporting the racist criminal seizure of white owned land without compensation in South Africa, a policy that could lead to ethnic cleansing and widespread starvation, utter, utter stupidity, completely absurd, absolutely ridiculous.
[03:54:42.720 --> 03:54:57.720]  Meanwhile, in Spain, huge boatload of illegal migrants storms luxury resort beach in Spain. This is a bright bought headline. A boat packed with around 50 illegal migrants beached itself on a luxury resort in Spain's Costa de la Luz on Sunday.
[03:54:57.720 --> 03:55:12.720]  And if you go to this article, you can actually see the video. Again, it's this basically a dinghy of about 20, 30 migrants. They just roll up to this beach. You see it right here. This luxury beach people is just looking on in awe.
[03:55:13.720 --> 03:55:24.720]  They just storm the beach and run off. If you had ISIS, which by the way, ISIS invaded a beach in Tunisia only a year ago and massacred 38 people, most of whom were British, by the way.
[03:55:24.720 --> 03:55:36.720]  You could get ISIS terrorists on one of these boats coming from Libya, coming from one of these North African countries. Just storm in under the guise of being migrants, which the Spanish government has rolled out the red carpet for.
[03:55:37.720 --> 03:55:45.720]  They could massacre hundreds of people. Nobody would bat an eyelid. There's no security there. There's nothing whatsoever. They're just letting this happen.
[03:55:45.720 --> 03:55:59.720]  This ridiculous socialist Spanish government has opened up this migrant route, which, by the way, actually results in migrants dying when Italy closed off the route to some extent, even though the EU is trying to blackmail them out of it.
[03:56:00.720 --> 03:56:09.720]  The number of migrant deaths crossing from Libya to Italy halved. So they literally saved half the people's lives by saying, no, we're not going to roll out a red carpet.
[03:56:09.720 --> 03:56:19.720]  Now Spain's doing it. You see a video out of Tunisia where, again, an ISIS militant stormed a beach with a gun disguised as a parasol and umbrella.
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:31.720]  Massacred, I think it was 38 people. Most of them were British. Absolutely horrific. And that was one guy. That was one guy stormed a beach in Tunisia, not so far away in Spain.
[03:56:31.720 --> 03:56:47.720]  You've got 20, 30 migrants. Nobody knows who they are, as we've seen out of Germany. There was a story last week where a woman, actually, whose ISIS sex slave captor, she met him on the streets of Stuttgart, Germany because he'd been given refugee status.
[03:56:48.720 --> 03:56:58.720]  He was literally an ISIS militant who had kidnapped and sold women into sex slavery. Nobody knows who any of these people are. They just show up. They run to the nearest town.
[03:56:58.720 --> 03:57:06.720]  This is absolute bedlam. Europe, Spain, particularly right now, is committing suicide by letting this happen.
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:17.720]  Meanwhile, 1,000 residents of German city right in the streets following fatal stabbing by migrants. Again, that is another flashpoint created by Angela Merkel's disastrous open border policy.
[03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:25.720]  Now you have big groups left wing and right wing fighting each other, murder on the streets. It's absolute chaos. And it's all thanks, basically.
[03:57:25.720 --> 03:57:32.720]  To her, Mufti, Angela Merkel. Thank you very much for that. No surprise that she's got record low approval rating now.
[03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:55.720]  That's going to wrap it up for the show. War Room with Owen Shroyer is coming right up. Sign that White House petition right now. It's up on infowars.com. Don't go away.
