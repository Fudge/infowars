[00:00.000 --> 00:23.160]  We are in an information war.
[00:23.160 --> 00:29.360]  Our objective is to destroy the false narrative by reminding as many people as possible to
[00:29.360 --> 00:33.880]  think for themselves and question everything.
[00:33.880 --> 00:37.200]  We were effective and so they tried to destroy us.
[00:37.200 --> 00:43.160]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers.
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.240]  Alex Jones obviously is a well known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.080]  This stuff is not speech, it's incitement, harassment, defamation.
[00:53.080 --> 00:59.720]  This is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[00:59.720 --> 01:02.720]  We survived, but we were wounded.
[01:02.720 --> 01:09.000]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones'
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.960]  accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[01:13.960 --> 01:17.360]  Info wars just lost their war on info.
[01:17.360 --> 01:20.360]  Obviously what he spews is hate and it's abhorrent.
[01:20.360 --> 01:24.840]  We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning back.
[01:24.840 --> 01:33.000]  We must push through to victory and so now more than ever we need your support.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.880]  Our products at infowarstore.com are like war bonds.
[01:37.880 --> 01:42.480]  Make a purchase today and support the fight.
[01:42.480 --> 01:46.520]  There is now open talk of repealing the second amendment.
[01:46.520 --> 01:52.120]  The NRA is being designated as a terrorist organization.
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.960]  People are being arrested for personal opinions they post online.
[01:57.960 --> 02:03.080]  We will continue to question everything and fight until the end.
[02:03.080 --> 02:06.600]  So go to infowarstore.com and keep the fight alive.
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.000]  I mean you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.880]  They didn't call out Fox News by name, they didn't call out anyone else by name.
[02:13.880 --> 02:27.560]  He's specifically calling you out.
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.600]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide broadcast.
[02:33.600 --> 02:40.480]  I am your host Alex Jones and this is going to be one of the record books yet again because
[02:40.480 --> 02:43.960]  the establishment is admitting its plans the whole world.
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.600]  They're admitting yes pedophilia is a good thing, yes world government is a good thing,
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.400]  yes the family is a bad thing, yes we're going to confiscate 90% of the firearms in the United
[02:53.400 --> 02:56.000]  States.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.600]  They are just admitting it all out in the open and we've got some amazing compilations.
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.600]  We're going to be covering coming up in the next segment and so much more today the largest
[03:06.600 --> 03:11.280]  oil refinery in the world in Saudi Arabia is on fire right now, hit by a mysterious
[03:11.280 --> 03:16.200]  drone they're saying out of Iran, I don't know how the Saudis would blow up their own
[03:16.200 --> 03:20.400]  giant oil facility, oil prices have exploded on that.
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.160]  The world is really at war right now.
[03:25.160 --> 03:33.600]  It's fifth generational warfare, it's economic, it's cultural, it's migratory, it's spiritual
[03:33.600 --> 03:41.440]  and it's coming to a head so we're going to be looking at every angle of that today.
[03:41.440 --> 03:49.000]  Also we are going to look at vaping which has come to a head in which they're making
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.160]  a huge deal out of, I'm not defending vaping but this is about big pharma and the system
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.080]  just taking it over, I mean it's obviously cigarettes are far worse and kill 500,000
[04:01.080 --> 04:04.760]  people, you're conservatively, people have a right to kill themselves, have a right
[04:04.760 --> 04:05.760]  to speak out against it.
[04:05.760 --> 04:11.840]  Fentanyl, they just caught enough Fentanyl coming in to kill 10,606,000,000 people, that's
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.720]  more than all on the earth, just coming in in one ship and 25,000 tons or 50,000 pounds.
[04:17.720 --> 04:24.000]  So this whole vaping thing is because it's gotten so hot and it's so big and it's a
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.480]  hundred billion dollar industry so they're just going to take it over and of course
[04:27.480 --> 04:30.920]  it's bad, of course they add chemicals to make it more addictive and of course it fries
[04:30.920 --> 04:34.080]  your lungs and of course it's terrible but it's never going to stop it.
[04:34.080 --> 04:37.240]  We're going to look at all those angles as well.
[04:37.240 --> 04:41.360]  It's a big broadcast today, I'm plunging right into the frontal assault on the Second Amendment
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.040]  taking place and the reason they're doing it is there hasn't been a big fight against
[04:45.040 --> 04:51.360]  the attack on the First Amendment so America's in many ways run the white flag up so they've
[04:51.360 --> 04:55.840]  decided to run that big old hot poker right up our area and come take the guns, that's
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  the plan.
[04:56.840 --> 04:59.600]  Let's talk about it.
[04:59.600 --> 05:03.520]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue, they've been selling it for over
[05:03.520 --> 05:04.520]  a year.

[05:09.480 --> 05:11.120]  body but not be a depressant.
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.920]  Now despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our

[06:23.520 --> 06:38.660]  It is September 15th, 2019 on this live Sunday global transmission under host Alex Jones
[06:38.660 --> 06:43.000]  broadcasting from Austin, Texas worldwide.
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.520]  On AM and FM stations across the country, TV and cable stations, Global Shirtwave WWCR,
[06:48.520 --> 06:53.520]  the Internet at NewsWars.com and MFullWars.com as well as Band.Video.
[06:53.520 --> 06:58.240]  We're going to be adding a lot to Band.Video by the end of this week so be sure and check
[06:58.240 --> 07:04.000]  it out but it's already got a lot of original and powerful content on it that the establishment
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.600]  does not want you to see.
[07:05.600 --> 07:15.840]  Alright, let me get into the big story and it's not just the story that we've seen unfold
[07:15.840 --> 07:24.240]  in over 100 nations in the last 70, 80 years since the end of World War II, 70 plus years.
[07:24.240 --> 07:31.160]  Hard to believe it's been 75 years basically since the end of World War II.
[07:31.160 --> 07:38.480]  Most nations had firearms at the end of World War II except Europe that was in ashes and
[07:38.480 --> 07:41.560]  Communist Russia the citizens were disarmed.
[07:41.560 --> 07:51.920]  But since 1945 every nation on earth but the United States and Switzerland has curtailed
[07:51.920 --> 07:59.160]  guns back to single shot unless you're in Israel and then some people are allowed to
[07:59.160 --> 08:03.920]  have firearms because there's obviously a threat all around them of folks that want
[08:03.920 --> 08:07.440]  to kill them.
[08:07.440 --> 08:13.080]  So hundreds of nations over 100 plus have had their guns taken and it never goes back
[08:13.080 --> 08:15.200]  the other way.
[08:15.200 --> 08:21.840]  Mexico always a colonial type deal run by the Austrian and Hungarian Empire for a long
[08:21.840 --> 08:27.800]  time and it was never allowed to have firearms but the peasants in the general public still
[08:27.800 --> 08:33.760]  had them but now they've been disarmed the last 20 years and they've seen a total explosion.
[08:33.760 --> 08:38.640]  Their crime rate is 9 to 10 times that of the average U.S. town or city.
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.840]  It's the second highest in the world only after Guatemala, formerly part of Mexico,
[08:43.840 --> 08:44.840]  to itself.
[08:44.840 --> 08:50.000]  And then we see areas like Chicago and New York and Baltimore, Maryland and Washington
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.920]  D.C.
[08:52.920 --> 08:58.040]  All the places where the citizens can't get a gun that has jumped through 100 hoops maybe
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.760]  might get one almost no private gun ownership.
[09:01.760 --> 09:05.960]  Police officers when they retire can't even have them in most areas.
[09:05.960 --> 09:08.520]  They have the highest crime rates.
[09:08.520 --> 09:16.000]  Chicago has 15 times the crime rate of a place like El Paso, Texas.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.800]  El Paso is a good sized city, why Chicago has 15 times the crime rate?
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.480]  Look it up, that's the last time I checked because Chicago doesn't let you have a gun
[09:25.480 --> 09:27.320]  but the criminals know that.
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.320]  Now I'm not going to go over those basic facts, we already know that.
[09:30.320 --> 09:33.400]  That's the big story here.
[09:33.400 --> 09:41.720]  That powerful corporations worldwide, the top fortune 150 just last week sent a letter
[09:41.720 --> 09:50.400]  to Trump saying it's time to ban and it's time to confiscate all semi-autos.
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.360]  The New York Times ran the same headline they ran last year, it's time to repeal the Second
[09:54.360 --> 10:00.160]  Amendment.
[10:00.160 --> 10:02.040]  Now why are they doing that?
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.920]  Because in all of their studies, in all of their actuaries, in all of their tank tanks,
[10:05.920 --> 10:11.080]  in all of their focus groups, if they really try gun confiscation, which they're already
[10:11.080 --> 10:18.080]  doing in 14 Democrat states, seven have passed red flag laws, no due process, no threats
[10:18.080 --> 10:26.720]  made, your guns are just taken, if they keep pushing that they know it's going to cause
[10:26.720 --> 10:27.720]  a civil war.
[10:27.720 --> 10:30.320]  And you know why they know it's going to cause it?
[10:30.320 --> 10:36.480]  Because they're hyping up that the right wing and the gun owners and the white gun owners,
[10:36.480 --> 10:40.520]  they're making, having a gun being a white thing, are going to go out and start killing
[10:40.520 --> 10:47.720]  everybody so they can provocateur and stage events to demonize American gun owners further.
[10:47.720 --> 10:54.320]  Both the shooters, you know, Paso and in Ohio, were in Antifa, were into the occult, thought
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.880]  the world was too overpopulated, but the media went and expunged their Facebooks, Twitters,
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.280]  and other social medias, and then put up that they were Trump supporters.
[11:05.280 --> 11:10.160]  In Ohio, they failed the cover up, because the neighbors were like, he's a devil worshiper,
[11:10.160 --> 11:16.760]  he hates Trump, he's in a band that talks about child molestation, they want to be evil.
[11:16.760 --> 11:18.920]  That's invoked.
[11:18.920 --> 11:23.000]  Same thing with the guy in Texas, but they were successful in covering it up, we got
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.880]  copies of it all, but the media just kept going with it.
[11:27.880 --> 11:33.480]  So they're activating their people, they don't even have to give them the orders.
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.640]  You know, I've got one, two, three, four, five, six studies right here, I'm going to
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.720]  go over next segment.
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.040]  With mainline psychological associations, you name it saying, the media hyping mass
[11:45.040 --> 11:51.080]  shootings and giving them attention is definitely causing it, because the crime rate peaked
[11:51.080 --> 11:56.720]  in 1991, with the end of the crack epidemic, everybody knows that, and then it went down
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.440]  massively until about five years ago.
[12:00.440 --> 12:03.640]  Violent crime was down 61% according to the FBI's own numbers, just look it up, professor
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.920]  lost on all the numbers, just look it up, but about five years ago, it started going
[12:07.920 --> 12:16.320]  back up, and so last time I checked, we were about 50% down from what we were in the 80s,
[12:16.320 --> 12:17.320]  peaking in 91.
[12:17.320 --> 12:20.760]  So crime is going back up, hell, I need to read the newspaper to know that, people getting
[12:20.760 --> 12:24.440]  robbed, people getting shot, people getting carjacked, people with their homes getting
[12:24.440 --> 12:30.200]  broken into, all over Austin, didn't used to happen, cops tell me it's getting worse,
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.520]  but I mean, so I don't need to read the newspaper to know that.
[12:34.520 --> 12:41.200]  So how is it if I turn my gun in, does that make me safer, no, it makes it like I'm in
[12:41.200 --> 12:42.200]  Chicago.
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.200]  Again, Mexico's had 200,000 killed, innocent people, and they've got a total gun ban there,
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.520]  they're a failed state, we all know that, they've got a crime rate, again, nine, ten
[12:50.520 --> 12:59.040]  times, the world average, way higher than ours, but again, it's all an appeal to emotion.
[12:59.040 --> 13:02.360]  So here's the big story, I'm playing a short clip of Matt Bracken, bestselling author,
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.040]  former Navy SEAL, terrorism expert, worked in the Middle East, dialed into it, he's a
[13:06.040 --> 13:11.800]  smart guy, he's really worried about the way the media is hyping with movies like Joker,
[13:11.800 --> 13:16.200]  where the downtrodden white male goes out and starts killing people in mass, and all
[13:16.200 --> 13:21.240]  these other movies like Cuck coming out, showing the same thing, Hollywood is creating race
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.400]  war, Hollywood is creating the vision of falling down on steroids, and just all these white
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.400]  males killing people, to create that in the media, to get people to do that, instead of
[13:31.400 --> 13:39.320]  death by cop, every time, in a big city, somebody goes out and pulls a gun on a cop, you later
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.760]  hear from their family almost every time that, oh, they wanted to be killed, but they wanted
[13:43.760 --> 13:49.960]  the cops to do it, because they didn't have the nerve to do it, well, now it's go shoot
[13:49.960 --> 13:56.840]  up a bunch of people, go kill people, that's the new option no one ever thought about,
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.640]  they didn't have death education in public schools until 1990, and they even had a 2020
[14:01.640 --> 14:10.120]  special in 1993 about it, where they admitted that once they taught suicide prevention education,
[14:10.120 --> 14:16.880]  that's tripled in girls, and went up substantively in boys, because girls were learning about
[14:16.880 --> 14:23.160]  other girls they empathize with, getting the shoestring in the bathroom on the little coat
[14:23.160 --> 14:29.640]  hanger, and how to lean forward and kill yourself, and they would go try it and kill themselves,
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.720]  they had to take, remember the schools of the 90s, had to take those off the stalls, a
[14:35.720 --> 14:40.760]  tripling, because they had them get in coffins, they teach them how to die, they were teaching
[14:40.760 --> 14:46.680]  them how to kill themselves, and then they put them on Ritalin and Prozac and serotonin
[14:46.680 --> 14:51.720]  reuptake inhibitors, and those speed drugs and those so-called antidepressants on the
[14:51.720 --> 14:57.200]  inserts admit they can make you commit suicide, or be psychotic and kill others, it says it
[14:57.200 --> 15:02.640]  on the insert, so see they've created a climate with the hype and all this, where they know
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.120]  exactly what they're doing, and we've got to get on the offense and let mainstream media
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.960]  know we know what you're doing, and we've got to get on the offense and explain it's
[15:11.960 --> 15:24.680]  these pills, and it's these sick devil worshiper hate women, involuntarily celibate, creepy,
[15:24.680 --> 15:28.040]  shoot them up video game playing people, and I'm not saying if you play video games you're
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.960]  bad, I'm not saying if you like to work black you're bad, it's that certain group though,
[15:31.960 --> 15:35.760]  you add the satanism to it, you add then the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which they're
[15:35.760 --> 15:42.000]  almost all on, the guy in Ohio, the guy in Florida, the guy in south Texas keeps coming
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.760]  out there on these, they know what they're doing, it's a formula, we're going to break
[15:46.760 --> 15:50.280]  it all down when we come back and play the video of the democrats promising just a year
[15:50.280 --> 15:55.400]  ago nobody wants your guns, it's a conspiracy theory, all coming up next segment stay with
[15:55.400 --> 16:04.640]  us. Super silver wound gel is a private label from the top company in the US that has their
[16:04.640 --> 16:09.080]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA,
[16:09.080 --> 16:12.480]  we have been blessed to third listeners and let us private label it in the last two years
[16:12.480 --> 16:18.040]  it's been a bestseller, we convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.880]  basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with
[16:22.880 --> 16:28.240]  their patented silver salt technology in it, it's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the
[16:28.240 --> 16:34.720]  steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver, coconut oil
[16:34.720 --> 16:40.160]  and so much more, it's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.800]  smaller one, you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere, you're certainly not
[16:43.800 --> 16:49.440]  going to find it at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslife.com, get your
[16:49.440 --> 16:54.880]  super silver skin cream today, we can only run this special for another week or so as
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.440]  of taping this September 10th.
[16:58.440 --> 17:04.200]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.000]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[17:07.000 --> 17:13.160]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting, I was the first to begin
[17:13.160 --> 17:19.040]  to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[17:19.040 --> 17:24.800]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com 15 years ago that Google
[17:24.800 --> 17:29.560]  was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[17:29.560 --> 17:35.960]  hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying
[17:35.960 --> 17:39.840]  to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.720]  Chinese on every one of these issues and many others, we've been dead on and we've raised
[17:45.720 --> 17:50.280]  the alarm on a planetary scale, that's why the globalists are trying to shut us down
[17:50.280 --> 17:55.080]  and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war, please support
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.320]  the info war however you can.
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.400]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller, we had to discontinue
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.040]  it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it, that new formula
[18:08.040 --> 18:14.040]  is ultra 12, it's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there, it's
[18:14.040 --> 18:19.400]  got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things, supports
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.640]  healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[18:23.640 --> 18:27.400]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system functioning, goes on
[18:27.400 --> 18:28.400]  and on.
[18:28.400 --> 18:32.280]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[18:32.280 --> 18:36.120]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count,
[18:36.120 --> 18:41.480]  bottom line folks, you need ultra 12, it helps fund the info war, so it's a 360 win and it's
[18:41.480 --> 18:47.840]  50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com, again we can only run the special for the
[18:47.840 --> 18:53.880]  next two weeks or so while supplies last, ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price,
[18:53.880 --> 18:58.880]  50% off right now at infowarslife.com.
[18:58.880 --> 19:02.920]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you,
[19:02.920 --> 19:08.960]  the products at infowarslife.com are, we go out, we find out what is the best rated,
[19:08.960 --> 19:14.880]  best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother
[19:14.880 --> 19:20.040]  Nature and then we make it even stronger, even better and lower the price.
[19:20.040 --> 19:24.400]  Now turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[19:24.400 --> 19:30.440]  it's good for the immune system, so many things, it sells itself, but normal turmerics only
[19:30.440 --> 19:37.960]  has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant, originally obviously
[19:37.960 --> 19:38.960]  from india.
[19:38.960 --> 19:45.520]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level and it's got other
[19:45.520 --> 19:50.160]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it and that's why people absolutely
[19:50.160 --> 19:51.160]  love it.
[19:51.160 --> 20:09.840]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at infowarslife.com.
[20:09.840 --> 20:33.680]  Thank you so much.
[20:33.680 --> 20:41.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:41.160 --> 20:52.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:52.520 --> 20:56.440]  I want to salute you all and thank you for spending time with us on this Sunday global
[20:56.440 --> 20:57.440]  transmission.
[20:57.440 --> 21:01.200]  Hey, now the wrong one to watch a good football game, have fun with your friends and families
[21:01.200 --> 21:05.840]  from around at the local swimming pool or whatever, go fishing, that's all great, it's
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  important.
[21:06.840 --> 21:11.080]  But you know what, the fight for civilization, our future is happening right now and it's
[21:11.080 --> 21:15.720]  not foreign armies that are coming this time, it's propaganda, it's disinfo, it's megacorporations
[21:15.720 --> 21:21.360]  allied with the chai comms and radical Islam literally coming to the west, overthrowing
[21:21.360 --> 21:27.000]  the engine of our freedom that made us successful and wealthy and the apple and the destination
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.360]  of the world.
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.160]  I was watching a clip I'm going to play next hour of a famous rapper who I actually like
[21:34.160 --> 21:44.560]  some of his music and I've seen in some of his movies debating Candace Owens and he
[21:44.560 --> 21:50.520]  says, tell me when America was ever great and this audience starts laughing at her and
[21:50.520 --> 21:52.960]  then she starts talking about how America was great.
[21:52.960 --> 21:57.440]  I wish he would ask me that question because I would tell him why America was great.
[21:57.440 --> 22:04.320]  TI slams Candace Owens for supporting Trump at Revolt Summit, see Revolt, Revolt, Revolt
[22:04.320 --> 22:05.320]  against what?
[22:05.320 --> 22:13.200]  We're going to be talking about that coming up a little bit next hour and I tend to try
[22:13.200 --> 22:16.600]  to open the phones up then as well on this live Sunday edition but let's get right into
[22:16.600 --> 22:19.560]  the meat potatoes.
[22:19.560 --> 22:23.760]  There's no doubt that the power structure and the globalists trying to maintain control
[22:23.760 --> 22:27.200]  over this country in the west, they've been losing control, fighting back, we've done
[22:27.200 --> 22:30.640]  it before, it's happening again, history does repeat.
[22:30.640 --> 22:35.280]  There's no doubt that they're trying to trigger a conflict.
[22:35.280 --> 22:42.640]  All the Hollywood movies, the shows, the Revolt Summit put on by TI, it's all race war, it's
[22:42.640 --> 22:48.600]  all the Joker, it's all white males, go out and shoot everybody, conservatives are terrorists,
[22:48.600 --> 22:54.880]  the NRA are terrorists, we got to bully these conservatives, we got to assault them, we
[22:54.880 --> 22:58.640]  got to make them uncomfortable, we got to flatten them, we got to burn them down, these
[22:58.640 --> 23:03.040]  are all quotes from CNN, MSNBC.
[23:03.040 --> 23:04.040]  That's their plan.
[23:04.040 --> 23:07.760]  I keep telling you that I got invited to Sundance by some big directors and I said, you know,
[23:07.760 --> 23:15.800]  I can't go but let me send one of my associates, he doesn't work for me, he works with me and
[23:15.800 --> 23:20.720]  he went and he said, this is a secret and he said, no, just don't say who was in these
[23:20.720 --> 23:29.520]  meetings and they told us all about the plan to overthrow society basically and how if
[23:29.520 --> 23:35.200]  I was nice, I could meet with a former president and how they really liked me and I said, you
[23:35.200 --> 23:40.280]  go to Sundance, right there in an office, I was sitting there with them six months ago
[23:40.280 --> 23:43.240]  and I said, you go to your Sundance thing in a couple of months and I said, you come
[23:43.240 --> 23:47.120]  back with your list of demands because I go to the people that sent you here even give
[23:47.120 --> 23:51.680]  you the list of demands and they were like, looking at me and they came back with the
[23:51.680 --> 24:02.440]  list of demands later and I said, I told you, so stop trying to rope me into this crap.
[24:02.440 --> 24:06.920]  Like I want to go hang around and hear about how you got 50 movies coming out to cause
[24:06.920 --> 24:08.760]  a civil war.
[24:08.760 --> 24:12.320]  I don't want to hang around with you people, I'm not part of it and I'm not even saying
[24:12.320 --> 24:18.520]  those directors are bad people, big directors, I just tried to tell them, I said, you are
[24:18.520 --> 24:23.640]  green lit to come talk to me, but only to get me in the net and then all the conditions
[24:23.640 --> 24:24.640]  come.
[24:24.640 --> 24:30.760]  This is not my first rodeo jack and some of these guys are for real.
[24:30.760 --> 24:34.560]  I mean, I've had a guy here, you know, super famous and I'm not name dropping.
[24:34.560 --> 24:36.760]  I'm trying to give you where this gun control is coming from.
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.240]  I mean, that is produced, you know, let's not exaggerate, 50 shows for HBO, the king
[24:42.240 --> 24:48.400]  of HBO, asking me how we turn this around was like five years ago and I said, I don't
[24:48.400 --> 24:49.680]  think you can be done.
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.680]  Well, you want to come be in LA and with the secret society of conservatives, sorry, don't
[24:54.680 --> 25:00.920]  have time for it, but I just love how the public thinks, oh, Alex is saying things.
[25:00.920 --> 25:02.280]  Are they really true?
[25:02.280 --> 25:12.000]  What the hell do you think I could be making $100 million a year in Hollywood just like
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  that.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.600]  I don't want it.
[25:14.600 --> 25:18.360]  I'm not for sale.
[25:18.360 --> 25:24.440]  And the reason it's important to explain all of this is so that people understand you can
[25:24.440 --> 25:25.640]  build your own system.
[25:25.640 --> 25:27.040]  We can build our own world.
[25:27.040 --> 25:30.360]  We can do incredible things.
[25:30.360 --> 25:36.960]  And the whole system is about owning men particularly and women secondarily.
[25:36.960 --> 25:39.520]  You know who's abused and attacked and controlled.
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.440]  You know why men are paid three times more all these places because there's other men
[25:43.440 --> 25:47.920]  trying to control them.
[25:47.920 --> 25:51.080]  Women on average don't even try to compete and get in the power structure.
[25:51.080 --> 25:54.200]  It's not their nature unless they're a Hillary Clinton.
[25:54.200 --> 26:00.520]  So I said I'd get to all the gun control, but I'm going to do it next segment.
[26:00.520 --> 26:12.840]  It's just that you understand that it's Sundance, and I've told this story 50 times despite
[26:12.840 --> 26:16.480]  the fact I've got hundreds of articles and clips that are incredible here, that he was
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.560]  in meeting after meeting for four days.
[26:19.560 --> 26:25.560]  And it was all their funding, overthrow of civilization, depression, America sucks, everything's
[26:25.560 --> 26:32.440]  falling apart, kill Trump, kill his supporters, suicides, wonderful, racism's everywhere.
[26:32.440 --> 26:40.640]  That's pure, shy, calm, globalist venom to make us hate each other.
[26:40.640 --> 26:44.480]  And then you read in the news they admit we want to crash the economy to stop the Trump
[26:44.480 --> 26:49.360]  recovery and to teach nationalists and patriots.
[26:49.360 --> 26:53.080]  You want to make white people guilty and hate themselves and teach minorities to hate them.
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.960]  It's not minorities running all this, it's the cold blooded establishment that wants
[26:57.960 --> 27:00.520]  to conquer America.
[27:00.520 --> 27:08.960]  And it is in the process of doing it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.560]  And you know what's sick is almost everybody else takes the payoffs.
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.600]  You know, I mean I was offered by the time I figured out what was going on, leading
[27:18.600 --> 27:20.720]  roles right out of the gates.
[27:20.720 --> 27:27.840]  I don't want to be a leading role in a space opera.
[27:27.840 --> 27:30.640]  You know, with a director that's a pedophile.
[27:30.640 --> 27:32.200]  I mean I don't want to be that character.
[27:32.200 --> 27:36.680]  I don't want to go lose 50 pounds and sit around while ashes is raining down on me and
[27:36.680 --> 27:41.320]  have people bring me caviar while I'm laying out of a pool and some soulless woman performs
[27:41.320 --> 27:43.400]  fellatio on me.
[27:43.400 --> 27:46.400]  I don't want to be part of that.
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.320]  It's important to declare that because everyone else is just falling down in front of themselves
[27:52.320 --> 27:55.080]  to worship this thing.
[27:55.080 --> 27:59.680]  Well Alex, I made three billion with my series of movies and we have some major roles for
[27:59.680 --> 28:00.680]  you right now.
[28:00.680 --> 28:02.680]  You'll just grow up a little bit.
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.320]  Oh, I think I grew up.
[28:07.320 --> 28:10.920]  And I want to tell Holly what's something.
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.280]  You're going to lose this fight.
[28:14.280 --> 28:21.840]  And you already know it and you curled up next to the soulless chai comms to prop you
[28:21.840 --> 28:27.600]  up the last decade and to an Obama to prop up our currency and to maneuver us for oblivion.
[28:27.600 --> 28:32.160]  You people are a bunch of losers because you had to have a pissing contest with America
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.640]  because you didn't feel like you were part of it.
[28:33.640 --> 28:37.900]  I'm not the globalist right now because it was so great, so powerful, so neat, so free
[28:37.900 --> 28:42.200]  compared to what you are that you want to kill it even though it's the goose laying
[28:42.200 --> 28:45.360]  you the golden eggs you fools.
[28:45.360 --> 28:47.000]  So they want to cause a civil war.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.200]  That's why they're coming for the guns because they know they're losing intellectually and
[28:50.200 --> 28:52.400]  they're losing in the free market and they're losing spiritually.
[28:52.400 --> 28:58.680]  So we're going to come back and break it all down and stay with us.
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.800]  As I sit here recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back to that
[29:04.800 --> 29:11.040]  tragic event 18 years ago, it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the
[29:11.040 --> 29:17.840]  fire department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm
[29:17.840 --> 29:25.480]  that bombs were in Tower One, Tower Two, and of course, Building Seven and that then FBI
[29:25.480 --> 29:30.040]  director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis and to know that
[29:30.040 --> 29:36.640]  there's a deep state group working within our government with radical Islam who are
[29:36.640 --> 29:41.520]  using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering
[29:41.520 --> 29:44.680]  and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[29:44.680 --> 29:49.680]  Well 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is awakened in 9-11 and infowars
[29:49.680 --> 29:54.280]  and our researchers and our guests, our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again.
[29:54.280 --> 29:59.120]  That's why infowars.com is more important than ever.
[29:59.120 --> 30:04.920]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[30:04.920 --> 30:09.360]  products and hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[30:09.360 --> 30:12.440]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[30:12.440 --> 30:14.200]  years as a best seller.
[30:14.200 --> 30:19.880]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[30:19.880 --> 30:24.760]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol
[30:24.760 --> 30:26.240]  technology in it.
[30:26.240 --> 30:31.600]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.880]  oil, it's got the nano silver, coconut oil and so much more.
[30:35.880 --> 30:41.440]  It's in two sizes, Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're
[30:41.440 --> 30:44.560]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it
[30:44.560 --> 30:49.480]  at this price and it funds the Infowar at infowarslife.com.
[30:49.480 --> 30:54.240]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today, we can only run this special for another week
[30:54.240 --> 30:58.680]  or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[30:58.680 --> 31:02.640]  There are a few things in this universe that I'm not sure about but I'm here to tell you
[31:02.640 --> 31:06.040]  the products at infowarslife.com are.
[31:06.040 --> 31:13.600]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[31:13.600 --> 31:18.560]  that God gave us to Mother Nature and then we make it even stronger, even better and
[31:18.560 --> 31:19.560]  lower the price.
[31:19.560 --> 31:24.200]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[31:24.200 --> 31:26.480]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[31:26.480 --> 31:34.800]  It sells itself but normal turmerics only has 3 to 5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.920]  or system in the plant, originally obviously from India.
[31:38.920 --> 31:45.320]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level and it's got other
[31:45.320 --> 31:49.960]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it and that's why people absolutely
[31:49.960 --> 31:50.960]  love it.
[31:50.960 --> 31:56.440]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at infowarslife.com.
[31:56.440 --> 32:01.720]  We sold secret 12 for 4 years and it was our number 3rd best seller.
[32:01.720 --> 32:06.160]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[32:06.160 --> 32:07.160]  it.
[32:07.160 --> 32:08.760]  That new formula is ultra 12.
[32:08.760 --> 32:13.160]  It's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[32:13.160 --> 32:18.480]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[32:18.480 --> 32:22.800]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[32:22.800 --> 32:26.560]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[32:26.560 --> 32:27.560]  and on.
[32:27.560 --> 32:31.440]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.400]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[32:35.400 --> 32:37.800]  Bottom line folks, you need ultra 12.

[33:01.720 --> 33:16.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.200 --> 33:29.680]  It's Sunday, September 15th, 2019 and we're broadcasting the defiance of the tyrants.
[33:29.680 --> 33:36.320]  I'm gonna get to their game plan to beat us in a moment but let's hear from this young
[33:36.320 --> 33:37.320]  lady first.
[33:37.320 --> 33:47.320]  It's a lot of beauty in the universe, it deserves protected and I'm gonna do it.
[33:47.320 --> 33:59.600]  That's right, all the folks that colonize California for a quick buck and ruin the state
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.080]  in the last 50 years are all moving here.
[34:02.080 --> 34:04.600]  They're not Californians.
[34:04.600 --> 34:07.080]  They're zombies.
[34:07.080 --> 34:13.880]  They're bringing their state of mind to Texas and ruining it but that's okay.
[34:13.880 --> 34:17.720]  Maybe someday they'll wake up and realize they're fleeing themselves and they'll stop
[34:17.720 --> 34:20.160]  being who they are.
[34:20.160 --> 34:28.520]  So I have analyzed very carefully the victim disarmament global corporate system and the
[34:28.520 --> 34:37.320]  UN treaty that Trump pulled us out of that was signed by George Herbert Walker Bush but
[34:37.320 --> 34:48.560]  never ratified and that's the United Nations Small Arms Convention that calls for eliminating
[34:48.560 --> 34:56.040]  the ownership of civilian firearm ownership because it threatens the legitimate power
[34:56.040 --> 35:01.400]  monopoly of the state, power monopoly.
[35:01.400 --> 35:02.400]  That's a true statement.
[35:02.400 --> 35:03.400]  They want a power monopoly.
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.080]  Are power monopolies ever good and are they legitimate?
[35:08.080 --> 35:15.360]  Civilian ownership of firearms, period, any type, threatens the legitimate power monopoly
[35:15.360 --> 35:25.240]  of the state and what else does it do?
[35:25.240 --> 35:26.240]  What else threatens it?
[35:26.240 --> 35:32.360]  Oh, a family, owing allegiance to your family, owing allegiance to your tribe, owing allegiance
[35:32.360 --> 35:40.920]  to your religion, owing allegiance just to being an independent person.
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.680]  They want total conformity through these big modern reeducation camps that are social
[35:45.680 --> 35:57.120]  media, these modern gulags, these modern ghettos.
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.040]  They're not liberals sticking up for the downed fraud in the week.
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.840]  They're monsters intimidating the downed fraud in the week and trying to form us into even
[36:06.840 --> 36:13.920]  weaker unions that they can control and in the darkness bind us.
[36:13.920 --> 36:19.120]  So it's in all the treaties, it's in all the statements, it's in all the Brady campaign
[36:19.120 --> 36:26.120]  and the moms against gun violence and the Soros and Bloomberg funded grants that the
[36:26.120 --> 36:32.600]  goal is to, quote, brainwash the American people into registering guns, then banning
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.040]  all semi-autos by demonizing the AR-15 over and over again, which every zombie then goes
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.600]  out and buys following their psychic orders, their programmed orders that a whole stack
[36:43.600 --> 36:52.480]  of mainline studies saying the media is the main culprit, programming heterosexual white
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.960]  men, how about terrorists, I mean it's true, who are devil worshipers and Antifa who want
[36:56.960 --> 37:05.480]  to hurt society and bring down culture, Satanist, almost all of them white.
[37:05.480 --> 37:13.720]  And Antifa leftists, firebombing ICE facilities repeatedly, almost no coverage.
[37:13.720 --> 37:17.080]  It's simply amazing, but I'm digressing.
[37:17.080 --> 37:21.840]  And so they say, oh no one wants your guns, no one's coming for your guns, it's a conspiracy
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.720]  theory, they've just done it in every other country, handful of countries still have guns
[37:26.720 --> 37:36.080]  out of hundreds, it's all been done this last 70 years the same way, hype up shootings,
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.160]  make people think it's happening everywhere, then copycats begin following it, then they
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.160]  have a chain reaction, then they say we can't have it happen one more time, register everybody,
[37:44.160 --> 37:49.320]  then begin the confiscation.
[37:49.320 --> 37:52.920]  The real crocodile Dundee looked just like the guy in the movies, acted like he's famous
[37:52.920 --> 37:58.000]  wrestled alligators, crocodiles, did all the stuff they said.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.400]  He had a ranch out in the middle of nowhere, tens of thousands of acres, it's desert,
[38:02.400 --> 38:07.800]  remember reading the story, how the Australian news was sent to me, never heard about the
[38:07.800 --> 38:13.360]  U.S., back in the mid nineties.
[38:13.360 --> 38:21.920]  And they came to take his semi auto 30 odd six Remington five shot and they gunned him
[38:21.920 --> 38:27.760]  down at his house, he wouldn't come out so they shot the house full of holes, wounded
[38:27.760 --> 38:35.200]  him, he killed two cops, it's astounding, a tragic tale of Rod Ansel, the real life
[38:35.200 --> 38:36.200]  crocodile Dundee.
[38:36.200 --> 38:42.840]  Oh wow, somebody wrote an article about it since then, that's from ATI, so that's what
[38:42.840 --> 38:47.040]  they want, they want to come out and target gun owners, Bloomberg even had the headline
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.080]  a few years ago, oh gun confiscation is a gun, where psychologists are your neighbors, you
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.600]  didn't threaten anybody, they just feel like you need to turn your guns in and then sometimes
[38:55.600 --> 38:58.120]  the SWAT team kills you.
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.680]  And that's going to cause a civil war because they're going to trigger it if they have to
[39:02.680 --> 39:05.880]  and there'll be some unstable people that end up fighting back, but you can say they're
[39:05.880 --> 39:12.080]  not unstable because in 1775 at Lexington and Concord at Bunker Hill, the Redcoats came
[39:12.080 --> 39:21.840]  to confiscate the firearms and the local militia said we're not turning it in, they were the
[39:21.840 --> 39:29.280]  local volunteer police department and the captain said we don't want a war, we're not
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.640]  going to fire first, but if they fire first, if they want a war, they're going to get one
[39:32.640 --> 39:36.360]  and it's called the shot heard around the world, somewhere in the computer, we haven't
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.120]  aired it a few years, we've got Andy Griffith from the Andy Griffith Show talking about
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.680]  the shot heard around the world, so we can find that, no big deal if we can't, live for
[39:43.680 --> 39:44.840]  tomorrow.
[39:44.840 --> 39:48.800]  And so that's where we come from, that's who we are.
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.120]  So why have they gone from denying they have this plan to try to take our guns, to now
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.200]  admitting it and that's being done to again escalate into crisis because they don't think
[40:00.200 --> 40:05.400]  they can do it politically or incrementally anymore, they want to bring us into revolution,
[40:05.400 --> 40:11.200]  to revolt, into conflict, go out and confront them at gas stations, grocery stores, at their
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.840]  homes, harass them, kill them, shoot them, that's what Democrats are saying, CNN said
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.240]  that when Congressman Scalise got shot, the guy that did it wasn't a monster, some call
[40:20.240 --> 40:26.480]  him a hero, Wolf Blitzer said with his guest and Wolf had a crazy look in his eye when
[40:26.480 --> 40:31.680]  he said it, they just wish that guy was a better shot would have killed that whole
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.520]  conservative caucus including Senator Paul, yeah they mean business, so let's go to break
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.880]  with the Democrats, just from the last few years denying they want our guns, I mean I'm
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.120]  trying to find the clip of Biden a few years ago going I don't want your rival, your shotgun,
[40:46.120 --> 40:49.840]  your semi auto, it's all conspiracy and him saying we're not going to send the army to
[40:49.840 --> 40:53.760]  come take it in the middle of the night, black helicopters, well they're announcing it now,
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.280]  the whole Democrat group, they all say we're coming to take them, we're confiscating them,
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.320]  tell yes we're coming, here it is.
[41:02.320 --> 41:09.720]  And please do not, if some of you are watching certain television stations or listening to
[41:09.720 --> 41:15.520]  certain radio programs, please do not believe this notion that somehow I'm out to take everybody's
[41:15.520 --> 41:16.520]  guns away.
[41:16.520 --> 41:26.040]  I'm not here to repeal the second amendment, I'm not here to take away your guns.
[41:26.040 --> 41:32.920]  One is questioning your right to have a gun, we're not talking about taking guns away from
[41:32.920 --> 41:33.920]  people.
[41:33.920 --> 41:37.440]  They want to create the fear that the government is actually going to come after guns because
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.280]  that helps sell more guns and it has across the country.
[41:40.280 --> 41:42.880]  And I think a lot of people that are out there that are fearing what we're saying right
[41:42.880 --> 41:45.920]  now think that we're going to try taking their guns, we're not.
[41:45.920 --> 41:49.120]  The never gun movement and the march for our lives is not trying to take your guns, we're
[41:49.120 --> 41:50.960]  trying to take back our lives.
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.400]  This is why the NRA puts up videos that try to scare Americans, they go to emotions, they
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.880]  go to fear, you know people want to take away your guns, nobody wants to take away people's
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.720]  guns, we just don't want to be any different than Canada or Australia or Great Britain.
[42:04.720 --> 42:10.760]  Those common sense measures would in no way infringe on any constitutional right.
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.040]  People like Mitch McConnell are stoking it, I mean in my state he put out an email from
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.200]  his campaign that was titled They're Coming to Get Your Guns, I mean that's how brazen
[42:19.200 --> 42:20.480]  some of them are.
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.560]  I am a second amendment supporter, I do not want to take away any gun rights that are
[42:25.560 --> 42:28.000]  held through constitutional protection.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.880]  Now if you own an AR-15, keep it, continue to use it responsibly and safely.
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.800]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, we're not going to allow it to be used
[42:37.800 --> 42:41.920]  against fellow Americans anymore.
[42:41.920 --> 42:45.240]  It will be voluntary, it won't be hell yes, we'll come get your guns.
[42:45.240 --> 42:50.360]  No, it's not voluntary, I want to make sure that we make the distinction here.
[42:50.360 --> 42:56.760]  It is mandatory, it will be the law, you will be required to comply with the law, so.
[43:20.360 --> 43:50.160]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[43:50.160 --> 43:58.960]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now in InfoWarsLive.com.
[43:58.960 --> 44:04.800]  Super Silver Loon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[44:04.800 --> 44:09.240]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[44:09.240 --> 44:12.320]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.080]  years, it's been a best seller.
[44:14.080 --> 44:20.320]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[44:20.320 --> 44:25.240]  creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology
[44:25.240 --> 44:26.240]  in it.
[44:26.240 --> 44:31.480]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential
[44:31.480 --> 44:37.200]  oil, it's got the nano silver, coconut oil and so much more, it's in two sizes.
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.280]  Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4oz and in the smaller one, you're not going to find a product
[44:42.280 --> 44:45.520]  that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it at this price and it
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.360]  funds the InfoWars at InfoWarsLive.com.
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.120]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today, we can only run this special for another week
[44:54.120 --> 44:57.360]  or so as of taping this September 10th.
[44:57.360 --> 45:02.840]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[45:02.840 --> 45:07.320]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[45:07.320 --> 45:08.320]  it.
[45:08.320 --> 45:09.880]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.280]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[45:14.280 --> 45:19.600]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[45:19.600 --> 45:23.920]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps

[45:27.640 --> 45:28.640]  and on.
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.560]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.520]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[45:36.520 --> 45:38.920]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.

[45:59.160 --> 46:04.920]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[46:04.920 --> 46:07.720]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[46:07.720 --> 46:12.360]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[46:12.360 --> 46:17.160]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.720]  for their organs to be harvested.
[46:19.720 --> 46:25.520]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com 15 years ago that Google
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.280]  was using microphones and hidden cameras for record everything you do at hundreds and
[46:30.280 --> 46:36.640]  hundreds of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying
[46:36.640 --> 46:38.320]  to control our economy.
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.040]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every
[46:42.040 --> 46:44.560]  one of these issues and many others.
[46:44.560 --> 46:48.520]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale.
[46:48.520 --> 46:53.280]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical
[46:53.280 --> 46:55.320]  than ever to support the info war.
[46:55.320 --> 47:21.320]  Please support the info war however you can.
[47:21.320 --> 47:28.960]  Our country was founded when the Redcoats came to take the guns.
[47:28.960 --> 47:38.480]  It was the last straw, the corruption, the bureaucracy, the kings, men's, ruthless behavior.
[47:38.480 --> 47:40.040]  The last straw was coming to take the guns.
[47:40.040 --> 47:43.160]  Our nation was founded about the people's right to keep their arms.
[47:43.160 --> 47:46.560]  You can go to 167 other countries and have no guns.
[47:46.560 --> 47:53.360]  This is a country where we have guns and we're 330 million people and 300 or so die year
[47:53.360 --> 48:03.440]  in mass shootings and 500,000 die from cigarettes and a couple million die from opiates and
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.600]  tens of thousands die falling in their bathrooms.
[48:07.600 --> 48:13.160]  Let's see the media just again I use the JAWS analogy came out in the mid-70s cut not just
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.360]  here but all over the world where people had movie theaters from Australia to the US cut
[48:17.360 --> 48:18.360]  beach attendance.
[48:18.360 --> 48:25.720]  You can type that in JAWS, Spielberg's JAWS, almost killed beach towns worldwide.
[48:25.720 --> 48:28.320]  You'll see newspaper clippings.
[48:28.320 --> 48:30.760]  You click Google images.
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.200]  10 people die year on average from great wives.
[48:34.200 --> 48:41.440]  I use this example every time but everyone I know is scared to swim out in the ocean.
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.080]  The sharks are going to eat them.
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.880]  On top of a nurse shark swim over when I was with Belize, my ex-wife and kids.
[48:50.880 --> 48:52.360]  I said baby it's a nurse shark.
[48:52.360 --> 48:53.360]  It's obviously been fed.
[48:53.360 --> 48:54.360]  We're by a dock.
[48:54.360 --> 48:58.920]  I was climbing in with this eight foot nurse shark just getting scared.
[48:58.920 --> 49:01.360]  I wasn't doing something macho.
[49:01.360 --> 49:04.480]  You can hand feed those.
[49:04.480 --> 49:08.360]  But see you know what I'm scared of when I see a bunch of jellyfish in the water I don't
[49:08.360 --> 49:09.360]  get in.
[49:09.360 --> 49:12.800]  When you see jellyfish on a bunch on the shore, that's when you don't get in.
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.280]  When you're in clear water and there's no jellyfish, that's where you're safe.
[49:17.280 --> 49:20.200]  Rarist way to die on this planet is a great white shark attack.
[49:20.200 --> 49:21.960]  It's the rarest way.
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.240]  Some say maybe a meteorite hitting you but some estimates are more people die than that
[49:25.240 --> 49:26.240]  a year.
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.000]  They'll just think it's an explosion in your house or a gas main.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.440]  Years later they tear down the house.
[49:30.440 --> 49:36.520]  There's a meteor under the floor or like you down in the dirt.
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.960]  So meteorites and great white shark attacks but everybody's scared of great whites.
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.600]  In the 70s, again, same thing with guns.
[49:47.600 --> 49:49.520]  Mass shootings are really rare.
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.880]  Do they have hundreds of carjackings a month in Chicago?
[49:53.880 --> 49:54.880]  Yeah.
[49:54.880 --> 49:58.600]  To 2,000 black people die every year in Chicago at the hands of other blacks, it's terrible.
[49:58.600 --> 50:00.640]  The media doesn't hype that, why?
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.400]  Because they're running the show, the government ship and the drugs and the Democrats are.
[50:04.400 --> 50:09.000]  The Mexican mafia, all God's children, MS-13 that Pelosi talks about, they're laundering
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.160]  that money.
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.640]  They're going to keep that going.
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.360]  Remember when TV with Andy Griffin talked about what this country was really about?
[50:19.360 --> 50:21.360]  Here it is.
[50:21.360 --> 50:29.080]  Well, one time a long time ago, this country was a part of England and we wouldn't get
[50:29.080 --> 50:35.200]  out of it.
[50:35.200 --> 50:46.040]  It's like this when you are
[50:46.040 --> 50:50.400]  a holding on for dear life and a hollering at the top of his lungs. He says the British
[50:50.400 --> 50:55.760]  is coming, the British is coming. Get you a gun, we gonna have us a revolution. And
[50:55.760 --> 51:00.940]  them farmers come up piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive. Minutemen, they
[51:00.940 --> 51:05.320]  have called. What's minutemen? Minutemen? There's fellas that have to be ready at a
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.040]  minute's notice. And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns
[51:10.040 --> 51:15.560]  and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere. And when the British
[51:15.560 --> 51:22.520]  come pranks and long haul dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it. It was a
[51:22.520 --> 51:31.120]  sight to see. And then it happened. They fired the gun. They fired the gun. And the shot was
[51:31.120 --> 51:48.120]  so loud, it was heard clear around the world. Oh, get out. That's the way this country started.
[51:48.120 --> 51:51.360]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much again for joining us on this live
[51:51.360 --> 51:56.560]  Sunday edition. You know, I came in yesterday. I launched a new show called the Info Wars
[51:56.560 --> 52:03.880]  Roundtable Caller Show 2 to 4 p.m. We may move it. We're going to probably expand it.
[52:03.880 --> 52:08.280]  And I'll host it some weeks and other hosts here will host it. But it was great. And every
[52:08.280 --> 52:11.400]  show will take five to 10 different callers that I think are some of the best callers
[52:11.400 --> 52:16.920]  or that Oh, and things are great callers or that David Knight thinks are great callers.
[52:16.920 --> 52:21.880]  We give each caller like 10 minutes apiece. And boy, it was really good. That's posted
[52:21.880 --> 52:29.400]  up on info wars.com and news wars.com. So folks know that I'm pretty good at gauging
[52:29.400 --> 52:33.520]  what the globalists are going to do by studying their past operations and what they've done
[52:33.520 --> 52:38.880]  in other countries and what they've done here. And they're definitely trying to cause a physical
[52:38.880 --> 52:42.440]  civil war. And that's not just me figuring that out or you figuring that out. They've
[52:42.440 --> 52:46.160]  been saying that and we're putting together a lot of compilations. We've already had some
[52:46.160 --> 52:49.960]  where they're admitting they want violence and a violent overthrow. But I was working
[52:49.960 --> 52:57.960]  on two videos on that today. They're going to be big, not fancy, but very prolific pieces
[52:57.960 --> 53:03.920]  that have a lot of clips and a lot of proof of what I'm saying, not just me telling you
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.240]  or showing you a news article, but right out of their mouths, how they want to kill you,
[53:08.240 --> 53:11.640]  how once they get control, they're going to get rid of the family and have sex with your
[53:11.640 --> 53:15.200]  children, how they're going to sterilize you. And you're just like, wow, why are they all
[53:15.200 --> 53:19.800]  saying this? You know, Obama's White House of Science are and top Hollywood people and
[53:19.800 --> 53:29.560]  top scientists because they're crazy control freaks and they're degenerates. And so having
[53:29.560 --> 53:36.640]  sex with children isn't enough for them now. Okay. They want full control of society and
[53:36.640 --> 53:46.260]  they want to wreck it. And if you want to understand that, understand Luciferianism, Satanism,
[53:46.260 --> 53:52.680]  not what you think of guys in a trailer park on meth killing their dog in the back on acid.
[53:52.680 --> 53:58.960]  It's real. It's a predatory mindset towards humanity to run by psychopaths and sociopaths
[53:58.960 --> 54:06.000]  and then thrill seekers and power seekers under them. And it is cancer. Humans to get cancer,
[54:06.000 --> 54:18.640]  humans to get cancer. Societies get cancer. We have very bad cancer. And if we don't cure
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.840]  it, the nuclear reactors will melt down and the civilization will collapse and there'll
[54:23.840 --> 54:33.520]  be a giant war. And almost everyone's going to die. And all the Elon Musk and people that
[54:33.520 --> 54:37.840]  they're going to get brain chips and live forever, that's the same delusion these megalomaniacs
[54:37.840 --> 54:44.400]  always have back to Egypt. Not going to happen. Ray Kurzweil's going to die. Elon Musk is
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.520]  going to die. They're all going to face their creator. They all look like methhead crazies
[54:50.520 --> 55:04.020]  thinking they're going to escape death. What a bunch of cowards. You will escape nothing.
[55:04.020 --> 55:08.600]  But I'm not going to stand by and watch you kill our species and the genetic code and
[55:08.600 --> 55:17.320]  eternal life. The guarantee of our birthright pool. Elon Musk owns the global government
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.200]  and all the AI gods. Beware them. Oh, it's all coming. I'm your priest. I'll protect
[55:22.200 --> 55:25.280]  you. And then he's the first to come out and say, take all the brain wires and chips
[55:25.280 --> 55:31.000]  next year. Did he do it because Soros took over his company and threatened him? He do
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.960]  it because he went on Joe Rogan and smoked pot and the stock went down and people started
[55:33.960 --> 55:40.160]  firebombing his factories. Doesn't matter either way. He's a servant of them now, isn't
[55:40.160 --> 55:47.600]  it? So Matt Bracken is a smart guy. I mean, I just don't have any run of the mill gongs
[55:47.600 --> 55:50.600]  just because they were a Navy SEAL. He's a smart guy. A lot of smart people years ago
[55:50.600 --> 55:53.440]  said, y'all have Matt Bracken on. He knows a lot of stuff. He's a smart guy. And I don't
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.760]  like Matt. He hosts a lot of shows with us. But Friday he was hosting the, or was it Thursday
[55:57.760 --> 56:03.400]  hosting the fifth hour, fourth hour? Hell, it all bleeds together now. And he was getting
[56:03.400 --> 56:08.880]  into, they want to cause a civil war. They know they're triggering the psychology of copycats
[56:08.880 --> 56:12.560]  and others. And I have all the studies I haven't gotten to yet, I will. Admitting this mainstream
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.680]  news. I mean, look at it right here. Media contagion is factor in mass shootings. A study
[56:17.680 --> 56:23.120]  says American Psychological Association, even the Lib Tards get it. Mass shootings, the
[56:23.120 --> 56:30.560]  role of media and promoting generalized imitation. James N. Mendel, PhD, John W. Ivy, PhD, top
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.040]  universities, all the big studies right here. There's just hundreds of these. Does media
[56:34.040 --> 56:39.840]  coverage inspire copycat mass shootings? Center for Research goes on to say yes. And it just
[56:39.840 --> 56:45.320]  goes on and on and on. I've got a whole stack of those. Oh, here are my other studies on.
[56:45.320 --> 56:48.640]  Mass shootings, the role of media and promoting generalized imitation. Mass shootings should
[56:48.640 --> 56:53.520]  be contagious. Research shows, even NPR admits it. And it's the key to it, along with the
[56:53.520 --> 56:59.680]  drugs they're on, that take away inhibition, cause suicide and mass murder. But here's
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.760]  Bracken. When we come back, I'll get to it. And I wasn't going to do a plug this hour.
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.960]  I'm out of time to even plug properly. We're listeners supported. Again, I didn't sell
[57:10.960 --> 57:14.480]  out to Hollywood and the globalists for money. I don't just care about money. Money, though,
[57:14.480 --> 57:17.240]  is a symbol of freedom and be able to do what you want. That's why they try to take it away
[57:17.240 --> 57:21.920]  for everybody so they can then use money to control us. But if you buy the products,
[57:21.920 --> 57:25.040]  water filters, the air filters, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the great supplements
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.680]  that you already need, then it helps us stay on the air. It's symbiotic for everybody,
[57:28.680 --> 57:35.480]  a 360 win, as I call it. And we have some of the biggest sales ever right now, at infowarstore.com.
[57:35.480 --> 57:40.880]  We have the new Beto Knot. Take our firearms t-shirt. It's already very, very popular.
[57:40.880 --> 57:44.760]  Get them all at infowarstore.com. We'll be back with a second hour. I haven't begun
[57:44.760 --> 57:51.520]  to fight yet. Please spread the word. As I sit here recording this on the eve of September
[57:51.520 --> 57:59.720]  11, 2019, and I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago, it makes me sick to my stomach
[57:59.720 --> 58:06.280]  to be vindicated and have the fire department of New York and major construction and engineering
[58:06.280 --> 58:12.200]  firms come out and confirm that bombs were in Tower One, Tower Two, and of course, Building
[58:12.200 --> 58:17.640]  Seven. It's just pancake. And the then FBI director, Robert Mueller, helped cover the
[58:17.640 --> 58:24.120]  whole thing up with the Saudis and to know that there's a deep state group working within
[58:24.120 --> 58:29.120]  our government with radical Islam, who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take
[58:29.120 --> 58:33.800]  our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the
[58:33.800 --> 58:38.960]  planet. Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is awakened to 9-11
[58:38.960 --> 58:43.280]  and info wars and our researchers and our guests, our whistleblowers have been vindicated
[58:43.280 --> 58:51.440]  yet again. That's why info wars.com is more important than ever. Super silver wound gel
[58:51.440 --> 58:55.920]  is a private label from the top company in the US that has their products and hospitals
[58:55.920 --> 59:00.000]  and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA. We have been blessed
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.200]  with their listeners and let us private label it. The last two years has been a bestseller.
[59:04.200 --> 59:09.880]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top
[59:09.880 --> 59:14.760]  skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[59:14.760 --> 59:20.160]  technology in it. It's got the hyaluronic acid. It's got the steric acid. It's got
[59:20.160 --> 59:25.800]  the grapefruit essential oil. It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[59:25.800 --> 59:31.440]  It's in two sizes. Super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one, you're
[59:31.440 --> 59:34.800]  not going to find a product that's good anywhere. You're certainly not going to find it at this
[59:34.800 --> 59:41.480]  price and it funds the info war at info wars life.com. Get your super silver skin cream
[59:41.480 --> 59:51.800]  today. We can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[59:51.800 --> 1:00:06.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. He aligns himself with the truth. It's time for
[1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:25.560]  you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. Hard to turn on. I remember that
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:31.960]  when I have girlfriends in other cities or they come flying and see me that those relationships
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:38.960]  are so special. And then you drive like three hours to meet that girl. And it's like you're
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:43.720]  making love to the highway. It's like you see it get dark and the lights come up and
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:51.720]  all the tail lights. I remember that. There's an old girl friend up in Dallas. I lived down
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:01:04.480]  there during high school. God gave us love, God gave us the earth, God gave us our emotions,
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:09.760]  all these wonderful things that evil tries to control and exploit. Remember that. Remember
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:14.520]  the globalists aren't invincible. They're the counterfeit elite. That's why they had
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:18.160]  to censor us and censor you and try to take over the schools and get your kids while they're
[1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:24.760]  young to brainwash them because they're weak. They just crave power, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:29.840]  My love is in league with the highway. Okay. You know, I'm going to get really serious
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:33.560]  and give the number out next segment and really plow into all of this meat and potatoes and
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:38.760]  all the other angles I haven't hit and really talk about how I think we can stop these folks.
[1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:43.280]  But first I had him digging around for Andy Griffin stuff and trying to find some of the
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:46.600]  other intros that I wanted to play. And they found this one I forgot about. They're talking
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.800]  about spying on people. That made me think of Google in the headline. Google's always
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:55.360]  been listening to you for 20 plus years from day one with hidden microphones. Now they
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:59.600]  admit it. And now they're watching you all the time. And in the Washington Post goes
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:04.440]  you dumb schmucks. They don't tell you Amazon's got its own competing system. So I don't think
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:09.840]  Alexa's watching people yet like Facebook's and Google's. I mean, this is all just flaunting
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:15.680]  it, rubbing your noses in it because they're at the emergence point. I'm going to cover
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.680]  that after break. But here's this little short clip.
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:23.680]  Paul, guess what? We bugged Mr. Blake's cell and we heard him talking to his lawyer. You
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:27.560]  see, we took the mic and we hit it up with the cell window. Wait a minute. What are you
[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:33.040]  talking about? We bugged Mr. Blake's cell. You what? We bugged the cell with arms tape
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:37.240]  recorder. Just listen to this, Paul. I can't listen to that. But Paul. Opie, I can't listen
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:43.400]  to that. I'm not permitted. But Paul, you don't understand. Opie, I can't listen to this.
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:49.400]  Now I told you about eavesdropping. But Paul, this is different. Yes, it's worse. You overheard
[1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:54.480]  a conversation that was supposed to be private. Now I can't be a party to that. But Paul,
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:59.400]  if you just listen to this. Opie, I can't listen. Paul, you're erasing the tape. That's
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:06.840]  what I mean to do. You bugged the conversation between a lawyer and his client. Now that's
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:13.520]  violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy. But Paul, no buts. But if it helps
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:22.400]  the law, Opie, the law can't use this kind of help. Because it's the ring of Mordor.
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:27.080]  Once you use it, you lose everything. And now they tell you everything's being listened
[1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:33.560]  to for 20 years, just as I told you. And it's not because I'm some hero. I had an independent
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:39.280]  show. I'd cover things nobody else would. And I had three different engineers at least
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:49.400]  come to me in 96, 97 and 98. And these were big engineers. These were guys involved. Like
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:54.320]  I said, one of the times that guy was driving like a $200,000 Maybach, first time I'd ever
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:04:03.120]  seen one. And he came to the rodeo where I was doing a live event and gave me an envelope.
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:09.040]  And when I didn't cover it, he showed up at a parking garage I was parked in at an event
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.200]  and said, listen, come over here. I'm going to give you the manual and I'm going to break
[1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:16.440]  one of these open for you. And he showed me the damn microphone. He said, you got to tell
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:21.400]  people. They're listening to everything and they're studying it and testing it with keyword
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:25.240]  so they can predict the future and know how to manipulate people. And it's being set up
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:29.720]  to be in all devices, telephones. He goes into the Telecommunications Act. This year
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:33.800]  they just passed. By 2000, it'll be in all the phones. They're going to be called smart
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:39.800]  phones. And I'm not even going to tell you the rest of the story because you wouldn't
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:40.800]  believe it.
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:46.720]  Well, I will tell you. About four or five years later, I was doing a movie showing in
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:49.760]  Alamo Drafts House and a guy showed up and he said, you know, that was my dad brought

[1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:15.880]  You're listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:23.480]  you are the resistance. And we are on the front lines. I am in Austin, Texas named after Stephen
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:29.360]  F. Austin. And the Democrats are all over the news. Bloomberg AP, we're capturing Texas.
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:34.840]  We've been imploded California. We're moving in with our forces. We can't believe how stupid
[1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:39.720]  they are. They're fleeing us with bringing with them their same ideas we programmed them
[1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:45.320]  with. This is victory. It's so sad to see my fellow Texans still somewhat asleep, but
[1:06:45.320 --> 1:06:48.880]  they've bought off talk radio. They've shut down almost all the conservative shows. You
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:54.680]  can even hear and no one's ringing the alarm bell. We are still on over 200 radio stations,
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:57.880]  over 100 TV and cable stations with a lot of them are mom and pops. Some are big. They're
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:03.080]  all precious. Please spread the word. But watching this happen is just so crazy. You
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:08.320]  know, when I learned in 96 and 97 and 98 from engineers that sent me information and came
[1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:13.640]  to visit me when I was doing remotes and things on 98, 9K JFK local talk radio at the time.
[1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:18.520]  I was already syndicating it on satellite myself. I was on probably 20 stations then
[1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:26.360]  and shortwave. I would go on air with a scientific Atlantic cable box also on my local TV show
[1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:33.200]  and I'd break it open and show the microphone. And I was on cable access so I could show
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:36.880]  people those before Internet was really streaming good. I would do some of it. The bills were
[1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:41.280]  so big I couldn't pay to put it out on servers before YouTube. I mean, I've caught bribery
[1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:44.760]  at the Texas Capitol and paying people off to testify. It's a second amendment. They
[1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:48.880]  were gang bangers and criminals and they use guns illegally and I caught them paying them
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:53.640]  off. I put that video up and got downloaded a few million times and I got a $14,000 bill
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:58.440]  or something. It was $14,000 or more. Back then, that was like all the money in the bank
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:08.120]  basically. And so I'd go down to access TV to do production and try to make documentaries
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:12.320]  and send out DVDs to people so they could actually see I was showing me breaking open
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:17.760]  a scientific Atlantic cable box. We've got to find that video somewhere. And it had a
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:25.280]  microphone in it, a hidden secret microphone. But if people would have listened to me then
[1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:28.720]  there would have been a national debate. There'd been a scandal. It would have stopped. That's
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:33.800]  why they were worried back then. And I got threatened and the access TV people said we've
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:38.400]  never seen this. Access TV started in Austin, Texas 40-something years ago. It's like 50
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:45.560]  now. Look that up. Started in the early 70s. Like 1970. Look up when access TV started.
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:53.080]  It's famous, folks. Access started here. And they would kill the transmission because you
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:57.000]  actually would transmit it over fiber optic down to the cable company. And when I would
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:03.920]  talk about that they would cut the show off live. And I got death threats and I was told
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:10.280]  you better stop that. Because back then the fact that the cable companies all over were
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:15.460]  listening to you in your homes and creating keyword text documents that could be read
[1:09:15.460 --> 1:09:19.800]  over and scanned and then read by computer. And the fact that then that was put in the
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:27.480]  telecommunications act of 96 that by 2000 all of them would be satellite tracked, GPS'd
[1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:31.560]  and that they could turn the phones on when they were even off and record you and they
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:36.000]  were going to be on when you had the phone on recording everything you did. And it'd
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.160]  be these home assistants that would do it and you tell your refrigerator what you wanted
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:42.120]  and then it would order it. But that was all going to be dialed in and everything you'd
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:51.600]  be doing would be tracked. And I was on air telling everybody all this because no one
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:57.760]  else would have these people on. I mean I was having police officers on who were the
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:04.800]  head cops who saw the Feds plant the bombs in the World Trade Center by name on the show.
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:11.480]  I was having widows on of cops who were killed because they exposed the Clintons. In Mina,
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:20.760]  Arkansas shipping in drugs and in Oklahoma City. And I was having the Branch Davidian
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:26.000]  survivors on and I was having again engineers were bringing me all this stuff because I
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:34.800]  would cover it. And of course the show became number one. But then it got noticed and all
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:41.920]  of a sudden we were told the LCRA is spending $100,000 a month with us. And you're not going
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:44.840]  to talk about the land grabs around Austin anymore and how they're taking all these farmers
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:48.720]  and ranchers land for no reason for environmental areas and then turning them around five years
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:57.080]  later and selling them to the highest bidder. And I said no I'm not going to shut up. And
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:00.440]  then the head of the place that had hired me three years before quit over it. He said
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:08.560]  yeah this young man's right. I'm not going to be immoral. And they brought in new people.
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:11.680]  And they tried to set me up. And this is about me telling a story. It's about all the world
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:16.200]  works where they wanted me to say I'd been killed on April Fools to make it look like
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:20.520]  it was legitimate to fire me because the show was number one in the city. Just incredibly
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:26.400]  popular. Went all the way past Waco and all the way to San Antonio on the FM dial. NPR
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:36.080]  has it today. 98.9. And I said no. And then later I turned out they were trying to set
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:40.600]  me up so instead they just fired me a month later. And I remember I came and they said
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:45.600]  get out of here and try to try to fight with me. Again that's what slaves are like. And
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:49.240]  I just thank God all these years later I'm not a slave. But a lot of people in media
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:56.200]  are like that and they just bow down. And then later I learned. They apologized to me
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:03.280]  on another affiliate here the main talk station that the hospital district that's a bunch
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:10.520]  of hospitals that get government money and abortion money in Austin came and bought
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:17.360]  my time slot out to get me off the air. And the station was so blown away that I didn't
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:22.080]  make a big deal about it. And I just said hey man I understand it's happening everywhere.
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:28.560]  But that's what America is. Is the hospitals get taxpayer money. Last time I checked like
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:36.400]  40 million a year to kill babies. And because I was against it. I was taken off the air.
[1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:41.440]  Well so what. You imagine when I was like endorse abortion so I could still be on the
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:47.480]  air. I wouldn't be on the air. I wouldn't be who I was. I'd be a mouthpiece. A repeater.
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:55.720]  A puppet. A nobody. So I tell you these stories folks so that you can know what it's like in
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:02.200]  Hollywood right down the low level media and how soulless and sad it is. And how sad it
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:10.240]  is to me that most men in America when they're confronted with this. And when they're told
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:16.080]  about this they decide to sell out. You know I knew a retired police officer who had the
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:26.120]  highest ratings on that last station. Loved. And right when they got rid of me. They called
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:30.560]  him in a few times and said you really ought to stop. Your Trump support you really ought
[1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:41.040]  to stop. He said I can't do that. And they let him go. Gillette lost eight billion dollars.
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:45.480]  Run an ad saying men are bad. Men liking women is bad. And masculinity is bad. And they said
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:51.760]  we don't care. It's an agenda and we've got to carry it out. What an evil agenda. Ladies
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:56.360]  and gentlemen the power structure is doing everything it can to take us off the air with
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:14:01.320]  our independent system we built with our own audio streams our own video our own satellites
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:07.800]  feeding AM FM UHF VHF cable systems. Global shortwave WWCR 100,000 watts serving the world
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:12.360]  by a shortwave was to do it anywhere on the planet info wars dot com the bandwidth cost
[1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:18.240]  or millions a year. Alone the IT cost millions a year. I'm not complaining we built our
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:22.680]  own infrastructure and you spread the word about it. That brings in the new people to
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:25.760]  learn the truth. They're not going to let us on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube because
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:30.400]  we're effective. We tell the truth and we're loyal and we haven't sold out and we're stead
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:39.000]  fast. We're dog like committed to our mission never backing down unable to sell out unable
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.960]  to be bent by this evil system because my soul's pointed towards God and I know yours
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:49.920]  is as well. We can defeat them so easy when you get excited and you get focused and when
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:53.520]  you tell people about the broadcast and how it's forbidden and how they need to know the
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:15:01.880]  truth. It's Americana. It's Renaissance. It's the Western world. It's the whole planet awakening

[1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:06.120]  Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia. I was the first to warn
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:12.280]  of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting. I was the first to begin to warn that babies
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:17.440]  were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested. I was the
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:23.040]  first to warn you along with Paul Watson and infowars.com 15 years ago that Google was
[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:28.120]  using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and hundreds
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:34.400]  of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private run for profit trying to control
[1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:38.840]  our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:44.200]  on every one of these issues and many others. We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm

[1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:39.800]  I remember being on air 25 years ago and reading in Patriot magazines like New American where
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:46.920]  I've never read a lie. How about Neurodically accurate and so demonized, the John Byrd Society.
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:55.240]  He's always saying, oh he likes John Byrd Society, he's discrediting 24 karat gold.
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:21:00.800]  And I was reading about the UN treaties and how they've taken over the US and UNESCO and
[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:04.480]  how they wanted world government at the end of the family and depopulation to bring back
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:14.760]  human sacrifice and so I went to the UT library and I pulled up the New York Times 1973 calling
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:20.040]  for communism in America by David Rockefeller and how great Mao Zedong was when he killed
[1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:21.040]  85 million people.
[1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:28.320]  And I was like, what? It's real. And I'd go and I'd read about the UN treaties signing
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:33.040]  over our national parks and 100 mile buffer zones and all the mines around them and then
[1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:39.160]  I'd traveled with a couple thousand dollars I had in the bank and my cousin for no pay
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:45.080]  I didn't have any money and 96 just been on the air about a year and a half and I drove
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:49.800]  to all these national parks and showed the UN signs and I'd asked the park rangers they
[1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:53.360]  threatened to arrest me they say, hell yeah, we're the UN. It's my film America Destroyed
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:22:00.480]  by Design because my listeners were like, it's not true there's not a UN treaty and
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:06.480]  George Herbert Walker Bush didn't sign us on to that and because there wasn't the internet
[1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:11.080]  to end. There were news sites but you'd show people photos they wouldn't believe it so
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:17.760]  I had to make VHS films and show them people and I'd sell a couple thousand and people
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:23.560]  make millions of copies. And then a couple years later I'd be with my family and like
[1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:28.880]  Colorado and walk into some shop and there'd be just given free copies of my films away
[1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:34.360]  stacks of them. That's the power of the people. So the globalist think taking the internet
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:39.680]  away from me, taking me off Facebook, Twitter, all these places were like that did something.
[1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:44.440]  I'm not trying to be famous. I'm trying to change the world for the better. I'm trying
[1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:48.400]  to make the information famous to stop the evil that they're keeping babies alive all
[1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:54.120]  over the country and selling their organs while they chop the organs out of them. The
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:58.160]  order comes in slow they only take a kidney but they get a bunch of orders and they gut
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:03.920]  them all on the spot. They'll keep babies alive two weeks, keep it fresh. Now it's all over
[1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:11.760]  the news. It was in lawsuits way back then when I first got on air 25 years ago there
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:21.040]  were pro-lifers showing me VHS stuff even worse than it's been discovered today. Babies
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:27.560]  being harvested, everything. I got to get a hold of all those access to TV producers.
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:32.560]  What's that Catholic guy's name? George Woolley. Hey tell the producer to get George Woolley
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:40.680]  on if he's still around. I mean I just can't. It's just unbelievable. And I know why people
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:46.320]  think this is all crazy because it sounds crazy but I've got stacks of news here I haven't
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:51.640]  even gotten to yet where major colleges and major institutions are promoting pedophilia
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:59.480]  as good. They've gone from saying it's okay to it's good now and it's the new thing and
[1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:03.880]  if they come and ask your kid out when they're seven and your kid they want to emancipate
[1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:08.640]  them now and say kids can take vaccines if you don't want them to and eat GMO and get
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:16.080]  a brain ship if they want or go out with some potbellied 50 year old man. There it is. Ohio
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:23.640]  College normalizes pedophilia sexual orientation and there's a book I covered last month written
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:29.920]  in the U.S. by an Obama politician that's in schools from here to Australia. Australians
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:39.000]  are fighting it. That tells kids fantasy stories about well I was six and I was in the bathroom
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:45.560]  and this man performed glacial I mean it was really great. So your kids want to go out
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:49.280]  and learn about something they didn't know about and get kidnapped and killed and you're
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:52.240]  like is that real? Hell we'll pull the article up. I'm going to blame you. There's a book
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.880]  on tape of it. I mean I couldn't play it on air. I know TV stations would cancel us if
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:03.040]  I did and you're damn right it's obscene. It's in elementary and middle school and high
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:14.200]  school right now. What's the name of the book? Pull it up for everyone. Beyond magenta. Yeah
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:19.120]  let's put an article up for folks. You want to play some excerpts for you? The 10 year
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:24.080]  old talks about the man asking to get in the truck with him and then the man sucks him
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:27.640]  off and you're like oh don't talk about it. Yeah yeah oh I know adult radio let's not
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:33.920]  talk about it. Beyond magenta. Transgender team speak. It's not transgender. It's children
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:43.280]  being molested. God help us. In fact I'm having an anxiety attack because I've got four children
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:52.800]  and this is sick. All right let's stop right there. Evil is coming out ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:57.520]  and we're going to have to oppose it and speak out against it. They know they're triggering
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:02.880]  the mass shootings by promoting all this. They know they're putting people on drugs that
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:08.440]  cause inhibition to disappear and make them commit mass murder. Shrimp as I covered believe
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:15.480]  me. You can look it up. Shrimp commits suicide when a little bit of Prozac runs off in the
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:19.200]  water. So do fish. They go out and attack fish 10 times their size. Shrimps are trying
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:25.560]  to murder birds. Hundreds of shrimp will just come out and attack birds and the birds just
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:30.000]  start eating them. Type in. There it is. Shrimp on Prozac commits suicide. You cannot make
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.800]  this up. The toll free number to join us. We'll take a few calls on the gun grab. Why
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:40.320]  do you think the Democrats are out in the open admitting they want to take the guns?
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:43.520]  Try to trigger a civil war. What do you think about that? What do you think they're going
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:53.320]  to pull next? They're obviously super desperate. 877-789-Alex. 877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex. I'll
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:58.520]  have time to take five, six, seven calls in the next segments. I just want to focus
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:05.520]  on that. But it doesn't matter what government you've got, what institution you've got, what
[1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:10.320]  system you've got. It's a fight between good and evil. It doesn't matter if it's the Protestant
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:14.680]  church or the Catholic church. It doesn't matter whether it's the Boy Scouts of America
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:21.040]  or the high school or junior high or elementary or the Girl Scouts. Evil is taking it all
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:25.920]  over. I mean, I remember three years ago, they had the Boy Scout Jamboree and they said
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:31.560]  they handed out 10,000 condoms to children as young as seven years old and said, it's
[1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:36.960]  normal, go in the tent and have men have sex with you. And kids got HIV, they got hepatitis
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:43.880]  and now the Boy Scouts is going bankrupt. Another institution destroyed. They destroyed
[1:27:43.880 --> 1:27:49.320]  everything. It's a pedophile cult and once they've abused a child, the child will then
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:55.080]  be part of the cult in many cases. About half the time because they think that's normal.
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:28:01.280]  They think sex with children is what men do. And I think how arrested it is. You look
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:05.360]  at these pedophiles, how sick and weak and gross they are because they never learned to
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:11.840]  go out and get a woman. They never learned to go out and get in a fist fight because
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:17.760]  the other guy, one of the girl, normal mammal behavior, all of that's being extincted. And
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:26.600]  all I can say is, thank God I was alive and young. Still, when the police took a blind
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:31.640]  eye, I remember 14, 15 beating the living hell out of each other. And I mean, I got
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:37.600]  to still live to be a man and activate all my instincts. If they keep you from activating
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:42.920]  instincts, then it doesn't activate all your other systems. That's why you need those rights
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:47.760]  and passage. We need to develop systems to get people back in the position for basic
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:52.320]  hand-to-hand combat because that triggers everything else that comes, including increased
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:29:02.440]  IQ. As I said here, recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:08.760]  to that tragic event 18 years ago, it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:15.120]  have the fire department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:22.400]  and confirm that bombs were in tower one, tower two, and of course, building seven.
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:27.440]  And the then FBI director, Robert Mueller, helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:33.320]  and to know that there's a deep state group working within our government with radical
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:38.560]  Islam who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.880]  while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the planet. Well, 18 years later,
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:48.560]  I'm here to tell you that the world is awake in the 9-11, and info wars and our researchers
[1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:53.400]  and our guests, our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again. That's why infowars.com
[1:29:53.400 --> 1:30:01.000]  is more important than ever. Super silver wound shell is a private label
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.760]  from the top company in the U.S. that has their products in hospitals and is sold over
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:08.720]  the counter and approved for that by the FDA. We have been blessed with their listeners
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:12.760]  and let us private label it in the last two years. It's been a bestseller. We convinced
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:18.460]  them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams
[1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:23.320]  that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology
[1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:29.080]  in it. It's got the hyaluronic acid. It's got the steric acid. It's got the grapefruit
[1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:35.280]  essential oil. It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more. It's in two sizes, super
[1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:40.360]  silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one. You're not going to find a product
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:43.880]  that's good anywhere. You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds
[1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:50.680]  the info war at infowarslife.com. Get your super silver skin cream today. We can only
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:56.560]  run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[1:30:56.560 --> 1:31:00.520]  There are a few things in this universe that are assured of that but I'm here to tell you

[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:37.880]  the active enzyme or system in the plant. Originally obviously from India. Well, body's

[1:31:55.360 --> 1:32:00.440]  We sold Secret 12 for 4 years and it was our number 3rd best seller. We had to discontinue
[1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:05.000]  it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it. That new formula

[1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:23.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:41.000]  live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, live from
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:34:04.680]  Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:07.280]  live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin,
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:11.920]  So, I mentioned this, but I thought I'd play the clip.
[1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:20.320]  All the Democrats say they want to confiscate any semi-autos, but Beto says it in a particularly
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:21.320]  psychotic way.
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.040]  Hell, yes, we're going to get your guns.
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:25.240]  They're designed to kill people.
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:26.320]  That's the whole point.
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:31.280]  They're designed, if someone's trying to kill you, to kill them.
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:34.280]  It's an am and object.
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:42.040]  Comprende, but he knows exactly what he's doing and when the ABC anchor asked him the
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:46.800]  question, that had its own propaganda and he goes, I played it already a couple of times
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:47.800]  last week.
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:48.800]  I'm going to play it now.
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:49.800]  You all saw it.
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:53.280]  The ABC anchor goes, a lot of people claim that if you have a buyback and take the guns
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:59.720]  forcibly, that's confiscation, but it's not really, is it?
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:04.680]  And oh, that's a piece I forgot to get to.
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.640]  I shot that yesterday and I don't think I even told Drew to give that to you guys.
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:12.720]  I did tell him to post it to infowars.com, see if that's posted yet.
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:15.720]  Fox News endorsed national gun confiscation.
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:20.600]  I was in the break room yesterday up here shooting reports, up for seven days a week
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:21.600]  now.
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:27.520]  Things are so serious and it's on Fox and they're promoting it and then I come back
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:30.800]  an hour later and it was on.
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:32.920]  So that report's going to go up on infowars.com.
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:37.240]  If it isn't already up there, the headline for it, get Jamie to post it.
[1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:40.840]  It's not up, please.
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:41.840]  There it is.
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:43.800]  Fox News endorses national gun confiscation.
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:45.800]  Gosh, I meant to leave with that.
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:46.800]  Good Lord.
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:52.440]  I mean, it's getting bad, folks, but they, well, it's not really confiscation if they
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:55.200]  just make you turn them in and they buy them back.
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:56.200]  What?
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.080]  I mean, everything is seeing how they can lie to you and watching little chipmunk dude
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:02.080]  on there.
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:03.080]  Yeah.
[1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:07.360]  And I saw two different Fox shows pushing it because they're told do that unless you're
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:10.880]  Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingram.
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:16.920]  You're told what to say on Fox and let me tell you, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:20.000]  are inches from being fired inches.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:21.360]  They're called in their chewed out.
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:24.080]  I mean, Fox is like 90% leftist.
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:25.080]  Okay.
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:26.080]  I know that work there.
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:27.080]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:31.320]  I know some of the big posts, I'll leave it at that, obviously.
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:33.040]  Talk to them all the time.
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:36.280]  And that's what's going on.
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:39.800]  They're like, go ahead and fire me then.
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:40.800]  That's the point.
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:45.160]  So when Trump says something's going on over at Fox, that video is at newswars.com.
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:46.160]  You should share it from there.
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:49.440]  That, you know, they censor in full force, we try to share it, but news wars is easier
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:52.600]  to share on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, but just get it out there.
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  This is crazy.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:57.720]  We just want to put it out there that, oh, yeah, take the guns, no big deal.
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:36:58.720]  On Fox.
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:36:59.720]  And we're not supposed to challenge it.
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:01.240]  That's what they want all of us off the air.
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:06.120]  So real patriots, real nationalists, real conservatives aren't on air to challenge all
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  this.
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:08.120]  There it is.
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:09.720]  Fox News endorses national gun confiscation.
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:10.720]  Incredible.
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:11.720]  We're going to play that in a moment, too.
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:13.120]  But first, here's Beto O'Rourke.
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:14.120]  Hell, yes.
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:15.120]  We're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:23.400]  We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:27.400]  And so let's play that report, then I'll come back and take all the calls that are on hold.
[1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:30.360]  But here's Fox, basically endorsing this.
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:33.880]  And I literally shot it off the TV in the break room, and then they added some documents.
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  Here it is.
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:41.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see it, Fox News promoting national gun confiscation.
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:45.320]  The system is really making its move right now.
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:49.160]  Stay tuned for this vital report and spread it, because the First Amendment defends the
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:57.800]  Second, and the Second defends all the rest.
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.280]  Let me read you some polls here at Fox News that we have on this issue, and it shows,
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.880]  in some ways, the other side around, requiring background checks on all gun buyers.
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:12.760]  I mean, there's overwhelming support, 89% support that.
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:17.200]  A law requiring that police take guns away from someone, a judge rules a threat to so-called
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:19.280]  red flag laws.
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:22.920]  Overwhelming numbers of Americans support that, 86%.
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:26.440]  That's not what the red flags are, but judge rules, the person's made a threat.
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:28.320]  That's a terrorist threat, that's criminal.
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:33.320]  This allows bureaucracies and this new harpa thing, run by big tech and psychiatrists,
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:38.800]  to just say they listened to you in your house over your Google Assist or your Nest.
[1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:43.760]  So see how they make it all sound reasonable, hey, I'm a judge, you're an old, sure a judge,
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:46.120]  see it's all deception.
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:51.840]  Can you even talk about a mandatory federal government assault weapons buyback plan that
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:55.520]  was caused so much controversy when Beto O'Rourke mentioned it at the debate?
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:58.560]  Look, more than half support that.
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:02.480]  What are you hearing on the ground in Iowa, how this is?
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:06.000]  This is Fox News, most of their shows are like this now.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:11.440]  Washington Post polls, everybody wants to turn their guns in, horse manure.
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:16.280]  Parents want convicted pedophiles to read drag queen story time as well.
[1:39:16.280 --> 1:39:19.360]  And fluoride's good for you, even though it gives you cancer.
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:23.200]  She resonates with the people there who will vote in that important caucus.
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:28.800]  Sure, you know, it's fascinating, even though nationally a lot of these policies have wide
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:33.520]  support in Iowa, I've heard from Democrats that they saw that moment by Beto O'Rourke
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:38.440]  as potentially a problem for them, again, heading into next November's elections.
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:44.440]  That's because they know the polls sample 15% more Democrats bare minimum and call people
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.400]  that they know are going to give them that answer.
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:47.400]  They're fake.
[1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:48.400]  Remember the last election?
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:53.360]  Right now, Democrats are fighting for control of the House and Senate in the state legislature
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:56.480]  and they've got a big U.S. Senate seat up next fall.
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:00.760]  And I've heard from a number of Democrats that they're concerned being painted as an
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:04.960]  anti-second amendment party being painted as the party that wants to grab your guns
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:06.360]  will hurt.
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:12.720]  Being painted, when they ask Beto the question, they go, people claim you want to confiscate
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:14.720]  but taking them isn't confiscating.
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:17.120]  Again, this is upside down world.
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:21.480]  In some more conservative parts of the state, just the other day, I spoke with a Democrat
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:26.800]  that lost in 2018 and he said that he thinks policies like Beto O'Rourke's proposal will
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.840]  make rural areas of the state more red.
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:33.920]  And O'Rourke, as we've reported, walking that back a bit in terms of it being a buyback
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:37.960]  program, it seems the majority of Americans do support it.
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:43.280]  It's not a buyback, it's a forcible confiscation, we'll play that in a minute.
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:46.800]  These people lie so much, it's just insane.
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:50.880]  Focus is not just on Congress because it's been gridlocked there.
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:55.600]  But Mom's Demand Action, the group that has been fighting for gun control and other gun
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:00.280]  measures, they have been focusing on state and local legislatures and they've gotten
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:01.280]  a lot of progress.
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:07.640]  And it was, who appeared earlier on MSNBC, talking about that progress.
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:09.960]  We have passed background checks now in 2018.
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:10.960]  So there you go.
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:11.960]  It was.
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:15.200]  Yeah, there's already background checks, they wouldn't have stopped any of the shootings.
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.480]  Most of the shooters tell people they're going to shoot people, nothing's down, they're
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:19.360]  almost all anti for devil worshipers.
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:24.200]  The drugs inserts, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors admit it's causing mass shootings.
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:27.320]  Media hyping mass shootings has proven and actually triggered it in the major studies.
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:31.720]  We're going to show you all those facts, but they don't want us to get the information
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:32.720]  out.
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:33.720]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:34.720]  That's right.
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:35.720]  The same big Bert Ruhm's dog.
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:36.720]  We got banned off Twitter.
[1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:37.720]  Remember that last year?
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:42.360]  These people are taking your First Amendment as well, but they can't stop all the people's
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:43.360]  friend, the word.
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:47.680]  They can't stop the people from telling folks that freedom lives in inforwars.com for a
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:57.320]  first life show in band.video Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists want to take us
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:41:58.320]  off the air.
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:02.440]  They're trying as hard as they can around the clock that you can trump them.
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:09.560]  You have the ace of spades, your word of mouth, taking action and buying the products.
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.240]  Everybody needs fish oil and krill oil.
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:15.840]  What it does for your body, your brain, your focus, your clarity, you talk about an atropic,
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:19.840]  you talk about something that makes you happy, you talk about the, I mean, I religiously

[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:02.720]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:05.520]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:10.200]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:14.960]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:17.560]  for their organs to be harvested.
[1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:23.320]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com 15 years ago that Google
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:28.080]  was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds and
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:31.680]  hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:36.120]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy,
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:39.400]  that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese.
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:44.280]  On every one of these issues and many others, we've been dead on and we've raised the
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:45.760]  alarm on the planetary scale.
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:51.080]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:53.080]  than ever to support the info war.
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:59.760]  Please support the info war however you can.
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:24.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:25.080]  Welcome back.

[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.400]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, don't share banned.video.
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:47.840]  That might make the globalist upset to what they say and just shut up and crawl and die
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:48.840]  banned.video.
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:54.800]  Okay, let's go to Dylan in Colorado and we're taking calls on the Democrats unanimously
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:58.080]  banned the semi-autos confiscate them.
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:01.120]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s and everything else.
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:03.480]  Why do you think they're throwing the gauntlet down?
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:09.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievably ridiculous.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:15.440]  I think the fact that they, it seems like they were sucking up to Beto so much everybody
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:21.840]  thanking him for for what he was doing and you know how he he smiled during that little
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:27.480]  you know he's so disgusting and disingenuous it was it was gross and I think they're sucking
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:33.480]  up to him to maybe get him as a vice presidential candidate and you know honestly he can come
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:38.080]  take my guns but I'm going to give him my ammunition first and that's you know well
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.360]  state rep said that and now Beto wants his guns taken Beto says it's a threat.
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:50.000]  Exactly it's it's unbelievable and you know if I could just say you know I don't think
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:57.160]  you guys are are tomorrow's news today you're 10 years news today because I remember you
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:49:04.280]  saying it was it was 2009 in August and I remember you saying that they were going to
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:10.600]  split Afghanistan into pieces and what did Biden say during the debate he said well we
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:17.360]  can't put Afghanistan back together we can't get out we have to split it into pieces.
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:22.760]  That's right because that's what the CFR wants it's not a crystal ball the globalists want
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:26.040]  to have warring factions there divide and conquer and they want to give China a piece
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:30.200]  of it so Biden's bought and paid for by the Chai Comm so that's the Chai Comm plan they
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:34.800]  want a large part of the east and let Pakistan have the rest maybe let Iran have a piece
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:37.360]  of it that's just that's just carbon the world up.
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:42.240]  Thank you so much appreciate the call Dylan it's not hard to predict their following policies
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:45.840]  and Trump's tearing them all up and I think it's a good thing and the Afghans just said
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:50.280]  they can fight us a hundred more years great we've been there 19 18 let's let's go let's
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:55.840]  go spend a trillion dollars let's let them kill themselves unbelievable but we're there
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:59.640]  for the chai comms they've spent zero on security and have taken out hundreds of billions of
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:03.680]  dollars or worse minerals we do the security for the chai comms we built their whole damn
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:09.400]  thing that's coming to an end and all the little people on the Chinese Communist Tata
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:18.080]  Mamre Gland are whining and bitching there's up next year extra extra in Washington extra
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:24.920]  you're on the air welcome hi yeah a couple things you know the Democrats talking about
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:31.320]  you know these forced buybacks confiscation all this it's really just the political end
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:38.440]  to the whole situation left or right I really wish you would get back to your old ways talking
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:42.440]  about the left right paradigm Trump is not a friend of the second amendment he's done
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:47.040]  so much damage on it already I could go through seven bullet points of law go ahead put into
[1:50:47.040 --> 1:50:53.320]  place alone and second of all I just want to make a point here the government is a paper
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:58.840]  tiger we the people have no reason to fear them there's a video on YouTube by the channel
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:05.320]  named John Mark Civil War two in America who would win we would win against our government
[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:09.000]  in every single possible scenario but not if we're having a race war in the middle of
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:13.200]  it we don't need to have a war with the government if it's a constitutional government that helps
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:18.760]  protect the guarantor of our rights I mean you want to get his name and number because
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:22.720]  I'll have you on for 10 minutes sometime the next few days to have a real discussion with
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:26.320]  you on that since you kind of disagree with me I want to hear your seven points I want
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:31.360]  to talk about what you're discussing it's because again the chai comms the globalists
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:34.320]  are trying to cause a civil war in this country right now because we're trying to get our
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:38.760]  nation back I appreciate your call get his name and number if he wants to come on remind

[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:08.760]  doing their big bands and stuff but the Democrats the reason they're pushing for it they're
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:12.760]  just putting all their cars on the table they've been threatening for years they really got
[1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:16.880]  much left to offer this is their big thread I guess they're gonna push this is gonna be
[1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:21.240]  their big push the borders say the nation doesn't deserve to exist and that's what the left
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:25.400]  pushing everywhere revolution we can beat the government let's overthrow it they are the
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:29.840]  big government group they love the chai comm funded government but now that Trump's turning
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:35.040]  all the leftist garbage off and pulling out of the UN treaties oh Trump's bad he wants
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:40.160]  your guns and look he may get hooked winked into some of that my god that's what we've
[1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:44.960]  got to be in there keeping him honest hey I'm gonna give Trump I'm gonna give him some
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:51.480]  time see what he does I'm for Trump 100% the gun red flag laws I'm gonna see how he backed
[1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:55.440]  off of that he backed off of that but but they are proposing it's confirmed again people
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:53:01.600]  didn't believe us a week ago that his administration is looking at the computers in your house
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:07.320]  listening to you the assistance and then reporting back microaggressions and then an algorithm
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:12.160]  written by leftist psychiatrists takes your guns if Trump endorses that he's become Hillary
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:15.840]  Clinton this I mean it kills you process everything God bless you Charles great points
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:21.800]  let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Michigan Alex you're on the air worldwide thanks for
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:29.040]  taking my call Alex the globalist clowns want to trigger the taking of our guns with
[1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:34.240]  movies like the new Joker movie in it too and remember a few years ago there was these
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:43.000]  clown attacks and the woods and if you your crew could look up big pharma Pfizer dumping
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:48.200]  polluting the water nationwide so what does the Joker do he poisons water and then he'll
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:52.560]  sell you a cosmetic or something that then kills you with it but then he has the antidote
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.160]  because it kills you slowly that's what they're doing and they're telling you we're clowns
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:02.640]  we're psychic vampires we're the Joker and this movie is all a worship of the left rising
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:07.080]  up and having a revolution in the package of angry white males it's just sick and they
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.040]  call it original I've already read the synopsis it's a joke I've got a special report coming
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:16.880]  out on Wednesday a sneak peek of this new Joker film yeah it's interesting what they
[1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:21.600]  do in the Batman movies to remember Batman Begins which was cool I thought with the ninjas
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:26.120]  and stuff but the scarecrow was polluting the water in that movie with stuff to make
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:32.440]  everybody afraid member one of the Batman's a few years ago where they use the cell phones
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:38.720]  to listen to everybody but also send out sonar and find the Joker that's real the cell phones
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:43.440]  can send out radiation bursts that look through up to like massive brick walls you name it
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.920]  so to the connect systems all the video games that quote look at your movement it's actually
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:53.440]  sonar radar blasting through back to the chip looking through your walls so it's not just
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:58.840]  a camera like connects had that in your house for 10 years looking through your walls yeah
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:03.120]  yeah roller for TV viewers so connect was already doing this when this Batman movie
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:08.280]  came out a few years later yeah also in the sequel to that the dark night rises I thought
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:13.440]  it was interesting bane coming in with the underground bases to attack everybody without
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:19.560]  like a sneak attack underground with all these underground bases you on musk is building
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:25.800]  in DARPA that's exactly it Alex call me back great points Matthew in California you're
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:34.280]  on the air go ahead founder warned us many many years ago that when our government becomes
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:41.960]  too big and too tyrannical it is our duty to defend and protect against them and to eliminate
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:48.880]  them they're talking about yes we're coming for your AR 15 yes we're coming for your gun
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:56.080]  now we have ammo restrictions we can't buy unless they track us at every movement I think
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:03.560]  there's lots of people here that are figuring out ways of getting our ammo without government
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:09.480]  spying on it well you're absolutely right my friend and it just it just happens over
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:15.360]  and over again we'll add it in post you know we're a live radio and TV show right now and
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:18.240]  I've been wanting to play this for a few weeks but I'm gonna play the part from the Batman
[1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:22.920]  movie which one was it where they use the cell phone radar that they actually have it's patented
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:27.360]  and they're doing it yeah right there that's really what it looks like because MIT 10 years
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:32.160]  ago was showing the connect system through your walls exactly the same that's it and
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:38.080]  they just rub it your face my god I appreciate your calling else Matthew coming out with
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:44.720]  a sonar paying against all the other iPhone gather new iPhones watch you and scans for
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:50.320]  everything it's 10 times worse it's an arms race towards our destruction Jim propaganda

[1:56:56.840 --> 1:57:03.960]  host that was speaking earlier on your program this is not a democracy where two wolves in
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:09.720]  a sheep go vote on what's for dinner that's right you don't just get to decide to take
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:15.120]  all our rights and then you or you put us in forced labor camps because 51% say make
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:22.320]  this other group a slave that's exactly right that's why this country was founded God bless
