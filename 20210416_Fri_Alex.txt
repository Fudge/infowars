[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.640 --> 00:28.560]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones just months
[00:28.560 --> 00:34.520]  after hiring former Biden transition official Andrew Lorenzen straight Texas
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.640]  nonprofit family endeavors won a no-bid contract for as much as five hundred and
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.080]  thirty million dollars to provide care for the migrant children arriving at the
[00:44.080 --> 00:50.600]  U.S. border former ICE official and the country's first national migrant public
[00:50.600 --> 00:55.080]  advocate Lorenzen straight worked for Lutheran immigration and refugee
[00:55.080 --> 01:00.600]  service leers where he oversaw a national network of foster care for
[01:00.600 --> 01:05.280]  unaccompanied immigrant children which seems to be exactly what he is doing for
[01:05.280 --> 01:09.640]  endeavor through the McCallan respite center where thousands of unaccompanied
[01:09.640 --> 01:13.920]  illegal immigrant minors are being shipped off to cities across America each
[01:13.920 --> 01:19.880]  week to live with whoever signed up on their website family endeavors confirmed
[01:19.880 --> 01:24.400]  this they said the work is a continuation of services we have delivered to the
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.680]  migrant population since 2012 family endeavors recently hired Basil Moosley
[01:30.680 --> 01:35.160]  as their deputy director for migrant services who formerly worked for Sark
[01:35.160 --> 01:40.080]  the Syrian Arab Red Crescent who partnered with the United Nations and
[01:40.080 --> 01:47.320]  open border NGOs in the evacuation of Syrian refugees into Europe it seems
[01:47.320 --> 01:51.600]  the endless pipeline of immigrants coming into the U.S. through McCallan Texas
[01:51.600 --> 01:58.360]  are coming in as refugees and the amount of refugees we take in is decided by
[01:58.360 --> 02:03.800]  our senile puppet president our corrupt Congress and globalist government
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.440]  agencies who all seem to now be aligned with the United Nations and according to
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.520]  the United Nations replacement migration program the U.S. should have 593
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.680]  million so don't expect anything to be done about the endless import of these
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.320]  so-called refugees all coming in to receive years of taxpayer dollars from
[02:26.320 --> 02:31.240]  our broken welfare system it's all part of the plan to destroy the national
[02:31.240 --> 02:35.960]  sovereignty of Western nations and if you still have a survival instinct that
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.760]  causes you to question this then you are labeled a heartless right-wing bigot
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.240]  there is no more common sense Americans along with the rest of the modern
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.400]  Western world are being conquered by way of name-calling and tragically it's
[02:52.400 --> 02:58.160]  working for info wars.com this is Greg Rees
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.920]  when is the time
[03:07.040 --> 03:10.920]  when you're written statement you say now is not the time to pull back on
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.760]  masking physical distancing and avoiding congregate settings when is the time when
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.560]  do Americans get their freedom back can you put your microphone please
[03:20.560 --> 03:27.200]  right when we get the level of infection in this country low enough that it is not
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.280]  a really high what is low enough give me a number what I mean we have 15 days to
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.600]  slow the spread turned into one year of lost liberty what metrics what measures
[03:36.600 --> 03:42.360]  what has to happen before Americans get more freedoms my message Congressman
[03:42.360 --> 03:48.760]  Jordan is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as we possibly can to
[03:48.760 --> 03:54.920]  get the level of infection this country low that it is no longer a threat that
[03:54.920 --> 04:00.840]  is when and I believe when that happens you will see what determines when I'm
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.320]  sorry what what measure what I mean are we just going to continue this forever
[04:05.320 --> 04:08.840]  when does when does when do we get to the point what measure what standard what
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.520]  objective outcome do we have to reach before before Americans get their
[04:13.520 --> 04:18.480]  liberty and freedoms back you know I you're indicating liberty and freedom I
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.560]  look at it as a public health measure to prevent people from dying and going to
[04:22.560 --> 04:25.040]  the hospital you don't think Americans liberties have been threatened the last
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.920]  year dr. Fauci they've been assaulted their liberties have I don't look at this
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.160]  as a liberty thing congressman Jordan well that's obvious and it's all been
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.040]  done based on fraud everything about COVID has been alive because it's a great
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.400]  reset the liberties never come back there to be taken away forever this is the
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.560]  beginning of the organized extermination of humanity this isn't a joke it isn't a
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.000]  game I'm not being a chop chop this is a reality we'll break down the enemy's
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.080]  blueprint for total enslavement now to stop them straight ahead on our show
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.800]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[05:05.800 --> 05:11.280]  challenge first of all let me say I love your products I am a granny and for all
[05:11.280 --> 05:15.240]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like
[05:15.240 --> 05:20.040]  me I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.520]  since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[05:24.520 --> 05:30.640]  gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your
[05:30.640 --> 05:34.320]  other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.760]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[05:37.760 --> 05:42.360]  taking it me doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.760]  started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[05:46.760 --> 05:51.800]  wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put it on derma blend anymore you know
[05:51.800 --> 05:58.560]  so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[05:58.560 --> 06:07.840]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[06:07.840 --> 06:29.520]  well we were trending on sweater again yesterday all over the news they're
[06:29.520 --> 06:35.480]  reporting on animal human clones being made in laboratories expressly to grow
[06:35.480 --> 06:43.040]  humanoids to harvest organs now that's exactly what I began saying about 27
[06:43.040 --> 06:50.400]  years ago 26 years ago because at the time it was in major medical bio science
[06:50.400 --> 06:57.000]  publications that 20 plus years before that so we're talking 50 years ago now
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.800]  they'd already made animal human chimeris now they denied all of this in
[07:03.800 --> 07:07.160]  mainline publications until a few years ago and now they run the same headline
[07:07.160 --> 07:15.400]  every week for the first time animal human clones have been made that's
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.760]  always to it's in the test tube it's embryonic and that's just a condition
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.000]  condition condition condition the CIA was quoted in the Washington Post back
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.200]  in 1999 that oh we're funding the body modification and tattoo and earring
[07:30.200 --> 07:35.360]  movement doesn't mean it's bad or good or anything to get you ready for
[07:35.360 --> 07:40.160]  implantable chips I mean this is all actually in different publications they
[07:40.160 --> 07:45.120]  admit all of this everyone's freaking out and my phone's been blowing up going
[07:45.120 --> 07:51.120]  alex how did you know it's on ABC news it's on CBS news it's on NPR exactly what
[07:51.120 --> 07:55.760]  you said what you told Joe Rogan three years ago that it's for clones and then
[07:55.760 --> 08:03.320]  at the clones they're harvesting organs how do you know this because it's all
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.960]  in the medical literature they just have a breakaway civilizations let me tell
[08:08.960 --> 08:14.080]  you the headline for the show today it is that there is a scientific global
[08:14.080 --> 08:21.320]  dictatorship that is breaking away from humanity and that as it breaks away it
[08:21.320 --> 08:26.400]  extracts all the resources of the old civilization poisons us dumps us down
[08:26.400 --> 08:31.840]  divides us and conquers us puts us back into the jungle but the urban jungle and
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.360]  then wipes us out and by the time that they finally wipe everybody out which
[08:38.360 --> 08:43.040]  is coming very soon in it in a cascade of crises they orchestrate but poses the
[08:43.040 --> 08:49.520]  saviors those of us that haven't joined them it'll be very hard press for us to
[08:49.520 --> 08:55.680]  survive without joining them and those of us that haven't joined them will still
[08:55.680 --> 09:01.160]  only survive because the globalist killed everybody so we're not on their
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.360]  side but if you're able to to make the right moves and be prepared you might be
[09:07.360 --> 09:16.360]  able to survive and not join them but I think God isn't gonna like that God
[09:16.360 --> 09:22.040]  doesn't like coward so I think it's not just surviving we have to stop this
[09:22.040 --> 09:31.120]  thing from happening and we have to admit how much trouble we're in we have to
[09:31.120 --> 09:36.520]  admit this is not a joke this is not a game it's our only hope we have to reach
[09:36.520 --> 09:42.400]  out to people that work in the scientific dictatorship the minions most of
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.240]  which have already been let in on a lot of facets of it but still actually think
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.360]  it's for a greater good they have to be decompartmentalized to understand really
[09:50.360 --> 09:54.640]  how horrible this is so they can have a chance to make the right decision and
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.600]  join us in the resistance and I can tell you the globalists have major turnover
[09:58.600 --> 10:04.680]  with their higher level people because they really understand even once they
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.280]  have all the money in the power that it's empty and if they haven't totally
[10:08.280 --> 10:16.760]  turned their souls over to the spirit of destruction they then turn against it but
[10:16.760 --> 10:21.080]  then those people don't have a voice they get shut down or they get killed
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.320]  you know if you've ever worked for the New World Order and ever signed the
[10:25.320 --> 10:29.320]  contracts with them and ever actually run their operations then they will kill
[10:29.320 --> 10:35.560]  you if you sidestep them or don't don't follow their orders or ever try to leave
[10:35.560 --> 10:41.920]  them but if you've never sold out to them it's its metaphysical rules they'll
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.400]  just try to get other people to kill you but they won't give the order
[10:44.400 --> 10:49.000]  themselves or they will try to kill your name or discredit you or put you in
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.680]  prison but they they don't often kill you unless you've been involved with them
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.280]  and made some deal with them at some level and that's why I've never made
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.520]  any deals with these guys because believe me they've given me plenty of
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.600]  chances to join them and I could be right up there at the top with them but no
[11:07.600 --> 11:13.240]  amount of the money the prestige the immunity for prosecution no amount of
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.760]  that can get me to sign on to them with them but that's what's so frustrating
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.240]  about having a debate about whether this is real or not everything I talk about
[11:22.240 --> 11:27.120]  is as real as the Sun coming up it's clear as day it's a it's a breakaway
[11:27.120 --> 11:33.400]  civilization technology is 40 to 50 years ahead of what they're showing
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.640]  everything you see is 40 to 50 years old human animal clones are 50 years old
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.400]  in the literature at least hell the Nazis by 45 were already able to clone
[11:44.400 --> 11:53.000]  rabbits and so the space shuttle plans are from 1937 it wasn't in service till
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.160]  1980 the SR 71 Blackbird they say is the fastest plane in service in 1956
[11:58.160 --> 12:04.680]  and those like Mach 3 and a half they say it really goes back Mach 8 but that's
[12:04.680 --> 12:14.720]  the reality of this and and again I have personally known people that did work
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.320]  some on the fringes of the deep state the real deep state scientific state and
[12:19.320 --> 12:28.040]  it was cyborgs and clones 40 years ago major industrial level cyborgs clones
[12:28.040 --> 12:33.280]  you know that's what Jeffrey Epstein was not just doing sex and pedophile stuff
[12:33.280 --> 12:41.240]  and compromising people he was producing clone carriers at the Zorro ranch and I
[12:41.240 --> 12:46.600]  have that from a lot of good sources and I can also connect separate dots because
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.720]  you still they have still have trouble making a clone in a artificial womb if
[12:51.720 --> 12:56.240]  they don't grow up right they don't grow up healthy you need to have someone
[12:56.240 --> 12:59.480]  artificially inseminated which they were doing out there to women saying that was
[12:59.480 --> 13:04.600]  Jeffrey Epstein's children was not Jeffrey Epstein's children what they were
[13:04.600 --> 13:09.440]  doing was inseminating them with basically top globalist clones royal
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.240]  family clones Bill Gates clones and so he was running a clone ranch and then
[13:14.240 --> 13:17.800]  they take the children they raise them under another identity and they're
[13:17.800 --> 13:26.680]  there for spare parts in case Gates wants them and they're also there to do
[13:26.680 --> 13:30.360]  other studies and other tests you know in case something happens to the original
[13:30.360 --> 13:36.680]  they haven't gotten the immortality yet but all of this is a giant race to get
[13:36.680 --> 13:40.720]  what they believe is immortality so that's the holy grail of this and then
[13:40.720 --> 13:48.880]  all of us are to be tested on with mass mutinogenics to give rise to the other
[13:48.880 --> 13:53.560]  mutations they believe they're gonna find that will then allow the ultra rich to
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.240]  not die so that's what all this is and that's just one cloning base and again
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.200]  they hide the clones in plain view that you they tell the women you're gonna be
[14:01.200 --> 14:08.000]  artificially inseminated with Jeffrey Epstein sperm well they mean the women
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.600]  and importantly hundreds of children out of that alone and then of course these
[14:11.600 --> 14:18.560]  children don't look anything like Jeffrey Epstein they're their clones of rich
[14:18.560 --> 14:23.960]  billionaires and royalty mainly and again that the children are then raised
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.680]  and brought up in in the world it's not like the island that's that's a good
[14:28.680 --> 14:33.480]  allegory of this made in the 2006 excellent film where they have clones
[14:33.480 --> 14:35.880]  in an underground base who think that the world's been hit with a virus so
[14:35.880 --> 14:38.560]  they're safe in the base and then when they win the lottery they go to the
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.680]  island but really the other person that bought them is about to have them
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.720]  executed so they can you know have their have their organs but you know and the
[14:46.720 --> 14:50.560]  person doing it is who they are there they're a clone of that but again the
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.080]  organism doesn't thrive if it's not living and exercising and the clones
[14:56.080 --> 14:59.560]  actually take care of the embryonic clones but don't even know it they're all
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.520]  compartmentalized it's part of their job in the facility and that's a great
[15:03.520 --> 15:06.960]  example of compartmentalization how we are seen as the public is biological
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.280]  robots but the globalist we are building our own disruption our own
[15:10.280 --> 15:13.720]  enslavement as well and so if you don't have full awakening to this if
[15:13.720 --> 15:17.400]  Congress doesn't the intelligence agencies don't people's about army
[15:17.400 --> 15:21.000]  intelligence or the military intelligence they don't know any of this
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.720]  they're not let in on any of it this two stuff at the highest level is military
[15:25.720 --> 15:29.320]  intelligence that's totally compartmentalized to our cake weapons
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.800]  atomic weapons are 120 years old they had all the equations are 120 plus years
[15:33.800 --> 15:39.400]  ago that's all tinker toy stuff that's all that's all that's being phased out
[15:39.400 --> 15:42.000]  they're getting rid of the human military by 2030 there really won't be
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.520]  many humans left in the military and they have all these Hollywood movies about
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.160]  super soldiers these really cool badass guys and you know like the new movie
[15:49.160 --> 15:53.400]  nobody you know he's so tough none of that exists it's all gone it's all over
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.520]  it's all robots it's all clowns actually bought this it blocks UHF frequencies
[15:59.520 --> 16:04.600]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us not
[16:04.600 --> 16:10.000]  just tracking and recording our GPS location but recording audio and video

[17:58.000 --> 18:14.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:28.360 --> 18:33.960]  you know I'm gonna stay
[18:33.960 --> 18:42.960]  I'm on a catalog for your dreaming, I touch you with a cane.
[18:42.960 --> 19:03.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I am your host, Alexander M. McJones.
[19:03.960 --> 19:07.960]  Very honored and blessed to be here.
[19:07.960 --> 19:12.960]  Globalists need another crisis in America as their reset agenda fails.
[19:12.960 --> 19:18.960]  Brandon Smith, alt markets a great thinker, but I don't agree with the analysis of this article.
[19:18.960 --> 19:23.960]  And I don't read that to like put them down and say I'm the big swing and Johnson on this.
[19:23.960 --> 19:27.960]  His information is dead on, but his perspective is wrong.
[19:27.960 --> 19:30.960]  They were never going to take over just with the COVID virus.
[19:30.960 --> 19:35.960]  It is a five pronged attack, at least with many subgroupings in each one.
[19:35.960 --> 19:39.960]  I'll tell you about that coming up the start of the next hour.
[19:39.960 --> 19:41.960]  That's up on info wars.com.
[19:41.960 --> 19:50.960]  Also Pope Francis, those full communists sharing prosperity is not communism, but pure Christianity, but they're going to direct how you share.
[19:50.960 --> 19:55.960]  And of course, all the big bankers pay no tax until lecture you all day.
[19:55.960 --> 20:00.960]  And more on the next piece of the crisis they're going to launch when we start the next hour.
[20:00.960 --> 20:16.960]  I really want to get to the fireworks though in and around the heart of the globalist takeover and the main prong being the medical charity that brings in the medical world ID that brings in the permanent lockdown that brings in the non essential than the other four prongs come in on.
[20:16.960 --> 20:22.960]  And what's happened with Jim Jordan and Mad Maxine telling him shut your mouth.
[20:22.960 --> 20:25.960]  You don't talk to Lord Fauci like that.
[20:25.960 --> 20:30.960]  And then you also have Chelsea Clinton, who famously called for me to be the platform.
[20:30.960 --> 20:33.960]  She said he should be taken off Facebook, Twitter, Google, everything.
[20:33.960 --> 20:38.960]  And boy, when she clicked her little heels running her big child kidnapping operation for her mommy.
[20:38.960 --> 20:40.960]  That all came out with your legs.
[20:40.960 --> 20:45.960]  They took me off because she is the paragon of power and goodliness and holiness.
[20:45.960 --> 20:56.960]  Well, now she wants Tucker Carlson off saying he's incredibly dangerous for asking a question. If the vaccine safe and effective and like 99% like they say and they said once you got it, you could go back to normal.
[20:56.960 --> 21:05.960]  Why are you now saying it and you never go back to normal because they were always planning to not let anybody go back to normal.
[21:05.960 --> 21:09.960]  What, you know, again, I don't tell the story to act like my crew is not smart.
[21:09.960 --> 21:13.960]  They're great people, but they're not diabolical globalist and so they don't think like them.
[21:13.960 --> 21:17.960]  I do. And we're sitting in there with the lockdowns going on.
[21:17.960 --> 21:23.960]  And I go, you know, this is never going to end and they're going to release a little bit of it and tighten it back down or release tighten back down.
[21:23.960 --> 21:27.960]  Because that's the plan, folks, it's never going away.
[21:27.960 --> 21:38.960]  So we keep addressing it at face value and Fauci won't say to Congress won't say to CNN won't say to Fox News about when we get our liberties back because you never get them back.
[21:38.960 --> 21:41.960]  It's in all the great reset documents.
[21:41.960 --> 21:48.960]  And so Webster Hubble's Mr. Ed horse is a horse, of course, of course, Chelsea.
[21:48.960 --> 21:54.960]  Runs the global initiative now and and has the contract for I forget what it is like just the administering.
[21:54.960 --> 21:56.960]  It's like $29 million.
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.960]  I saw another document when they finally fund it fully for the next pandemic that Biden says is imminent.
[22:01.960 --> 22:11.960]  It's going to be billions and billions and billions for contact tracers that the Clinton global initiative will run in America.
[22:11.960 --> 22:12.960]  Did you hear me?
[22:12.960 --> 22:15.960]  The people coming to your house to take you away and make you take shots.
[22:15.960 --> 22:21.960]  It's already started in California that they're under her command.
[22:21.960 --> 22:25.960]  And she doesn't want Tucker up there going, hey, we never take the mask off.
[22:25.960 --> 22:27.960]  We never leave our houses.
[22:27.960 --> 22:31.960]  Because Fauci wants lockdowns again.
[22:31.960 --> 22:39.960]  And understand anywhere they've got control in a public that's going along with it, like Germany or England or Australia, you notice the lockdowns never stop.
[22:39.960 --> 22:40.960]  Oh, New Zealand.
[22:40.960 --> 22:43.960]  I'm talking to a nice lady from New Zealand.
[22:43.960 --> 22:48.960]  She was giving me a massage and she's like, oh, yeah, but you know, we did a total lockdown, but now we don't have to wear a mask.
[22:48.960 --> 22:52.960]  And I said, within two months, there'll be a new case and it'll lock down again.
[22:52.960 --> 22:53.960]  And she goes, you know, you're right.
[22:53.960 --> 22:54.960]  It happened two months later.
[22:54.960 --> 22:55.960]  She was, how'd you know two months?
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.960]  I just said, I just, you said two months, just dead reckoning, but six months, one month.
[23:00.960 --> 23:04.960]  Look, they just announced the end of lockdowns in England last week.
[23:04.960 --> 23:06.960]  And I said, within a week, they'll announce a new lockdown.
[23:06.960 --> 23:12.960]  It was exactly one week because they want to take it away from you instantly.
[23:12.960 --> 23:14.960]  They want to jerk you around.
[23:14.960 --> 23:18.960]  You're in a cult now.
[23:18.960 --> 23:19.960]  And so that's how they operate.
[23:19.960 --> 23:20.960]  We're going to be getting to all that.
[23:20.960 --> 23:24.960]  I mean, you've got all these countries that have stopped the Pfizer shot, all these companies that have stopped the AstraZeneca,
[23:24.960 --> 23:26.960]  all these ones that have stopped J&J.
[23:26.960 --> 23:28.960]  You've got all these deaths, not one death.
[23:28.960 --> 23:29.960]  Look, a one woman died.
[23:29.960 --> 23:32.960]  You actually go look at the reporting system.
[23:32.960 --> 23:35.960]  It's like 3,000 here, 2,000 there, 5,000 there.
[23:35.960 --> 23:37.960]  They estimate between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100.
[23:37.960 --> 23:39.960]  They're not sure it varies.
[23:39.960 --> 23:45.960]  Country to country are actually reporting the deaths as COVID, but it is COVID vaccine killing them.
[23:45.960 --> 23:53.960]  And so, oh, Norway is going to totally stop the newest country, the AstraZeneca, completely.
[23:53.960 --> 23:57.960]  But oh my gosh, the infection rate is at record high, but not the death rate.
[23:57.960 --> 24:03.960]  But see, now as they put more PCR machines around the world with you and grants, they're calling most deaths COVID,
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.960]  even if it's a car wreck because they want the money.
[24:07.960 --> 24:12.960]  Because globally, the companies are paid, the medical companies more when that happens.
[24:12.960 --> 24:15.960]  We're going to look at all of that coming up today.
[24:15.960 --> 24:20.960]  Robert Barnes is going to be looking at the insane Chauvin trial up in Minnesota.
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.960]  And when he thinks that's going to end, and no doubt, every major city is going to be lit up like a Christmas tree.
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.960]  And they're not the type you put cookies and milk out for Santa for.
[24:29.960 --> 24:31.960]  It's going to be lit up with fire.
[24:31.960 --> 24:33.960]  And why are the communists doing this?
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.960]  It's part of the takeover of the police.
[24:35.960 --> 24:37.960]  They're not getting rid of the police.
[24:37.960 --> 24:40.960]  They are bullying them using any bad event that happens.
[24:40.960 --> 24:45.960]  Oh my God, we've had three days of riots and a guy in armed robbery suspect for robbing a woman,
[24:45.960 --> 24:49.960]  waving guns around everywhere, is then attacking the police.
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.960]  And in the melee, the cop pulls the wrong weapon and shoots him.
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.960]  What do you think happens when you go into riots and high-speed car chases?
[24:59.960 --> 25:02.960]  But now, you see, we've got to have more riots for that trial.
[25:02.960 --> 25:05.960]  We've got to have more – see, it just goes on and on.
[25:05.960 --> 25:08.960]  But if you're a good globalist police department, if you do everything the New World Order says
[25:08.960 --> 25:14.960]  and arrest their political enemies, become commasars under strong citizenship that Obama launched,
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.960]  directly directed by the UN, well, then you're in like Flynn.
[25:19.960 --> 25:22.960]  So that's coming up separately, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:22.960 --> 25:23.960]  Here it is.
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.960]  This is your last three-day chance to get the really highest quality liquid, multi-vitamin mineral system
[25:29.960 --> 25:31.960]  with amino acids as well.
[25:31.960 --> 25:33.960]  Everything you need that is essential to live.
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.960]  So in case you've got a deficiency in something, you don't have the big problems that come with that.
[25:38.960 --> 25:41.960]  And when something's essential, it's like oxygen or water.
[25:41.960 --> 25:44.960]  You die without oxygen in five minutes, you die without water in about a week,
[25:44.960 --> 25:48.960]  you die without food in general in about a month because you don't have the vitamins and minerals.
[25:48.960 --> 25:51.960]  So it takes longer to die without the essentials, but you will die without it,
[25:51.960 --> 25:54.960]  and medical science won't even tell you why you're getting sick.
[25:54.960 --> 25:56.960]  Scurvy is a huge problem across the Western world.
[25:56.960 --> 25:58.960]  People don't get the vitamin C they need.
[25:58.960 --> 26:02.960]  Everything you need is environmental fusion, and it funds the InfoWare 361.
[26:02.960 --> 26:03.960]  40% off.
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.960]  We've got winter sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 taken on the tongue,
[26:07.960 --> 26:11.960]  good for children, adults, especially old people, and brown folks, you need your D3
[26:11.960 --> 26:13.960]  because you're not getting enough of it.
[26:13.960 --> 26:16.960]  If you're black, you've got to be on the sun hours and hours a week.
[26:16.960 --> 26:18.960]  If you're white, about 30 minutes direct sun.
[26:18.960 --> 26:21.960]  Hispanic, it depends on the person, 45 minutes a week.
[26:21.960 --> 26:23.960]  If you're not doing it, you need vitamin D3.
[26:23.960 --> 26:26.960]  You've got to have it taken under the tongue, goes into your blood vessel.
[26:26.960 --> 26:29.960]  Some folks don't absorb the stomach, so that's why this liquid is so important.
[26:29.960 --> 26:34.960]  It's 50% off when you get it with vitamin mineral fusion, or 40% by itself.
[26:34.960 --> 26:40.960]  InfoWareStore.com, or triple A-253-3139.
[26:40.960 --> 26:48.960]  When we come back, I am going to plow directly into so many stacks, so much news.
[26:48.960 --> 26:50.960]  I'm not sure when I'm going to hit first when we come back.
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.960]  There's a lot of important stuff I'll tell you about it in a minute.
[26:54.960 --> 26:56.960]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[26:56.960 --> 27:03.960]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[27:03.960 --> 27:06.960]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.960]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[27:09.960 --> 27:13.960]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[27:13.960 --> 27:15.960]  The global government, the New World Order.
[27:15.960 --> 27:19.960]  Now that people woke up to the fact that that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[27:19.960 --> 27:21.960]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[27:21.960 --> 27:22.960]  My gosh, look it out.
[27:22.960 --> 27:26.960]  Prescription drug prices just tripled, or quadrupled, depending on the drug.
[27:26.960 --> 27:29.960]  Once Biden signed that executive order, we pay the most of anybody in the world.
[27:29.960 --> 27:32.960]  That's just one case of hundreds of things.
[27:32.960 --> 27:36.960]  The Trump had reversed, and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.960]  The energy cost, everything else.
[27:38.960 --> 27:41.960]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate,
[27:41.960 --> 27:46.960]  where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[27:46.960 --> 27:49.960]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[27:49.960 --> 27:51.960]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[27:51.960 --> 27:52.960]  The swamp is deep.
[27:52.960 --> 27:55.960]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[27:55.960 --> 27:59.960]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[27:59.960 --> 28:04.960]  And I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[28:04.960 --> 28:06.960]  that has come together over the years.
[28:06.960 --> 28:07.960]  It is truly an answer to prayer.
[28:07.960 --> 28:11.960]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[28:11.960 --> 28:13.960]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.960]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[28:17.960 --> 28:18.960]  You got red blood.
[28:18.960 --> 28:22.960]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children,
[28:22.960 --> 28:24.960]  we are brothers and sisters together.
[28:24.960 --> 28:28.960]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.960]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[28:32.960 --> 28:35.960]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[28:35.960 --> 28:40.960]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[28:40.960 --> 28:43.960]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[28:43.960 --> 28:47.960]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[28:47.960 --> 28:51.960]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[28:51.960 --> 28:54.960]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse.
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.960]  God bless.
[29:25.960 --> 29:27.960]  They don't want to go along with the globalists.
[29:27.960 --> 29:28.960]  But they're scared.
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.960]  They're looking for leadership.
[29:30.960 --> 29:32.960]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[29:32.960 --> 29:33.960]  You fund us.
[29:33.960 --> 29:34.960]  You support M4store.com.
[29:34.960 --> 29:36.960]  You get great privacy at the same time.
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.960]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular,
[29:40.960 --> 29:42.960]  what the globalists will target you for,
[29:42.960 --> 29:46.960]  to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[29:46.960 --> 29:47.960]  That's our job.
[29:47.960 --> 29:51.960]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire,
[29:51.960 --> 29:54.960]  meet the shock groups and the information war.

[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:21.960]  So if you have a microphone and you were to tell the entire world right now about your experience and the take away from it, you're looking at 36 years in prison for going for going on a road trip with your brother.
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:29.960]  You've done you've done nothing criminal you haven't never heard you have never heard and you've never previously been arrested in your entire life this is the first time that you were in jail.
[3:17:29.960 --> 3:17:39.960]  You were taken to a private prison you weren't a lot of phone call you weren't a lot of shower for five days. If you had a microphone that you could tell the entire world about your experience right now.
[3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:43.960]  What would you tell everybody about this.
[3:17:43.960 --> 3:18:03.960]  I mean, if that's a hard one there's a lot. People need to take action and I don't mean violently. I mean, with their voice, we still have our amendments and we still have freedom of speech. It's being censored, but don't let that deter you call your representatives.
[3:18:03.960 --> 3:18:17.960]  There's a lot of things other than social media like speak out. It's all my friends that have seen what has happened to me tell me how shocked they are they're like if this can happen to you.
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:26.960]  This can happen to me and that's that's exactly right if it wasn't me some going to be somebody else, and it will be somebody else tomorrow and the day after.
[3:18:26.960 --> 3:18:40.960]  Everything of political opposition is what this is and your story is incredible. I mean, you're, it's infathomable that this is happening, but the really scary part here Felicia is that this is happening to thousands of people.
[3:18:40.960 --> 3:18:53.960]  There are thousands of people in your shoes really. We were able to track you down to make this appearance but, you know, I don't think that people really quite understand the full magnitude of what is going on here that this is a complete
[3:18:53.960 --> 3:19:00.960]  being perpetuated on the American people that has twisted and manipulated the facts surrounding what happened on the 6th of January.
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:09.960]  They were talking about impeaching a president based on speech that incited violence when he specifically said out of his mouth to be peaceful and patriotic.
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:18.960]  When you heard him say to be peaceful and patriotic, did you somehow take that as go be violent and take over the Capitol building interrupt Congress and shut down the meeting.
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:27.960]  No, and his speech, I don't think according to the timeline had even ended before their original breach.
[3:19:27.960 --> 3:19:40.960]  Hang on just a couple of seconds because we're going to come back and talk to you just a little bit more. There's some other really gruesome and gory details about the story for Felicia here in a way that you can help her out as we come back with more of the Alex Jones show at BandThis.TV.
[3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:44.960]  My name is Stu Peters from Red Voice Media. We'll be right back.
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:56.960]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:19:56.960 --> 3:20:03.960]  And then we're all this together. And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:10.960]  But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:15.960]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:20:15.960 --> 3:20:21.960]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:27.960]  That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:33.960]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:41.960]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com. Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:44.960]  They're wonderful products and they support the info war. Thank you.
[3:20:44.960 --> 3:20:53.960]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[3:20:53.960 --> 3:21:03.960]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension.
[3:21:03.960 --> 3:21:09.960]  So we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to. And it really does come down to that.
[3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:17.960]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:27.960]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[3:21:27.960 --> 3:21:37.960]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:44.960]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:53.960]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[3:21:53.960 --> 3:22:02.960]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:07.960]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:18.960]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[3:22:18.960 --> 3:22:25.960]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[3:22:25.960 --> 3:22:41.960]  not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:45.960]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[3:22:45.960 --> 3:22:54.960]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:03.960]  Big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:12.960]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:20.960]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it.
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:25.960]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and block it, block it, some things like that for more than a decade.
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:32.960]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:41.960]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:56.960]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:25.960]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. My name is Stu Peters from redvoicemedia.com here with Felicia Canold who had a Gestapo-style raid.
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:34.960]  Dozens of FBI agents took her out of her bed at gunpoint, in her pajamas, ARs in her face. She's never been to jail before.
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:41.960]  She's not a criminal. She walked through an open door at the Capitol on the 6th of January battling with some audio issues here. But welcome back to bandness.tv.
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:45.960]  We know that they're lying. We know that it's fake. We know that it was a setup.
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:54.960]  And you know, the globalists have also impacted crowdfunding for people that are in her position making it impossible for her to get legal representation,
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:59.960]  making it impossible for people like her to get any kind of relief or freedom whatsoever.
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:08.960]  At the same time, Kamala Harris, you know, when she was a candidate, she was directing people to the Minnesota Freedom Fund to get rioters out of jail,
[3:25:08.960 --> 3:25:14.960]  people that are actually hurting people, burning down your city, taking your corner stores out, assaulting people in their alleyways,
[3:25:14.960 --> 3:25:18.960]  targeting and assassinating police officers, you know, all over the country.
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:22.960]  We see the hypocrisy from the radicals that are wanting to take over our country.
[3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:30.960]  So to help her out, her crowdfunding, by the way, has been taken down. So the GoFundMe people and all these people from these different places,
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:37.960]  they've taken down her thing. They've made it impossible for her to raise money, for her to get some help from legal counsel.
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:51.960]  So if you want to help Felicia, Felicia, that you have a Venmo that was set up, and that is Felicia-Kanold, K-O-N-O-L-D-1. Is that correct?
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:53.960]  Yeah, that's correct.
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:57.960]  All right. Well, you know, I'm sorry that we were battling with some of these audio issues.
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:05.960]  And, you know, I just want to make sure that people get your help and, you know, get help to you if they should feel that that is something that they can do.
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:12.960]  Because what you're going through, obviously, is a horrible representation of the attack on our freedom, the attack on our democracy,
[3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:21.960]  and the attack on conservatives as they try to choke out every last remaining pro-conservative, pro-freedom, pro-liberty voice that is here,
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:30.960]  and specifically Christians. So God bless you, and we will be thinking a lot about you and following up on your story as it continues. Appreciate it.
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:47.960]  What we also know about the lying and fake news mainstream media, the state-controlled Communist Party funded radical and narcissistic Don LeMans and Chris Cuomo's of the world won't tell you about the shocking reality surrounding the dangers associated with the so-called COVID vaccine.
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:27:02.960]  They'll ignore, suppress, and refuse to report on the deadly side effects being experienced by so many Americans after subjecting themselves to the jab, rolling the dice with an unproven cocktail injection into their bloodstream.
[3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:09.960]  So for those of you that say that you did the research before you got the injection, I need to warn you, you are the research.
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:24.960]  Now, I've talked about some of this over at redboysmedia.com with Dr. Jane Ruby, who in just one day the other day on my program, Patriotically Correct, revealed a dozen men that experienced blood quats after getting their second shot.
[3:27:24.960 --> 3:27:37.960]  Despite the lying troll, Dr. Fauci, the highest paid bureaucrat, by the way, in our entire governmental system, who has a financial stake in the game, telling us that only women that have taken birth control are being effective.
[3:27:37.960 --> 3:27:46.960]  That's a lie. Dr. Jane Ruby is here with us now. She's an international health economist and she's an author as well as a troublemaker in Washington as an insider.
[3:27:46.960 --> 3:27:59.960]  Dr. Ruby, thanks a lot for being here. We really appreciate it. You have discovered a lot of things with this injection, with this so-called vaccine, with the stab that are just not true. Tell us what you've learned.
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:10.960]  Stu, I'm going to tell you that the whole thing is a lie. The entire issue around these so-called vaccines. This is an incredibly dangerous time for the American people.
[3:28:10.960 --> 3:28:19.960]  The entire CDC website that I've combed over the last few days, just to get updated, is a complete and total lie. What do I mean by that?
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:32.960]  First of all, we learned from the Harvard study that less than 1% of all people are reporting these so-called COVID vaccine reactions. On top of that, we have 60,000 that have been reported.
[3:28:32.960 --> 3:28:43.960]  So if we're only getting 1%, you can imagine how dangerous these injections, these experimental injections are. And let me give you another stat that I think is really chilling.
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:52.960]  In the last 13 years, in these injections for all kinds of flu vaccines, there were about 3,000 deaths in the United States.
[3:28:52.960 --> 3:29:02.960]  And now we're learning that just since December, these so-called COVID experimental injections have resulted in over 3,000 deaths just in these few months.
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:09.960]  So we are really in dangerous territory. I've been pleading with people to wait, wait and hold off.
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:20.960]  All right, so let's talk about this. We now know that there are dozens, thousands, 60,000 you're saying, people adversely affected. That's the ones that we know about.
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:26.960]  Now, we also know that deaths associated with COVID-19, these numbers are fake. They've been a lie.
[3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:29.960]  Now, we do know that people are dying with COVID-19. We understand that.
[3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:40.960]  But I mean, there were people from Milwaukee whistleblowers coming forward saying, hey, you know, providers here, healthcare providers are labeling these COVID deaths even in a complete absence of a COVID test.
[3:29:40.960 --> 3:29:45.960]  They just say, well, this person had COVID-like symptoms and they labeled them a COVID death.
[3:29:45.960 --> 3:29:56.960]  So my thing has always been follow the money. I mean, as a bail enforcement bounty hunter guy, when you're looking to track somebody down or if you want to find somebody who's guilty or see if somebody had some nefarious involvement in something,
[3:29:56.960 --> 3:30:03.960]  all you have to do is look for who had what to gain, who had a stake in the game, who could benefit, who had the motive to do this.
[3:30:03.960 --> 3:30:11.960]  So we know that Big Pharma has a lot to gain. That's why they're up on Capitol Hill lobbying to get, no, not one injection, but two.
[3:30:11.960 --> 3:30:15.960]  And now we're seeing another guy come out here saying, well, there might be a third injection that you need.
[3:30:15.960 --> 3:30:21.960]  And then you look around the globe and you see all these other strains, these new strains of this COVID coming out.
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:30.960]  So what we fear is that if there was a 99.98% survival rate or give or take, whatever the actual number is, Dr. Ruby, I guess I don't know for certain,
[3:30:30.960 --> 3:30:37.960]  but whatever that number is, it's high. There's a real good chance that you can beat and recover from this COVID-19 thing if you get it.
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:42.960]  Now they're trying to scare us with these new strains saying that, well, kids could now be potentially infected by this.
[3:30:42.960 --> 3:30:50.960]  Kids could be adversely affected. Kids are at great risk because they're coming after our kids because they know that that is what, that's what pulls our heart strings.
[3:30:50.960 --> 3:30:52.960]  So to this, you say what?
[3:30:52.960 --> 3:31:02.960]  Oh, my gosh, children should not be getting this vaccine. Children have not been tested in these vaccine trials, which, by the way, are still ongoing.
[3:31:02.960 --> 3:31:08.960]  This is critically dangerous. Children have an almost 100% chance of recovery.
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:13.960]  You would never take the chance of getting a vaccine for something like strep throat. Would you? Why?
[3:31:13.960 --> 3:31:18.960]  Because A, there are treatments for it. You can take kind of Cilin or Tetracycline or some other antibiotic.
[3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:23.960]  We have curative treatments. 500,000 people did not have to die in this nation.
[3:31:23.960 --> 3:31:31.960]  We had HCQ and ivermectin, which are safe years of safety data and perfectly fine in terms of curative treatment.
[3:31:31.960 --> 3:31:36.960]  So these vaccines, listen, Stu, we're getting news in the last few days alone.
[3:31:36.960 --> 3:31:52.960]  Mammograms by the thousands are coming up positive for lumps and unusual lymph node enlargement. We're seeing brain, lung and leg clots from all of these different companies.
[3:31:52.960 --> 3:31:57.960]  It's just incredible. People are getting shingles where they've never had it before and they're not at risk for it.
[3:31:57.960 --> 3:32:03.960]  So I got to tell you, Stu, it's not about the short term. It's about the long term.
[3:32:03.960 --> 3:32:14.960]  And we are, this is genetic engineering. I want everybody to understand not any one of these so-called experimental injections are safe.
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:22.960]  All of them modify permanently your genetic makeup. You can, it's irreversible. You can never do anything about it.
[3:32:22.960 --> 3:32:24.960]  You can't get it out of your system.
[3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:35.960]  The last thing we want to do is to give this to children who have almost 100% chance of surviving. But more than that, they will be damaged for life if they even live a normal life span.
[3:32:35.960 --> 3:32:37.960]  This is an old call.
[3:32:37.960 --> 3:32:46.960]  You've been out here talking about the survival rate. You've also alluded to this vaccination as not necessarily being a vaccination.
[3:32:46.960 --> 3:32:55.960]  You have said that what this is is some sort of a cocktail that tricks your body. It tricks your body into believing that you have COVID all the time.
[3:32:55.960 --> 3:33:01.960]  Something that you inject into your bloodstream like that. And then in addition to that, we've looked at testing.
[3:33:01.960 --> 3:33:11.960]  We have debunked the reliability of the so-called PCR test. The inventor of that test way back when was on film saying that Fauci was a liar back then.
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:18.960]  And there's a lot more to cover on this, including President Donald J. Trump and his push for this vaccination.
[3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:26.960]  Now, originally there was obviously political motivation as well as safety motivation to get some sort of a vaccination to the public.
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:32.960]  But I want to hold you over here to come in with our final segment because there's so much more to cover with this as we come back.
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:42.960]  Oh, and Shroyer is down at the border. Alex Jones is on his way to ground zero right now. They're going to bring you that report right here at VanMess.tv.
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:44.960]  And we will be back on the Alex Jones show right after this. Stick around. My name is Stu Peters.

[3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:49.960]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[3:34:49.960 --> 3:34:54.960]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:59.960]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:05.960]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:16.960]  You've got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:23.960]  And as crazier things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:28.960]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:35.960]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:43.960]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support infowarstore. God bless.
[3:35:45.960 --> 3:35:54.960]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma. They control academia.
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:36:07.960]  They control the military, industrial complex. They control big tech. And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:16.960]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:32.960]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt and turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:37.960]  That's why they target infowarstore because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:45.960]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote infowarstore and ban that video. So redouble your efforts. We're all in this together.
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:52.960]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:37:00.960]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:06.960]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:18.960]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[3:37:18.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:36.960]  Pray for us. Word of mouth. Tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:56.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:37:56.960 --> 3:38:21.960]  I think she's going to be the official doctor of everything redboysmedia.com, Dr. Jane Ruby joining us with an emergency warning for all of us that we really suspected that there was a reason for the push for this vaccination.
[3:38:21.960 --> 3:38:36.960]  Obviously, it all comes down to money compliance and control and folks, we know that the one way to control people, the masses, people that would normally never do certain things can be coerced into doing certain things when they're feeling the fear emotion.
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:41.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. My name is Stu Peters, redboysmedia.com, bandits.tv.
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:58.960]  This is some information that Dr. Ruby had sent me before and I think that it's really important that I go over this. This goes all the way back to August 1 through December 31 of 2007 where there was 150 deaths following vaccinations.
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:11.960]  Now, this number kind of creeps up a little bit until you get into, you know, 2019. Okay, in 18, there was 172 deaths. And then in 2019, there was 196 deaths.
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:24.960]  In 2020, between January 1 and November 30, deaths following vaccinations was down to 96 deaths. Now, listen here, folks, here's where this gets really, this is where it gets really scary.
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:36.960]  August 1, 2007, November 30, 2020, in 13 plus years, total all vaccine deaths was 3,001. Okay, that's for 13 plus years.
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:49.960]  From 2007 to 2020, deaths following vaccinations, follow me here, 3,000 deaths. All right. Now, December 1, 2020, December 1, 2020, until April 13.
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:59.960]  What is that? Just three days ago, four months, there has been 3,005 deaths, according to the information that I was sent by Dr. Ruby.
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:07.960]  That is in four months, folks, more deaths in four months after the COVID-19 vaccination, so-called vaccine rollout.
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:14.960]  There is as many deaths, more deaths in those four months than there has been in the last 13 plus years.
[3:40:14.960 --> 3:40:21.960]  Back with us now is Dr. Jane Ruby. She's an international health economist. You can find her, obviously, at drjeanruby.com.
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:24.960]  This is some really scary stuff for the world to understand.
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:30.960]  Now, we have talked before about some of this. You were, on my show, patriotically correct.
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:39.960]  We talked at that point, that day, you had discovered that there were 12 men, specifically in the Palm Beach County area, the Palm Beach area.
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:48.960]  It's a place of interest for you just because of your geographical location. But more so, you looked into this because Fauci was out here telling us all,
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:56.960]  listen, be cautious, fine, but get the vaccine. The vaccine is safe. We don't think that this has anything to do with the vaccine,
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:05.960]  because research is showing us that the people that are being impacted by these blood clots are specifically females who have ingested oral contraceptives.
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:11.960]  So then you started digging into this a little bit, and it didn't take you long to figure out that that's another lie,
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:17.960]  and that the media is suppressing, covering up the lie, and that they're telling you to go get this.
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:25.960]  I mean, this isn't something that's just exclusive, by the way, to the MSNBCs and the CNNs and the radical liberal left communist state-controlled media.
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:32.960]  I mean, we're watching conservative networks that have doctors out here, Dr. Ruby, that are saying it's a very effective vaccine.
[3:41:32.960 --> 3:41:36.960]  Go get the vaccine. So to those people, you say what?
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:48.960]  It's a shame to say it's true, but as a medical professional myself, I'm going to call out a great number of medical providers who are for some reason colluding.
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:57.960]  They are making statements that these side effects are not connected to the vaccines, and they know full well that they have no way of really knowing that.
[3:41:57.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  They're telling people just like the CDC website. When I tell you the lies are everywhere, the entire CDC website is telling people it's safe,
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:14.960]  that you will get some side effects, but they're normal. This is just insanity, Stu. It's just dangerous, and somehow we've got to stop it.
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:21.960]  I'm asking people to wait. I see, as you mentioned earlier, President Trump wanting to associate himself with this.
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:27.960]  Maybe in the beginning, that was a good thing for him because he wanted to show that he was doing all kinds of things, and I applaud him for that.
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:35.960]  But I implore him right now, if he ever gets any wind of this, stop associating yourself with this because no one knows the long-term effects.
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:43.960]  It doesn't matter what the short-term effects are. With the regular flu vaccine, you can get a few fever or some aches and pains, and then you're fine after that.
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:49.960]  And you can actually detoxify from those vaccines. You can't do this with that, and I'm not so focused on the short term.
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:56.960]  What President Trump has not been aware of, because we don't have the information yet, because we're still running the trials.
[3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:00.960]  The reason why we have to focus on the long term is because of our kids.
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:09.960]  Now, any person that has values, any person that was raised by a mother and a father who instill core values and morals into us,
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:13.960]  teaches us from a very young age that the most precious gift from God is your kids.
[3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:20.960]  They treated you like that, hopefully. If they didn't, and you were less fortunate, hopefully you have found that in some way else.
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:27.960]  But as a parent, as a father of three kids, I would protect them with my life without even thinking about it.
[3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:32.960]  I would jump in front of a speeding Amtrak train or a bullet any day of the week, come hell or high water.
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:36.960]  I would never let anything bad happen to my kids without even thinking about it.
[3:43:36.960 --> 3:43:38.960]  They are our number one, our top priority.
[3:43:38.960 --> 3:43:44.960]  We spend our entire lives setting up a financial future for our kids, what we're going to leave for our kids, what we're going to leave for our grandkids.
[3:43:44.960 --> 3:43:49.960]  We have to think now a lot about the Republic that we're leaving them as we're watching the unthinkable.
[3:43:49.960 --> 3:43:56.960]  I mean, the things Dr. Ruby that are happening outside of medicine, you know, with the insurrection on the 6th of January,
[3:43:56.960 --> 3:44:02.960]  with the media doing everything that they're doing, with the way that these political groups like Black Lives Matter have been propped up,
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:10.960]  and now we're looking at a story from redboysmedia.com about their national poster boy, their glory idol here,
[3:44:10.960 --> 3:44:12.960]  arrested in Minneapolis very quietly.
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:17.960]  The media is not going to tell you that he was arrested on a warrant stemming from, you know, having sex with kids.
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:25.960]  And this is all a big, it all comes back kind of to the same thing, this globalist pressure to get at our kids.
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:27.960]  And I'm telling you that I can see it.
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:28.960]  I can see it.
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:30.960]  The writing is on the wall.
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:37.960]  Now, back when this thing in January and in February of 2020, when this COVID-19 thing was starting,
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:46.960]  and there was this, you know, a little bit of a blurb here and there in the national news media about this breakout in China with this virus,
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:52.960]  and it's COVID-19, and it's spreading really quickly across the, you know, the Chinese, the China, the continent of China,
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:57.960]  and Asia and all this other stuff, I said right away, this is going to come here.
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:45:00.960]  This is going to come here. It's going to be politicized.
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:04.960]  It's going to be used as part of the political assassination of President Donald J. Trump.
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:11.960]  We did it. Look, the steel dossier, the button paid for, steel dossier didn't work, the Russia, Russia, Russia, all the lies.
[3:45:11.960 --> 3:45:13.960]  They illegally spied on a sitting president.
[3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:19.960]  They spied on a U.S. citizen when he was a campaigning, you know, a U.S. citizen, the President Trump campaign.
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:21.960]  They spied on that. No accountability there.
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:26.960]  And all these things that we're talking about that are so fringe, you know, I was called a racist and a bigot
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:29.960]  because I said this thing was going to be politicized by Nancy Pelosi.
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:31.960]  I was an insensitive a-hole. I was a total jerk.
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:35.960]  I was jaded. I was cynical. I was a radio show host saying things for shock value.
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:37.960]  And look, I was exactly right.
[3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:46.960]  And now my prediction is that because this thing did not have this killing-off effect that I think a lot of the globalists were looking for,
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:50.960]  that now they're rounding up round two and they're going to come after our kids.
[3:45:50.960 --> 3:45:51.960]  What do you think?
[3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:57.960]  I mean, am I over the target here or am I a conspiracy theorist? Should I go get my tinfoil hat right now?
[3:45:57.960 --> 3:46:01.960]  All the tinfoil hats are off, Stu. You're right over the target.
[3:46:01.960 --> 3:46:09.960]  I will go so far as to say, after speaking with some security officials from D.C. who came down here for a private briefing a couple of months ago,
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:13.960]  we are – I'm being told we are in the middle of Marxist coup.
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:17.960]  And I don't think that's hyperbole anymore at all. We're in the middle of it.
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:19.960]  We have a very short window of time to reverse this.
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:28.960]  What you saw last year, the COVID, the lockdowns, you know, the masks were training wheels, to be honest with you, for this vaccine.
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:37.960]  And the vaccine, these experimental injections are actually the training wheels for vaccine passports and complete control by the state.
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:45.960]  And the destruction of small businesses is really related to making not just individuals, but also businesses, entrepreneurs, wards of the state.
[3:46:45.960 --> 3:46:49.960]  Don't kid yourself. This is what we're all involved in right now.
[3:46:49.960 --> 3:46:59.960]  As they get out here on these commercials and they tell us all about how before you go into a business, you have to look for this well-health logo or whatever this thing is.
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:06.960]  I mean, you've got people like, you know, Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga, the health experts, warning us that if you don't see this decal,
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:12.960]  well, here's some guy making millions of dollars by manufacturing this decal. And that's what this is all about.
[3:47:12.960 --> 3:47:16.960]  You follow the money. This is all about control and compliance through fear.
[3:47:16.960 --> 3:47:21.960]  And what they're going to do is they're going to choke out anybody that says, no, no, no, I'm not buying this.
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:23.960]  I don't believe in this. They're not going to get the well-health thing.
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:26.960]  They're not going to go subject themselves to the world ending jab.
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:31.960]  They're not going to go cover themselves with their face diapers and their muzzles.
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:38.960]  They see all of this because when history isn't addressed, when you don't look it right in the eye, it's bound to repeat itself.
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:42.960]  Dr. Jane Ruby, you know, we really appreciate you being here.
[3:47:42.960 --> 3:47:46.960]  If you want more from Dr. Ruby, go to drjanerubydrjaneruby.com.
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:48.960]  Thank you very much. We really appreciate it.
[3:47:48.960 --> 3:47:50.960]  My pleasure.
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:54.960]  Owen Schreuer is down at the border. He's at ground zero.
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:58.960]  They're going to be bringing you coverage from there. Alex Jones is on his way there right now.
[3:47:58.960 --> 3:48:03.960]  I apparently just caught a flight after he did the first segment here in the final hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:08.960]  You stick with infowars.com, band.video, bandis.tv.
[3:48:08.960 --> 3:48:13.960]  For all of those updates, Owen is going to go live here in about 20 seconds as we hand it off to him.
[3:48:13.960 --> 3:48:16.960]  He's down at the border for the war room.

[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:25.960]  My name is Stu Peters. It's a pleasure being here every single Friday, and we will not be afraid of the truth at any time.
[3:48:25.960 --> 3:48:28.960]  God bless you, Godspeed. Here's what's up to it. Here's what's down to it.
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:33.960]  To any way you can get to it, remember, one day they're going to come for the car, and when they do, save that radio.
