[01:08.560 --> 01:13.960]  for me to drop the ball as I do at least partially every day they've had
[01:13.960 --> 01:24.160]  reactors in Nebraska Illinois and another one in New York and two in
[01:24.160 --> 01:27.560]  Canada and I'm gonna try to do a detailed report on the nightly news tonight
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.080]  or tomorrow but I've got to compile all this they've had them leak radioactive
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.080]  steam you name it and it's not even an issue now I mean these are big
[01:37.080 --> 01:45.880]  incidents and it's hardly even on the radar a nuclear plant closed after
[01:45.880 --> 01:53.040]  radiation leak in San Diego it's a plant north of San Diego south of Los
[01:53.040 --> 01:59.680]  Angeles it's been shut down and it did have power failures and release a bunch
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.960]  of radiation and they've got articles in the San Francisco Chronicle and others
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.000]  saying well there it might not be good for you now you notice that last year
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.960]  months in the Fukushima they raised the isotopes from 25 percent to 200 percent
[02:15.960 --> 02:19.640]  to 500 a thousand some isotopes a hundred thousand times what they
[02:19.640 --> 02:25.620]  previously said were safe and now stuff like this is just a footnote I mean
[02:25.620 --> 02:31.160]  Fukushima is still melting down five of the six reactors I told you as a melt
[02:31.160 --> 02:34.280]  down for time I mean we had scientists on they had the isotope readings they
[02:34.280 --> 02:38.520]  knew what it was all that radioactive waste has been now hitting the US coast
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.480]  not just in the air but but now the debris in the last two months has been
[02:42.480 --> 02:45.960]  hitting and piling up they're not even warning people not to mess with it this
[02:45.960 --> 02:49.760]  is stuff of plutonium on it and you know and you wonder why you get cancer a
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.440]  year later and die I mean it's sick a new radioactive leak from Fukushima
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.240]  reactor New Zealand Herald it's good news out of New Zealand people don't even
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.080]  care here I mean it's just like the government says it's safe they waved a
[03:03.080 --> 03:12.400]  magic baloney wand a magic bowl wand speaking of getting out of the United
[03:12.400 --> 03:18.240]  States we got an article at info wars calm and prison planet calm that just
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.040]  came out minutes ago Cameron fleeing America to escape collapse or is of all
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.960]  the airborne super viruses that have been created I don't know about Cameron
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.440]  himself I know a lot of Hollywood people and have run into some defense
[03:32.440 --> 03:36.720]  contractor company owner very well known person I'm not gonna say I was off
[03:36.720 --> 03:40.520]  record and many others have told her five years that the elite are all
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.920]  exiting basically and those that stay here are buying houses in New Zealand
[03:44.920 --> 03:48.960]  and we he's got a bunch of quotes from elites admitting they're getting out
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.000]  because of collapse and civil unrest and super viruses and they're all moving
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.200]  to the middle of nowhere they're moving to the outback of Australia they're

[04:18.160 --> 04:22.200]  engineered I'm gonna explain how and what it's going to then cause and why the
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.760]  system said that they wanted to end the family and that it's archaic actually
[04:27.760 --> 04:30.080]  heard a guy calling the local radio this morning that's how I knew about this
[04:30.080 --> 04:35.560]  survey and CNN ran a story on a big national study and I heard one caller
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.280]  and I heard a woman man say the families are kick and in marriages and then I
[04:40.280 --> 04:45.800]  heard a woman agree and they don't even know why they say this it's just in all
[04:45.800 --> 04:50.800]  the trendy publications if you think it's a civilization collapsing as trendy
[04:50.800 --> 04:57.320]  and being isolated slaves well I guess it is trendy so is cancer exploding so

[08:31.400 --> 08:42.120]  February 2nd thursday edition it is February 2nd 2012 in the second half of
[08:42.120 --> 08:47.840]  the broadcast investigative reporter and deep researcher fritz springmeyer will
[08:47.840 --> 08:54.880]  be joining us to go over evidence that many of the global elite are indeed
[08:54.880 --> 09:02.520]  luciferian psychopaths satanists in the right word because that's kind of a low
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.600]  level minions they think lucifer's god and I thought I'd show some clips of
[09:06.600 --> 09:10.880]  eyes wide shut and news articles about world leaders involved in the occult and
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.920]  so john bound has prepared some of that for the radio audience and the TV
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.200]  audience and so we'll be bibliography engaging in a bibliography here on air
[09:22.200 --> 09:26.360]  with some of what fritz is talking about just because it's it sounds so over
[09:26.360 --> 09:32.720]  the top but unfortunately so much of it has been proven to be accurate again I
[09:32.720 --> 09:39.640]  read his book came out in 95 it's been updated bloodlines the limonade and I
[09:39.640 --> 09:45.480]  was like this this this can't be true and then over the years I just kept
[09:45.480 --> 09:52.800]  running in separately in mainstream media or in research just into things that
[09:52.800 --> 09:59.160]  were in his book that he'd originally reported on from sources and by the way
[09:59.160 --> 10:04.560]  I had John bound for two days look for that times of London or was it Sunday
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.240]  times of London because I have a memory of it in fact he actually found the link
[10:08.240 --> 10:13.280]  and then I was digging it back up last night so if you didn't dig that link
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.760]  back up please find it John and there was the clip about the woman escaping from
[10:17.760 --> 10:26.200]  the burgundy France castle and when the state police broke in there all these
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.160]  dead women and women barely alive in cages and then it was connected to the
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.240]  French government so the story got shut down that links dead that article's
[10:34.240 --> 10:41.640]  taken down kind of like the Sunday times again had a big article about global
[10:41.640 --> 10:47.760]  rich meat to deal with overpopulation at Rockefeller University we went
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.680]  subscribe got into their archives gone thank goodness we saved part of the
[10:52.680 --> 10:56.320]  article you know a blurb of it and I found that global research and others
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.040]  have the whole thing saved ABC News changed their headline and cut out the
[11:01.040 --> 11:07.040]  stuff about reducing population and who was there Warren Buffett Bill Gates
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.360]  Ted Turner George Soros Oprah Winfrey and they're in there saying well we're
[11:13.360 --> 11:16.640]  like an alternate to the global government but not trying to be the
[11:16.640 --> 11:20.160]  official global government that's how the article ends and they say with you
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.880]  we've got to figure out ways to reduce the population and of course Gates and
[11:25.880 --> 11:29.240]  Buffett's Foundation the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation that that Buffett's
[11:29.240 --> 11:34.560]  put 50 billion in there more tax-free by the way it actually makes money it's
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.800]  buying up vaccine companies GMO New York Times reports Bill Gates is the
[11:38.800 --> 11:40.960]  biggest
[11:41.240 --> 11:50.000]  financer of biotech crops in the world now GMO it he then finances London
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.280]  Guardian ABC you name it we did a report on that earlier in the week listing the
[11:54.280 --> 12:01.040]  dozens and dozens of TV networks and print papers like the Guardian that they
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.680]  finance I mean the whole thing it's not sponsored by they're paying for what's
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.600]  in it how great Bill Gates is how he loves you how much he loves black people
[12:10.600 --> 12:15.840]  I mean it's sick it is sick and and and there's this brainwashing in the
[12:15.840 --> 12:19.920]  churches and everywhere Bill Gates hung the moon he loves us meanwhile we've got
[12:19.920 --> 12:23.360]  the clips we're putting a report together of this about yeah Kilgram on
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.120]  higher-ten teachers and the teachers clapping excitedly the idea of you kill
[12:27.120 --> 12:34.200]  somebody and you cut off resources you get it a vampire parasitic cannibal
[12:34.200 --> 12:42.760]  economy a consolidation economy a wrecking ball economy a killer be killed
[12:42.760 --> 12:48.760]  economy not a win-win-win expanding economy to the stars but but one of
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.440]  the post-industrial that's what they want and it's so incredible to watch
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.600]  these monsters because you can go just type in Warren Buffett eugenics Warren
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.200]  Buffett Planned Parenthood Warren Buffett abortion Warren Buffett
[13:02.200 --> 13:05.680]  population control and you'll get his quotes going back 30 years in the groups
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.920]  he funds and Bill Gates and all of them and of course Ted Turner calls you
[13:10.920 --> 13:17.440]  useless feeders and you know we need to kill 90% of people C-span but then oh
[13:17.440 --> 13:23.880]  he want oh he's got shots for you he loves you in Latin America Asia and
[13:23.880 --> 13:31.240]  Africa so much he's liberal and yeah the guys are pulling up how he funds
[13:31.240 --> 13:35.100]  abortions worldwide how they give women money to have abortions in third
[13:35.100 --> 13:39.760]  world countries I mean but but but he's got a shot for you and he's designing
[13:39.760 --> 13:44.800]  your food you don't just get to have regular food and they've got lost past
[13:44.800 --> 13:51.280]  so they don't have to label when it's got a bunch of genetics added that in
[13:51.280 --> 13:59.280]  every study reduces your fertility I mean these are these are monsters monsters
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.800]  and every time a little glimpse on Lair News Hour of Bill Gates and we got to
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.760]  reduce the population massively boom they pull that down or Ted TV where he
[14:08.760 --> 14:12.360]  giggles and laughs just two years ago and says we're going to give everybody
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.560]  vaccines to reduce population and the audience of establishment people laugh
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.880]  because Gates is laughing about it then he releases mosquitoes and says soon
[14:20.880 --> 14:24.080]  we'll put vaccines in them so you basically can't escape them and then
[14:24.080 --> 14:28.840]  releases some in the crowd they're pulling that video I mean these are
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.760]  demons hopping around laughing at us with a bunch of PR about how much they
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.840]  love us okay I never get to the news until later and it's wrong I just start
[14:40.840 --> 14:45.840]  thinking about one avenue what they're doing to us and the deception and it
[14:45.840 --> 14:52.120]  makes my head spin I wish they weren't doing Satanism or Luciferian worship
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.000]  it's killing bones but they do I wish it wasn't going on a bohemian grove but
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.840]  it's real I wish this stuff wasn't true I wish bisphenol a wasn't added in the
[15:02.840 --> 15:06.760]  50s to all the major plastics that our foods contained in designed to reduce
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.280]  our fertility and feminized men but I've got all the documents and they did it
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.920]  and they and they admit it does do that I wish this wasn't true every day I
[15:15.920 --> 15:21.040]  wish that I didn't know six years ago about fast and furious before we even
[15:21.040 --> 15:27.200]  knew the name I wish that I was wrong I wish that when I said over a year ago
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.920]  that they're gonna use this to blame the Second Amendment and then indeed the
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.760]  memos came out that that's what it was a false flag wish I was wrong again wish
[15:35.760 --> 15:40.360]  I was wrong about it all but I'm sorry I'm right I'm right I'm right and truth
[15:40.360 --> 15:45.640]  is stranger than fiction it's always over the top it's always crazier than I
[15:45.640 --> 15:52.240]  thought crazier than the movies crazier than science fiction because this is
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.880]  reality this is a lot wilder than what you can put in fiction all right I'm
[15:57.880 --> 16:01.800]  gonna do it right now I'm just gonna read you the headlines
[16:01.800 --> 16:08.400]  California nuclear plant closed after radiation leak flesh eating bug spread

[17:35.480 --> 17:40.600]  gonna break this down it's it's simple but it's also complex and it is it is the

[24:13.520 --> 24:19.040]  three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen stacks of
[24:19.040 --> 24:23.440]  news and some of these stacks are five stories deep others are about 20 stories
[24:23.440 --> 24:29.240]  deep and I generally get to about half of this on air every day in the old days
[24:29.240 --> 24:31.720]  back when I was going to talk radio like ten years ago I was actually more
[24:31.720 --> 24:37.640]  disciplined I would actually cover everything but I want to go back into a
[24:37.640 --> 24:40.920]  lot of these and it's almost like I'm a dog in a butcher shop I can't decide
[24:40.920 --> 24:44.400]  which one to get into because once I get into one article I'll tend to run down a
[24:44.400 --> 24:48.480]  rabbit trail and obviously folks like that because the show is very popular
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.760]  and gaining affiliates and getting top ratings but it's just into the brain of
[24:52.760 --> 24:56.200]  Alex Jones here I'm trying to discipline myself so let me just start on the right
[24:56.200 --> 25:01.840]  hand side here again to try to give you just you know the top stack headline
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.880]  and it all just gets more insane every day this is every day and there's just
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.200]  endless amounts people's like wow how do you dig all this up dig it all up it's
[25:10.200 --> 25:14.720]  just pouring out in the open reactor in California releasing a bunch of
[25:14.720 --> 25:20.040]  radiation of course they had that salt reactor blow up in the 50s and radiate
[25:20.040 --> 25:23.160]  bigger than Chernobyl and cover it up see everything's always connected that's
[25:23.160 --> 25:27.280]  why I can't read you one article you've got more radiation more meltdowns at
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.360]  Fukushima that's in that stack we've got the family almost completely gone and
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.320]  then what's left of it under attack and the culture in the media we've got
[25:38.320 --> 25:46.680]  slain border agents family files lawsuit and fast and furious scandal and holder
[25:46.680 --> 25:50.360]  involved in all sorts of corruption Bill introduced a challenge authority of
[25:50.360 --> 25:54.840]  NDAA other Congress people now go public against it not just Ron Paul the
[25:54.840 --> 25:58.720]  secret arrest provisions Microsoft buys eugenics technology from Merck
[25:58.720 --> 26:03.080]  vaccines that sterilize you ultrasound where you get your welfare payment if
[26:03.080 --> 26:09.680]  they hit your you know what's with the ultrasound to kill your sperm just just
[26:09.680 --> 26:12.600]  total rollout by Microsoft with that
[26:12.600 --> 26:18.800]  diminishment of sovereignty and more fed manipulations Big Bob Chapman article
[26:18.800 --> 26:25.440]  moving right along here Cameron fleeing America to escape collapse or all these
[26:25.440 --> 26:28.640]  reports about how they may release a super flu that kills over 90% of those
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.040]  that come in contact with it or take your pick Ebola he's a big globalist
[26:33.040 --> 26:41.280]  reduce the population insider oh yeah and Cameron is bye-bye to New Zealand out
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.400]  at the middle of nowhere we'll be getting into that detailed report by Paul
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.920]  Watson and Alex Jones continuing here sugar should be regulated like alcohol
[26:49.920 --> 26:54.960]  tobacco and that's what CBS news ABC news and the federal government are
[26:54.960 --> 27:00.640]  saying now let me explain how this works as pertain chemical weapon you can have
[27:00.640 --> 27:04.760]  that this phenol in the plastic lining your TV dinners and your coat cans and
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.280]  everything on record increasing cancer and reducing fertility in men
[27:08.280 --> 27:11.440]  hyper feminizing women
[27:11.440 --> 27:15.840]  early onset of puberty in women suppressing puberty in boys just just go
[27:15.840 --> 27:19.040]  check it out for yourself it's an admitted fact not debatable just like the
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.320]  aspartame and the fluoride knowledge which the globalist and had public
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.400]  documents about how they do it on purpose it's not just like oh look they
[27:27.400 --> 27:31.080]  talk about how they want to kill us all day and then they own the companies and
[27:31.080 --> 27:35.800]  the big medical systems to make money off this boy it's obvious they're doing
[27:35.800 --> 27:40.280]  it they even talk about how they're doing it to us the White House science
[27:40.280 --> 27:43.200]  art says you know we put stuff in your water and food to sterilize you and
[27:43.200 --> 27:50.920]  they're doing it they're doing it they're doing it and of course who can't have
[27:50.920 --> 27:54.240]  the kids it's the yuppies who take all the shots and wait till they're 35 to
[27:54.240 --> 27:58.680]  have kids all right continuing sugar should be regulated like alcohol
[27:58.680 --> 28:03.440]  tobacco so see let's let's let's blame regular sugar for everything when
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.240]  people I've looked at the statistics ate more sugar in the 1950s we've had
[28:07.240 --> 28:11.720]  guests on about this and they do now what do we have now though MSG aspartame
[28:11.720 --> 28:19.400]  this phenol a and all this other garbage that's directly linked to pancreatic
[28:19.400 --> 28:26.120]  cancer and type 1 2 and 3 diabetes it's off the charts all of it so what are
[28:26.120 --> 28:30.000]  they gonna do they're gonna come in and regulate natural healthy fats they're
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.320]  gonna come in and regulate sugar this this is how the globalists do it and
[28:33.320 --> 28:36.840]  they have the apediatric associations they have saying give your baby
[28:36.840 --> 28:43.800]  pdlite with the with the aspartame in it don't give your kid sugar I mean sugar
[28:43.800 --> 28:47.400]  a lot of sugar isn't great either but I mean this is really bad it's like saying
[28:47.400 --> 28:53.600]  you know don't slap your child hack their head with a battle axe hack them
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.640]  45 times in the head with a battle axe don't slap them see they always create
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.240]  the crisis offer the solution and regulating and taxing everything got
[29:01.240 --> 29:08.560]  that Israel's a head of military intelligence has come out saying Iran is
[29:08.560 --> 29:12.360]  uranium for four nuclear bombs but it's like all the headlines in the West it's
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.720]  misleading let's just be they have enough if they could ever refine it but
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.840]  it's not refined I mean that's like saying you know that the hospitals in
[29:21.840 --> 29:24.720]  America have enough radioactive material to make a nuke well yeah but you can't
[29:24.720 --> 29:29.800]  make it with it because you can't purify it okay I want to okay I haven't even
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.240]  gotten into the top news that I'm just going from right to left here I've got
[29:34.240 --> 29:39.720]  all this other stuff oh my goodness got a big juicy drudge link on naked body

[34:29.600 --> 34:36.240]  ground this guy's nuts and maybe they're not trolls I just kind of saw that meme
[34:36.240 --> 34:40.200]  pop up here and there just as I was scanning over news and seeing comments
[34:40.200 --> 34:45.320]  on YouTube and things when I comment on this and I think that's just because a
[34:45.320 --> 34:49.400]  lot of people well they still think I'm lying about many GMO foods you eat have
[34:49.400 --> 34:54.600]  multiple insect genes in them they grow their own pesticide people don't know
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.880]  that they they've got corn that grows live HIV in it Jimmy you name it there's
[34:59.880 --> 35:03.920]  thousands of pharmacological crops growing openly blowing into all the
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.480]  other similar species so there's a lot of that mutations going on they've got
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.320]  reports here in Texas confirmed where corn is growing out of the side of oak
[35:12.320 --> 35:19.000]  trees I mean it's just jumping species whoa and I understand uninformed people
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.480]  that don't study science who don't you know stay up till 2 in the morning last
[35:22.480 --> 35:25.600]  night reading government documents you just think I'm making that up I
[35:25.600 --> 35:29.880]  understand that I mean I've been on syndicated radio shows many times and
[35:29.880 --> 35:35.760]  said well you know DC Salt Lake City Dallas Texas other areas have about 120
[35:35.760 --> 35:41.440]  thousand feet Department of Defense giant blimps that are unmanned bigger
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.200]  than the Goodyear blimp is are cheaper than satellites with ground
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.440]  penetrating radar face scanning heat resonance scanning they know your heat
[35:51.440 --> 35:55.120]  resonance fingerprint off the biometric print off the top of your head and
[35:55.120 --> 35:59.920]  shoulders but when you look up they get a face scan as well they've got a
[35:59.920 --> 36:05.440]  biometric print off your walk I mean I saw it when Alexander Haig got the
[36:05.440 --> 36:12.000]  funding in 1993 I was watching him on a science
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.440]  program he had that they syndicated the channels bragging and it turns out the
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.440]  company he started got bought by another and they launched a bunch of these
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.560]  before 9-11 and they launched even more now you could just type in Homeland
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.960]  Security blimps you'll get MSNBC ABC News but still they launch them and then
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.280]  you barely can see them up there even on a clear day because they're right at the
[36:33.280 --> 36:38.080]  edge of the atmosphere and they've got solar power and they run off propellers
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.400]  and when they do see them now I have ABC and I've played it ABC says they believe
[36:42.400 --> 36:47.200]  it's aliens over Salt Lake and it's a big silver blimp with propellers and
[36:47.200 --> 36:53.320]  equipment hanging off the bottom and they tell the public it's an alien on ABC
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.000]  News that and and and and that they have that they launched a big one over Dallas
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.600]  four years ago remember and Larry King was freaking out on CNN people are seeing
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.080]  an alien cigar-shaped thing that looks like it's the size of two football fields
[37:06.080 --> 37:12.480]  there's a stinking blimp I saw it on the news it's it's a blimp it's a blimp I'm
[37:12.480 --> 37:16.320]  not the conspiracy theorist guys type in Homeland Security launching surveillance
[37:16.320 --> 37:23.240]  blimps it's a 2004 is an MSNBC that shows them launching one from DC I mean it
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.640]  gets really old it's not a flying saucer it's got stinking propellers on it
[37:27.640 --> 37:33.800]  nobody came here from Alpha Centuries with propellers on it and explain that to
[37:33.800 --> 37:38.800]  people that propellers aren't gonna work in space okay all right a blimp's not
[37:38.800 --> 37:43.840]  gonna go through the atmosphere it is the unmitigated ignorance of the public
[37:43.840 --> 37:49.520]  blows my mind sometimes but here is some of the articles right here armed robots
[37:49.520 --> 37:56.520]  push to police wired magazine shotguns grenade launchers and it gets into I'd
[37:56.520 --> 37:59.960]  dug back up the articles where they've got little spider droids that go in your
[37:59.960 --> 38:05.400]  house and they can weaponize those they're exploding or surveil you and it
[38:05.400 --> 38:08.920]  goes on to say Department of Defense developed you know robots or now the
[38:08.920 --> 38:14.120]  police are getting them that's how to wire magazine here's defense dot update
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.760]  calm tack calm to test new robot for checkpoint support development of
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.280]  advanced robotic controls look at all sorts of robots for the checkpoints
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.800]  they're setting up they're testing them in Iraq and Afghanistan I mean just type
[38:26.800 --> 38:32.920]  in robots security robots checkpoints the Japanese are testing them okay I'm
[38:32.920 --> 38:39.040]  sorry it's real there it is UFO blimp ABC news and they say it must be a flying
[38:39.040 --> 38:43.640]  saucer and the aliens must fly blimps no it's a Department of Defense giant blimp
[38:43.640 --> 38:48.400]  okay I'm showing it if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv that's good that you
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.040]  found the video but just sir I want to show them a news article where they
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.800]  before they launched them they admitted what they were just type in Homeland Security
[38:56.800 --> 39:04.720]  blimps MSNBC.com okay continuing I'm just got about 20 articles here on this
[39:04.720 --> 39:10.120]  here's LA Times may I heard of them new drone has no pilot anywhere so who's
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.720]  accountable autonomous killing already going on looks like something out of
[39:13.720 --> 39:17.880]  Buck Rogers there it is eyes in the sky for Homeland Security scroll down shows
[39:17.880 --> 39:20.600]  them photo right there Washington Monument when they launched the blimp
[39:20.600 --> 39:23.800]  because people saw when they launch it and they said it's Homeland Security now
[39:23.800 --> 39:28.160]  when a guy with a telescope sees it up at the edge of space they just say oh it
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.560]  says it's a little green man you know he's hanging out he's friendly dude
[39:32.560 --> 39:38.960]  continuing again knowing things means you're a conspiracy theorist knowing how
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.160]  the world works is bad if I said it was an alien I'd be oh that's reasonable
[39:43.160 --> 39:46.960]  yes that's exactly what it is that Alex Jones is really getting mainstream now
[39:46.960 --> 39:55.200]  more drones more robots more wars Reuters ground robots air robots by 2020 the
[39:55.200 --> 39:59.640]  entire Air Force except for troop carriers will be drone the bullets are
[39:59.640 --> 40:04.240]  gonna be drone and you go around corners they already have those not just this
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.040]  laser-guided thing they showed people yesterday here's the Daily Mail the
[40:08.040 --> 40:11.840]  cyborgs are coming living brains and planted with electric chips to replace
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.400]  faulty parts under my dad who's always into science and technology bringing
[40:16.400 --> 40:21.080]  home research papers and stuff he go the library to dig the stuff I remember
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.960]  being about nine years old with him with color magazines and and research
[40:25.960 --> 40:34.440]  publications showing a big cockroach a palmetto bug the Floridian species with
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.240]  a big chip on him hooked into his brain controlling him I was like five six seven
[40:40.240 --> 40:46.560]  years old take them they're just now telling the slaves about it now cuz
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.480]  they're rolling it out remember oldest Huxley his brother ran UNESCO the head
[40:50.480 --> 40:54.400]  eugenics arm the real head of the UN where all the countries that are under
[40:54.400 --> 41:00.080]  UN global control or you get overthrown or invaded or don't get loans adopted
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.680]  UNESCO his brother ran it and he gave a speech in 62 right before he died you can
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.160]  pull up Berkeley speech by oldest Huxley and he says I want to announce to you
[41:09.160 --> 41:15.960]  this is all eugenics that's how I wrote Rave New World in 33 this is not fiction
[41:15.960 --> 41:21.680]  this is our plan and you will adopt it you will love your servitude Berkeley
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.600]  people clap because they were part of the team and he actually laughs and teases
[41:26.600 --> 41:30.320]  everyone and people thought oh he's exposing the evil no he's saying you
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.400]  cannot stop us and we've got facilities in England and in the US where there
[41:35.400 --> 41:42.320]  are microchips controlling people's brains he said miniaturized electronic
[41:42.320 --> 41:46.960]  systems we're already able to control humans folks everything you see is
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.400]  always 30 years old yep there's the and that's one of the older transistor
[41:52.400 --> 41:56.120]  systems yeah that's probably from the 70s where'd you find that that's a very
[41:56.120 --> 42:01.160]  good job can't see cuz the lights are often there Chris found that well when
[42:01.160 --> 42:06.240]  does it say that that pole metal bug was wirehead jacked there cuz that that
[42:06.240 --> 42:12.400]  looks like a 70s tech job I've seen now 30 plus years ago they had robo rats
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.120]  they're now announcing the robo rats the tech is so small now all there is is an
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.360]  antenna sticking out of their head 30 years ago the robo rats were carrying a
[42:22.360 --> 42:29.840]  little backpack on total control total control and by the way how many troops
[42:29.840 --> 42:35.880]  do you think have volunteered not just for the secret space program how many
[42:35.880 --> 42:42.080]  do you think not have volunteered for the chips I remember about eight years
[42:42.080 --> 42:46.520]  ago I had family a guy who's an officer in the military at a family quasi
[42:46.520 --> 42:53.120]  reunion say I gotta apologize to you they called us in the officers hundreds
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.720]  of us and he told me the university where they met in Texas and said you're
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.840]  all gonna be getting chips under your skin and then about two years later I
[43:01.840 --> 43:08.360]  brought it up and he said don't ask me about that I guess he took it and they've
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.680]  got guys volunteering for brain chips they also give the troops now after
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.800]  combat missions Halcyon type cocktails of amnesics and you get your teeth pulled
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.040]  you don't remember anything they give that to the troops now and folks if you
[43:21.040 --> 43:28.000]  join the military you might as well just sign up to to be in a guinea pig
[43:28.000 --> 43:37.160]  because troops are a lot more plentiful I remember I was talking to my dad and
[43:37.160 --> 43:39.680]  he was telling me a story about when he was in some research projects in
[43:39.680 --> 43:45.080]  college and he said to one of his professors why do they use humans to
[43:45.080 --> 43:52.360]  when for atomic soldier test and things instead of monkeys or things and they
[43:52.360 --> 43:58.760]  said well you the troops are cheaper than monkeys cheaper than apes there's a
[43:58.760 --> 44:06.440]  lot more we're trash and see that's the attitude of these ruling elite it's a
[44:06.440 --> 44:11.720]  power trip that they're on it's a power trip for Bill Gates to be jacking with
[44:11.720 --> 44:16.080]  all your food supply and coming out with every GMO crop there is and already the
[44:16.080 --> 44:23.360]  seven major crops soybeans corn wheat go pull it up the seven major crops are
[44:23.360 --> 44:30.040]  all over 90% GMO now and have infected all the other strains you cannot escape
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.520]  them until you fully wake up and it may be too irrevocable then Monsanto said
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.720]  what 12 years ago they said our plan is to infect everything so you don't have a
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.040]  choice and then and then we'll have court's rule we own everything we
[44:42.040 --> 44:48.040]  infected and that may be an old number they were able to pull up the numbers
[44:48.040 --> 44:57.080]  of things that are genetically modified soybeans 93% corn field maize 86 cotton
[44:57.080 --> 45:04.960]  seed oil cotton seeds 93 alfalfa I don't see a number there 80% Hawaiian
[45:04.960 --> 45:12.200]  papaya is 80% tomatoes it's got different numbers ranging canola 93% sugar
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.800]  cane sugar beet they're just getting started with that thank you for pulling
[45:17.800 --> 45:24.040]  that up what's the source on that it's Wikipedia yeah it's probably old okay
[45:24.040 --> 45:29.760]  let's continue here hmm the cyborgs are coming living brains and planted with
[45:29.760 --> 45:38.440]  electronic chips to replace faulty parts here it is how military robots work
[45:38.440 --> 45:44.560]  science.com and it shows the many tanks wrestling with weapons I was telling
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.440]  you about yesterday and they've got the little hand grenade robots that come in
[45:48.440 --> 45:52.160]  your house and kill you little spiders here's the Washington Post a future for
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.440]  drones automated killing this was last year so now there they are in the air
[45:56.440 --> 45:59.880]  automated they've been for a long time oh but there was no way to remote control
[45:59.880 --> 46:04.400]  the aircraft on 9-11 even though those very aircraft were installed with it and
[46:04.400 --> 46:08.520]  Bush talked about a depress conference they told him to shut up here's another
[46:08.520 --> 46:13.160]  one company introduces low-cost checkpoint security robot national defense
[46:13.160 --> 46:18.000]  with an artificial memory chip rats can remember and forget at the touch of a
[46:18.000 --> 46:25.080]  button ah pop science oh and then that's just an article about radiation being
[46:25.080 --> 46:29.320]  released and I'm shutting down a new plant out in California no big deal
[46:29.320 --> 46:32.760]  they've now said in radiation is no problem you can have a hundred thousand
[46:32.760 --> 46:38.400]  times stuff that before was lethal just type in your new listener FDA raises
[46:38.400 --> 46:41.520]  levels of what they say is safe radiation you can read all the new
[46:41.520 --> 46:47.520]  isotopes this one's 25,000 this one 5,000 this one a thousand this one 100,000
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.080]  and they just drink that milk eat all that stuff it's blowing over sure six
[46:52.080 --> 46:56.880]  months ago from Connecticut on on the East Coast to Washington on the West
[46:56.880 --> 47:01.280]  Coast and water supplies in California huge amounts of radioactive isotopes
[47:01.280 --> 47:06.720]  hey you know what it's okay and of course don't even question why suddenly
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.680]  they're announcing radiation levels going up all over Europe that typed that
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.200]  in from a month ago just mysterious radiation going up in Europe and they
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.640]  say well it's not good for you yeah and they get that they real calmly go on
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.200]  the news they'll be some increased cancer yeah but there we go we'll try to
[47:23.200 --> 47:26.200]  give you some treatments for those cancer no we're not going to discuss why
[47:26.200 --> 47:31.200]  there's radiation going up kind of like yeah yeah several thousand percentage
[47:31.200 --> 47:34.960]  increase in breast cancer in the United States above everybody else but other
[47:34.960 --> 47:40.040]  Western countries that follow the regimen are having increases as well we're not
[47:40.040 --> 47:44.720]  going to discuss why it's becoming like the common cold and why your mama or
[47:44.720 --> 47:49.120]  your wife or your daughter's dying or grandma in fact scroll back down I want
[47:49.120 --> 47:51.800]  to read that headline thank you guys are getting really good at finding stuff
[47:51.800 --> 47:58.080]  better than I know we're gonna find out treatments for it there it is riddle of
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.800]  radiation sweeping across Europe UN nuclear agency mystified by soaring
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.440]  levels I've had Dr. Buzz beyond who is one of the top nuclear physicist and
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.840]  because he's also a chemical physicist who predicted all of this with accuracy
[48:14.840 --> 48:17.960]  and he said a lot of his colleagues believe this is being done on purpose to
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.160]  reduce fertility because nothing screws up chromosomes and reduces fertility
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.200]  like radiation and the globalist have got advanced high-tech treatments where
[48:26.200 --> 48:29.120]  they're going to be able to treat you but only when you merge with the
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.160]  machines and then you'll think oh it's great I'm I'm going blind because of
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.880]  radiation or I can't have kids will take your DNA which they're now doing from
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.000]  regular cells splice them with you want three partners how about a kid that's
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.760]  from five people they're already making those clones they kill them in the test
[48:45.760 --> 48:50.600]  tube they claim of course the Intel and it's leaked in the Washington Post not
[48:50.600 --> 48:56.760]  in China not in Hong Kong not in Costa Rica oh they have got the clones are
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.200]  walking around this is a government that took your blood 40 years ago world
[49:02.200 --> 49:05.840]  blood at birth and put it in a bio weapons database and told you was for
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.480]  blood tests for your baby they do what they want in fact we don't even know
[49:10.480 --> 49:18.320]  how advanced their technologies are okay I've typed that human animal hybrid
[49:18.320 --> 49:25.720]  clones and and then show them embryos from three parents so just it'll be
[49:25.720 --> 49:29.880]  BBC AP Reuters how great it all is and all the mutations of the viruses and the
[49:29.880 --> 49:35.320]  rest of it and hundreds of airborne weaponized Ebola's and flu's and just
[49:35.320 --> 49:45.440]  facilities everywhere all run by chemist and biologist who openly write
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.440]  letters about their PhD papers as they've sent them to me threatening me how
[49:51.440 --> 49:54.600]  dare you talk about about dr. Pionka he doesn't want to kill everyone what most
[49:54.600 --> 50:00.280]  of us do and you won't stop it you know and you know who can say we would be
[50:00.280 --> 50:04.720]  better off getting rid of all humans he won't stop us it's our great work and
[50:04.720 --> 50:07.880]  you know how's that gonna be for your football game and you're in your hot
[50:07.880 --> 50:14.000]  dog roast out by the pool when they when these nutcases pull the 12 monkey
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.720]  scenario then that's it for all this all this junk all this garbage all your
[50:19.720 --> 50:29.640]  ball all of it all your trendiness all of your idiocy all of it down the toilet
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.320]  people revel in their slavery they revel I was reading and the family being
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.640]  dead and they and they call it a talk radio hey it's wonderful it's all dead
[50:38.640 --> 50:41.400]  yeah if you notice everything rotting and falling apart there's all these
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.680]  little self-centered slackers who get off of being lazy bags of scum the new

[55:32.240 --> 55:35.720]  three-year-old with the military searching her so it's all part of just
[55:35.720 --> 55:39.520]  overthrowing due process overthrowing everything and police now are going in
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.280]  houses without warrants everywhere and there's all these movies where it's
[55:43.280 --> 55:47.040]  where where it's celebrated breaking in without warrants and that's how you get
[55:47.040 --> 55:50.640]  the bad guy like this movie I just watched yesterday law-abiding citizen I
[55:50.640 --> 55:56.240]  mean it's just pure programming well now and this story is on the right hand side
[55:56.240 --> 56:02.320]  of the drudge report it's of course from info wars.com as you can see it at
[56:02.320 --> 56:08.720]  drudgereport.com full body scanners at Superbowl 2012 first time devices linked
[56:08.720 --> 56:16.760]  with cancer first time devices that have been linked and confirmed to be linked
[56:16.760 --> 56:22.440]  to cancer risk will be used at public sports event and I've got AP articles
[56:22.440 --> 56:25.720]  with the FBI has said they're going to be at shopping malls everywhere can you
[56:25.720 --> 56:29.000]  imagine how much money churned off who put the first order in as the homeland
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.960]  security ed will make now that he heads up the company and it just goes over all
[56:34.960 --> 56:39.080]  of it local news is reporting that you will be put into a naked body scanner
[56:39.080 --> 56:44.440]  and everywhere from the ankles to the neck will be searched and they will
[56:44.440 --> 56:49.040]  squeeze your genitals so first it was just pat you down now they're gonna
[56:49.040 --> 56:53.360]  they're gonna let you know it's all about people getting your comfort zone and
[56:53.360 --> 57:00.880]  TSA will be there commanding the local security isn't that just special US no
[57:00.880 --> 57:06.040]  fly list of suspect terrorist doubles in 12 months last time I saw it was 2
[57:06.040 --> 57:10.880]  million I don't know what this London Guardian says 21,000 I give you a
[57:10.880 --> 57:15.520]  newscast from 2016 it had doubled from 1 million over 2 and then they made it
[57:15.520 --> 57:22.120]  secret but I guess this is a specific list they're saying of people they say
[57:22.120 --> 57:25.920]  are terrorist you mean like a locky who hung out secretly the Pentagon or the
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.120]  underwear bar me gone the plane I mean those guys they say it's 21,000 of these
[57:30.120 --> 57:35.880]  people that they think are known terrorist known to oh yeah the Pentagon
[57:35.880 --> 57:38.760]  itself says there's less than a hundred al-qaeda in all of Afghanistan but
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.960]  that's okay because Google is to allow censorship of blogger content worldwide
[57:43.960 --> 57:48.480]  and Twitter's announcing it see I told you they didn't want the recording
[57:48.480 --> 57:52.960]  industry controlling it through a law in Congress they're just gonna do it with
[57:52.960 --> 57:56.840]  the governments and Google admitted in the US and England they're taking stuff
[57:56.840 --> 58:01.680]  down that's seen as anti-government or what was the exact quote critical of the
[58:01.680 --> 58:06.000]  government and they take it down and they've delisted us from Google News and
[58:06.000 --> 58:12.600]  they've delisted us in many other ways so I mean they're already doing it gonna
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.600]  stand for freedom info wars comm prison planet comms the test that's why we're
[58:17.600 --> 58:20.840]  using some of their own platforms to fight back against them and I'm gonna
[58:20.840 --> 58:24.320]  make that announcement coming up at the start of the second segment and we've
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.000]  got Gerald Salente popping in and then we've got the one the only Fritz
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.720]  Springmeyer for a detailed report but I've covered covered about 70% of what I
[58:32.720 --> 58:35.680]  want to get to at least skimming the service I want to get into more detail
[58:35.680 --> 58:49.440]  as well as in planet TV this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:48.840 --> 1:00:01.160]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

[1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:28.480]  Alex Jones you know I had wanted to air most of it today I may have to on Sunday
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:33.280]  I did an amazing interview with Gerald Salente it's like 45 minutes long
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:37.480]  commercial free last night on the nightly news he was really on fire we heard a
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:42.560]  lot of key topics but I'm gonna play just a few clips when we come back in
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:50.040]  the next segment also we've had listeners point out that since Google and I
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:54.200]  wish I would have used it more before they changed the algorithm since Google
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:01:00.120]  changed things has changed their whole system to stop our Google bombs we still
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:03.800]  do them a little bit but it just doesn't it's not guaranteed maybe third of the
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:06.800]  time we tried it works and then they just knock it down that was certainly
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:12.120]  good ball lasted we need to do more of this so it's up to you to do these tests
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:14.760]  and we're trying to learn about these systems and then to give us feedback
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:19.560]  about it we're gonna do a Twitter bomb and something new we done a Twitter bomb
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:25.440]  once and it worked pretty well we're gonna do a reddit bomb a reddit bomb on
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:35.240]  our article that is up on the drugs report where did that go I just had it
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:41.840]  full body scanners at Super Bowl 2012 it's red linked on info wars dot com and
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:47.440]  prisonplanet.com but you can also it's from the right hand side in amongst
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.360]  other Super Bowl news there on the drugs report a headline full body
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:55.960]  scanners at Super Bowl 2012 first-time devices linked with cancer risk used
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:01.680]  for public sports event we're going to ask our sizable audience fighting back
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:07.440]  against the censorship when I come back from break to do everything you can to
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:13.760]  retweet but to also go to the link at the bottom of the article at info wars
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:19.560]  dot com at the bottom of the article we've added a reddit link where Paul
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:29.920]  posted it and we want you to go vote it up and we'll see if they do what dig used
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:33.320]  to do when dig was a lot big for they started censoring and you know destroyed
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:37.680]  themselves the traffic went on dramatically we didn't develop it listeners
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:42.520]  would would would would dig our articles and it would go to the top and then they
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:47.880]  just banned any info wars or prison plan you know that's what's frustrating is
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:55.480]  is you win it's like Ron Paul in fact that was from yesterday it went up last
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:00.280]  night we get out of the archive the feature news archive so much of our top
[1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:05.160]  news scrolls off into tiny little link under a text ad I want to tell the IT
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:12.040]  guys make that a bigger blue link or a red link to that archive where where Ron
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:16.960]  Paul has been shot out of the CPAC now he won that like like Reagan did the
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:22.640]  coveted CPAC two years in a row nobody's ever done that and that shows that most
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:26.120]  conservatives and libertarians there actually like Ron Paul just like he
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:29.840]  wins all the straw polls and it shows there's election fraud it shows he's
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:33.120]  winning every other metric all you see all over the country are Ron Paul
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:39.120]  stickers endorsement signs but in these states known for fraud he's getting
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.800]  trounced like a lot of polls show he's number one in Nevada the news isn't even
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:46.880]  talking about him in Nevada I saw a few articles saying he can win in Nevada but
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:54.800]  instead it's all about the scumbag Donald Trump endorsing Newt Gennrich I
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:58.640]  mean that's all you need to know this is a casino owner Democratic operative who
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:04.400]  gives double to the Democrats and he's a joke and I'm not even saying that Ron
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:08.840]  he's good obviously I'm not I'm just saying every scumbag is endorsing Newt
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  Gennrich give me an attacking Ron Paul so you can't win I'm an arrogant front
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:18.200]  for you know globalist money I go bankrupt all the time and the investors
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:25.680]  get left outside I mean he's just a big foppish goofball a nobody a front man a
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:31.640]  bag man a nobody Trump's a joke a preening peacock everything that's wrong
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.600]  with this world prancing around constantly in public makes you want to
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:41.360]  throw up the point is and giving all his advice out a bunch of deception the
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:45.400]  point about him is he's saying Ron Paul can't win so yeah there's the article
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:49.440]  oh they're gonna have Romney and Gennrich there too globalist but not Ron
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:54.000]  Paul why because he's gonna win oh don't put them on the football field don't
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.440]  put that horse out there in the Kentucky Derby it'll win we don't want
[1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:00.000]  winners
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:06.400]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:11.920]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:15.640]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:20.720]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:26.120]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:31.000]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.440]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:39.160]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:43.080]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:48.640]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:54.760]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars com or

[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:05.000]  them as an archive because with this caza type software they can delete my
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.800]  voice off the entire internet once it's all on cloud systems I mean it's
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.240]  already happened and I've called the company and and and said why we're the
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:19.920]  endgame if anybody uploads 30 seconds to YouTube or other channels it won't let
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:26.400]  them upload it this is pre restraint all because I went through a distributor
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:30.120]  that then signed it to a catalog of a Canadian company try to put in game in
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.800]  stores I hold the copyright it's in my contract that I can give it out free on
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:39.360]  the internet and you notice they left a few channels they think are mine up but
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:43.680]  everywhere else you can't put 30 seconds of in game now on the web they can hit
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:48.120]  one buttons and it'll start like a virus erasing my voice forever your voice
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:55.560]  this is what their cloud system their centralized internet to is all about so
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:03.600]  you start page use other proxy systems stop using the globalist operation
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:08.200]  stop using their grid because they're spying on you with it you name it but
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:11.080]  it's really coming to a head we got Fritz spring mark coming up with an
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:15.160]  incredible report John's gotten together a bunch of video clips from eyes wide
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:20.200]  shut the Good Shepherd another mainstream media where they basically show
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:25.600]  you the mainstream fiction quasi history like the Good Shepherd where they show
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:29.440]  you what's happening in reality through fiction in the case of eyes wide shut
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:33.280]  then a bunch of news articles about Tony Blair and the occult and Francois
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:37.840]  Mineron and the occult and just a lot of other Rothschilds wearing devil

[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:47.880]  their connections to that that's all coming up when he joins us and we found
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:52.160]  the dead link to the old Times of London article but it's dead about the
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:55.560]  tortured women escaping the castle I mean this stuff's getting removed off the
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:00.360]  web folks they're removing the articles where the Rockefellers admitted
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:03.160]  they're having meetings with Bill Gates about reducing population with Oprah
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:13.040]  Winfrey and Ted Turner and and Soros one disgusting crew of scum now I want
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.680]  everybody to listen to me carefully listeners have advised as they did we
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:20.560]  start the Google bomb they've now blocked us on that very effective weapon
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:24.360]  while we had it wish I would have used it more when we had it but boy what

[1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:18.360]  lot of news we haven't gotten to yet but here's Gerald Salente when I brought up
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:23.160]  to him the fact that they're now saying MF money vaporized and disappeared now
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:26.960]  they're saying they found it again they've done that about seven times so
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:30.840]  they're just stringing people along they know day one where the money was wired
[1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:35.680]  and they're acting like they don't know and they're acting like Corzine didn't
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:39.600]  purge himself and they're acting in Congress like the Justice Department
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:42.960]  didn't purge or themselves by the way there is a daily caller article and it's
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:47.160]  it's got it all in there about just department paid off by Cayman Island
[1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:52.120]  officials and people to of course how do you think all these big rich billionaires
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.680]  are allowed to have tax shelters that you or I couldn't have whenever you hear
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:59.680]  about a tax shelter getting busted in the Caymans or in Switzerland that you
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:03.240]  know it's some guy that put a million bucks in there over 20 years you know
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:07.040]  some guy that owned a restaurant that's not a rich guy that's just a middle upper
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:10.480]  middle-class person that makes the economy go who was who who who who who
[1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:14.680]  lawyers told you can put the money here no no they only let the big boys put
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.600]  their billions and it's just it's a mafia but let's get to a little bit from
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:24.240]  Salente here from the nightly news last night the basics Gerald Salente joins us
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:28.120]  to give us his take on that and the rest of the world economy Gerald thank you so
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:32.560]  much for coming on with us oh it's always my pleasure being on with you Alex man I
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:38.920]  tell you you couldn't write this stuff in a weird science fiction attempt at at
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:43.720]  satire Kurt Vonnegut as you know wrote books about cartoonishly police state
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:50.160]  absurdist future realities this out does any of that Gerald well it it out does
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:56.560]  it and but it what it is is clear it's the writing of prostitutes look how
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:02.360]  they use the language vaporized yeah just just disappeared it vaporized could
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:07.160]  you imagine if one of the white shoe boys didn't do this how about enough
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:12.680]  an Italian or somebody like you know a mafia guy was caught oh boy would it be
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:17.360]  different how about if it was somebody that they didn't like was caught oh it
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:23.400]  would be a whole different story vaporized it was like the wall street
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:31.200]  journals guy who wrote the story came from JP Morgan Chase Alex everybody I
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:39.920]  know in the industry knows that Corzine knew JP Morgan Chase knew everybody
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:46.680]  knew it was coming down but look Corzine raised a what five hundred thousand
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:53.440]  dollars plus recently for the Obama campaign so it's a hands-off for him
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:58.680]  yeah anybody that breaks the minor little infraction of the law man they
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:08.880]  got you and Jackie are dead but not him November December January February four
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:15.840]  months four months this thing has been going on oh we can't find one point two
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:23.280]  billion dollars who could get away with this only them and only with the help of
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:29.840]  the prostitutes well I just showed a headline where they were saying you're
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:33.920]  just out of luck with your money I mean when you wire a thousand dollars there's
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:38.480]  a record when you are over 10,000 a criminal investigation is open he
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:43.840]  wires 1.2 billion the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as you know
[1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:49.280]  comes out and says hey he was involved he did give the order but Corzine says
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:54.920]  hey I wasn't involved as CEO in this I mean and he gets caught lying and no one
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:58.520]  gets in trouble Obama gets caught shipping guns in the Mexico to blame the
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:02.760]  Second Amendment he's not getting in trouble I mean this is ruled by criminals
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:06.840]  Gerald when is it going to end how bad is it going to get because if they're
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:10.280]  getting away with this hell they might just start doing with black water didn't
[1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:13.880]  I rack according to federal documents just shooting people for fun I mean why
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:17.360]  not I mean maybe maybe you know Corzine will show up at your door with a crap
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:22.680]  sandwich and make you eat it I mean I mean whoa he's God I guess well again and
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:27.720]  he's not alone here this is from the Financial Times just on the 30th
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:36.280]  January 30th Moody's quote did not understand 6.3 billion MF global bet on
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:41.680]  European debt Moody's investor services did quote did not have any
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:48.760]  understanding that MF global the failed futures broker had placed a 6.3
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:54.160]  billion dollar proprietary bet on the debt of troubled European sovereigns
[1:28:54.160 --> 1:29:01.120]  until about a week until about a week before the brokerage filed for bankruptcy
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:08.320]  Moody's these are the people that rated all of that junk AAA these are supposed
[1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:15.720]  to be the rating agencies oh we didn't have an understanding it's all a fix the
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:21.560]  whole game is rigged and they're screwing every one of us look how they
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:28.000]  get away with that kind of crap and listen Alex as you know that's why I
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:35.880]  believe that President Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization
[1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:42.120]  Act so now it allows the military to take out people like you and me who
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:47.440]  complain all right because absolutely the whole thing is crashing down as you

[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:39.800]  this we've done a lot of basic dredging of research I'd already done over the
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:45.200]  years but I asked John bound to go back one of our nightly news coordinators and
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:50.080]  he also works from the radio shows a producer I asked him to go back and I
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.880]  just said search this and and you can do this to you'll find a lot more than
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:56.680]  we're gonna present here because it's it's one thing to find something to get
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:39:00.040]  it and put it to graphics and video and show it to you here and if you're a
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:04.720]  radio listener a new listener you're going show it to us yes we're blasting
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:09.520]  out on XM 166 over a hundred AM and FM affiliates and global shortwave WWCR
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:14.480]  hundred thousand watt blowtorch so that's our big audience but I got sick
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:19.360]  many years ago going back 17 years ago first getting on air with people saying
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:23.280]  you're making that up so I created info wars.com so whatever I covered that
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:29.080]  night doing it myself at first and then in my girlfriend and you know and then
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:32.640]  folks I hired updating whatever main stories I was gonna cover I would just
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:38.880]  post links to them or legislation so you know I wasn't making it up and then I
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:43.720]  said why not just start putting the show to video so it's all right there so I
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:47.440]  mean because we post a link to stuff and the Washington Post can take it down
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:51.840]  but if I show it to you here or I show you a video clip or I show you Rothschild's
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:57.280]  wearing devil necklaces or I show you articles about Francois Mitterrand the
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:01.480]  former French leader you could find all these articles about him obsessed with
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:08.080]  Lucifer Luciferian rituals him involved in all sorts of weird activity his
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:14.560]  commissioning of the Louvre pink pyramid with 666 pieces of glass I had a
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:17.600]  professor on a few years ago that published a book where they admit that
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:22.600]  the big parliaments in Ottawa and other areas in the provincial capitals are
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:27.320]  all built to a cultic specifications of 666 and it's admitted and they shut them
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:32.800]  down into rituals in them a lot of public buildings they shut down areas of
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:36.240]  them and do rituals in them and again this is these are the religions that
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:40.600]  predate Christianity that had to go underground under that they don't call
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:49.240]  themselves devil worshipers the devil is their God Lucifer the lightbearer and
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:55.240]  there's really 360 degrees in the Illuminati Masonic system low-level
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:59.320]  mason's don't even know this and early on we're not part of it because it even
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:06.080]  masonry goes back to Solomon and secret knowledge and that was more of the you
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:13.280]  call it the the right hand of Jewish mysticism itself that came out of well
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:18.160]  after captivity Babylonian and and the Zohar the rest of it but but that's all
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:24.320]  new compared to the Egyptian this all is Egyptian and then it went into Greece and
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:28.200]  then that went into Rome this is the system the the and they're all about
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:35.560]  knowledge how humans operate study of knowledge control but within this these
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.120]  larger schools of mystery school many of which see themselves as altruistic
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:45.640]  always at the core the violent the psychopathic the murdering the most
[1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:50.920]  brutal always take control so I'm giving you giving you this from their
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:56.960]  perspective you understand that in this whole occult universe which just means
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:02.080]  hidden it's all the colors the rainbow but always at the heart of it are the
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:09.960]  most vicious murdering child-killing people you can imagine skull and bones
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.200]  bohemian Grove all of it it is about how ruthless you can be and you see this
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:17.960]  manifested we're going to Fritz there in a moment I want to preface this you see
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:24.360]  this manifested in every organized crime syndicate whether they be Russian
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:31.440]  Italian Jewish Latin American you've got to kill an innocent to really get into
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:37.080]  the inner sanctum go kill that old lady go rob an old man in a truck and shoot
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:40.080]  him in the head we want to see it on the news go go kill a kid in the
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:42.440]  playground
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:50.880]  even in many branches of the Likosa Nostra they burn images of Jesus and Mary
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.320]  and say a little devilish prayer it's like showing that you'll really get into
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:01.000]  something wicked and you got a bohemian Grove that's just a gateway to the
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.920]  pedophile stuff that they do off-site from our research it's like okay be part
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:12.000]  of this or we don't trust you so it's basically rolling around in the sess is
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:17.240]  how you become part of the club and they constantly in different European
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:19.960]  countries you can just type it up government officials cotton pedophile
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:23.920]  scandal government officials caught in a cult scandal just start page search
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:30.240]  engine these terms use the search engine search them Rothschild's the occult
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:36.320]  Tony Blair the occult Hillary Clinton the occult Tony Blair spirit of the light
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:39.400]  he it's in the London Guardian of their articles he flops around the ground every
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:42.320]  morning and is possessed by it I mean you can't make this up
[1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:48.720]  Francois Mitterrand running around doing Luciferian rituals Ronald Reagan
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:54.880]  obsessed with his astrologer which is just a offshoot of all this and what
[1:43:54.880 --> 1:44:00.160]  color tie he wore and when he spoke to the minute according to it this is what
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:04.680]  goes on you know about Hollywood the occult and the rolling stones and a
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:09.600]  sacrifice dead black child and no one got in trouble because government
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:14.720]  officials were there reportedly you didn't know about that look it up John
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:18.760]  Lennon they try to course to recruit him into this that's why his later music was
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:24.080]  all about Luciferianism being bad devil worship being bad population control
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:31.480]  being bad how the elite are devils and so they killed him look at eyes wide shut
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:35.800]  Stanley Kubrick who you better believe got invited to things like this and
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:39.200]  there's names very similar to George Soros in it as you know the bad guy
[1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:43.600]  character and his wife he finds out's really an occultist and they he died a
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:47.600]  day after refusing to cut 24 minutes of it well they cut it you better believe
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:53.040]  they cut out of this film and and I'm showing some video go ahead and play
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:56.600]  some audio with that as well start that over
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:03.120]  now keep it rolling there so and then we also have a clip of a French film
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:10.080]  showing this but I want to again explain they don't see themselves as devil
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:18.360]  worshipers and what they do is they finally get population to accept public
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.880]  sacrifice the Romans would sacrifice people at a funeral and then that became
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:28.560]  a stylized fight between the slaves then it became gladiators the Greeks actually
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:34.320]  engage in human sacrifice they sacrifice their children they throw them off
[1:45:34.320 --> 1:45:43.640]  clips here's a clip a clip from love Empire new redemption and they have you
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:47.200]  know the lady commit suicide under mind control that's part of one of their
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:52.040]  rituals they all put their little mask on now and again this is how the system
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:56.440]  throws in your face we have photos of top Rothschild family members wearing
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:01.640]  bathomet necklaces at sporting events I mean old women with giant chains around
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:06.480]  their neck and lean a $5,000 gown with bathomet I mean this is what they're
[1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:11.360]  into because it's all about your animals we're gonna eat you see they don't just
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:15.520]  kill us they embrace it now I give you Fritz spring my author of bloodlines
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.000]  the Illuminati he's gonna speak about 30 minutes then we'll open the phones up in
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.440]  last 45 but he joined us today Fritz spring my bloodlines the Illuminati
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:27.720]  available at info wars.com and when I read this it had to be I don't know 99 or
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:31.080]  so I don't remember I was sent a copy but on air a few years I was like this
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:35.160]  can't be true but that over the years so much of it turned out to be true I mean
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:38.320]  I was there at Bohemian Grove when they were doing the mock ritual of killing a
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:41.800]  child and the old man I was like this is interesting they're like be quiet they
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:47.480]  were just going like I mean they were this was religious I mean I've been in
[1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:50.600]  Baptist churches and holy rolling churches growing up folks and these
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:53.680]  people are getting off on it more than Christians worshiping God I mean they
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:47:00.000]  were in rapture Fritz spring my are good to have you here with us my friend thank
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  you allies good to be with you and all your listeners I do you agree or
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:10.160]  disagree with anything I just said in the last 10 minutes I thought you were
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:15.120]  doing a good job of covering things okay I'm gonna just do something I don't have
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:19.040]  a problem with well thank you my friend I'm gonna this segment and the next few
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:22.320]  I'm gonna just sit back whatever issues you want to cover about the ruling
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:26.000]  elite the families who they are what whatever direction you want to go in I
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:29.240]  know you sent some photos we're gonna put on screen radio listeners can later
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:33.120]  go to info wars.com we'll post the videos by tomorrow of this interview so
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:38.640]  people can check this for themselves but you've got the floor Fritz okay well
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:45.720]  thank you you mentioned a couple things that were were related to what I had in
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:51.560]  mind one is as you mentioned Philippine the Rothschild and I wanted to I wanted
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:56.480]  to bring out some of the misconceptions about the the Illuminati and one of the
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:02.560]  misconceptions is is that the Rothschilds are a European phenomenon but the
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:10.720]  Philippine Rothschild she and her husband the Baron went into business with
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:18.760]  Robert Mendovi down in Napa Valley California so we've got Rothschilds all
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:24.040]  across the United States this that family is not just a European phenomenon
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:30.760]  and you're going to show a picture of her that you have so that's great I also
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:37.080]  wanted to discuss along that line some of the other misconceptions that people
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:43.520]  have about the Illuminati one of them is is that all of these members in the
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:48.560]  Illuminati are kingpins in the Illuminati that's sort of like imagining
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:54.480]  that that within a tribe all of them are chiefs it's not the case some of these
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:49:00.960]  people are just low-level flunkies it's just like an analogy is like there's
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:07.600]  millions of gods in Hinduism you know you have Vishnu and Tara and Shiva and
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:13.600]  Kali but a lot of these the majority of gods nobody's even heard of them they're
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:24.100]  obscure so some of these illuminated members of the Illuminati are not
[1:49:24.100 --> 1:49:32.000]  kingpins in any shape or form they're not they're not all chiefs in this tribe
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:40.480]  but your pillars of society are very oftentimes Illuminati and that's one of
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:46.240]  the misconceptions to that people have is you know when we get into discussing
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:50.160]  these people you know we we can look at the dark side of them like you are
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:57.760]  bringing out there's a dark side to them but to make another analogy when we
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:03.000]  when Christians read the Bible and they they read about the Pharisees they see
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.680]  all the negative things that Christ said about them oh you're these people are
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:11.200]  snakes you know and they think that the Pharisees were just horrible but if you
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:17.080]  lived back then who were the Pharisees they were the people's role models they
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:23.240]  a Pharisee had a lot of power he was the equivalent of several things wrapped up
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:30.800]  in one it not only was he the equivalent of a Supreme Court justice but also a
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:37.920]  congressman and the head of a Bible college and a judge yeah and they had
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:42.040]  the reputation of somebody like Billy Graham so these were the people that
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:48.520]  that a mother would want her child to emulate I want my son to grow up to be
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:52.000]  like that Pharisee you know and it was so we're dealing with the same thing
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:58.800]  today these these Illuminati kingpins a lot of them are pillars in society some
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:03.680]  of them their occupation is philanthropist a philanthropist that means
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:10.520]  he spent his time giving money away so it's not like they're they're not doing
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:18.240]  good deeds it's not like that like they're just Fritz let me stop you
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:23.720]  Fritz you're skype them Fritz you're skype's breaking up a bit it was great
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:26.920]  last week we may have to reconnect I haven't skipped the break here to give
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:30.080]  you time but then it started sort of breaking up but just to be clear Bill
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:35.800]  Gates put his 80 billion in a tax-free foundation it makes money and now it's
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:41.000]  tax-free and he's buying up big pharma everything and living off of it and then
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:46.720]  using what money the profit it makes to steer society but then we're told oh
[1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:54.400]  he's giving to us yeah he's giving us poison GMO yes their giving is within
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:52:00.200]  their own self-interests and promotes their agendas yes yeah it's not
[1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:06.440]  altruistic like alike we might think can you hear me better you're better now
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:22.080]  go ahead okay so just letting people realize that they're the ones who
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:26.120]  created the system they're making a large share of the important decisions of
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:31.000]  this system if they were to evaporate and all disappear we would not have the
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:37.040]  system like we have it today because they play an important role in things
[1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:42.360]  unfortunately a lot of the agendas and decisions that they're making are are
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:50.520]  really scary if they were to dissent all disappear tomorrow I feel confident we
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:55.040]  wouldn't have such large wars like the Cold War World War two World War one
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:53:00.040]  these are manufactured wars that they created and one of the things that people
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:05.160]  read about in the bloodlines book they will see the document there that the
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:13.000]  secretary of the treasure of Morgenthau and FDR put in the law on December 13th
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:20.760]  1941 a few days after Pearl Harbor they very quietly made this law that allows
[1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:24.960]  certain people to trade with the enemy and who are the types of people that
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:32.520]  could trade with the enemy on asses Rockefeller oh these people are
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:39.320]  Illuminati king pins making big butts off of off of World War two there were
[1:53:39.320 --> 1:53:47.400]  like 450 Greek ships prior to a World War two almost all of them were sunk at
[1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:53.480]  some point or the other in different places around the world by by the two
[1:53:53.480 --> 1:53:59.960]  sides because we had a world war going on however Aristotle and asses the ships
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:05.840]  were never attacked no matter where they were sailing and they sailed to all
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:10.040]  parties let me just stop you let me just stop you guys you can pull up all
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:15.520]  he's talking because this is so key only Halliburton was allowed under the
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:21.080]  sanctions in the last decade plus to sell oil-filled equipment to Iran and the
[1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:24.320]  same thing they were allowed with a handful of groups to sell to Saddam
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:29.240]  they put the sanctions in to shut down all their competition it's the same
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.200]  trick get to know what page of the book that documents on I want to show it to
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:41.480]  people great um it's uh I don't right hand cuz right off hand I'll look in the
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:46.120]  bibliography what would that be under trading with the enemy I'll look it up
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:57.040]  keep going um so yeah so we we have wars that are are created manufactured
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:04.000]  wars you got a lot of this a lot of the storylines I just laugh because they
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:09.720]  remind me of back to the future and Biff you know you have this like Aristotle
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:21.480]  on NASA's uh his family was from Turkey and he goes to Argentina as about I
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:27.360]  think he was like 19 when he went to Argentina Buenos Aires and he was washing
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:33.880]  dishes and arrived as a refugee penniless and within a year he was a
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:42.320]  millionaire um and people say well he just worked long hours at washing dishes
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:49.480]  what was their family involved in back in Turkey well it was applying opium and
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:55.760]  uh there's a group of men in Europe that have made decisions the council of
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:03.400]  300 300 men wise men that for a couple centuries at least have made the
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:09.320]  decisions for Europe and they decided which families would be allowed to trade
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:13.440]  in the opium one of the families that they decided that they would allow to
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:19.280]  become rich was the Astor family so we have another Biff and back to the future
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.320]  story where we have this guy John Jacob Astor the first and I sent you a picture
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:32.720]  of him the guy was a butcher helping his dad and then he he comes to America and
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:40.560]  his brother in New York City was given a monopoly by the British when they were
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:45.600]  controlling New York City during the American Revolution he was given a
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:50.520]  monopoly by the British to supply the beef for the British army to occupy
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:59.240]  New York City during the war what a lucrative monopoly and strangely nobody
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:05.400]  ever wonders or questions someone like John Jacob Astor about his his British
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:09.880]  affiliations you would think that after Americans had fought a war against
[1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:15.160]  Britain it would be suspicious of well let me let me back you up let me back
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:19.720]  you up it's admitted with skull and bones we're gonna reconnect after the
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:22.240]  break with you on Scout to make sure it's a little bit clearer but most of
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:27.680]  it's clear for it's but key information the trading with the enemy you know type
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:34.280]  stuff look at skull and bones look at the bushes the the main US agents of the
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:37.560]  Nazis allowed to get away with it backing up what you said and that's what
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:40.480]  they say about skull and bones and the documents that have been leaked you're
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:44.960]  given money and power but you're you're told it's always given to the group
[1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:50.480]  and you're gonna be given this money but but only to to control it for the
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:55.120]  collective and that's like Bill Gates his dad's army intelligence some out of
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:59.800]  nowhere head of Planned Parenthood big eugenicist his son is then given we've
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:04.400]  now documented technologies that were there allowed to have the monopoly for
[1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:09.400]  a while IBM gives it away to him that run by Watson the big eugenicist who said
[1:58:09.400 --> 1:58:13.760]  in his you know deathbed we've got to set up all these subsidiaries so that you
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:19.360]  know we get around the the the laws on monopolies I mean you just see it and
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:23.160]  and yeah here's that document for all the big US companies were allowed to fund
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:26.600]  Hitler right through the war and I've talked to pilots in there most of them
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.960]  are dead now but it's on record that they couldn't bomb the General Motors and
[1:58:29.960 --> 1:58:34.280]  Ford plants in Germany that were making the tanks our troops were fighting the
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:44.720]  whole thing was a new world war against humanity you are listening to GCN

[2:00:13.160 --> 2:00:23.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[2:00:34.160 --> 2:00:40.160]  Okay, he's with us for the entire next hour. Wasn't that for two hours? There's just so much
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:44.660]  news I had to get to but understanding these people I don't believe they're a
[2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:49.160]  bunch of crazy occultists in a in an ancient mafia that predates Christianity
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:53.480]  so of course it's a cult that's what was there before that. I know it and there's
[2:00:53.480 --> 2:00:58.800]  so much evidence of it. I was just showing Baroness Philippine de Rothschild with
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:04.360]  devil necklaces, bathroomette necklaces at public events. This is an old woman who
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:08.240]  looks like you know something out of a nightmare movie looks like a Janet
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:12.320]  Apolitano or something and she's got devil necklaces and then I've got all
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:17.160]  the lore and the news articles and the connections to the Rothschilds and the
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:21.560]  occult and the and funding occult groups and the Rockefellers and then of
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.000]  course you also talk about you know the guy that they made the movie Rosebud or
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:32.560]  Citizen Kane about the Hearst dynasty. I mean and I've been to his castle in
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:36.600]  California it's devils and demons and pentagrams everywhere and of course
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:42.280]  he's reportedly involved in all this. Please continue. Yeah while we're on
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:48.120]  William Randolph Hearst okay let's see it says something here about my
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:51.480]  connection. Am I still connected? You're still connected. We're gonna reconnect
[2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:56.360]  during the next break though. Go ahead. Okay well speaking about William Randolph
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:01.320]  Hearst I sent you a picture of him because he's riding on a carousel and
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:06.520]  those people that have gotten in touch with my books on the mind control will
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:13.600]  recognize that the carousel is used in programming children and Patty Hearst
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:20.280]  being programmed with Illuminati Mind Control, programmed multiple personality
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:24.600]  and then you mentioned the Hearst mansion which follows right in
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:29.080]  line with something else that you were saying. The state of California has
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:34.440]  taken over the maintenance of his mansion but on when it's closed I know
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:41.040]  people have informed me that when they close that off to the public they will
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:47.240]  oftentimes have Illuminati rituals quietly on the property. So yes the
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:54.560]  Sansimian mansion there is is definitely some Illuminati ritual
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:58.520]  properties. I gotta stop you again. Your book talks about Patty Hearst being
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:02.880]  under mind control program. Now it's come out saying she was basically mind
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:06.960]  controlled and that the FBI knew it and that the government was involved with
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:15.480]  her. That stuff you wrote about 17 years ago. Yes. Wow okay so yeah that's one of
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:21.080]  the things that just like you're saying when people read this if they
[2:03:21.080 --> 2:03:26.600]  find something hard to believe just put it on the shelf because maybe in a year
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:31.280]  or two years you're gonna start seeing the proof for yourself. You're gonna see
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:39.080]  it before your eyes because now your eyes are open. Yeah it's all around us. Every
[2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:43.320]  day I see this stuff and I kind of just any more just tune it out because it's
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:51.760]  just you know I've gotten so used to it being all around. So Aster was this
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:58.360]  it's interesting how they they choose these people because John Jacob Aster
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:04.240]  was not somebody that you would think typically would become the most richest
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:10.880]  man in the United States which he did. When he arrived in the United States he
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:14.960]  couldn't speak English and when he tried to it sounded like he had marbles in
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:21.680]  his mouth. He was a very crude unsocial man. Stop right there long segment coming
[2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:25.240]  up. I don't want to start over with this. This is too important. You're breaking up
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:30.240]  a bit. We're gonna reconnect with you and come back with Fritz Springer on the
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:35.000]  other side. The book is Bloodlines of the Illuminati full of documentation and
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.760]  just whenever Fritz says something there's all these connections to just
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:43.420]  proving all of it about how it's all rigged both sides of a war how they're
[2:04:43.420 --> 2:04:47.480]  always allowed to trade with the enemy and vice versa and then they'll even
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:50.800]  betray their minion like Hitler and then it comes out there were secret
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:55.160]  treaties with Hitler in England and that's why Rudolf Hess flew there and it
[2:04:55.160 --> 2:05:00.720]  just did all his stage. It's incredible. We'll be right back.
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:06.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:11.280]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda
[2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:15.960]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:20.680]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shot
[2:05:20.680 --> 2:05:26.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:30.040]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal
[2:05:30.040 --> 2:05:34.720]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:38.360]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:05:38.360 --> 2:05:41.920]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:05:41.920 --> 2:05:47.160]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:05:47.160 --> 2:05:52.840]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:07:58.840 --> 2:08:09.240]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:20.160]  We're talking to Fritz Springmeier about how the Illuminati ticks, how this
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:25.360]  global occultic mafia operates, and going over a lot of the evidence of it.
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:28.520]  When you start looking into this stuff, most of it's hidden right in plain view,
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:32.360]  all the symbolism, the elites always getting caught involved in the occult.
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:36.800]  We're doing a Twitter bomb right now trying to expose the naked body
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:41.240]  scanners at the Super Bowl that one local news agency went to cover
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:46.040]  preparations and took photos and covered it, but no national news
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:51.520]  except for infowars.com and the Drudge Report linking to us is covering it. Full
[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:55.560]  body scanners at Super Bowl 2012, first-time devices linked with cancer
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:08:59.400]  risk used for public sports events. After he gets more of the Illuminati, I want to
[2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:05.040]  ask why they're doing the GMO, the poison, the aspartame, the bisphenol,
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:10.120]  the radiation, reactors leaking radiation on a weekly basis now. I've talked
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:13.560]  to physicists and people on the inside who think it's being done on purpose to
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:17.240]  reduce fertility. I mean, what's their master plan on that front?
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:20.520]  I want to throw that question at Fritz Springmeier. If you go to the bottom of
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:25.440]  our article at infowars.com, there's a link to Reddit. We're trying to do a Reddit
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:29.760]  bomb here because I'm told by listeners that's really important to do. It's got a
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:37.680]  lot of comments and a ton of votes and we're trying to push it to the top. So
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:46.200]  please get into that story and send full body scanners at Super Bowl 2012. Please
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:56.760]  vote out at the top of Reddit and I also want to have you get it and even more
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:10:02.360]  importantly, get it out on Twitter at twitter.com for real Alex Jones. Get our
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.080]  Twitter on it. Get this trending boycott the Super Bowl over their use of
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:12.960]  cancer-causing body scanners. Use pound Super Bowl scanners and then that will
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:17.080]  center the article that breaks this down. So let's let's kick some behind in on
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:20.160]  that. I want to thank everybody for getting involved. Okay, continuing with
[2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:24.760]  breaking down your book, Bloodlines the Illuminati Fritz Springmeier. Now back in
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:31.320]  print available at infowars.com and we are selling these quick. We can always
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:35.880]  reprint because I helped Fritz reprint but that'll take a month or so. So I
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:39.160]  recommend you get your order in before we run out of these. They're selling a
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:41.400]  lot faster than I even thought they would and that's good. People are
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:45.760]  interested in this information available at infowars.com. I guess they are
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:51.480]  selling to 300 bucks on eBay and on Amazon so I guess that's probably one
[2:10:51.480 --> 2:10:55.800]  reason why to buying for a fraction of that. Now going back to Fritz, you were
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:11:00.120]  getting into the Aster's other elite families. Why do they choose people it
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:04.600]  seems from nowhere to then elevate them up into a system that has royal families
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:11.480]  in it. Please continue Fritz Springmeier. Yes, I was talking about John Jacob
[2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:16.680]  Aster the first. Not somebody that you would think would be successful in life.
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:25.400]  He one time he's recorded his while he was eating a meal. His hands were dirty
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:29.640]  so he reached over and cleaned his hands on the white shirt of the guy next to
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:34.200]  the wardrobe room. So he had no social graces. He spoke like he had marbles in
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:39.320]  his mouth. It was hard to understand his crude English. Not somebody that you
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:46.560]  would think would rise to the top of society. But he was given the blessing
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:51.760]  of the committee of 300 that they were going to elevate the Aster's and they
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:12:00.040]  were going to make them rich and so he comes over to United States and the
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:05.280]  fur trade which was a hundred percent profit. I mean it was like gold. It was a
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:10.480]  lucrative business and it had been going on for hundreds of years but within a
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:14.600]  short time he has a monopoly over the whole fur business. How does that happen?
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:22.880]  And then he's given a special license to trade during the War of 1812 where he
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:27.600]  makes incredible amount of money trading with the enemy and our president,
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:35.720]  President Jefferson, allowed him to do this. And then the committee of 300 gave
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:43.560]  him the blessing. He was the first American family to be able to be involved
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:48.320]  in the opium trade. By the way, I'm going to stop you again. I've had former MI6 people on.
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:52.320]  It's been confirmed. As you know, the committee of 300 that they denied
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:57.080]  existed 20 years ago. They now admit it ties in Bilderberg, Trilateral, all the
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:01.640]  major groups. It's basically British intel as you know. There you are 17 years
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:07.280]  ago writing about it Fritz and then expanding on that. I can't tell you
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:11.240]  how many researchers who aren't even into looking at the occult angle. Dr. Dennis
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:15.200]  Cutty, so many countless others we've interviewed over the years who will
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:20.000]  confirm that David Rockefeller or others are obsessed with genealogies of
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.680]  families and people and there'll be some guy who's you know top of his class but
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:27.360]  of tens of thousands nationwide are in the top of the class and they'll be David
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:31.560]  Rockefeller or Brazilian Brazilian ski at their little college therein in the
[2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:36.920]  lunch line saying come with us. I mean they actually personally and is that
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:41.480]  what you're about to get to this has to do with bloodlines, correct? Right. I'm
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:47.320]  just just letting people get an awareness of how they operate. Sometimes
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:53.640]  people think that somebody rises to the top like our last president Bush. He
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:58.200]  rose to the top because he was the best man for the job of president. No, he
[2:13:58.200 --> 2:14:03.240]  became president because of what family he he belonged to and because somebody
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:10.120]  made the decision to elevate him into that role. But he was he was placed in
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:16.720]  that. It's like a big stage theater act where somebody decides okay we're gonna
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:22.880]  have this person play this role. He can be president for this scene and he can
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:29.040]  play the kings for that scene. These people are not intrinsically the best
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:37.280]  for the job and so John Jacob Astor was sending his ships to Turkey and getting
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:45.200]  his opium from sources like the Onassis family and then they were would ship
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:51.080]  them to China and make their big profits. So these there was a book Dope
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:56.480]  Incorporated. Maybe you you've read that book and interestingly of the top 13
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:03.120]  Illuminati bloodlines that I wrote about in the book that you've been talking
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:11.200]  about nine out of those 13 are mentioned in doing drug trading. So it's just like
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:16.680]  this back to the future with Biff, you know, you get somebody who's who rises
[2:15:16.680 --> 2:15:23.720]  out of obscurity like Aristotle Onassis or or John Jacob Astor and become
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:29.800]  incredibly wealthy. He became the wealthiest man. They're just frontmen. I
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:32.720]  mean I've studied Bill Gates. It was all given to him. We were just showing for
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.200]  people that are watching online. Radio listeners can go rent it and watch it or
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:40.640]  get it on Netflix. But the Good Shepherd Robert Duvall puts it out. It is a
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:46.280]  historical movie. It shows skull and bones. It shows the devil as a king that
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:51.200]  shows them doing rituals, blood rituals. ABC News, of course, has covered it that
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:55.480]  they really do do this and do human sacrifice. They say it's mock, of course,
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:16:02.840]  being urinated on, bathing in feces. Here's some of that. I mean this is what
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:07.960]  the most the CIA director, as many presidents, secretaries of state, and
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:13.760]  it's on record. Encyclopedia Britannica admits skull and bones was founded out of
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:21.720]  the Bavarian Illuminati in 1824. They came and set up with British money but a
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:25.760]  German death cult. It's just another branch of that that, of course, caused the
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:30.680]  French Revolution as well. They come over, they set it up, and it's set up by the
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:36.360]  main opium traders of that time with a monopoly. I mean this is incredible. I
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:41.120]  mean they're drug dealing, devil worshiping, child kidnapping, murderers, but
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:46.240]  they wear suits and ties. It's an army of psycho killers. And so many atheists say,
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:48.520]  well, I don't believe in God, I don't believe in any of this. Well, there are
[2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:52.960]  pygmy tribes that, you know, you know, believe in rock gods. The point is they
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:56.200]  believe in it in their anthropology. Whether you believe in the devil or not,
[2:16:56.200 --> 2:17:01.680]  the New World Order believes in it, and they think killing you is good. Go ahead,
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:09.080]  Fritz. And you're headed in the right direction in answering the question
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:12.600]  that you raised, the issue that you raised a little while ago. Why do they
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:20.680]  have all these genocidal programs? Because their, their agenda is not human
[2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:27.560]  friendly. It's, it's a satanic agenda that's anti-human. And when I saw the kind
[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:33.840]  of things that they had planned for this planet, that's one of the reasons why I
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:40.560]  was so highly motivated to do something, even though doing something was not
[2:17:40.560 --> 2:17:47.360]  going to be the most secure thing that I could do in life. There's a lot of safer
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:52.840]  things I could have done, a lot of more, a lot of things I could have done that
[2:17:52.840 --> 2:17:58.760]  would have made me more money, given me an easy life. But I couldn't have looked
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:05.080]  myself in the mirror knowing what I knew and not stood up for, for humanity and
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:09.600]  for what's right. And of course, Fritz, that's, of course, that's providence that
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:14.840]  an intelligent, focused, dedicated person like you would run smack dab into an
[2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:19.600]  Illuminati nest and get it the best way directly from sources that turned out to
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:24.200]  be accurate. Instead of us, you know, I'm, here I am 17 years later just putting
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:28.680]  pieces together. I mean, you really ran into a nest of these guys. I want to talk
[2:18:28.680 --> 2:18:31.720]  about that some later before we go to calls, but I also want to talk about what
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:35.040]  they have planned for this planet. We're about to go to break, but start getting
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:38.880]  into, you know, now we kind of got a little snapshot of how they operated
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:42.520]  tiny area, more in the book, obviously, but what do they have planned for the
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:52.880]  world? Well, as you were intimating just a minute ago, it's genocide, where, you
[2:18:52.880 --> 2:18:58.440]  know, death and destruction, Rob kill and destroy. They rob us, they kill us,
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:07.240]  they destroy our souls, and that's why, you know, it's satanic. It's not just a
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:14.840]  neutral, okay, they want, they want to make money. A lot of times people think
[2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:19.400]  they use the excuse, well, Hollywood's making movies because that's what makes
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:25.320]  money. No, they put out a lot of movies that are, are pushing an agenda, not
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:29.040]  because they're gonna make money, but because it's got an agenda behind it.
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:34.520]  They print the money, this, this is their warfare system. I mean, they are
[2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:40.000]  attacking us, and what does the Bible say? That, that in the end times, you know,
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:45.240]  that the dark magicians, the dark lords of the New World Order would traffic in
[2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:50.040]  the souls of men, and that no flesh would be spared if God didn't intervene, and
[2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:53.920]  now look at the bio weapons, all of it. We'll be right back with Prince

[2:24:01.320 --> 2:24:19.280]  Prince talk about disgusting deception. Here's Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Ted
[2:24:19.280 --> 2:24:24.560]  Turner, all of them in on record in journals that you know aren't for
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:27.960]  public distribution but are public. There's not widely distributed but we've
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:31.760]  we've republished and documented it. Rockefeller Foundation, you know, they're
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:37.400]  meeting with them. Rockefeller Foundation about Sterilins and vaccines, GMO, food
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:42.000]  really designed to reduce fertility, give you cancer. It's all out there. We know
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.720]  they're doing it and they're all over the news helping the children and Bill
[2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:49.800]  Gates with black Africans all around him and he's smiling at them and I mean
[2:24:49.800 --> 2:24:54.440]  you can if you have any discernment plus you know what he is you're looking at
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:25:01.920]  at an absolute devil with people begging and thanking him and everything he's
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:09.680]  doing is a fraud and it is just so crazy that they're running around doing this
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:14.480]  to people and then financing the media actually paying to have them say the
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:20.080]  opposite and you see that he's constantly has this smug satisfied look
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:26.080]  and is on the verge of laughing and it is a demonic satisfied control freak I
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:31.400]  just see the spirit of just we run things we're forcing our will and we're
[2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:38.400]  going to do this to you and they just enjoy dominating and hurting everyone it
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:42.440]  is it is and but I mean getting into the GMO all this they're trying to play God
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:50.720]  your views on that well yeah I concur another example that came to my mind as
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:56.960]  you were talking was I've talked to people who you know as children you
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:26:03.600]  know George Bush the first George Bush president was a pedophile and sexually
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:11.720]  molested some of these people and and then I'm early in the 90s I'm looking at
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:17.120]  a Masonic magazine put out by the Supreme Council this Scottish right and
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:21.920]  they have his picture playing with kids you know I mean it's just something you
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:27.360]  want to gag and barf at you're being told this by people and so much of what
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:31.000]  they told you separately turned out to be true you hope it's not true but then
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:36.040]  there's bohemian Grove that Richard Nixon said is a giant homosexual orgy and the
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:40.480]  New York Post and Associated Press say they fly in plain loads of gay porn
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:45.080]  stars to have sex with them this is on the news we don't know who exactly is
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:48.920]  doing it in there I saw photos in the camps when I was there for five hours
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:53.960]  of Henry Kissinger dressed up in drag and I can't even say what he was doing
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:59.160]  and on a family show but he was I mean it's just you know again and then you
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:03.360]  see Sandusky and then the local writers that expose it say look it was the
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:08.800]  alumni paying money this guy was raping kids in broad daylight in the shower like
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:13.200]  he was taking a dog for a walk they don't even hide this all these congressman
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:19.560]  cotton bathrooms fritz I mean yeah exactly it's I'm sorry go ahead these
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:26.440]  are kind of things that motivated me to to challenge all of this and expose to
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:35.760]  it it was disgusting to the nth degree I there were times when people that I was
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:40.800]  I was working with that had been in the Illuminati they would tell me a story
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:47.120]  one time with Cisco she told me something that had happened I actually
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:56.160]  broke down on the floor I melted into the floor and cried for a whole day I
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:01.080]  mean I didn't even know a person could sob for a whole day but I did I cried
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:07.720]  for all day this stuff is it's absolutely incredible and way beyond
[2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:13.200]  people's imagination because a normal decent person's imagination can't even
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:22.920]  go there and so that's why I got motivated to actually do what I did and
[2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:30.240]  other people that have bumped into it and and the depth of depravity are also
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:37.200]  going to be motivated just like me um you were talking about what is their
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:43.240]  agenda what wanted one pieces of their agenda is the destruction of the United
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:47.600]  States the United States does not mean anything to these people and I'll give
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:54.080]  you a little bit of a your listeners a little clue on this because I love my
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:58.640]  country and I love the ideals that they at least claimed that this country was
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:02.000]  founded on in the Declaration of Independence life liberty and the
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:11.360]  pursuit of happiness you know I'm all in favor of that and so in 1976 we had
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:16.880]  our bicentennial and those of us that were were proud Americans were proud
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:21.320]  that a country that was founded on life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:26.480]  had survived for 200 years what well what was happening while we were
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:31.440]  celebrating the bicentennial why our congress people were getting together
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:37.760]  and quietly signing another document a declaration of interdependence where
[2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:43.120]  they pledge themselves to support the destruction of the United I remember
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:47.400]  that stay there I want to come back with that and more and I'll give out the
[2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:55.280]  number for folks to join us we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones

[2:33:20.200 --> 2:33:24.720]  again I've been on the radio since 1996 I read Fritz's seminal book he's written
[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:29.080]  I don't know 15 others or something bloodlines the Luminati and I just
[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:33.360]  didn't believe it I'm into some of it I knew from history and some of it I could
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:37.440]  confirm the parts that I knew but I just like this is not going on of course
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:42.960]  back then British broadcaster and best-selling author he wrote the book
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:46.240]  that's now turned into men hysteric goats with George Clooney and all that he
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:50.360]  wrote the book them he said no they really do do this ritual that Bohemian
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:54.440]  grow they do fly in the prostitutes and stuff and he said for liability stuff I
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:59.480]  just want to use you and have you go in because the TV you know folks won't let
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:05.200]  me do it and I said okay fly me out there I don't believe that's going on this
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:08.720]  is about a year before actually went in 2000 he said okay coming up next year
[2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:12.760]  they just had it this year I've got a source inside and everything I mean
[2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:17.560]  that's just 12 13 years ago that I was ignorant and and again he says he has a
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:21.040]  source that says it's about a president or whatever all I know is these
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:24.880]  presidents launch wars killing hundreds of thousands of people in life to us and
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:30.680]  the government is involved shipping drugs in all I know is that you can type
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:34.920]  in dying core Halliburton sex trade and including children you'll get Chicago
[2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:39.120]  Tribune Associated Press but nobody gets in trouble all I know is you can type
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:45.760]  in UN child kidnapping and you'll get thousands of articles all I know is
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:50.120]  that a lot of crazy stuff goes on at Bohemian Grove and remember Abu Ghraib
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:53.960]  and the 30 plus other camps you can read the army's report type in Abu Ghraib
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:59.400]  army report on Abu Ghraib abuse is what they called it general to Goomba
[2:34:59.400 --> 2:35:06.760]  American general you you read it and it says acid I'm not gonna say on air what
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:12.600]  they do with it acid and children and raping now this is what the military
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:17.160]  and the people they hired as dungeon keepers were doing to people to make
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:21.120]  them talk and then you all well that was isolated no they were ordered to they
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:26.120]  found folks that would do it remember all the 24 shows and stuff where they
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:29.480]  tortured the kid in front of the dad to get the answer and that would stop the
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:33.400]  nuke from going off and law enforcement magazines I remember so we read one like
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:37.640]  in 99 was like an anthrax bombs are gonna go off all over the city and
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:41.440]  probably kill hundreds of thousands but terrorists won't talk not even a
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.720]  torture but you've got his son what do you do well with Khalid Sheikh Muhammad he
[2:35:46.720 --> 2:35:50.080]  wouldn't talk after four or five years of waterboarding they brought his wife and
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:53.800]  kid and his little son and threatened him the new said we threatened him and
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:58.720]  he he confessed to 9-11 and blowing up buildings as well that weren't built when
[2:35:58.720 --> 2:36:04.600]  he was in custody he basically confessed to you know shooting Lincoln this is the
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:11.040]  dungeon keepers the demon spawn of pure hell openly selling you on all these
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:16.720]  shows and dramas everywhere on how cool it is to torture how awesome it is in
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:21.480]  fact I mean every major movie I see that's got cops in it you know the cops
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:25.320]  watching fantasies like law-abiding citizen torturing people but they always
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:29.000]  deserve it the situation with Nixon getting rid of the Constitution and and
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:33.640]  just act and the cops celebrate it and agree I've learned to hate the
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:37.440]  Constitution I've learned you're right the guy's like good I've murdered all
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:42.440]  these people good he's like the hero military guy and I mean so Fritz they
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:48.360]  are clearly selling everyone now on what they want here's the toll-free number to
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:54.720]  join us 800 25 at 992 31 quick questions or comments for fritz springmeyer 800
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:37:01.760]  we'll come back in a month or so we're gonna want a lot 800 25 at 992 31 is the
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:08.400]  number to join us we disagree agree 800 25 at 992 31 for a springmeyer but my
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:13.920]  point is you cannot deny this is the agenda because they are openly trying
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:20.480]  to sell us on things that was in your book 17 years ago like it's good fritz
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:29.600]  that's right I mean they are talking about the declaration of interdependence
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.600]  where our leaders pledge themselves to destroy United States in our industry
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:40.720]  and make us dependent on other nations you see the ideals that they these banner
[2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:46.320]  issues that they have us fight wars for they they don't even care about this is
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:51.840]  one of my favorite posters I have it hanging on my wall say freedom of
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:58.000]  speech right but it's a world war two poster that the government put out to
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:01.960]  get people to fight world war two and give money to the government and war
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:09.880]  bonds and you so I would ask you do these people that pledged that sign that
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:14.680]  declaration interdependence do they really care about this when they send
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:19.240]  us off to die in these wars do they really care about us or care about
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:25.080]  these these issues that they have us supposedly die for are they really
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:31.280]  trying to save our freedom of speech or what are they trying to do well fritz I
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:37.560]  disagree with you on this point and and of course in a nuanced joking way it's
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:42.080]  not that they don't care about America they hate the United States and pay
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:48.840]  tax incentives and use our tax money to move general electric and and and and
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:52.760]  general motors and others out of the country it's not just that our jobs are
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:58.840]  leaving they're paying with our taxes to get rid of our jobs they absolutely
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:03.280]  hate this country and you're right pledged to bankrupt us and take us from
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:08.880]  the most intelligent highest test scores strongest family values best nation of
[2:39:08.880 --> 2:39:14.560]  the worst and they're celebrating now that more Americans now then not do not
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:19.920]  get married they're not having children and when they do they they say women
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:24.360]  run it all and the women work with the state and I hope you enjoy your 2000
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:27.680]  percent plus increase in breast cancer too because the globalist that the other
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:31.400]  state didn't a very nice husband it's run by devil worshipping killers that
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:39.840]  gang rape children in Iraq a solo nation American consumers stay single and I heard
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:44.640]  it being celebrated today and callers going the family's archaic oh yeah let's
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:49.960]  not even have a civilization and and Miss magazine CIA funded breaking everything
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:55.520]  up Fritz they knew exactly what they were doing and they they have just
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:00.120]  devastated and and you've got a bunch of selfish people running around and that
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:05.240]  that's really what Satanism is because when you think I'll cheat everybody I'll
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:09.400]  only care about myself me me me I get ahead that way no no no you poison the
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:12.920]  well I mean I hate to use the analogy of people in public pools urinating in the
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:16.320]  pool but you don't want to go to the big public pool when there's 300 kids in it
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:19.360]  because you know you're bathing in a toilet and then it gets so toxic that
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:21.560]  they have so much chlorine you can't even get it because it burns your eyes
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:29.040]  okay this is what Satanists do they run around wrecking everything and then say
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:33.840]  because I'm just doing what I want but really it's because they do to them
[2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:40.280]  maggots black uniforms death children with their bones sticking out starving
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:43.800]  I've seen the art that Schwarzenegger and all these elites are into studying it
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:47.800]  and it's like kids run over by cars I saw Schwarzenegger in Germany he flew
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:51.400]  there just to buy a bunch of this art and was with the artist I found it on an
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:54.480]  obscure German site one time searching for Schwarzenegger photos and it was
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:41:01.000]  like dead babies little girls dressed up in Nazi outfits children run over by
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:05.960]  cars and it was just Schwarzenegger's quotes about how beautiful this was and
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:09.920]  to them it's just beautiful it's I mean they go see a dead I mean I've read
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:13.320]  reports for you they see a dead animal with maggots they'll just stop and oh
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:18.560]  it's so pretty like psychos like that smell oh this is oh this is beautiful
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:23.840]  these are malfunctioning cancers and normal people have to route them out
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:31.640]  Fritz your comment and we're going to calls yes some of them are obviously just
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:37.280]  simply parasites now some of them are actually producing something of value
[2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:41.880]  or making decisions that help run the system but there's plenty of them that
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:50.960]  are our parasites and it's frightening the the the cancers so to speak that
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:56.800]  they're spreading amongst us at different levels any other points you
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:41:59.760]  think are important to make here of the ocean of info you've got before we go
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:08.640]  to calls oh wow we've covered a lot nothing that comes to it comes to my
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:16.680]  mind and within a short you know I started to talk about on asses and I
[2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:22.960]  sent you guys a picture showing Jackie Kennedy while she was still married to
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:31.680]  JFK going on board on asses's job I thought that would be an interesting
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:40.640]  picture to show the your audience because it kind of pulls the the curtain
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:46.960]  away from you know backstage there's a lot that's strange that's happening and
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:55.320]  so an asses was the kingpin who helped coordinate the assassination of JFK and
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:43:03.880]  then he gets to like a bandit he runs off with JFK's wife incredible but
[2:43:03.880 --> 2:43:08.960]  expanding on that because your sky's breaking up real bad just interrupt
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:15.160]  there to expand on that it's the same story over and over and over and over
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:22.200]  and over again and we've got to go to calls but briefly how far back to these
[2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:26.600]  bloodlines go I mean obviously it ties into their delusion that their mayor of
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:33.160]  engines and that Christ had children with Mary Magdalene right it goes way
[2:43:33.160 --> 2:43:39.000]  back to Rothschild's in their secret genealogy take themselves all the way
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:44.800]  back to Nimrod if I had had time I was going to try to find some artistic
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:54.960]  portrayal of Nimrod for you but yeah that some of them go back to your ancient
[2:43:54.960 --> 2:44:01.040]  Roman elite families some of them go back to the Venetian families that go
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:09.120]  back even further the tribe of Dan has had which was the black sheep of Israel
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:17.160]  they have a provided a bloodline that's crept into a lot of other bloodlines
[2:44:17.160 --> 2:44:23.440]  um yeah they go back to the pharaohs and they've kept track of all of this stuff
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:28.720]  and their secret genealogies and and that's why the Bill Gates all of them
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:32.080]  are obsessed with the genealogists when they take blood from babies at birth
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:36.480]  worldwide they needed that blood to test it for their genealogy programs but take
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:43.520]  the Aster family it's admitted that Anderson Cooper is CIA but left and that
[2:44:43.520 --> 2:44:47.480]  he's one of the heirs to the Aster fortune I mean it just never ends these
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:54.480]  people are everywhere they are and and the connections are endless too once I
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:59.800]  started researching it and you would look at one illuminati character and you
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:04.720]  would start seeing him connected to all these other illuminati families and then
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:12.080]  the people that they hire and everything are it's just one big network in fact
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:18.240]  that's even one word that they use for themselves as the network all right I
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:23.600]  want to go to some phone calls here let's go ahead and talk to DeWayne in
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:29.560]  California then Sergio Richard Jim and Tony DeWayne go ahead yeah thanks Alex
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:34.880]  I have I've done a lot of research on what Prince Springmeyer is talking about
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:39.760]  bloodlines of illuminati and I've seen this information had just done tons of
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:45.760]  research as well and I'm just it's amazing when you look at the
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:51.720]  interbreeding that's going on between like the Rothschild, the Rockefeller
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:56.640]  look at how all the presidents in the last 100 years are all related I mean
[2:45:56.640 --> 2:46:01.280]  Obama's related to all of them I mean it's it it's it's crazy and it's not
[2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:05.840]  like they're just cousins once or twice or Bush and Kerry go to the same secret
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:10.520]  society they were cousins on every angle it's like if you have a French bulldog
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:13.720]  it's related to all the other French bulldogs they're they're their own
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:20.400]  psycho interbreeding program I'm sorry go ahead no no okay it's amazing though
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:25.720]  that you find these families in European your Britain United States and
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:30.560]  they're all somehow related way back when but it was three generations or a
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:35.200]  recent generation and there's also some sort of connection even with the George
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:40.920]  Bush family and Bush Clinton George HW Bush and Obama they all seem to have
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:46.080]  some relationship and some connection either genetically or interbreeding
[2:46:46.080 --> 2:46:51.000]  some somehow and it's it it's just it's disgusting when you find out how many of
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:56.920]  them actually have have the same agenda oh it's the exact same agenda and they
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:00.520]  all go to occultic retreats the liberals have their own bohemian grove
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:03.920]  Helmut Schmidt who was the German Chancellor wrote men and powers a
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:08.040]  political retrospective and said yeah we're the Illuminati we do our own
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:11.720]  rituals at our own grove and we are setting up to the Bilderberg group a
[2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:15.720]  world government I mean I own the book it's I did screenshots of it for my
[2:47:15.720 --> 2:47:20.200]  bohemian grove films and he just admits the whole thing it says we do rituals we
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:24.800]  do druidic rituals I appreciate your call 60 seconds before we go to other
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:32.080]  calls on the druid connection I know that's big in your book are you going to
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:36.200]  a caller no I'm going to you friends because because Schmidt said they're
[2:47:36.200 --> 2:47:43.800]  druids go ahead yeah druids is is one of the lines of magic that's practiced
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:49.920]  there's many different types of magic but druidism is one of the larger forms
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:59.640]  of magic and I yeah you you definitely see a lot of druidic we have a full size
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:08.280]  replica of Stonehenge here in this area and the Illuminati practice rituals at
[2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:16.040]  secretly near that Stonehenge the monument you know it's it's actually
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:22.720]  got all of the the set and it falls full scale rock pillars and everything yeah
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:30.440]  yeah one of the main monarchs mind control centers I don't know if it would
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:35.000]  be one of the main ones but we've got we've got our share of it it seems to
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:40.040]  be that no matter where you go you you find this stuff let's go to Richard in
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:45.760]  Texas Richard you're on the air thank you for taking my call mr. Jones and mr.
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:49.800]  Springmeyer I'd like to ask you if you guys ever heard of the black blue lake
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:54.960]  they're the other side of the sculling bones they're there to protect the white
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:49:00.320]  sculling bones they operate out of the Greek system the apple of five beta and
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:05.640]  all the different other groups subgroups and they're pretty much recruited out of
[2:49:05.640 --> 2:49:09.720]  the top colleges and universities black and white universities you know I know
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:13.960]  there's all sorts of spin-offs of lodges that's why sculling bones is 3 2 2 and
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:17.480]  then they'll test people at these things they'll say okay now we're gonna have
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:22.160]  sex with a goat you know as part of the ritual for the university you're like
[2:49:22.160 --> 2:49:24.960]  well that's gross well you're not gonna be in the club because if you'll go along
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:29.040]  with this next it's gonna be people but yeah let's get Fritz's comment on how
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:35.920]  all these other societies are feeders into the darker rat holes. The black blue
[2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:42.920]  lake I I did write about it at one point but what I wrote didn't get published
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:49.160]  you're in print but yes I was I was aware that they have organizations for
[2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:58.520]  the blacks that want to participate in all of this you're right thanks for
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:04.280]  bringing that up yes sir anything else yes they're on flag their own song and
[2:50:04.280 --> 2:50:07.600]  to me there's some of the biggest sellouts because they're the ones that
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:11.040]  help keep the races separated because they're the ones that push the race
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:15.280]  card the most they're the ones that you know tell you know it's funny you say
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:18.080]  that and I'm God bless you we're about to go to break but a call back in again
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:21.760]  I want to hear more about that down in access TV over the years I was really
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:24.960]  friendly really nice that's where I started out immediately got a radio show
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:28.760]  about six months after I was doing the the the TV show here locally by the
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:32.880]  grace of God but there were these black masons that were part of that group
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:37.280]  you're talking about the Prince Hall whatever and they were always attacking
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:40.520]  me on air saying I was a racist I was even talking about black people on air
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:44.720]  I mean I don't and or if I was I was standing up for their liberties and then
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:46.920]  they wouldn't even talk to me in the hall they would just look at me with
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:49.680]  hate and then later I was talking to somebody that worked up there and they
[2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:53.000]  said well that's because you're you're bashing the Illuminati don't you know
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:57.200]  both those guys are like the head people number one and number two of the whole

[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:36.200]  I'd like to say real quick that I've been long time well not a long time but
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:41.040]  last last few years ever since George Bush Jr. got elected into president I'm
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:44.320]  kind of woken up after I've seen the bohemian girl video I just wanted to
[2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:48.640]  thank you for the work that you've been doing and just to make a comment real
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:54.440]  quick I did did this like research project for a history class over here at
[2:56:54.440 --> 2:57:00.040]  the junior college and what I ended up talking about in my paper was I cited
[2:57:00.040 --> 2:57:04.600]  this book called the master game by Robert S. D. Rope not sure if you guys
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:08.360]  are familiar with it but in the game or not in the game but in the book they
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:12.880]  highlight like low games and high-level games that's at least like to play in
[2:57:12.880 --> 2:57:17.440]  and one of them is the Mola game and when I read when I read like how they
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:21.680]  describe the Mola game it essentially sounds like exactly like the the shock
[2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:24.720]  and awe report that the Bush administration put out before the
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:29.000]  before the actual shock and awe campaign I was wondering if you guys knew
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:38.320]  anything about that comments on that prince yeah the principles behind shock
[2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:45.120]  and awe have been around for a long time so they just they they bring these
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:51.120]  things out every few years and let's jam another caller here as we got a
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:55.080]  break and in the official show the whole our retransmissions coming up and I'm

[2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:04.600]  Alex good almost out of time okay I just want to start out just saying that
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:10.080]  everything comes down to the religion I grew up with no religion at all in the
[2:58:10.080 --> 2:58:15.720]  home and this research every which way comes back to it even with Albert
[2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:19.800]  Pike's book morals and dogma on the cover word out of chaos looking up those
[2:58:19.800 --> 2:58:24.560]  words order one of the definitions is one of the nine sex requires of angels
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:29.040]  and you look up chaos and one of the definitions is the bottomless pit the
[2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:34.880]  abyss order out of chaos and that's one of the definitions everything they do
[2:58:34.880 --> 2:58:38.320]  comes back to some kind of religion amazing hey I'm gonna be back this
[2:58:38.320 --> 2:58:44.280]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. with a Sunday show back tonight thank you for listening to
[2:58:44.280 --> 2:58:54.400]  GCN visit GCN live comm today I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:58:57.880]  of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was
[2:58:57.880 --> 2:59:02.440]  working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well
[2:59:02.440 --> 2:59:07.440]  as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what
[2:59:07.440 --> 2:59:11.560]  I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:15.680]  products at info wars team dot com but I want to point out the three that have
[2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:23.080]  helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months products like beyond Tangy
[2:59:23.080 --> 2:59:27.760]  tangerine pollen burst and rebound when I started taking the Tangy tangerine
[2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:32.480]  and other products every day I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months now
[2:59:32.480 --> 2:59:37.640]  that's results I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot
[2:59:37.640 --> 2:59:42.000]  com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:46.880]  in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately start your
[2:59:46.880 --> 2:59:53.600]  journey to health and wellness today info wars team dot com coast to coast
[2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:59.200]  direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting network
[2:59:59.200 --> 3:00:21.080]  network
[3:00:21.080 --> 3:00:25.280]  all right doing a bit of overdrive here the callers are making great points
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:31.880]  Aaron Dykes who we ought to have said in one day an interview Fritz just came
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:37.760]  running in during the break earlier and said oh yeah the black lodges it's on
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:41.320]  record that all the main black leaders are members other black leaders have
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:45.800]  spoken out about it and that they have a deal to serve the elite and basically
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:49.920]  keep black people under their control and I mean they'll sell out for almost
[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:53.600]  nothing but that's how the globalists do it with everybody and that fits in with
[3:00:53.600 --> 3:00:59.520]  what I saw just very very very very bizarre in fact in a way it's like the
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:03.200]  black lodges are even higher than some of the white lodges where they really
[3:01:03.200 --> 3:01:07.240]  think they're doing altruistic work and I've seen really do defend the
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:11.200]  establishment and actively work against black people and I think that's what the
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:16.280]  caller the calling an earlier was saying but but side issue I've digressed
[3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:20.560]  let's talk to Adam in Australia you're on the air with Fritz Springmeyer go
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:30.040]  ahead yes Adam from Australia oh okay sorry Alex I didn't realize you're on

[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:37.800]  question is not for your guests I need to say something to you I have
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:41.680]  information that I must not get to you I've left a message on Rob's answering

[3:01:45.280 --> 3:01:48.880]  dollars literally to be able to get this to you in a secure not the money it

[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:56.640]  message I mean you have to tell us what I mean some of what it's about I can tell
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:02:01.360]  you there's two things one I have information which pertains to people
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:05.800]  them doing rituals I my girlfriend has just had a friend killed by them she's
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:10.600]  had her son kidnapped and yeah they run the police and the CPS in most cities
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:14.080]  when they publicly rape children at military bases now to make parents talk
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:18.000]  I mean I understand but you see I understand they probably control your
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:21.240]  local media but you just need to do a YouTube and expose the whole thing they
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:25.840]  when that when you're afraid of them they they get off on it when you have no
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:30.840]  fear of them they absolutely freaks them out but just get us an email sir with
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:33.680]  your basics and we may try to get back in touch with you it's just that we're

[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.800]  in my name my family my treasure everything just it's in God's hands and
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:26.920]  that's the end of it you got to put yourself in God's hands and say God
