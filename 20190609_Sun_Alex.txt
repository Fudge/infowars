[00:00.000 --> 00:18.240]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:18.240 --> 00:28.720]  and my friends we are live sunday june 9th 2019
[00:28.720 --> 00:43.200]  mainstream media and steven cobert comedy central mtv pbs cnn abc nbc cbs anybody you can mention
[00:43.200 --> 00:49.920]  every newspaper every establishment publication lies about us and because their old lies didn't work
[00:50.560 --> 00:58.320]  they've gone on to even more insane elaborate lies but one of their big ones is that i put all
[00:58.320 --> 01:04.480]  these articles out here every day as a prop if you're a tv viewer you can see them there's probably
[01:05.040 --> 01:12.000]  150 articles here or more this is even all the stuff i've read or looked at i would say probably
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.720]  70 of these articles today i've read almost all of them that is i read almost all the article
[01:19.280 --> 01:26.400]  other ones i scanned over and again document camera shot for tv viewers you've got all these stacks
[01:26.400 --> 01:31.920]  of news all these things that happened the last two days since i was last live on friday
[01:33.120 --> 01:40.640]  and i've got 30 plus clips right here a video this is always fresh this is always news this
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.680]  isn't like carl roe who said that he would win debate challenges because he'd have a big stack
[01:47.680 --> 01:54.560]  of cue cards that intimidated the other guy and there was nothing on the cue cards and so the
[01:54.560 --> 02:01.040]  media thinks that's what this is uh no that's not what this is this is dedication this is research
[02:01.680 --> 02:08.400]  i have been working since five a.m this morning for this broadcast i took off two hours and took my
[02:08.400 --> 02:15.280]  two-year-old daughter on a three mile hike this morning down to the creek and and back up i carried
[02:15.280 --> 02:22.960]  her on my shoulders the last mile and a half back the rest of the day has been on this and that's
[02:22.960 --> 02:29.040]  really my problem is there's been a few times i went out with the guys and had a big hangover
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.480]  and didn't get ready and pulled up five minutes for the show and they say those are the best shows
[02:34.480 --> 02:39.920]  ever when once or twice a year i get hammered and can't see straight the next morning i just come in
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.600]  here with no preparation but you know what doesn't matter i'm going to do the preparation one way
[02:45.600 --> 02:54.160]  or the other and that's the way it is that said though i feel guilty every time i finish a broadcast
[02:54.160 --> 03:00.560]  because i probably covered 10% of it because i can read fast i can speed read and i also get
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.280]  distracted when which i tell them to do they put stuff on screen videos articles i tend to then look
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.000]  at that and that gets my friend a thought change but i'm the director of this broadcast only one
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.120]  like it in the world so it's my fault that happens but that's why sometimes i pause when you see
[03:15.120 --> 03:20.160]  something on screen because that i don't just look at that article or that video that creates for me
[03:20.160 --> 03:26.160]  an entire full spectrum data set of enemy operations and by the way i've proven this
[03:26.160 --> 03:31.520]  isn't some comic book but this is an origin transmission where we're changing the world
[03:31.520 --> 03:39.120]  together that yes the enemy sees me as a mastermind that's what they call me the evil mastermind of
[03:39.120 --> 03:46.160]  the reboot of the populist movement 1776 worldwide that we created the populist launchpad for trump
[03:46.160 --> 03:53.520]  and you know what the enemy's damn right i am a mastermind it's true there are a lot of masterminds
[03:53.520 --> 03:58.960]  in this world there are people that really care about their communities do amazing things and
[03:58.960 --> 04:05.760]  learn everything about what they do the truth is masterminds are not that rare masterminds are all
[04:05.760 --> 04:12.320]  around us ladies and gentlemen and really masterminds to show us something about ourselves
[04:13.200 --> 04:17.920]  while others were telling us we were a nobody we were somebody so we're going to go to break
[04:19.360 --> 04:22.960]  because i'm a mastermind when it comes to researching stuff and knowing how it works i'm
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.800]  not a mastermind when it comes to orating it on air that's actually my weak flush but that's
[04:28.800 --> 04:37.040]  what has to be covered when we return on the other side start your 5000 horsepower engines and get ready
[04:37.600 --> 04:43.200]  because we've got the latest enemy attack that we call right on time coming in with over the
[04:43.200 --> 04:51.120]  horizon radar only the six cents can engage in and we know the next attack but more importantly
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.160]  we've got all the levers and all the switches and all the weapons to defeat the enemy but will
[04:56.160 --> 05:05.280]  we do it or will we be slaves what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free
[05:05.280 --> 05:14.640]  speech in the western world history this is a digital ai enforced bag order not to say the
[05:14.640 --> 05:26.000]  name alex jones our info wars dot com this is not see germany level this is racketeering this is
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  cartels mr president we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.680]  wars as a dominant independent anti-war pro human pro sovereign pro family populist organization
[05:41.680 --> 05:47.200]  so they thought first they come for alex jones then when people say okay take him off the air
[05:47.920 --> 05:52.960]  everyone else like dominoes would fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more
[05:52.960 --> 05:57.600]  than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can
[05:57.600 --> 06:14.880]  take us down they'll take everybody else down waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming
[06:14.880 --> 06:24.960]  to you live from the front lines of the info war it's sunday june 9 2019 global live broadcast on
[06:24.960 --> 06:31.680]  alex jones here in the catbird seat here in the crow's nest here in the cockpit here on the front
[06:31.680 --> 06:37.680]  lines we're not given corporate talking points we're not told what to do by the democratic party
[06:37.680 --> 06:46.000]  the republican party thorge soros we just engage in good old-fashioned pro americana research we
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.920]  wear our bias of liberty and freedom and justice on our sleeves thanks for joining us on this live
[06:51.920 --> 06:59.760]  global sunday transmission as i do sometimes let me just try to read headlines and not get into
[06:59.760 --> 07:06.640]  details of them and then i'll try to walk through as much of this as i can today but this is a
[07:06.640 --> 07:13.040]  particularly important broadcast they're all extremely important this one if people would just
[07:13.040 --> 07:20.640]  listen if folks would just understand and if and if alternative media and alternative republicans
[07:20.640 --> 07:33.200]  and alternative libertarians would just listen to me if the dav rubens and the uh stefan malinus
[07:33.200 --> 07:39.680]  and the jordan peterson's would just listen to me they won't be shut down and they won't be censored
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.760]  hell of paul watson would listen to me because i'm on record and i've got the emails to watch
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.760]  and the rest of it telling him exactly how this will unfold i said they'll come for you in one year
[07:52.880 --> 07:56.480]  and paul called me up the day and he said how did you know they'd come for me in one year
[07:56.480 --> 08:02.800]  i mean i you know yeah this it's it's all phased in it's all in one year programs
[08:04.640 --> 08:11.120]  it's run by stay behind networks trump calls them embedded groups inside the government
[08:11.120 --> 08:17.120]  like trump said take brennan security clearance that's the president's total purview
[08:19.440 --> 08:19.840]  like a
[08:22.720 --> 08:25.360]  chihuahua's purview sitting in your lap and barking or a
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.200]  dalmatians purview is running between horses as a horse dog or
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.960]  what's that cool dog so big that would bring the little packages of brandy up to people lost in
[08:38.960 --> 08:42.240]  the mountains got st bernards purview as a rescue dog
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.640]  trump's purview is
[08:48.880 --> 08:52.480]  taking people's security clearances away or giving them security clearances
[08:54.080 --> 08:59.440]  and they four months ago he ordered it they said f you he ordered the troops out of
[09:00.960 --> 09:07.680]  afghanistan and they said f off our government did we're in a state of mutiny we're in a state
[09:07.680 --> 09:13.440]  of civil war i'm sorry i said i get in the news let me just tell you what i spent
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.200]  it's not exaggerate seven eight hours today getting ready for
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.160]  did you know that 99 of the news on info wars dot com and news wars dot com that corporate
[09:34.160 --> 09:38.080]  controlled leftist media calls fake news is just a clip of what somebody said
[09:40.480 --> 09:46.560]  but jim acosta grabs a microwave from a woman and slaps her arm and the news says that's a fake
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.640]  clip doesn't matter it was on c span it's the same clip they tell you it's fake just like they'll
[09:52.640 --> 10:01.680]  tell you this is fake huh it's just one article a g bar compares his return to doj as d day invasion
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.400]  now there's a war against criminals that have taken over this country to get the nation back wow
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.040]  that's that's powerful and that's true that's exactly what we should hear from somebody that
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.600]  actually wants to turn this country around because the real danger is the out of control
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.560]  bureaucracy he thinks it's god i get we want balance in the government we don't want to
[10:22.560 --> 10:28.320]  be too left-wing or true right-wing that old argument that argument got us into this mess
[10:28.320 --> 10:33.040]  we want to be balanced with the chai comms and balance with the there is no balance with cancer
[10:34.560 --> 10:40.720]  america is balanced turning individuals loose leaving people along as long as they're nonviolent
[10:41.680 --> 10:49.440]  stopping monopolies yet we are the balance america is the Darth Vader of countries we
[10:49.440 --> 10:52.720]  don't need all of you to teach us about the balance get out of the way
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.880]  and i think info wars is slogan i've always said this for years but i see it all the internet
[10:58.880 --> 11:03.920]  you're lying about alex jones he's done nothing wrong he's a patriot get out of the way i just
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.400]  see it everywhere christ said to the devil get behind me satan get out of the way because you
[11:08.400 --> 11:13.840]  realize we're the vanguard we're the leaders and it's always scumbags saying get out of the way
[11:13.840 --> 11:19.120]  there's a front page of new york times sunday declaration of war like we're some third world
[11:19.120 --> 11:24.400]  country they're lying about the wmds they're gonna invade and they say that all conservatives
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.360]  are brainwashing a cult and all of us must be banned everyone millions must be taken off
[11:30.160 --> 11:37.840]  there must be a total purge because we're so popular again the same story over and over again
[11:38.400 --> 11:47.600]  unbelievable the way they behave and the way they operate oh i'm sorry i've only hit two articles
[11:47.600 --> 11:53.280]  i've got a hundred and something here so again let me tell you what's coming up today a g bar
[11:53.280 --> 12:04.800]  compares his return to doj to d-day invasion isn't that interesting turns out the fbi new
[12:05.600 --> 12:10.480]  government documents that have been released that the russian probe was fake from the beginning
[12:10.480 --> 12:19.200]  and a total lie oh that's coming up that's just two articles of hundreds here let me
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.800]  tell you about some of these little jewels this is linked up on drudgereport.com our article
[12:25.760 --> 12:31.520]  by kellen mcbreen we're sending folks down to cover the next few days oh i don't need to go very far
[12:32.560 --> 12:40.240]  they've got illegal alien africans by the hundreds in downtown austin but a big group came across
[12:40.240 --> 12:44.880]  last week they're already in san antonio oh and they're already bitching man they want their free
[12:44.880 --> 12:54.560]  stuff and they want it now baby hundreds of illegals from ebola ridden congo dumped in texas 350 more on
[12:54.560 --> 13:01.280]  the way and there's all the videos saying we want our free stuff and a lot of them are pregnant
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.920]  we're here to have that baby and taxpayers you're gonna pay and what's gonna happen everything
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.560]  you spend everything you do is gonna go up oh and that brings me to the next piece of news
[13:12.560 --> 13:17.600]  we're gonna we're gonna get all the newscast on that oh avocados and tequila will go up
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.640]  in tomatoes because of mexico a few cents or whatever did you ever think about the
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.440]  500 billion dollars a year it's estimated the illegal aliens cost this country getting all
[13:27.440 --> 13:34.160]  this free crap oh 500 billion versus maybe a billion oh by the way mexico capitulated to trump
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.840]  and they said we'll stop human trafficking we'll put troops on our southern border
[13:39.840 --> 13:43.760]  we'll stop shipping them up through the country because you're about to put tariffs on us
[13:43.760 --> 13:50.800]  we'd organize it with the un the un said to do it but we'll stop yeah the un organized the refugee
[13:50.800 --> 13:56.160]  centers people flying in from around the world giving plane tickets to get to guatemala and
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.400]  because still the mexican airport still stop people from other countries coming without visas
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.760]  without authorization so now mexico is going to go back to defending its borders how horrible
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.760]  mexico freezes human trafficking bank accounts sends national guard to border amid very good
[14:11.760 --> 14:18.560]  decision president trump says that's up on news wars dot com mexico blocks 1000 migrant caravan
[14:18.560 --> 14:24.320]  ahead of trump's tariff deadline and so they've agreed now but if you listen to nancy polosi and
[14:24.320 --> 14:30.000]  others they say oh mexico'd already agreed but just a month ago they told us there wasn't a border
[14:30.000 --> 14:38.720]  crisis there weren't caravans so that's coming up today and then we've got all these kind of articles
[14:38.720 --> 14:46.960]  here oh yeah this is political correctness by the way i already talked about this i bought
[14:49.360 --> 14:54.720]  a condo near my parents house for my children put it in their name for them to have some place
[14:54.720 --> 15:00.480]  for college or whatever in the future and we rented out airbnb before they get big but
[15:00.480 --> 15:05.040]  my son's a year away from college right now about about 14 months away i think we want to go to
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.000]  youtube and get in and live there but and i asked well there's a condo thing i said why is there
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  not a gate here on the condo complex they said oh the city doesn't allow that now it's a gentrification
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.080]  to have a gate i said well hell is it front door gentrification or how about clothes on my body here
[15:22.080 --> 15:28.080]  but again that's all this un planned a breakdown civilization breakdown privacy

[21:07.040 --> 21:15.040]  if we know that typhus has shown up all over the united states is killing a bunch of people
[21:15.040 --> 21:20.080]  some of the only the worst verbal countries have when their war zones when they're when their
[21:20.080 --> 21:25.680]  civilization collapses and if we know the black plague and drug resistant tv spreading and people
[21:25.680 --> 21:31.920]  are dying by the thousands of it every month tv alone and it's being covered up and all these
[21:31.920 --> 21:38.800]  blue cities are collapsing into rats and feces and decay and collapse why is this happening
[21:38.800 --> 21:47.280]  and then let's go ahead and get to it now we've even got a local newscast in san antonio
[21:49.680 --> 21:54.320]  reporting on our story that's up on drugs report dot com now this is an important
[21:54.320 --> 21:59.600]  article this is something everybody needs to get out okay you've seen the videos a week ago
[21:59.600 --> 22:12.240]  of 200 300 at a time different groups of africans from central africa where the obola virus is
[22:12.240 --> 22:19.440]  spreading massively unvetted swimming across the rio grand or walking across the rio grand
[22:20.800 --> 22:25.680]  and then once they get there the border patrol is ordered just to release them because
[22:25.680 --> 22:34.800]  that's federal law think about that that's federal law
[22:38.000 --> 22:44.240]  but if you can make it across into the united states you get your amnesty hearing now i
[22:44.240 --> 22:52.640]  submitted last week that only one out of ten people ever show up at an immigration naturalization
[22:52.640 --> 23:00.160]  hearing and so the border is broken people know they get here they can stay here and now the border
[23:00.160 --> 23:06.960]  and the corridors up through mexico and canada are so open that tens of thousands of people
[23:06.960 --> 23:19.040]  a week pour in who aren't even from central or south america those are major arteries major
[23:19.040 --> 23:25.280]  pathways paid for by the un paid for with us taxpayer money us aid
[23:26.880 --> 23:30.160]  each leg of the trip they get their plane tickets paid for in a thousand dollars
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.880]  to get over the land bridge and they carry children with them 30 have been genetically tested
[23:34.880 --> 23:41.600]  to not be they tested them all the ones they catch are not related to anybody it's not their parents
[23:41.600 --> 23:45.840]  and the kids let her go no i was grabbed a lot of the kids are grabbed in mexico
[23:45.840 --> 23:52.000]  so by latin americans coming up because they are a get out of jail free card and we have new video
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.600]  upon news wars dot com info wars dot com of armed men walking directly into california
[24:00.400 --> 24:04.880]  and other states we've got new video of arizona this week new video of new mexico new video of
[24:04.880 --> 24:14.880]  texas armed men with guns and their waste bands leading people right into the united states and
[24:14.880 --> 24:20.160]  the children aren't checked they're not checked for diseases the senate admits tens of thousands
[24:20.160 --> 24:27.040]  have been sex trafficked this is collapse of civilization and trump finally gets mexico
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.640]  on the eve of tariffs hitting tomorrow to say okay we'll put some troops on the southern border
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.880]  and we won't let folks you know travel across and we'll bust human smugglers and the media says
[24:36.880 --> 24:43.440]  trump is lying there is no border crisis or uh oh we already had a deal he just waited and did this
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.440]  no he didn't you've been blocking everything but if we have typhus if we have black plague if we
[24:49.440 --> 24:54.640]  have leprosy if we have drug resistant tb if we have all of these drug resistant diseases pouring
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.600]  in and even footnotes and the health departments admit almost all the new outbreaks of measles you
[24:59.600 --> 25:18.080]  name it are from illegals why in the hell why in hades why in the world would we not be checking
[25:18.080 --> 25:25.360]  any of these people because it's total breakdown of society and why would the left try to block all
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.560]  of this trump tweeted today i'm pleased to inform you that the united states of america has reached
[25:30.560 --> 25:34.960]  a signed agreement with mexico the tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the u.s on money
[25:34.960 --> 25:39.920]  against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended mexico in turn has agreed to take strong measures
[25:39.920 --> 25:47.840]  and they announced that was true but policy and cnbc and cnn all said it wasn't true that either no
[25:47.840 --> 25:54.480]  agreement had been made or it got worse ladies and gentlemen that trump already had an agreement
[25:54.480 --> 26:02.400]  what does that even mean so that's the point we've gotten to if you want to see the video
[26:02.400 --> 26:09.920]  it's up on news wars dot com and info wars dot com and we asked the question hundreds of illegals
[26:09.920 --> 26:21.120]  from obola ridden congo dumped in texas 350 more on the way tens of thousands of cases of obola
[26:21.120 --> 26:26.560]  in that very country no screening coming directly in so if all the other diseases have come in
[26:27.360 --> 26:33.360]  we can rightfully guess and surmise that it's a better than a 50 50 chance here's the takeaway
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.520]  from a gut level and and the past disease is coming in and just following that as a rule of
[26:37.520 --> 26:43.840]  thumb i think it's an easy statement or dead reckoning to say 50 50 chance we get Ebola cases
[26:43.840 --> 26:51.520]  folks we had Ebola cases four years ago and later was confirmed what we first broke that in Dallas
[26:51.520 --> 26:59.360]  and in uh Detroit and places obola got here and was covered up so are they gonna cover this up
[26:59.360 --> 27:07.840]  this time here's the local san antonio newscast downtown san antonio's bus station just got a
[27:07.840 --> 27:14.960]  little busier as hundreds of migrants from the congo and angola arrive in the alamo city we didn't
[27:14.960 --> 27:20.240]  get a heads up dr calleen bridger the interim assistant city manager says the conglise migrants
[27:20.240 --> 27:26.240]  started coming in on tuesday and said they traveled with a group of about 350 migrants
[27:26.240 --> 27:32.080]  through ecuador to the southern border when we called border patrol they said yeah probably another
[27:32.080 --> 27:39.680]  two to three hundred from the congo and from angola will be coming to san antonio that includes
[27:39.680 --> 27:45.040]  misanji a conglise migrant who didn't want his face on camera but told me via google translate
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.480]  he came to america for security reasons and said quote my family is staying in my country but with
[27:50.480 --> 27:58.080]  the help of the usa i can get him back but this language barrier is why the city is in desperate
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.920]  need of french-speaking volunteers to help get many of these individuals to their final destination
[28:03.920 --> 28:08.560]  if you speak primarily french that would be really helpful wednesday alone the migrant
[28:08.560 --> 28:15.760]  center saw a total of 450 people spanish and french speaking during the day and housed 375
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.640]  of them at travis park church at night the city opened up the frank garret center to house the
[28:20.640 --> 28:26.080]  conglise migrants for the weekend but after that they're not sure where they'll put them especially
[28:26.080 --> 28:32.640]  since they don't know how long some of them will be here the plan was 350 of them would travel from
[28:32.640 --> 28:38.000]  san antonio to portland when we reached out to portland main they said please don't send us anymore

[35:14.400 --> 35:18.960]  seeking process julicia rizari tens five by witness news
[35:23.520 --> 35:30.960]  so it's june 9 2019 i'm alex jones your host and i i've got articles from this year last year the
[35:30.960 --> 35:38.400]  year before new york times washington post saying alex jones and his writers are insane
[35:38.400 --> 35:45.680]  they claim there's a un plan to build refugee centers in guatemala nicaragua el sabbador
[35:46.480 --> 35:54.720]  venezuela and have the un fund through us state department money millions of people
[35:55.440 --> 36:03.040]  from africa not just latin america to pour in and get all the free welfare as welfare mules
[36:03.040 --> 36:09.600]  of course snopes reported on us and said we were fake news uh if you're a tv viewer you can see it
[36:09.600 --> 36:14.320]  on screen they said well it's actually true it's a un document the un said they're doing it but
[36:14.960 --> 36:23.520]  the un didn't mean it that's right that's right i show you what they already did to europe i show
[36:23.520 --> 36:29.120]  you all the un plans i show you their current plans three years ago two years ago a year ago and
[36:29.120 --> 36:35.120]  guess what they carry those plans out like it was a cruise missile shooting down sedams chiming
[36:36.880 --> 36:44.960]  and right on time they arrived just the way they said they would that's just one church in san antonio
[36:44.960 --> 36:51.280]  thousands of day from africa are coming in now ask yourself a question how'd they get 4 000 miles
[36:51.280 --> 36:55.840]  across there how'd they get paid to get all the way up here well we we just so happened to know
[36:55.840 --> 37:04.400]  no hell george soros puts press releases out the whole world sees you get to the us you're here
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.840]  and you get free welfare and have your babies for free let's see when you talk to the poor
[37:09.840 --> 37:15.200]  folks being used and doing this they say well listen my family's back in the congo which is
[37:15.200 --> 37:20.800]  beyond road warrior and they're going to get killed if i don't send money back so and that's
[37:20.800 --> 37:25.840]  when you so when we interview them and we've been talking to them and others have they say listen i'm
[37:25.840 --> 37:30.160]  just here because i'm gonna get killed if i don't send money back so they're not a refugee and that
[37:30.160 --> 37:36.160]  somebody's threatening to kill them for what they did they're saying hey slave you're gonna go to the
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.840]  us the democrats are gonna sign you up under three or four identities you're gonna get welfare they're
[37:41.840 --> 37:48.240]  gonna skim off the top you're gonna send some back to your handlers and then guess what you're
[37:48.240 --> 37:54.560]  gonna get your ass a job and work on top of it so let me let me boil down with this is real slow
[37:54.560 --> 37:59.840]  for everybody i know the audience gets it slavery is legal in six different islamic countries right
[37:59.840 --> 38:07.280]  now slavery is legal in two other african countries run by black people what you think white people
[38:07.280 --> 38:12.880]  invented slavery everybody's been doing it white people ended slavery and that's why they know we
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.840]  have that soft spot people forget like why you invented slavery and you've done all this you
[38:17.840 --> 38:23.120]  white people meanwhile these black people are being sent over here just like chinese are
[38:23.920 --> 38:28.480]  by their families by the government to get all the welfare and send it back or their family
[38:28.480 --> 38:37.120]  it's put in a forced labor camp even cnn admits this four years ago that the number one immigrant
[38:37.120 --> 38:45.840]  to the us is on average a 30 year old chinese woman coming here nine months pregnant to have her
[38:45.840 --> 38:51.440]  baby who becomes a citizen and then gets everything free and then her whole family can
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.600]  you come here but they don't stay here they come get welfare they have an address and they send
[38:57.600 --> 39:06.480]  the money back to china so what these are are welfare mules a term that justin one of the
[39:06.480 --> 39:12.000]  great producers just invented back there and it's true it's not a mule carrying a bunch of heroin
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.480]  or cocaine in their gut it's a mule a lot of times mules they'll tell you hey we're going to give you
[39:18.480 --> 39:24.240]  a $5,000 to ship these uh you know 10 packages of cocaine in inside your guts but if you mess up
[39:24.800 --> 39:28.080]  your mama lives in this little village we're going to bust a cap in her head you understand
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.800]  so they are victims don't make no mistake the left ones to make everybody victims they certainly are
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.440]  these people are you just think people from the congo folks congos right in the middle africa
[39:41.440 --> 39:47.120]  congos probably the most dangerous place in the world other than somalia there is no government
[39:47.120 --> 39:54.640]  in the congo slavery is still run in the congo one of the main meat is human flesh in the congo
[39:55.440 --> 40:03.360]  the congo baby is unbelievably dangerous and these people show up all the way across the
[40:03.360 --> 40:10.480]  atlantic ocean and they show up in texas known where a bunch of schmucks and they say we're here
[40:10.480 --> 40:15.520]  to get all this free stuff but you heard that lady who again is a useful idiot leftist you heard her
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.280]  going portland portland means the smugglers the leftist smuggler the soros group portland said
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.920]  they sent them here we're just telling portland we're overwhelmed we're running out of stuff
[40:25.920 --> 40:33.360]  hey lady you're supposed to run out of stuff this is 21st century warfare you got six billion people
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.160]  outside the west and they all want to come here and they all got taught everything's free and once

[47:14.320 --> 47:23.600]  throw away the key there's someone in my head but it's not me
[47:23.600 --> 47:38.880]  me
[47:38.880 --> 47:48.880]  no one seems to hear
[47:48.880 --> 48:00.160]  different tunes
[48:00.800 --> 48:08.480]  ladies and gentlemen it's sunday june 9 2019 and i am sitting here if you're a radio listener
[48:09.360 --> 48:15.440]  tv viewers can see this with actual u n documents that they admit or from them
[48:15.440 --> 48:25.760]  from 12 years ago 10 years ago eight years ago seven years ago six years ago do i need to continue
[48:27.520 --> 48:30.800]  and you can go to paul watson's article last july almost a year ago
[48:31.520 --> 48:38.080]  revealed you in plan to flood america with 600 million migrants
[48:38.080 --> 48:46.960]  and then macron came out the week later and said oh yeah i agree with you in plan
[48:48.400 --> 48:56.400]  we also want 250 million people from africa to move to france and you go that sounds insane
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.600]  that doesn't sound right i mean france doesn't have a 60 million people or whatever it is
[49:01.600 --> 49:04.720]  in fact don't trust me let's go from memory what is the fact i guess the france don't have
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.360]  kids anymore it used to be 60 million what's it like 50 million hours old look up france's population
[49:09.360 --> 49:16.640]  please so macron says he wants 250 million i can play the video if you want him he says it in
[49:16.640 --> 49:23.120]  french but he said it but snopes wrote another article 66 million my god my memory's pretty good
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.480]  but that's mainly farmers coming in i think indigenous to france is like 30 million now
[49:28.480 --> 49:36.800]  or something the point is is that snopes said because snopes is god
[49:39.040 --> 49:46.720]  that he didn't mean that okay did uh did the uh thousands of africans arriving in texas every
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.160]  day illegally that are coming in across the real grand river from 5 000 miles away from
[49:52.160 --> 49:59.840]  4 000 miles away that was that uh was that did they mean that snopes because i know mainstream
[49:59.840 --> 50:04.400]  media said you were the fact checkers right so yeah this is the game you remember a year ago
[50:04.400 --> 50:11.040]  and six months ago trumps a liar there's no caravans jim a cost to all of it that was the
[50:11.040 --> 50:17.360]  talking about Nancy Pelosi there's no crisis oh but now there's a crisis and it's trumps fault
[50:17.360 --> 50:27.360]  so i'm gonna explain something very very slowly here if you tried to sneak in some marijuana
[50:27.360 --> 50:33.360]  from mexico you got caught at the us customs you wouldn't get a ticket like you get most places
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.760]  you might get a couple years in prison because it shows you're a criminal trying to break the
[50:37.760 --> 50:44.560]  borders and if you're trying to break the borders it shows that you might try other things like
[50:44.560 --> 50:51.280]  smuggling vegetables you know like well who cares about that well there's a lot of
[50:51.280 --> 50:54.720]  pests around the world that if they get in here would devastate our crops that's a fact
[50:55.920 --> 51:02.000]  or what about endangered species but who cares about children the senate report two years ago
[51:02.880 --> 51:09.360]  another one four years ago admitted that tens of thousands of little children as young as three
[51:09.360 --> 51:13.920]  and four years old were smuggled in when obama said let all the kids in from around the world
[51:13.920 --> 51:18.160]  so people started kidnapping children to bring them in and i don't know i've already talked about
[51:18.160 --> 51:28.960]  this two or three times today but in willy wonka's chocolate factory you had to have a golden ticket
[51:29.920 --> 51:34.720]  but to get in here you got to have a kidnapped child and again it just came out two weeks ago
[51:34.720 --> 51:39.600]  the board patrols tested over a thousand people claiming they had their kids or grandkids or
[51:39.600 --> 51:48.880]  cousins with them and guess what 30 zero genetic connection obama administration placed children
[51:48.880 --> 51:57.600]  with child traffickers that's the wash and post dna test reveals 30 of the children not related oh
[51:57.600 --> 52:03.280]  but the left cares so much about the children no they care about our charity here in america
[52:04.400 --> 52:08.240]  and the fact that they're going to be given identities they're going to be put on welfare
[52:08.240 --> 52:12.400]  and then they're going to have sponsors that the democrats admit through these eight groups
[52:12.400 --> 52:18.320]  and so-called churches that make money off the kids so if you thought a sex cult inside the
[52:18.320 --> 52:26.000]  catholic church screwing kids was bad it's bad how about all the major churches all the big
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.520]  think tanks all the big groups are busy and are going to sponsor third world people in here
[52:31.520 --> 52:38.720]  with have no rights who live under fake names that are controlled by lawyers in the democratic party
[52:42.560 --> 52:50.960]  there are lawyers in austin texas where i live that individually sponsor over 300 children
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.000]  the money is unbelievable
[52:56.000 --> 53:05.680]  oh they're all democrats and some lawyers are making five million dollars a year off of a piece
[53:06.960 --> 53:14.640]  came out four years ago that one address in austin where i live had 108 million dollars
[53:14.640 --> 53:21.040]  of tax returns sent to it and they went there and it was over a hundred illegal aliens saying
[53:21.040 --> 53:28.800]  they live there only about 15 dead the articles in the usa today of all places
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.400]  and the illegal aliens weren't getting the money they were getting tax returns in the name of people
[53:36.400 --> 53:43.520]  in prison and people that were dead no one to take the irs five six years to figure out was a scam
[53:43.520 --> 53:53.040]  they were getting hundreds of millions of dollars at one address billions in the city alone
[53:54.160 --> 53:54.720]  billions
[53:57.760 --> 54:01.600]  because they control these people and by the way they're really mean to them folks they make them
[54:01.600 --> 54:08.800]  go get jobs two or three jobs they make the little girls be whores the 15 13 14 year old girls
[54:08.800 --> 54:16.640]  that's come out so the democrats make these girls give blowjobs and have sex all day the pimps make
[54:16.640 --> 54:22.720]  them um it's become out in federal court things they make the little girls have sex without condoms
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.560]  and they let these big fat potbellied men run by the feminist and liberals run these little girls
[54:29.600 --> 54:34.320]  member member prozik veritas like eight years ago went in to all these different democrat
[54:34.320 --> 54:41.760]  solutions said i got kidnapped little girls i'm running sex slaves and prod and they told project
[54:41.760 --> 54:47.040]  veritas they said well let's teach you how to make money off them i had damn right remember
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.640]  everybody's like what the hell right yeah all you got to do is keep them in school pay the tax
[54:53.280 --> 54:56.960]  as long as the government gets some money they don't give a damn and you're in the right city
[54:58.080 --> 55:01.040]  if you weren't in blue city you wouldn't be able to run them children
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.960]  and so james will keep them saying all right some of these kids are like eight years old
[55:08.080 --> 55:11.520]  they're like that's good they don't talk too much do they

[56:16.560 --> 56:21.840]  doing anything to hispanics no the only problem we got is that white lady she's worried she can't
[56:21.840 --> 56:30.240]  take care of the africans right and races but it's her well meaning that does it all you see
[56:30.880 --> 56:36.960]  and creates the scam to use these people and suck them in like a big burning torch that mauves come

[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.160]  telling you what's really going on and i'm just gonna take everybody the woodshed next segment
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.400]  it's gonna happen and i take myself the woodshed when i need to but let me just tell you something
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.960]  right now all these other candy asses in the alternative conservative media think when somebody
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:54.000]  else gets taken down the competitions being taken out that is one-dimensional lobotomy thinking
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.120]  and i'll just be honest it's like the bible says i want to people that are hot or cold man
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.640]  and god said you're lukewarm i speak out of my mouth i don't want to be with people on the fence
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.320]  anymore because this fence sitting has gotten us where we are you think america with all its
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.400]  problems was about sitting on fences it was the opposite there was no sitting on fences around
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:21.120]  here and i have seen i've been behind the scenes i've seen it all with the scheming and people
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.360]  thinking if you play along with the system you know no i never sold out to anybody
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:34.640]  and i did it because i'm not stupid you can't sell out to evil it's like selling out to a monster
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.240]  so it eats you last while you watch your whole culture eating head first
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:48.240]  and then it comes and gets you last and lasts at you when we could have with our full force
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.200]  one like that up front even though they've eaten most of us now there's we still kick this monster's
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.760]  ass and i'm not gonna sit here and watch everybody get their ass kicked when we still have the power
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.360]  to stop this but see i talk about typical people the woodshed
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.240]  then i want to write notes about it i want to be very judicious about it but you know what
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:18.320]  there's just not time for that anymore they could shut us down any time completely and i look at all
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:25.040]  these weak cowardly people who played along with the system and who think they're gonna navigate
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:32.960]  this armageddon you're not gonna navigate this even if you decided to join the utopian eugenicist
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.520]  transhumanist post human movement you dumb sons of whatever you are
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:49.520]  don't you get it when they get you to give your humanity up on one person
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.800]  you give it up on yourself but you know a lot of people say oh i'm a bleeding heart
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.200]  if i told something's loving i do it no you have to be judicious you have to know what
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.360]  you're talking about and actually make hard decisions for humanity not just do whatever
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:09.760]  you're told because the moral authority said so the un and the new york times and the washington
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.440]  posts and all these organs push fake wars and death and anti-human movements they don't have
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.200]  any authority to say who shouldn't be on the air and who shouldn't but common sense says
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:28.960]  no one should be able to do that unless it's targeting one thing in jurisprudence and i agree
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:36.800]  with it that's children adults it's free game anything out there is fair and open but you
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.840]  don't corrupt children you don't corrupt the youth because they haven't been able to make their
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.040]  decisions yet except their parents and their guardians to protect the little ones instead
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.720]  the whole system's about taking the children's youth away making them adults before they are
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:04:00.880]  so they can be sabotaged because predators go after the week predators go after the week
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:10.640]  and the left is not the left the left is the left they're not the left you heard
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.880]  what's the left oh i don't know what that means oh i don't know what it means
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:26.880]  they're not the liberals they are the left-hand path satanist total power overthrow reality
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:41.600]  the old brown lakes of blood in for girls all right we come back i'm getting into that big
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.520]  launch of mass censorship and the divide and conquer stratagem being deployed against the

[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:19.680]  from enemies born and domestic it's alex jones you know sometimes it's not about bragging it's
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.800]  about fact because if you don't stake out what you've done and what you stood for the fact that
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.560]  it's been the truth and it's been successful other people will come around and join with the system
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:37.680]  and they'll silence you and then they'll point at you and lie about you because the counterfeit
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:45.440]  always wants to destroy the real mccoy what it's always about i don't know if i do it today but
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.240]  i'm not going on the war path against many alternative media figures who are really the dominant
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.280]  media but they buy the global's propaganda that they're alternative because they all need a very
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.480]  strong kick in the pants because so many of them are just opportunists they mean well some of them
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:06.000]  but they play the games of people that aren't leaders well i'm a leader and our audience are
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.160]  leaders and we've trailblaze the whole modern turning of events you see we've engineered it
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.320]  because the truth the justice the reality the will the purity of it doesn't mean i'm perfect
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:24.880]  but my mission what i believe is pure i believe what i'm saying i know what i'm saying is right
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:32.880]  i've proven i'm right i'm committed i'm on fire what i want is justice i want to defeat the
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:39.760]  globalist i want to empower all of humanity and then i watch everybody always like little kings
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:45.920]  courts argue and manipulate and crawl over each other backbite and play their games
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.320]  so they get eaten last by the establishment not me
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.800]  i wanted to be eaten first something mark zuckerberg got right because he's got a lot of
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:10.880]  surveillance he said i think alex jones wanted to be banned last year that's not exactly right mark
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:19.440]  i was already banned in everything but name and so i knew that when i didn't buckle
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:29.520]  i would be banned first instead of last and i chose to be banned first
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.120]  instead of last when there was nobody left to speak up for me
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.440]  but just like i knew what happened most of the children and the people that didn't have vision
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.360]  and the people that were followers and thought they were taking the safe path
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:54.000]  they could all sit back feel like they were high and mighty intellectuals on the road
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.600]  that info wars and our operation paved and they could say that they were superior i don't care
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:09.920]  about superiority i care about results so this whole pantheon who's there that's been aware of
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:16.160]  what's happening mad rudge is a massive lone mountain
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.960]  incomparable in the geography the lesser gnolls
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:34.240]  it's all insane you know i said i get to this big new york times thing and it's all the censorship
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.280]  and you know i don't know if i should because you know what if you really want to be silenced by
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.040]  the big corporations they're doing it because they got some really nasty in mind for you
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.680]  but i will hit the censorship because there's a lot of preparation on it
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.960]  people wanting to get the wheel inside baseball what's happening and what's about to happen next
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.880]  and you know even how to stop it
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.960]  pay the fastest way to stop it is to stop saying oh we follow the rules we didn't do this now you're
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.000]  expanding it to us once you give the left the authority to control reality and to say and
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.360]  define things you've given up to them my god don't you know the basic information
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.840]  i'm not talking to the audience i'm talking to the establishment want to be
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.800]  resistance you're not resistance you're pretenders because when the going gets tough you crap your
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:37.280]  britches and beg for mommy here's john bound's report is the threat of Ebola and up to close the
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.400]  border because thousands from Ebola caring nations have only legally come in with no testing
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:50.240]  stay with us as the number of Ebola cases surpasses 2000 in the Congo where it originates from
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.680]  those fighting the horrific viral hemorrhagic fever are under attack as Reuters reported the
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.080]  deputy mayor of Benai in the eastern democratic of Congo said 13 civilians were killed in an attack
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.840]  by the allied democratic forces the adf a group thought to be linked to the islamic state back
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  in 2014 the Sierra Leone outbreak resulted in over 28 000 infections and roughly 11 000 dead
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.840]  it's no wonder that we are seeing immigrants from the Congo crossing the us's southwestern border
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.680]  recently us border patrol reported they had apprehended 15 immigrants from Congo we build
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:34.080]  the wall crowdsourcing founder brian colfidge posted on his facebook page claiming an as yet
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:41.680]  unconfirmed dhs insider exposed to him us kongo migrants have made it to the usa with confirmed
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.640]  cases of ebola three are in custody in laredo texas and six in laredo mexico and in war as
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:55.040]  right next to their wall but even if colfidge's information is flawed what's to stop ebola from
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.880]  spreading amongst refugees south of the border and then what over a million immigrants will cross
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:07.440]  the border in 2019 alone and they are being flown and bust all over the united states on the taxpayers
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:14.080]  dime ebola can take up to 21 days to manifest that gives an infected immigrant roughly three
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:20.000]  weeks to illegally enter the country and spread ebola via body fluids fortunately hospital staff
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.360]  in the united states have been trained due to the international panic from the 2014 seara leone
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.720]  outbreak at present the risk to our nation directly is extremely low just because of where this is
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:38.160]  that may change if we get outbreaks into if it spreads into goma or into kinshasa or into
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:44.480]  you know into kumpala or something like that as we get if this sort of dwells on but we do have a
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.920]  very effective screening program now that we've developed in a sense as a consequence of that
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.600]  2014 experience so i do think we're very prepared here this is why i come back and say and i'll say
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.320]  to you and in general for our health security the best thing this nation can do to protect its health
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:07.360]  security is to detect respond and prevent these outbreaks where they start but why would we
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:14.400]  disregard national security to a degree that puts us all at risk is it simply to satisfy the
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.880]  democrats fantasy that there is no crisis on the border last month alone we saw 144
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:27.360]  thousand people come into our country illegally it is overwhelming our system and president
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:33.680]  trump made it clear that mexico must do more yesterday the president directed us myself the
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:40.080]  secretary of state in our team to meet with a mexican delegation at their request and hear them
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:48.160]  out progress was made the mexican delegation brought forward proposals but as the president
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.400]  said last night it was not nearly enough and we made it clear yesterday at the white house that
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.840]  mexico must do significantly more i think it's safe to say you've talked to all of our members
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:05.760]  we're not fans of terrorists we're still hoping that this can be avoided at the same time it's
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:14.240]  way past time the president's request for assistance from our government be met i mean we
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.920]  walked out of here after we did this supplemental and the democrats insisted on taking out of the
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.840]  supplemental they just passed in the house yesterday anything to address the humanitarian crisis
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:33.600]  at the border that would be funded by health and human services we all believe that immigration is
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.680]  the constant reintegration of america enriching america with immigrants enriching america with
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:47.920]  their hopes their dreams their aspirations and again it's a happy really a happy day because
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.960]  our dreamers they're the gold standard they love america they're patriotic how can the government
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.200]  claim they have an interest in national security and continue a position of open borders where millions
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.880]  of us citizens could die from diseases crossing that border john bound reporting
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.240]  that story is up on info wars dot com it's linked up on drudge report dot com please spread it
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.760]  but let me clear here it's abusive of the people coming in illegally not to test them
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.800]  and millions are dying from tb and all these diseases and the and the crime and the and the
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.560]  billions in cost hundreds of billions a year this is insane we always check people at Ellis Island
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:38.160]  now they check nothing this is the takedown cloward and pivot attempt to bankrupt our country
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:43.120]  to make us accept global government saudi arabia doesn't take one migrant china doesn't take one

[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:23.120]  we're on the march globalism is collapsing alex jones here broadcasting worldwide
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:34.080]  okay let's get into the new york times cover story a double spread centerfold
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:40.640]  of total lies and disinformation this is as good as their known lies about wmds in iraq that they
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.200]  knew was a lie and then their defense of a half million dead iraq he's saying it was a good price
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:52.000]  to pay this is a murderously run criminal group that pushes the most evil elements of the whole
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:59.040]  world government program and so they have this big article about how conservatives are brainwashed
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:03.760]  in the mind control of youtube and how this algorithm made the conservatives more powerful
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.520]  that just means if you click on videos about bunnies or click on videos about superheroes or
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:18.400]  videos about guns or videos about fishing it then feeds you more of those videos that's how google
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.760]  and all of it works that's how search engines work whatever gets the most clicks whatever gets the
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:30.720]  most votes goes to the top but there's a move by big tech to get rid of ratings for restaurants or
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.240]  dry cleaners or hotels or schools or medical facilities and in the last second of the sour
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.920]  we've got someone who's been banned from one of the largest consumer reporting agencies
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:49.200]  uh and and groups that report on testing and ratings and big pharma big pharma is trying
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:55.680]  to pass laws where there won't be drug inserts saying the adverse reactions so there's a war
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:02.320]  on speech across the board and so they reported the wall street journal a year ago that they
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:08.800]  were going to ban alex jones and wiki leaks and that they had the new head of news course saying
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.840]  we're going to be incredibly profitable the next few years uh because we're going to ban alex jones
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:19.200]  and wiki leaks this year and then we're going to ban everybody else the next year and the entire
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:28.400]  internet will actually look uh like netflix and you wonder why fox is coming out against
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:37.680]  trump more and more and trumps talked about that because they're making their move and the president
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.280]  is aware of it so so you ever wonder why a bunch of fish will get into school
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.880]  because if they're a little alone fish by themselves they figure everybody's going to go
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:54.080]  pick that fish off but if you're in a big school you're still going to get attacked but
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:59.920]  you won't be targeted it'll just be you next week so see leaders they go off on their own and
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.280]  build new systems but followers most of the people in conservative or libertarian news
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.280]  came around the last three or four years most of them were liberals and i'm going to do some
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.760]  reports on this soon i'm going to go back and show their old clips most of the big names were leftist
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:22.400]  just five years ago but they went wait alex jones and others are so popular i've been around 25 years
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:29.760]  never changed my spots let's act like that and we'll get popular which they did because people
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.960]  are sick of leftist and globalist and control and the university brainwashing but then when
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.280]  the attacks came in the system was smart pick alex jones demonizing build a strong man when people
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:45.760]  don't defend him then everyone will be taken off and as the wall street journal talks to the new
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.720]  head of the news division of news corps it split off from the entertainment division disney bought
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.080]  the other they said oh in a couple years there'll be nobody we're gonna get we're gonna get the
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:01.760]  left off too it's only gonna be like the old hollywood system again or the music industry
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.320]  and so i told everybody this and i did videos laying out the order it would happen and how they
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:13.200]  would do it because they were saying it but see people didn't care they would just play along
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:21.040]  thinking that they wouldn't be gotten next it's because they're not leaders some of them are
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.160]  but most of them are not leaders they didn't launch the modern 1776 worldwide movement
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  they didn't launch the populist movement worldwide they didn't say i believe populism
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.360]  was more popular than globalism they didn't believe any of that none of them were there
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:41.760]  and it's not an exercise of kissing matt drudge's ass it's an exercise in that in origins the enemy
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:48.080]  creates all these fake origins about info wars because they fear the origin grassroots out of
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:54.320]  nowhere access tv local radio got top ratings got syndicated by a ragtag group never sold out
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.440]  matt drudge little email list he had interesting news stories builds a site it's interesting it's
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.800]  different becomes number one in the world it's the same thing only matt drudge helped me and people
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:12.560]  like jorge snoring and the listeners everyone else then just came along later jumped on to the
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.640]  bandwagon and then proceeded to say that i was all these horrible things thinking if they got rid
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:27.600]  of me they would somehow be big big boys the counterfeit always seeks to destroy the mccoy
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.880]  and so the reason i almost didn't cover this today is because i could spend a full hour on
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.080]  this and i just i feel physically second-less i do and i'm not a person likes to attack people
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.000]  and i and i'm not gonna attack Joe rogan he's woke up and done a good job super free speech
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.280]  but it was kind of i think something needed to happen i probably went overboard but it helped
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.680]  Joe and he later thanked me and we were friends and it was good i think some other people need me
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:58.080]  to come after them and that's why i come on your little shows so you stop being wimps and you
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.680]  realize the man's world you're in and what you're really involved in this isn't some candy ass where
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.720]  people too ugly for movies go into radio and people don't want to be in movies go into being
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.520]  you know working as weather girls see i'm not like you i'm talking about the audience who is like me
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.760]  and natural folks want to live their lives already feel secure love their family love their church
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:26.240]  love their job love their community like to go have lunch once a month by the old graveyard and
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.360]  look at the great grandparents gravestones you got that spirit it could be old you could be young
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.640]  you could be white you could be black you you got an extra to god but our problem was a bunch of
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.400]  weak people came in who wanted to be famous and who wanted to be big and who wanted to be whatever
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:47.680]  and jumped on that so that when the enemy came they all turned and ran and showed their asses
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.520]  i'm not going to do that i know you're not going to do that as well but i think these people need to
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:00.640]  be exposed i think what's really going on needs to be talked about because these usurpers these
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.640]  pretenders don't even have the basic instinct when they're faced with this stuff to get what's
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.720]  happening when they don't stand up for other people being censored they get censored
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:17.600]  when they say oh i'm not like those other censored groups i get it they're saying bad things but
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.480]  i'm not don't you shouldn't give the left the authority to say what could be on air and what
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.120]  can't they're the ones lying about wmd's in iraq they're the ones killing millions of people
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:32.800]  they're the ones saying they do it again like let's play madeline albright who work for the
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:40.160]  clinton's saying 500 000 dead iraqi kids was a good price to pay these people have no money
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.080]  will have no moral authority to tell us how to think or what to do or what to say and like
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.520]  hell's gates have opened the authoritarians are everywhere now coming after all of our
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.000]  speech i've got video coming up next segment of our reporter peacefully out covering a gay
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.680]  pride parade and the police say you're not allowed to be here in public spaces has nothing to do
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.200]  with what these women do with their or men do i could care less it has to do with their
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:11.680]  authoritarianism that's been attached to their ding dogs let's go ahead and play the clip
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:19.440]  we have heard that a half a million children have died i mean that's more children than died when
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:28.320]  in hiroshima and and you know is the price worth it i think this is a very hard choice
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:34.880]  but the price we think the price is worth it and they go on from there now coming up
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.120]  i'll have to do a whole hour on the start of the show tomorrow this is so central this is so
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.240]  important about how how they're carrying out the censorship what the master plan is how we buy
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.640]  their narrative and then they laugh at us i've told you the blueprint i've been proven dead on
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.720]  my god i have their own statements do we really want to be picked off one after the other or we
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:29:03.440]  want to stand up like men okay it's true i stayed up late last night so i had half the turbo force

[01:32:55.740 --> 01:33:18.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.460]  He aligns himself with the truth
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:24.420]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.140]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:33.060]  So, America was all about not being royal
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:36.020]  or not being a lord or not having your station
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:39.060]  because of who your parents were,
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:41.340]  but by what you built, what you believed in,
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:44.060]  what you constructed, what you stood for.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.580]  That's why Martin Luther King said,
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.740]  we're not about what color we are as Americans.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:50.100]  We're about what we build, what we stand for,
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:53.100]  the character of our deeds, the conduct of our actions.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.140]  It all made perfect sense.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.420]  It was Americana.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.860]  And people may take that for granted
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:58.980]  because we're right in the middle of it,
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.660]  but that's what made our country so great.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.740]  Just that idea, we never really achieved that much of it,
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.700]  but the few percentage points we did,
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.500]  we were 4% of the world's population.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.100]  96% lived somewhere else,
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.380]  but we had half the wealth 50 years ago
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:16.580]  because we produced the wealth,
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.340]  because we turned the people loose.
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.820]  And so you see all the censorship, all this control,
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:25.780]  I remember growing up in the 80s
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.380]  and not liking parental advisories
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:30.620]  on two live crew records I wanted to buy.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:32.780]  But let me tell you,
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:37.140]  Tipper Gore ain't got nothing on Google and Facebook.
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:39.180]  They're gonna watch what our writers say in live time
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:40.580]  and censor me right then.
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:45.820]  And they're gonna defame me while they do it.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.740]  And they're gonna tell the world,
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:49.020]  you can't say my name unless it's negative.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]  Imagine if Tipper Gore said,
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:53.420]  you can't say two live crews name
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.340]  or in words with attitudes or whatever it was,
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:34:58.500]  unless you say they're bad.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.100]  People say, you're a cult leader lady, you're done.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.700]  And you know, I was brought up a libertarian.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.940]  I don't have to preface this with like,
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.420]  oh, I'm not against people that are
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.220]  into the same sex or whatever.
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.700]  So you come after kids, heterosexual, homosexual,
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.620]  I don't care, but you go out
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:19.260]  and you look at leftist gay parades or all this stuff.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.460]  It's like they're royalty.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.180]  It's like they're saying because they're in that club,
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:25.860]  they're special and they're cool
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:29.220]  and they can hit you and spit on you and do whatever they want
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:30.580]  just because they don't like you
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.380]  because you support President Trump.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.140]  And there's no appeasing it.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:39.260]  Trump can wave rainbow flags all day,
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.900]  that pisses them off more
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.220]  because these are leftist wrapping themselves
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:48.220]  in some gay flag, they're just a gang.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:50.700]  Tim Cook wants to run slave factories
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.100]  in China, the worst in the world.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:53.940]  And if he says he's gay, you can't attack him
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:58.940]  because if you're gay, you can run a slave factory, seriously.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.420]  So nobody cares about what Tim Cook
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.860]  looks like a dead buzzard doing in some bed.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.100]  We care about how he's censoring everything
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:11.580]  and how he's out of control and everybody kisses his ass.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:12.940]  He tells us how moral he is
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:16.180]  and now Alex Jones is immoral and a threat to the world
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.780]  and Senator Murphy says that America won't survive
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:21.700]  unless I'm silenced, that's a quote.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.620]  I don't even have a misdemeanor in like 10 years,
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:27.060]  never had a felony.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:29.660]  Worst thing I got is parking tickets.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.700]  But some guy owns the worst slave factories in the world,
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.380]  he's this moral God and I'm a piece of crap.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:37.260]  The New York Times that lies about WMDs
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:39.300]  and kills millions, they're good guys too.
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:43.740]  Because they told you they were.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.260]  So Caitlin Bennett is super polite.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:51.620]  She goes out the videos on infowars.com to Des Moines, Iowa,
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.660]  up where she lives, to the gay pride event
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.060]  that's on a public street.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.380]  And there's little kids that we blur it out,
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.940]  dressed like hookers dancing with full grown men and women.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:04.860]  I don't care, it was a heterosexual event or whatever.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.700]  I came to a heterosexual event like a barbecue cookout,
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:10.100]  tailgating that somebody had a seven-year-old girl,
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.940]  dressed like a whore with a G-string,
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:13.300]  a little boy dancing around, I'd say,
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:15.300]  what the hell is this, an ambly convention?
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.460]  Who's ass do I need to be?
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.820]  But because it's a gay pride thing,
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.180]  oh, sir, the cop shows up and this is an edited video
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:25.660]  for time, 15 minutes, I did it, it's on the site.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.060]  He says she attacks them, he says they complain,
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.100]  you gotta go, even though they physically attacked her.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.900]  And the video's gone viral, it's on infowars.com.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.620]  Video, pride gets peaceful.
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.780]  Here it is, folks.
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.440]  I got pushed, I got pushed.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.080]  This is men and women attacking a female or four.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.780]  Bramming into her, hitting her, slapping her,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:57.780]  men attacking women.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:00.100]  Women attacking women.
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:06.460]  The new cool kid thing isn't to be the jocker, whatever,
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:12.820]  It's to be gay that's what this is the new cool kid thing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:19.000]  You got a problem. I do have a problem. Yeah, you got a problem. I just physically attacked you nasty. No
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.140]  You know what today's the day I'm done
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:33.340]  Why are you here? Okay, that's fine. Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here?
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:40.900]  So again, everybody's harassing or slapping or hitting her and the cops show up and say she's the bad one
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.780]  Because they recognize her as the gun girl. They go you're not we're taking your guns
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.380]  Yeah, you are
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:53.420]  Then we have the preacher who got arrested in Toronto. They're saying I love you to gay people
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:57.060]  Totally legal the police arrested him. They're now framing it
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:04.180]  Leave that'll be a rough day. Yeah, these people don't join an old fascist street gang that you're disturbing people, correct?
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.860]  I'm not disturbing you. I tell you something
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.940]  Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. What's happening? Let me tell you something right now
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:13.820]  If we have any more complaints about your behavior tonight
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:17.620]  You're gonna end up being in trouble. I take the complaint
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:23.540]  I investigate the complaint if there are in fact people that are willing to be a victim for disorderly conduct action will be taken
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:25.380]  I am a victim of disorderly conduct. What's that?
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:29.420]  I have a video for being assaulted. Okay. Would you like me to make a report about you being assaulted?
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:34.420]  Michael out the footage on there. I don't know if he has I'm not gonna look at any footage
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:37.220]  I will send it to a detective. So I'll have to take the camera and pause real quick
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:42.940]  He knows full damn. Well, they've been attacking them for 10 minutes. The cops are all like in the little club
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:49.340]  Little naked kids dancing over there. They're having you know, they're there and and they're like, oh, they take your camera
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:53.960]  They know full damn. Well, what's on that video? This is when your cops are leftist
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.400]  And it just goes on and on and every time she stops letting talk
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.400]  He threatens to arrest her and then later says he never did it full videos on the site
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:07.200]  People are really ashamed of this guy, but this is what happens when the left gets control. You're in Venezuela. Here it is
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.480]  I'm not gonna look at any footage. I'll send it to a detective. So I'll have to take the camera and put it on property
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:17.880]  So I'm gonna ask you that everybody in here's having a good time tonight and you walk around with that big bright light on there bothering people
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.640]  We're probably gonna end up asking you to pause again. There's no big bright light all lies
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:27.900]  So now there's a street preacher last week. We had on arrested for it. We the raw footage there
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:32.860]  I love you. Jesus loves you exercising his free speech arrested facing prison time
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.800]  They're saying it's an excitement for hate because again, you don't have free speech when it's around the LGBT
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.800]  Because they don't want to show in a little kids dancing around naked. Here it is
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.660]  I was physically assaulted. I'm asking you to arrest
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:55.800]  You didn't investigate the assault. Yeah, is that what the black preacher gets attacked? Let's see. He's a Christian. He gets it
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:04.620]  Do you know that every person is a sinner? Don't touch me, please please take that off my body up to please
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:11.060]  Now you're assaulting me chasing to hit him and punch him that run into him. I'm trying to say buddy
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:14.180]  You're a Christian. We're gonna do it. I'm trying to walk
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:21.180]  This is not love. I'm trying to walk. I'm trying to review and exercise my speech.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:25.780]  So worldwide the left has been green-lighted. He even tries to get away. They chase him and corner him.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:32.340]  You know when people are mature and they actually really love somebody because they're a street gang doing what they're doing
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:37.260]  They would allow people to walk up. They take the road warrior. It's a gay gang. You know, you get a straight gang gay gangs
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:41.660]  They're like killing people. Jesus. So show what okay, now you're talking. That's what it is. It's like a gay gang
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:44.460]  If you want to issue it and the cops work for
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.460]  On what grounds?
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:57.100]  Remember when the left didn't like police now they love them because they run them
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:07.620]  And hate speech against my religion. They arrest him because the left got mad at him
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:12.860]  And everything's a big giant safe space now folks. They're shutting everything down everywhere
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:17.860]  They work around the clock to shut down info wars.com and news wars.com, but they're not going to beat you
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:23.840]  You're going to spread the links to info wars.com and news wars.com by email by your
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.800]  Text they can't censor that yet and by Facebook YouTube everywhere
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.600]  You're going to jam it on the throat with billboards and signs. You're doing it and we're winning. Thank God
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:36.880]  And we've got a giant sale going right now the super force special

[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.480]  So the info wars model is a self-fulfilling
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:11.200]  Self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:17.120]  Sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.560]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:28.520]  Self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:34.640]  What audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:40.840]  Whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.320]  info war's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:08.480]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:15.740]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.120]  1960s
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.520]  Researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.320]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.360]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:35.280]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.720]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.880]  In fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:52.160]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:57.500]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.760]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.520]  backed up with human waste and
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:16.320]  Debris this is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine products and
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:22.160]  Safe sex products and so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:29.360]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged the human body gets clogged just like that
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.520]  And you may be experiencing backup too

[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.400]  All right, I'll be back at 11 a.m. Central tomorrow
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.840]  Trump has come out and said that he's gonna go after Twitter now for the sister ship
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.200]  He gave an ultimatum that means we'll take action. He says you do antitrust
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:38.040]  We don't have time to play games with all the lawsuits. This is election meddling big time, but I hope Trump does take action
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.040]  We got to keep the pressure on though
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:47.520]  But Mike Adams, you know, it's been the health ranger for 15 years best-selling author had a bunch of their websites
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.520]  I wouldn't call conservative or even liberal
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:59.320]  But Facebook's purged him when I would call it purging consumer advocates are purging consumer reviews because what they're saying with vaccines or drugs is
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:06.080]  Don't report on adverse reactions. Just say it's a conspiracy theory even though the inserts say it. So you have the New York Times cover story
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.120]  Today the making of a YouTube radical or where they just it's a classic
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.520]  Authoritarian model to pick somebody supposedly from your camp and say he was brainwashed. He was under their control
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.800]  He never met anybody he talks about he was never in a camp. He never no no
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.840]  They brainwashed him and Google helped do it because the algorithm is just if people click on things it promotes more of that to him
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:32.080]  Oh, oh, oh, something sells better on the menu. You put a billboard out front saying home of the famous chili cheese state
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.040]  It's not an algorithm. It's called sales tactics, but Google calls it an algorithm
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.400]  And so it's this huge split page
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.240]  centerfold article
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.080]  all about
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:49.000]  How all these people need to be banned next completely and unpersoned and and how look
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:59.240]  What's her name Lauren Southern said the sexist racist homophobic narrative has been blown out of proportion and
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:05.320]  Sensationalized and everybody knows it. They go on to say it's that type of hardcore hate
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.120]  That has to be banned really Philadelphia demand balconies and bay windows as symbols of gentrification
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:18.720]  Summer is now sexist says USA today. It's a takeover of the language show Mike
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:24.160]  I mean, I really see you you've got a big consumer lab top rated test things you you write about I mean
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.800]  I remember you 15 years ago on the show about in others
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.520]  You know about a Monsanto and Glyphosate causing cancer. It's all admitted now. So so so I guess
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.120]  They've totally bans you you're now verboten and once they ban Alex Jones, then they ban everybody else
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.760]  That's the plan told by don't stick up for Alex. You did and all the other so-called service though
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.200]  Well, he was demonized. I better stay over here. They'll get me later
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:54.720]  That's a classic authoritarian model of takeover and these idiots are falling for it. It's it's just crazy
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.000]  But they're not leaders Mike
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.480]  They didn't get into this 20 something years ago like you did or 25 years ago like I did because we really cared about it
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:06.240]  And we're and led the movement they got into it to hijack it and I think that's our greatest weakness
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:12.280]  It's not the audience and the activists but the so-called leadership of the Liberty Movement are really just a bunch of folks that want to
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.440]  Uh, you know make money and act famous. Well, they say that about us
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.600]  That's not who we are because we were actually offered to sell out
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:23.240]  I know you were and I was always little nobody's didn't get the offers because I could be the guys with the
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:30.680]  Unintested talk shows. You know unchallenged number one podcast if I wanted to be but see I wanted my integrity and I'm glad I didn't do it
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.960]  I these are times that test the the hearts of men and women who are
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:41.640]  Conservatives or are pro-liberty or pro-life in any way and you know, you and I being both pro-life
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:48.040]  Or just want to tell somebody your daughter took a vaccine and almost died. They say you can't say that even though she's in a wheelchair
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:54.280]  And you know years ago you started warning people about exactly what was coming and of course a lot of people
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:59.880]  Mocked you for it. I don't know if you recall though the the more you were getting censored the more I asked
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:06.400]  Or the more I offered to to help the host the fourth hour and do other things because I knew I knew you definitely not been a
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.400]  You've definitely been at the front lines
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:13.080]  And if others had that instinct, we wouldn't be in this position. That's what pisses me off
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.640]  Exactly and it is our duty to survive. It's our duty. I know you work hard every day
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:23.520]  I work hard as well. It's our duty to survive because right now survival is
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.680]  Success it's victory. I'm not saying that's the only reason we built our own infrastructures
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:34.700]  We knew this was coming all the candy asses that serve the system and thought they'd be okay. They're gonna have nothing Mike. They're idiots
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:42.560]  Yeah, I know and and they have no principles and they're willing to compromise just immediately because you know, I've been
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:50.360]  In many different ways threatened to stop talking about Trump, you know a stop appearing on infowars for that matter many many different threats
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:56.360]  And I always stood my ground and said, you know what if I can't tell the truth if I can't speak
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:01.840]  What's in my spirit? If I can't defend humanity that I have no business being online
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:04.600]  You said it who wants to be on air if it isn't from the spirit
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:10.200]  Exactly because this is not theater for for us, you know, this is not a job
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:15.560]  This is a God put us here all of us for a reason and what I do
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.560]  And what you do this is what God put us here to do to help and there's their article
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:24.440]  The new infowars is a vitamin site promoting the apocalypse daily B
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.280]  She's been around 20 something years published hundreds of books
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.480]  I've been having you on for 15 years you exposed glyphosate all of it and you're the bad guy, Mike
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:37.960]  You're the new site. You're the nobody everything. They say it's all crafted though a perfect lie
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:43.640]  You're the new site. You're the scammer that said glyphosate was bad daily B said it was good
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:51.840]  You know, it's incredible because I remember progressives and liberals used to be anti GMO and anti pesticides and anti herbicides
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:58.560]  And all the things that I warned people about 10 15 years ago are now being affirmed, you know
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.560]  a glyphosate causes cancer and
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:04.400]  Pesticides give you dementia truth is Mike none of them have ratings
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:09.240]  They're all collapsing and they think that once they've gotten rid of us that supposedly they'll have an audience no
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.040]  Nothing will put them back together again. No amount of car. That's right
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:17.200]  I'm king pins no amount of Jeff Bezos propping up the Washington Post
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:23.200]  None of it will put umpty-dumpty back together again, and that's what's so hilarious is that if they were able to extinct us
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.880]  They would get rid of their reason to even exist. They are true lightweights
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.120]  Yeah, yeah, and and look about the tactic that's being used here
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:35.880]  The tactic that was used against you when CNN complained and got you D platform last year
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.360]  I think it was a loft across many platforms Vox attacking
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:45.600]  Crowder and now the Daily Beast attacking natural news and immediately within well within hours
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.240]  We were banned by Facebook. This is what I call tag team techno
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:56.000]  They keep acting like the the the establishment media has power these are corporate agreements
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  This was set up over three years ago
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:04.880]  Where they say it to give them cover like they had pressure to do it. That's all that is exactly its big tech running
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:09.600]  Yeah, yeah, you know exactly how it operates. They were planning on doing it anyway
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:14.480]  In fact, I'm a little bit shocked that we were not completely deleted by Facebook long ago
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.600]  But what they did they tried to keep us around but shadow ban us
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.440]  99.99% which is even more insidious in a way because then they say well, we're not censoring anyone
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.760]  But so you know enough for the vitriol
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.800]  That was so right. Yeah, the smarter folks just want the shadow ban
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:36.880]  But but some of the older insiders like Soros they want it banned. They want to see that they want to believe that they want to know that
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:45.360]  Right, right and right now and you said it earlier America is under attack. There is a you know humans are being
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:52.560]  essentially inoculated with biological weapons and brought into our country even in Texas as you mentioned with the people from the Ebola
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:59.800]  countries right now coming into Texas by the hundreds probably by the thousands on screen you fly in from a foreign country you get screened
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.520]  But no not unwashed Africans literally and let's expand on that mind
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.120]  I want you to come back tomorrow for a full 30 minutes if you can or come in studio
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:12.880]  Here's the deal they're getting ready to try to take out Trump. They're getting ready to make their move this level of censorship all this
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.880]  They admit they're getting ready for their big move
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.920]  Oh, you're absolutely right. That is the main point here the only reason to
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:26.480]  Conduct us what I call this online ethnic cleansing to eliminate all voices that are pro-trump or pro-america
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:32.240]  Is because they have something massive coming and they don't want you to be able to because they know you're Johnny on the spot
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.360]  Even more than I am now with your articles. I always feel good. I wake up and I'm busy and I'm like I don't have writers to do it
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.760]  Like oh great. Mike's already up at 2 a.m. He's got it
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:47.200]  They don't want your info viral spread when the hammer drops. That's why every listener on am fm shortwave on the internet right now
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.480]  It's so precious that when there's a big event or something happens
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:55.200]  You've got to come to our sites and you've got or even to your email because they may shut the sites down
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:00.720]  So that we can email you at info wars.com for slash newsletter sign up for or get Mike's free newsletter
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.480]  Because that's still the way we can get to you and they're still pissed about that. They're planning a hot revolution against us Mike
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.680]  Yeah, and don't forget your people listening to you right now if they sign up for your newsletter
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:17.600]  They should not use a gmail.com or a yahoo email. I guarantee you your tech team will tell you
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:20.160]  They're already blocking it. It's been happening for six months
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.560]  Yep, and I know it because they're doing it to us too. They've been doing it to everybody
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:32.080]  So Mike you talked about it a year ago. They now announce on google and microsoft. They're going to block our sites at browser level
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.960]  Not on the site. They're going to do it on your phone
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.600]  Yeah, I know people are going to have to really look into the brave browser
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.760]  They're going to have there's uh, I think gab is working on a browser. Aren't they some browser?
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:48.320]  The point is is that everything? Yes, everything's building towards this everybody has to be on maximum alert
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.120]  But again, they've got psychiatrists and psychologists running this
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.480]  They need to do it incrementally by the little attacks
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.520]  We would get numb to it when the big attacks came we fall asleep
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840]  The big death blows are coming
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:02.320]  Everyone has to get frosty and go into maximum awareness
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:05.760]  Mike talk to producers pop back on tomorrow with phase two what happened to you
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:11.360]  I appreciate you holding to come on natural news.com where you have to go to get it unfiltered info wars.com
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.720]  News wars.com. They're going after everybody and they put up these big hours. Thank you, Mike
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:18.880]  They're putting all these divided conqueror articles
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:24.240]  Where they try to like call everybody Nazis the New York Times and then they hope a few people in there go
