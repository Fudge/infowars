[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:43.720]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is the
[00:43.720 --> 00:51.520]  eve of election day already November 3rd 2008 and we're going to be live
[00:51.520 --> 00:58.960]  here for the next four hours we're also gonna have wide open phones throughout
[00:58.960 --> 01:12.000]  the broadcast today I have a lot of news I do want to go over I'm in a very
[01:12.000 --> 01:19.680]  thoughtful reflective mode today more I study the New World Order the more I
[01:19.680 --> 01:25.160]  study human activities throughout history the greater my understanding
[01:25.160 --> 01:34.720]  becomes and the greater my sadness intensifies because I don't even hate my
[01:34.720 --> 01:41.480]  enemies I don't even hate the enemies of liberty and freedom I just am so sad so
[01:41.480 --> 01:44.280]  sad at all the bad things that have happened throughout history and all the
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.520]  bad things that are unfolding now and what this country and this world is
[01:48.520 --> 01:58.160]  going to be going through because some very very bloodthirsty people some very
[01:58.160 --> 02:04.720]  very selfish greedy people some very cold-blooded people some control freaks
[02:04.720 --> 02:12.040]  of the 10th order are in control of our planet and are socially engineering us
[02:12.040 --> 02:24.320]  into something very bad so today we will have open phones throughout the full
[02:24.320 --> 02:31.320]  four hours of the show giving you a chance to chime in instead of myself
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.280]  exclusively or my guest talking at you with important information nonetheless I
[02:36.280 --> 02:40.440]  do want to hear from the listeners on any of the news items any of the issues
[02:40.440 --> 02:45.520]  taking place in our world the election the economy the police state the
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.640]  control grid the global taxation system that's being set up we will discuss it
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.520]  all today you know I I've interviewed Joseph Stiglitz Nobel Prize winner for
[02:56.520 --> 03:05.840]  economics he's won two prizes I don't know six seven times and I've always
[03:05.840 --> 03:09.520]  said on aerial he's a globalist but we've had him on because he was
[03:09.520 --> 03:16.800]  criticizing the IMF World Bank system as predatory but we've certainly not been
[03:16.800 --> 03:22.680]  saying he is a good guy and we see them playing their good cop bad cop with us
[03:22.680 --> 03:30.360]  he has come out along with hundreds of other economists and monetary experts
[03:30.760 --> 03:38.240]  parasites and said we need a world government we need a world system run
[03:38.240 --> 03:45.040]  for and by the banks to help all the poor so we have that clip coming up today
[03:45.040 --> 03:55.240]  for you the public is now learning about what the greeny revolution is all
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.240]  about it's about taxes it's about regulation it's about lowering our
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.560]  standard of living and they're on record saying that and people are now
[04:04.560 --> 04:10.640]  learning that Barack Obama wants to shut down basically every coal facility
[04:10.640 --> 04:22.280]  coal powered coal fuel power plant in the United States 49% of our power is
[04:22.280 --> 04:28.800]  supplied by coal and then people call in and say well it's a greenhouse gas it's
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.600]  carbon dioxide it's deadly poison well it's number one it's not deadly poison
[04:33.600 --> 04:39.160]  it's what plants breathe and they say well coal's dirty well they they have
[04:39.160 --> 04:42.800]  clean burning coal four states haven't it's been laid off limits with the
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.840]  federal government so they saw that coming a long time ago and shut that
[04:46.840 --> 04:52.360]  down so there's just a lot we're going to be talking about today very important
[04:52.360 --> 04:57.640]  information a lot of key audio clips as well websites are in full wars.com
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.000]  prisonplotter.com stay with us
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.800]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length
[05:05.800 --> 05:08.800]  here recently and she was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking
[05:08.800 --> 05:13.040]  about the gas prices the food prices this economic uncertainty we're in these you
[05:13.040 --> 05:16.040]  know really kind of perilous times no one knows where we're headed or where we
[05:16.040 --> 05:19.280]  might end up and she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days
[05:19.280 --> 05:22.760]  folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and
[05:22.760 --> 05:25.600]  they could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people
[05:25.600 --> 05:28.440]  who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the
[05:28.440 --> 05:31.480]  landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't have the chickens and the
[05:31.480 --> 05:34.920]  livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain
[05:34.920 --> 05:38.400]  right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global
[05:38.400 --> 05:42.240]  food shortage now what can you do to prepare do what I did sell some toys off

[06:24.400 --> 06:29.720]  despotism to grow at our own door seven years after the attacks of September 11

[08:29.200 --> 08:37.640]  and today we're going to be going over quite a bit of that and of course
[08:37.640 --> 08:46.360]  taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 GOP pollster says he cannot
[08:46.360 --> 08:52.800]  foresee scenario where McCain wins this is from raw story it's up on prison
[08:52.800 --> 08:57.520]  planet.com it doesn't look good for Senator John McCain both campaigns have
[08:57.520 --> 09:00.360]  pushed polls that show their candidate in a position to win the
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.720]  presidential race a Republican pollster said it is highly unlikely McCain will
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.920]  triumph on a Tuesday I cannot foresee a scenario that John McCain has elected
[09:10.920 --> 09:14.800]  the president of the United States pollster Frank Luntz said remember
[09:14.800 --> 09:22.080]  Frank Luntz is the guy that has been caught having fake staged focus groups
[09:22.080 --> 09:30.320]  on TV and that's on record and I have no doubt that the media's diatribe the
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.240]  last few months that it was a foregone conclusion that Barack Obama would be
[09:34.240 --> 09:39.240]  president that that hasn't had an effect on the public oh we've got to be with
[09:39.240 --> 09:45.000]  the winners so we'll vote for Barack Obama but there's a trump card in all
[09:45.000 --> 09:52.000]  of this right around 40% of the country has voting machines put in by
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.760]  three different companies that have been proven to steal elections and engage in
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.040]  mass rigging electronically and their own engineers and software designers have
[10:01.040 --> 10:04.240]  gone public and they've been caught stealing elections and that's on record
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.480]  and so George Bush clearly lost the 2000 election George Bush clearly lost the
[10:10.480 --> 10:16.720]  2004 election but both of the candidates basically stood down and took a dive
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.800]  you don't just rig the election you have to rig the opposition as well and so
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.520]  what this will do now with Barack Obama it looks like set to win tomorrow night
[10:30.320 --> 10:35.840]  that will now have the left go back to sleep and not be concerned about election fraud
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.840]  and then Barack Obama has said he will continue the war he will even expand it
[10:39.840 --> 10:43.040]  he will expand a warrantless wiretapping against the American people
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.880]  he has said he will increase the defense budget he's doing everything they want
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.120]  and that's why he's raised a lot more money from big international corporations
[10:53.120 --> 10:56.880]  than even John McCain that's why the establishment everything they could to
[10:56.880 --> 11:03.040]  not run a strong republican candidate on popular issues like controlling the
[11:03.040 --> 11:09.040]  border or national sovereignty or a host of other issues no they ran milk toast
[11:09.040 --> 11:19.760]  John McCain knowing that he would basically throw it for Barack Obama
[11:21.440 --> 11:23.840]  and that's what we have going on here
[11:27.440 --> 11:35.200]  so now the public is being sold on the fact that Obama is going to be their savior
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.320]  and that he's going to bring big change and that he is going to remake the face of the world
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.920]  they're running tv ads radio ads print ads 30 minute propaganda cast where he is seated in
[11:47.920 --> 11:53.120]  the oval office already with that predictive programming brainwashing the public with the
[11:53.120 --> 11:58.400]  idea that it's inevitable that it's a foregone conclusion that nothing can stop it
[11:58.400 --> 12:11.520]  and so we need to start analyzing what it will mean to have Barack H. Obama as president
[12:13.760 --> 12:17.840]  barring some bizarre twist of fate where the establishment
[12:17.840 --> 12:24.320]  uses the electronic voting systems to throw it to John McCain Barack Obama will be
[12:24.320 --> 12:33.520]  the 44th president of the united states and there will be change ladies and gentlemen
[12:33.520 --> 12:41.120]  like you've never seen million plus person youth brigade spying and tattling on their
[12:41.120 --> 12:47.280]  neighbors not my words their words we first reported this a year ago and then it was back
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.680]  in the news three or four months ago people couldn't believe it but now some of the videos
[12:51.680 --> 12:57.600]  actually surfaced on youtube of obama calling for it doesn't matter john mccain has called for
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.880]  using the army on the streets of america and domestic spy forces because see both men are
[13:02.880 --> 13:09.200]  pushing an agenda that's already in place under secure core a division of americorps set up by
[13:09.200 --> 13:20.000]  george w bush in 2001 and that was in the planning stages way back in the 1980s so
[13:20.000 --> 13:28.400]  it is a seamless passing of the baton from george w bush to barack h obama all of the
[13:29.840 --> 13:36.000]  polls basically are trending in that direction even in the polls that mccain hails the few
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.600]  polls that show him neck and neck or one point behind one point ahead those are few and far
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.840]  between and those are within the margin of error when you have the great body of polls and
[13:47.840 --> 13:54.960]  and information coming out showing that the people are sick and tired of george bush and so now
[13:55.520 --> 14:01.920]  they will go out elect barack h obama and the system won't even have to be rigged at least
[14:01.920 --> 14:06.560]  at the presidential level and there will be lots of vote stealing at the house and senate level
[14:06.560 --> 14:12.160]  there will be lots of vote stealing on those machines lots of vote flipping lots of gubernatorial
[14:12.160 --> 14:18.800]  races being cheated as they thwart the will of the people so regardless of which man is
[14:18.800 --> 14:25.360]  elected this is what you're going to get giant domestic spy forces more domestic surveillance
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.760]  face scanning cameras license plate reading tracking cameras tracking everywhere you go
[14:29.760 --> 14:37.280]  your cell phones being tracked your phone calls being listened to a three million person environmental
[14:37.280 --> 14:46.560]  stasi brigade that's also being set up by both candidates years in the making years in preparation
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.720]  you're going to have continued war in iraq you're going to have expanded wars and conflicts around
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.560]  the world you are going to see massive tax increases across the board and by the way they've
[14:58.560 --> 15:03.680]  been changing the tax code in the last eight years the taxes have actually gone up they'll
[15:03.680 --> 15:10.240]  have lots of widely publicized tax cuts and rebates but then if you really look at the
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.800]  taxes anybody that pays taxes separately from having it with all from their check knows that they've
[15:16.240 --> 15:24.800]  brought in lots of mandatory overrides and different things to increase your taxes property
[15:24.800 --> 15:30.800]  taxes state taxes regulations of every type of mushroomed across the fruited plain
[15:30.800 --> 15:41.280]  we need to know what we're going into we're going into a barrage obama presidency where suddenly
[15:41.280 --> 15:50.080]  the left will hail all of what george bush has built or as a figurehead all that's been built
[15:50.080 --> 15:57.760]  in his name when really george bush was just one more layer in the construction of this new world
[15:57.760 --> 16:04.880]  order so strap yourselves in the right of this nation has been wedded to war and tyranny and
[16:04.880 --> 16:11.120]  torture and corruption and they will support barack obama in all of that the left will
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.840]  predominantly support him in that those that try to go out and protest will be rubber bulleted and
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.800]  shot with beanbags and sprayed and arrested and charged as terrorists as they're now doing in
[16:20.800 --> 16:28.720]  minnesota and the long night cometh and the biggest issue is barack obama was even more
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.120]  supportive than mccain the banker takeover bill people keep saying well why aren't they handing
[16:33.120 --> 16:37.920]  out the money why are they keeping it for bonuses why why the brokerage firms and select banks doing
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.400]  all this why aren't they bailing us out well that they were never going to do that the bill
[16:42.400 --> 16:47.920]  was a takeover the bill was economic martial law that's not just my words a lot of mainline analysts
[16:47.920 --> 16:53.840]  have said that the bill gave them total immunity total secrecy to do whatever they want but
[16:54.720 --> 16:58.880]  and then the congress has released all these blacked out pages of who and what has been paid
[16:59.760 --> 17:10.240]  but what the companies admit is hundreds of billions of dollars in bonuses to jp morgan chase
[17:10.240 --> 17:22.720]  city bank wells fargo bank of america and others i mean so far they're talking about 25 to 40
[17:22.720 --> 17:29.680]  billion two different numbers have been put out for goldman sacks executives in bonuses
[17:29.680 --> 17:35.600]  and they're talking about what's already happened in england 14 billion dollars or seven and a half
[17:35.600 --> 17:45.040]  million pounds in bonuses out of the british bailout that was 400 billion dollars there was a uh
[17:45.680 --> 17:53.760]  250 billion than another another one for 200 billion so that's what's going on right there just
[17:53.760 --> 17:59.440]  open bank robbery in front of everybody and they're not going to stop there they have now
[17:59.440 --> 18:04.240]  announced they want their world banking system with world governmental powers to regulate the
[18:04.240 --> 18:12.000]  planet and they are going to have cap and trade carbon taxes they are going to tax the electricity

[25:17.680 --> 25:26.640]  800-259-9231 somebody on uh one of my listeners great folks out there needs to on a youtube channel
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.480]  or something put together all these videos i've seen the last month as prime ministers
[25:32.480 --> 25:38.080]  chancellors presidents presidential candidates joe biden i mean there's got to be
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.720]  30 40 of them i don't know that i've seen or read where all the world leaders are openly saying the
[25:44.720 --> 25:50.720]  heads of the imf world bank federal reserve treasury departments are all saying a world
[25:50.720 --> 25:56.880]  government run for and by the banks a new world order will fix this crisis which they engineered
[25:56.880 --> 26:05.040]  and we need a world currency directed out of london with three sub world currencies
[26:05.680 --> 26:11.600]  a north american currency a european union currency an asian currency with seven sub
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.760]  currencies exactly what the trilateral commission called for in 74 exactly what the club of rome
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.400]  always is calling for exactly what the big monetary institutions are calling for i mean
[26:22.400 --> 26:29.360]  people are like alex how did you know exactly what they proposed years ago oh i read what they
[26:29.360 --> 26:35.120]  said they were going to do and i loved to my little horn that's what's so amazing about
[26:35.120 --> 26:41.840]  this is it's now all over the news the public is having the gauntlet thrown down in our faces for
[26:41.840 --> 26:52.320]  every one to see as clear as day and they promise to do all these other horrible things to us
[26:52.320 --> 26:57.920]  and they keep their promises so let's go ahead this is joseph stichl if you can watch the whole
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.320]  clip up on cnbc we've also got a link to it up on prisonplanet.com but you can um you can go
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.880]  there and watch the whole six-minute conversation but he's going through how horrible things are
[27:08.880 --> 27:13.920]  and how bad the banks are and how bad america is and how our corrupt free market did this
[27:13.920 --> 27:19.440]  this isn't free market this is the very institutions he works for that engineered this and wrote and
[27:19.440 --> 27:26.000]  i'm gonna get him back on and confront him about it but the point here is
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.200]  that they are flaunting this they are putting this in our face here he is on cnbc former chief
[27:35.200 --> 27:42.160]  economist was the world bank he also worked for the imf the point is he's won the Nobel prize
[27:42.160 --> 27:48.320]  twice we've had him on here many times here he is saying what the other flock of parrots the
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.920]  monetary parasites are saying a global reserve currency rather than having the whole system
[27:53.920 --> 28:00.080]  depend on the dollar goes up goes down uh... has a good president has a bad president a global
[28:00.080 --> 28:05.360]  reserve currency kane's talked about that a global regulator uh... it's clear that america
[28:05.360 --> 28:10.400]  exported its toxic mortgages all around the world people thought they could trust american
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.200]  regulation obviously they couldn't uh... but it's very difficult for every country to enter
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.800]  to to look at what goes on in every other country in the world of globalization uh... america couldn't
[28:20.800 --> 28:27.040]  function if we had to rely exclusively on state regulation as a national economy so you need a
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.640]  global regulator needs to do something about global competition authority um... one of the
[28:32.640 --> 28:37.120]  problems is that we have these institutions that are too big to fail but these are global
[28:37.120 --> 28:44.880]  institutions uh... iceland uh... small economy had banks that were in some sense bigger than that
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.840]  economy but that's the nature of globalization so we need to have to have some kind of global
[28:49.840 --> 28:55.920]  oversight on these financial institutions there we go it is the financial institutions that are
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.400]  the global government you can literally read in hundreds of publications where they're saying you
[29:00.400 --> 29:07.280]  will pay your carbon taxes to them this is world government of four and by the banks
[29:07.920 --> 29:14.080]  and they are going to loot everything their anti-family farm their anti-small business
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.720]  they are going to turn loose their green soldiers their greenie meanies look out
[29:20.240 --> 29:26.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:26.880 --> 29:34.880]  our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.920]  worldwide but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope the first time in modern history the people
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.320]  are beginning to wake up it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow

[34:30.880 --> 34:35.680]  and farm relations documents government documents ran corporation documents where they talk about
[34:36.880 --> 34:41.440]  living in a world where bureaucrats visit your house every week where block captains
[34:41.440 --> 34:47.040]  environmental captains inspect your home your light bulbs your house where your children
[34:47.040 --> 34:52.480]  are turned against you and brainwashed where we have a one-child policy where a national
[34:52.480 --> 34:59.520]  on dcard keeps track of all of our purchases for the new carbon tax system and on the other side of
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.800]  that you have a neighborhood watch commander which they've now announced to look for terrorist
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.640]  where you have national compulsory national service where it's not even called a draft boys
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.600]  and girls men and women have to serve they just let you opt out me a domestic stasi
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.360]  you know when i read all of that when i read them openly saying they were going to implode the
[35:21.360 --> 35:31.680]  economy by design in between the year 2006 and 2010 in the 70s and i see them in the last few
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.720]  years prepared even the financial times of london comes out admits large central private banks
[35:36.720 --> 35:42.320]  we're going to implode the economy by design and bring in true world government of and by the banks
[35:42.320 --> 35:50.720]  and that you would pay them your carbon tax i mean how could i not go on air and warn people
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.680]  and then how could i be called a kook or a weirdo for publishing the documents and having
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.880]  guessed on and reading it and let me tell you what else they say they're going to do
[36:02.320 --> 36:06.240]  they say they're going to sterilize us to the food and water they say they're going to carry
[36:06.240 --> 36:11.360]  out eugenics against us they plan to kill the majority of us and hey i know that's crazy and
[36:11.360 --> 36:17.520]  that's scary but it's all on paper in my film the road to turning we give you the chapter the
[36:17.520 --> 36:24.000]  name the document the official u n policy passed by the full united nations in general assembly
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.880]  the biological diversity assessments the club of rome documents and let me tell you you you can
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.360]  deny it you can become scared by what i'm saying and just say oh that can't be true and frankly
[36:35.360 --> 36:42.400]  at some levels i don't blame you every day i don't want to say i'm shaken to my core i am chilled to
[36:42.400 --> 36:52.800]  my core when i realize this is real this is really going on it takes a lot for me to psychologically
[36:52.800 --> 36:59.040]  the mentally to spiritually god up to what i'm dealing with to what we're all facing
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.120]  and i wish every day it wasn't true god i wish it wasn't true because stuff's going to get bad
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.400]  and stuff's going to be really bad for people like me
[37:16.640 --> 37:22.320]  and i feel sad for the american people decadent confused bread and raised and lies and corruption
[37:24.320 --> 37:28.480]  i feel sorry even for the evil enforcers the low level and middle level minions they have no idea
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.600]  what they're part of they a lot of them think they're good guys they think evil is good they've
[37:33.600 --> 37:41.440]  been taught torture and lying and corruption and lying on the stand is good they are
[37:45.920 --> 37:54.560]  destroyed they're not even really living and people in our own movement the awakening movement
[37:54.560 --> 37:59.040]  the alternative media people who disagree with the media and the government whatever you want to call
[37:59.040 --> 38:07.920]  us dissenters heretics the majority of the world i really shouldn't expect to see purity and honor
[38:07.920 --> 38:17.200]  and decency all of these most precious possessions that people sell for a false reality not even for
[38:17.200 --> 38:23.760]  monetary gain i mean why would we expect in such a rotten twisted society that people on
[38:23.760 --> 38:26.640]  our own movement would be upright would be decent would be good would be honorable
[38:26.640 --> 38:33.520]  were better than others on average but i see the delusion i see a nation a world of people
[38:33.520 --> 38:39.120]  but a nation particularly of decadence generation for generation raised in decadence compared to
[38:39.120 --> 38:49.040]  our forefathers and mothers who lie to themselves i learned more and more that the world revolves
[38:49.040 --> 39:04.160]  around envy and greed and avarice and fear and that most people live in delusion
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.320]  they lie to themselves about who they are they they lie to themselves about the things they've
[39:10.320 --> 39:19.760]  done i mean you one of your greatest mental faculties one of your greatest possessions
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.400]  as important as your sight
[39:25.520 --> 39:32.480]  or touch is your moral compass and the ability to truly judge oneself
[39:32.480 --> 39:41.280]  and then to judge others but not in a hateful way to judge others according to the way you
[39:41.280 --> 39:48.480]  understand humans behave and act and operate and in that lies the secret
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.520]  to living just because i understand that most central of secrets doesn't mean that i put
[39:57.520 --> 40:04.800]  into practice always doesn't mean that i am as pure as the driven snow far from it the new world
[40:04.800 --> 40:13.280]  order knows man the new world order knows themselves know thyself and they choose to be dominant they
[40:13.280 --> 40:20.320]  choose to crush innocence they choose to mutate whole societies and traffic in the souls of men
[40:20.320 --> 40:24.960]  what is the soul of a man it's as intellect as i it's his ideas it's the sum of his actions in
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.520]  his life and the choices you've made and the knowledge you've gained and who you are
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.200]  madison avenue the hype machine it traffics in the souls of men
[40:39.920 --> 40:42.160]  they deal in the souls of men
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.040]  i have a friend who i've been needing to talk to on the phone and always been calling me named
[40:49.040 --> 40:57.440]  darrell rundus and repeatedly over the last few months i um you know have quoted an analogy that he
[40:57.440 --> 41:08.000]  gave to me uh parable and i haven't really done it properly but as you know the eyes they say are
[41:08.000 --> 41:17.600]  the windows for the soul they are the incredibly complex beautifully designed intricate systems
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.320]  that let you operate the three-dimensional world when you're in your embryonic development
[41:24.960 --> 41:32.080]  the eyes grow out of the brain their brain stocks brain stems and they come forward
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.800]  it's literally brain tissue the eyes are made of brain tissue
[41:38.800 --> 41:48.480]  you're looking at someone's mind you're looking literally into the windows into their mind truly
[41:48.480 --> 41:56.000]  the windows of the soul and people that sell out to corruption sell out to evil sell out
[41:57.600 --> 41:58.800]  to all of its forms
[42:03.040 --> 42:06.960]  you can go to them and say what would you give for your eyes
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.160]  to go to a clinic to go to a doctor and to sell me your eyes and you know you could legally do that
[42:12.160 --> 42:17.840]  people sell their kidneys what would you do if i gave you ten thousand dollars for your eyes
[42:17.840 --> 42:23.520]  well no i'd be blind that's how i see it's my body that's the wind that's the wind into my soul
[42:24.320 --> 42:28.320]  what about a hundred thousand no no way what about a million what about ten million what about a hundred
[42:28.320 --> 42:35.680]  million and only a fool maybe one out of a hundred people would say yes i'll give up my eyes and
[42:35.680 --> 42:43.040]  after they gave up their eyes they would howl in terror begging for them back offering that
[42:43.040 --> 42:53.600]  hundred million that billion back to get their sight so what would you give for your soul
[42:53.600 --> 42:56.240]  when the eyes are only the connection to it
[42:58.880 --> 43:04.000]  if you're an atheist the connection to your computer to your hard drive to your to your brain
[43:04.000 --> 43:12.400]  to that collection of three brains that's what we really have
[43:16.080 --> 43:21.680]  the lower brain and the left and right side of the brain the three integrated systems
[43:27.280 --> 43:28.400]  what would you give
[43:28.400 --> 43:30.400]  of
[43:33.280 --> 43:35.040]  what would you give to get your sight back
[43:37.920 --> 43:38.880]  if you'd lost it
[43:42.720 --> 43:44.000]  you know they've been reattaching
[43:46.960 --> 43:52.080]  through different medical procedures people's eyes who were born blind or
[43:52.080 --> 43:58.960]  never been able to see and they can see but they can't make sense of it ever and then it's basically
[43:58.960 --> 44:07.440]  useless for them it's just pointless shapes but someone who has seen they can be given their
[44:07.440 --> 44:13.920]  sight back at least a shadow of it but it's getting better and better and i think it's wonderful
[44:13.920 --> 44:18.880]  but can you imagine
[44:21.200 --> 44:27.520]  giving up your eyesight for ten thousand dollars or a million dollars it's the same thing your brain
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.640]  is being bombarded with images through the television set and through the media and the
[44:32.640 --> 44:37.520]  culture that are changing who you are changing your beliefs changing what you would have been
[44:37.520 --> 44:44.400]  changing what you would have been you've been given a false culture a lie a fraud
[44:46.160 --> 44:50.480]  they sell you on a george bush or a john mccain or a barack obama they sell you on a
[44:50.480 --> 44:54.960]  false set of ideas of what they stand for and what they're going to do they've given you a false
[44:54.960 --> 45:03.840]  download of reality they have twisted all of us they have poisoned us they have put poison in the
[45:03.840 --> 45:10.480]  water that they know reduces your IQ that literally blots the eyesight of the mind the
[45:10.480 --> 45:17.040]  understanding what is thought it is a complex three-dimensional and even four-dimensional overlay
[45:17.040 --> 45:23.600]  of the world around you past present and future integrating the information taking in the data
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.240]  it is wondrous it is magic it is a blessing and you just take it for granted
[45:28.240 --> 45:34.960]  and you set your little children down in front of the tv set with their whole future being robbed
[45:34.960 --> 45:40.880]  with their minds being destroyed with the system falsely going in and programming them instead of
[45:40.880 --> 45:47.200]  you rising them up raising them up building them up they're being bombarded with by scientifically
[45:47.200 --> 45:54.880]  crafted weaponized system that's only one part of it lest they struggle through that layer they
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.000]  put fluoride in their water they put hormones to sterilize them and toxify them and to give them
[46:00.000 --> 46:11.440]  cancers in their drinking containers they give them gmo food which kills the rats and getting
[46:11.440 --> 46:20.560]  pigs it's fed to they approve it we have a soft killed holocaust with cancer up several thousand
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.080]  percentile points in every category diabetes up several thousand or more percent in every
[46:26.080 --> 46:35.440]  category autism up several thousand percent in every category we're dying we're being killed
[46:35.440 --> 46:40.480]  because the enemy knows they can't come in like the nazis and round up whole cities and the machine
[46:40.480 --> 46:47.120]  got us or workers of death in labor camps they had to come up with soft kills slow kill systems
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.920]  that are hard to diagnose poisons they introduce in the environment that combine in our bodies
[46:54.080 --> 47:00.880]  then they misinstruct and misdirect the doctors who are not specialists and not be able to see it
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.360]  and then the specialists do put out thousands of reports detailing what's happening you could have
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.960]  90 percent of the environmental protection agency write letters two years ago 90 percent of their
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.840]  scientists and toxicologists saying sodium fluoride is deadly and is a cover term for a
[47:15.840 --> 47:20.880]  bunch of other poisons take it out take it out now and they say no we will not people say oh well
[47:20.880 --> 47:25.520]  something like this was happening people inside would expose it they have exposed it they're not
[47:25.520 --> 47:31.360]  bad you think the average epa scientists once their children dying once them poisoned by this
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.440]  i've got all these news reports and clips and studies going back to the 50s they would
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.760]  fluoridate water supplies they noticed the cows and horses would all die and they learned back then
[47:41.760 --> 47:49.840]  on big industrial farms to not give fluoridated water to the cows to the sheep to the goats
[47:50.880 --> 47:56.960]  to the horses there is no doubt and then more and more i realize just with the fluoride issue
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.880]  alone people can go research they can go find out they can see all the government studies
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.920]  not just institutions thousands of them they can find out about the doubling of bone cancer
[48:05.920 --> 48:12.800]  cancer the tripling of brain cancers the quadrupling or higher in studies of leukemias
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.160]  for god's sakes do whatever you can to at least not drink the fluoride
[48:21.200 --> 48:26.640]  to at least they're now adding it to hundreds of foods to at least not eat the foods because i
[48:26.640 --> 48:38.240]  don't want your son or daughter your precious angel to die god help us and and in that knowing
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.000]  they put it in the water knowing we have the documents where they put it in the water by
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.720]  designed to hurt us that tells you all you need to know about these people and that tells you the
[48:48.720 --> 48:58.880]  fbi and police all you need to know you know i've talked to fbi agents i've run into over the years
[48:58.880 --> 49:02.720]  and i'll tell them go check this stuff out go check it out on google they're like alex i know a lot
[49:02.720 --> 49:08.560]  of it's true and i don't want to get on the list looking at that stuff see they'll just admit to
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.080]  me yeah we know we're being watched how is that something you want to give your children and
[49:14.080 --> 49:21.680]  don't give me that bull about al-qaeda come on if they would give black men syphilis if they'd
[49:21.680 --> 49:27.840]  radiate thousands of american children to death and radiation experiments if they would nerve gas
[49:27.840 --> 49:34.240]  our own troops lethally and test and they would put sodium fluoride in our water what else are
[49:34.240 --> 49:40.240]  they doing well let me tell you what they're doing they're taking everything innocent and everything

[54:13.520 --> 54:18.720]  news tip but i'd just like to say it to you man it's so hard not to lose heart sometimes you know
[54:18.720 --> 54:25.040]  and and especially i'm so glad i'm not you in my but but you are honest to god the perfect person
[54:25.040 --> 54:30.000]  in the in the perfect place to say these things you've got the mind for it you've got the the
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.440]  ability to to express yourself so clearly and you've got the ability to see things in the big
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.360]  picture and the small picture don't be so hard on yourself man you know we all love you dude
[54:41.360 --> 54:46.880]  you know really well let me don't think i'm even bummed out so much today i i'm just sad
[54:46.880 --> 54:52.640]  you know it was okay when i could hate people in mainstream media that lied and twisted things
[54:52.640 --> 54:58.800]  but now i don't even hate them i see how pathetic they are and it's sad for humanity because and
[54:58.800 --> 55:04.640]  now look at the cold blooded neural water controllers the social engineers and i and i
[55:04.640 --> 55:10.160]  realized that so many people that are going along with this system that are so haughty and arrogant
[55:10.160 --> 55:15.600]  and full of themselves just the general public i just wish they knew what i knew because i wish
[55:15.600 --> 55:19.360]  they could see the research i wish they take time out to look into it and find out we're telling the
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.480]  truth we really got a criminal government the stages terror attacks they really do poisonous and
[55:25.120 --> 55:32.320]  and i realize it's just going to get worse yeah man well uh you know the when you're
[55:32.320 --> 55:37.840]  refining any precious metal the dross rises to the top and uh you skim the dross off the top
[55:37.840 --> 55:42.960]  and you discard it you know perhaps people need to start thinking about ways to skim that dross
[55:42.960 --> 55:48.880]  and uh but i do have a uh a comment on a news story that seems to have kind of slipped through
[55:48.880 --> 55:53.840]  the cracks and i think it might be important i find it ironic that we're possibly going to
[55:53.840 --> 55:59.840]  be voting for a president who may not even be a legal immigrant or a or a legal member of the
[55:59.840 --> 56:07.680]  united states and at the same time we have the american civil liberties union who you know they're
[56:07.680 --> 56:14.880]  not always perfect is uh reporting uh the about the constitution free zone have you heard about
[56:14.880 --> 56:19.440]  that yet alex yeah no that was actually under agenda 21 people are just now learning about it
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.360]  a hundred and something miles 125 miles on all the us borders and coastlines and and that's
[56:25.360 --> 56:28.880]  that's about two-thirds of the population lives on the border or on the coastlines
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.240]  and uh yes there's there's saying the homeland security on record says it's a constitution free
[56:34.240 --> 56:41.120]  area would you mind if i just uh well with people will go if people will simply search for a clu and
[56:41.120 --> 56:46.240]  constitution free zone they'll see a map that'll mock their eyeballs out yeah i've asked my writers
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.000]  a few weeks ago to actually do a report on that we need to get a more detailed one out to give
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.840]  people the clear picture but yes it's really happening uh can i just make one more brief
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.680]  comment on it yes basically what it boils down to is north southeast and west it's a hundred mile
[56:59.680 --> 57:05.120]  border that encompasses you know well on the northern border we've got seattle and spokane and
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.960]  and core delay and these are the ones that are kind of on the border north and all everything
[57:08.960 --> 57:14.560]  north of that all of michigan all search people when they come in it's it's deep inside the country
[57:14.560 --> 57:20.560]  yeah i mean it's everything it's all the big metro and now they're offering a north american
[57:20.560 --> 57:27.760]  travel card separate from uh your passport and see that's going to be for the immigrants this isn't
[57:27.760 --> 57:32.480]  to stop the immigrants this is to unionize the border it's part of the north american union
[57:32.480 --> 57:36.800]  absolutely and uh and of course if they can do this they can get away with it which appears
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.200]  that they're trying to do uh and people just ignore it and say oh what's not affecting me then it's
[57:41.200 --> 57:44.960]  going to go right up the nafta super corridor and 100 miles on either side of that and then
[57:44.960 --> 57:49.760]  we'll be 100 miles on either side of the 100 mile border you just hit the key and that's
[57:49.760 --> 57:54.240]  what i told my writers to do a story on they're also saying the spp there's going to be buffer
[57:54.240 --> 58:03.360]  zones on the 84 or is it 83 uh federal highways the interstates and so those will be international
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.920]  zones and they're going to tax us for the north american union on those roads

[1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:09.280]  world today coming up blue dobs reports on um what we wrote stories about at prisonplanet.com
[1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:17.120]  and info wars.com five years ago and i'm not tooting our horn i'm pointing out again we're
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:26.400]  being accurate here the u.s government is actually been funding iran with the non-peaceful nuclear
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:35.680]  components directly so has israel in the uk we we need to do flashbacks by the way at info wars.com
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:42.480]  and prisonplanet.com those stories blue dobs has reported a tiny fraction of just how bad it is
[1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:48.480]  but we do have that video clip if you want to watch it up on prisonplanet.com that's coming up
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:51.920]  also the carbon taxes what life's going to be like under that a lot of key clips but i want to
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:56.240]  continue with your calls ray in colorado and then tom billy dan and others ray you're on the air
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:04.160]  welcome hello hi ray hi how are you alex i'm fine say listen i just agree with that previous
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:10.160]  caller you are a brother to us all and we love you and we pray for you you have been speaking
[1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:16.160]  truth veritas to the people and we just really appreciate it and i just wanted to agree that
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:21.680]  what does the prophet of man to gain the whole world yet lose your soul and i just i just see
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:26.720]  it coming down to that and um i i just want to make one more comment though as a christian i do
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:32.560]  want to urge people to look at the prophecies that are coming true because there is truth
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:37.760]  and there is lies just there is there's there's no denying it anymore and i just wanted to add
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:43.120]  that the bible does predict that they will make you swear allegiance to their system in order to
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:48.800]  buy or sell and that you'll forfeit your soul forever because uh that's what they ask they ask
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:53.200]  your soul yeah let me say this you know to the listeners that understand the point is would
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:57.280]  you give a million bucks to lose your eyesight you say no absolutely well losing your mind
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:03.920]  losing who you are buying into this world system you know that is a brainwashing uh mechanism
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:09.520]  you are literally losing your soul through that and even if you're an atheist even if you are an
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:16.800]  agnostic the globalists admit they are trying to set themselves up to watch us to surveil us to
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:22.160]  regulate us in an omnipresent fashion and it just so happens they are a cultist even if you don't
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:29.440]  believe in god they really do so again it's so amazing that that they are building this world
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:33.600]  system and it isn't just to buy or sell with the thumbprint the face scan as they're admitting
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:39.360]  they're doing and it's all coming in now it's that they're going to use the phony environmentalism
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:46.320]  to regulate our everyday lives and and put us on a carbon credit ration and so that's going to be
[1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:53.760]  their excuse i mean it's so horrible it's total slavery it's horrible and it's total lies and
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:59.040]  and and you have said it alex you said they they worship lucifer and he's the father of lies so
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:06.960]  they believe it they believe in him and i just do it admonish your uh here is to believe it too
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:12.240]  and choose light don't choose darkness we love you alex god bless you and your family and your
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:17.280]  staff members we are praying for you thank you well i'll say this i've been a very worldly person
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:23.040]  and uh but i've always been my core been a good person and i've always belonged to god
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:27.920]  i've always belonged to the good side though i've certainly stuck more than my toe in evil
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:34.080]  and i'm not afraid of dying i'm not afraid of being killed in fact i'm committed and i'll do
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.960]  whatever it takes and lord knows i'm a target stuff goes on i don't even talk about here on
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:48.480]  erin but every day i feel the spirit of god a spirit of goodness and love and compassion and
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:54.640]  discernment it's it's i can't even articulate the understandings i have it it's it's so complex
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:02.160]  and so multivariate and and deep i just can't even it's just overflowing and i a lot of times it's
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:07.920]  not even a selfishness i don't want to die because i want to continue to grow i want to continue
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:15.440]  to become a better person and uh i want to continue to forgive people that have done bad
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:21.360]  things to me but forgiving people have done bad things you doesn't mean you forgive corruption
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:27.040]  and that you don't stand up and fight it and yes even if you deny spirituality folks the new world

[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:54.720]  just a broadcast note several of the things i keep getting to cover
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:00.160]  cover i have to be very careful about what i say and i realize that more and more
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:04.000]  is the great responsibility i have i'm humbled by by the way
[1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:11.360]  because i'll say things and and then people misconstrue them or start fights over them or
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:17.840]  attack people over them and so i want to be clear about this last week ted anderson got a call from
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:21.600]  one of our final affiliates and i'm not even going to say who but it's out in california
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:27.600]  saying hey uh people are calling us uh saying that alex is on air saying that we're going to
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:34.000]  take him off air and i said well that's news to me and then and and then ted said well no i even
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:42.400]  got some calls from listeners about it uh so what did you say and then ted gave me fragments of
[1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:54.080]  what was said and i went oh no no no i was talking about how i got taken off the air by probably
[1:08:54.640 --> 1:09:02.240]  70 of the stations i had i mean i was up to 80 something right after 9 11 because i went on air
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:08.320]  and said 9 11 was an inside job and then uh a lot of stations took me off the air
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:17.920]  and i was saying that most people will never be in that position i mean i've known other
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:23.840]  uh patriot networks and talk show hosts when they get heat i mean they'll have whole networks where
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:29.440]  9 11 inside job isn't allowed to be discussed uh that was a network out of austin or uh
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.640]  less people say i'm talking about some other network i was not criticizing any operating
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:43.760]  network or any any station currently carrying this show i was uh speaking about being knocked off
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:50.400]  the air in 2001 i mean i got up to 80 something stations mainly mom and pop stations none of the
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:57.920]  big you know corporate giants were carrying us they have an oligopoly of more than 90 percent
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:04.240]  of the talk stations just uh clear channel west wind and a few others uh but mom and pop stations a
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:09.840]  lot of them huge listenerships uh privately owned stations they put me on because they were anti new
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:15.440]  world order real conservatives libertarians uh and uh you know they liked the message of anti
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:21.440]  un anti-world government pro second amendment and the attacking bill clinton who certainly
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:24.880]  deserved it you know and i could go on air and talk about the government bombing oklahoma city
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:31.280]  and that was fine i remember going on other mainline talk shows on clear channel stations as a guest
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:40.240]  and going on there and you know talking about Oklahoma city being an inside job and the host
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:46.000]  agreeing and every caller agreeing it was when i went on air and said 9 11's an inside job like
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.680]  i even lost quite a few stations in the two months leading up to it saying they're gonna attack the
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:53.680]  world trade center they're gonna stage an attack get ready they're gonna launch a biological attack
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:58.400]  get ready they've got to pass all these laws i was reading in a pentagon report so they were
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.800]  saying we're about to be hit by terrorists and our world will change forever north cobble be formed
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:10.960]  and blah blah blah and so i was mainly just talking about never selling out never compromising never
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:17.200]  um watering down what i have to say in fact from memory i think ted said a few stations called
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:20.800]  a couple weeks ago when i uh talked about that thinking i'm talking about them i'm not talking
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:26.560]  about our dear precious wonderful stations that carry the show and we really appreciate all of
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:33.520]  you out there i was talking about the repercussions i have gone through for never compromising
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:38.080]  you know it's easy for johnny come lately to come along and talk about 9 11 being an inside job
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:45.120]  today but did you do it years before 9 11 making films about government sponsored terrorism my
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:51.440]  first film covered that america's robot design i mean did you do it on the day i remember going
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:58.160]  down to be a guest on george humphrey show great guy uh on the day after 9 11 and his producer
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:04.000]  a lady i known for years began screaming and yelling at me in the hall you know saying you
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:10.320]  know shut up you know you're a traitor no it wasn't an inside job now six months later she was
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:15.440]  doing shows about it being an inside job but never really said sorry and never really was nice to me
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:24.800]  again um because people aren't big enough when they've been wrong to admit they're wrong i am
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:32.080]  big enough and i'm trying to be big enough of a person to not be a small person and to admit
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:39.440]  i've been wrong about a lot of things and i've handled a lot of things wrong uh but uh and again
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:45.760]  i said that would be a program note i just spent five minutes on it the other program note they
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:51.600]  have international iranian television press tv it's an english worldwide i'm also on russian tv
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:13:02.000]  live tomorrow i'll be on iranian tv and studio uh on um wednesday but they keep wanting to have me
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.200]  on on a phone interview while i'm on air i never had the time to do that and you'd be surprised you
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:14.800]  think this would be a us bashing fest on iranian tv it's not in fact every time i've been on it's
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:21.440]  two to one on the show against me with a pro us view and by us i mean the people running the us
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:29.120]  so uh they say they're gonna do a simulcast today in the fourth hour we'll see if that happens they
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:34.000]  did it before and then canceled it that should be interesting but you you will hear me passively on
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.880]  air with their host talking and then the other guest and i need to ask traven what the topic is but
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:46.080]  it's very interesting uh to go on these international english uh speaking channels
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:54.800]  so that should be interesting that's coming up so we'll see if that ends up happening in the
[1:13:56.160 --> 1:14:02.960]  fourth hour today okay i said i'd take your calls let's go to uh tom in los vegas nevada you're on
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:08.560]  the air a very good morning or afternoon to you mr jones and thank you for having me on thank you
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:15.760]  okay um you know i just so many of the things that that you say are so brilliant and um and i hear
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:20.080]  a sadness in your voice saying it kind of sad me and i just i just like to remind you and remind
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:26.560]  the listeners you know when you start trying to battle these luciferian freaks on their own
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:32.400]  battleground right i think that it's really easy to get kind of bogged down with the darkness
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:36.240]  right because that's their that's their forte that's what they do and so i would just i would
[1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:41.280]  just like to say like i think for myself like the one way that i found to combat this stuff
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:45.360]  is really the love thing you know just trying to maintain and you mentioned this earlier and it's
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:50.880]  brilliant just you know we have to it's not a pity thing it's just you know these are people too
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:56.480]  like we're all fallible we all have issues and it's just at some point you have to hope
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:59.920]  that these people are going to look at what they're doing and say wow this is really insanity
[1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:04.400]  what i'm doing what i'm perpetrating is just insanity poisoning the children i mean what the
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:09.840]  putting hiv on purpose and over a million doses of factor rate and knowingly shipping
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:15.280]  and out and laughing about it bair did i mean you know there's thousands of things like that i mean
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:21.360]  the reason i say i have sadness actually i'm empowered by almost surrendering and you know
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:27.520]  i flux back and forth between being angry being enraged being focused that way uh but that tires
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:34.240]  me out actually when you hear me you know but saying admitting i'm sad it's more of a commitment a
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.920]  full commitment but you know a deeper level of commitment i keep saying it's a full commitment
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:43.280]  but my commitment just gets deeper levels i didn't know and i'm at peace i'm at peace with whatever
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:49.040]  happens to me i'm at peace with whatever happens to my family it's just a sadness and it's a
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:54.880]  the world is so beautiful goodness is so wonderful decency and wholesomeness and
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:16:01.120]  creativity it sparkles with a billion colors and and i'm and so so at one side i'm so thankful to
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:07.120]  the creator i'm so thankful for all the good people in history and i'm so honored to stand with them
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:12.400]  and humbled by how dirty and bad i am compared to so many of the other beautiful wonderful people
[1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:16.880]  that are here today with us and that have come before and i'm also very sad over the years that
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:22.080]  i you know hadn't grown to the point i'm at now and i know i'll still grow more that i could have
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:32.240]  done a better job so so by sadness uh it's it's it's i don't know i mean it's it's it's such a
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:37.280]  deep thought i it's there aren't even words to describe it it's just the knowing that the new
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:40.480]  world order is real the knowing they're really going to do everything they said they're going to do
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.520]  the knowing that they're going to kill most of us listening right now the knowing that it's all
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:51.920]  pretty much going to happen and i think that's in god's plan too and and to know that it's just
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:58.400]  it is uh it is overwhelming and i appreciate all the thoughts alexa but at the same time i think
[1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:04.320]  when we start to say oh i and it's not yourself and i don't hear you advocating these sorts of
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:07.360]  things but there are a lot of people in the truth movement and so on that say oh we need to get
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:11.440]  shotguns and we need to go kill them and this sort of thing and i really think that that when you
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:15.440]  start to have those dark thoughts when you start to say you know what these people deserve to be
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:19.200]  exterminated then you're doing exactly what they want you to do that that's i think part of their
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:22.800]  con is they're trying to get it out because they don't care about the cops in the military
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.400]  they want them to be chewed up in a fight with them that's part of their plan but
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:31.680]  what do you do when slavering punks and black uniforms are dragging you and your family away
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:37.520]  there is a time to resist but i think the offensive going on looking for it will empower the enemy
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:42.560]  and i think you're right about that and i i would just have to say though that i think that
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:47.520]  that jesus um if he is your role model that's that's you know great i think there are other
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:53.280]  examples you know if you look at gondi if you look at um mlk you know the kind of non-violence thing
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:58.880]  because i and there have been people who brought this up it's like when you start to play by those
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:03.520]  rules then you become that same dehumanizing force that they're trying to to force upon you and so
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:07.760]  i don't really have a good answer for what happens when they kick down your front door right
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:11.920]  like i don't think there there is a good answer to that but i just think that in the interim until
[1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:18.080]  that sort of stuff hits the fan it's going on all around us right we just don't hear their screams
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:23.760]  well i just i think that we have to pray for these people i think we have to stay positive we
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:27.600]  have to stay full of love i think there is if i could just quickly there are two really good
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:33.040]  free books on the internet um the kingdom of god is within you by leo tollstoy um and the
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:36.080]  imitation of christ by thomas kempis i have nothing to sell but they're out there they're
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:42.880]  really good really good free books just like how to try and cultivate that kind of loving god thing
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:47.760]  inside you and not buy into that madness that they're trying to sell us because i think that
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:52.560]  that is the true measure of their power and their wickedness is that when they start to
[1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:56.560]  convince us to play by their rules i think that's where the their power really lies and
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:59.520]  where the destruction really lies and i would just like to warn everybody against that sort of
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:06.640]  thing so all right thank you so much for having tom tom thank you billy dan others your calls are

[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:12.320]  is in the bill you're on the air welcome hey alex i gotta say thank you man i've
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:16.720]  tried to uh call on here i've been on here for an hour and ten minutes waiting to talk to you i
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.800]  just had a couple of questions for you um i just looked up to constant freedom uh constitution free
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:28.800]  zone and that is really scary but uh my questions were one i recently saw a thing on youtube um back
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:34.720]  when they um katrina hit and the military was going through taking all the guns and uh one of
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:41.520]  the military guys right at the end uh get asked by the newscaster um would you shoot an american
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:45.920]  and the guy bluntly said yeah and that really scares me that our troops would shoot our own
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:50.240]  people on american ground i mean what are your thoughts on that well and now in illinois they're
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.480]  using the army to confiscate guns and they're announcing they're going to use black water
[1:25:54.480 --> 1:26:01.680]  and domestic operations and it's really happening but it's going to be incremental
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:07.360]  it's it's really happening i mean they haven't hired 26 000 preachers covertly
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:11.840]  tell their flocks to turn their guns in and go to fema camps when they're told
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:18.720]  because you know they're playing games these are this is domination this is total enslavement they
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:28.400]  want a soviet slash nazi suck dial calling here in the us and the other thing is is um i've watched
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:33.920]  almost all your movies and i gotta say thank you and i try to tell anybody and everybody i can my
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:40.240]  doctors my lawyers my friends my family my foes my enemies uh to watch your shows and learn for
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:44.800]  themselves i almost got no office fight with my brother trying to tell me about the trans um the
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:50.400]  nafta superhighway and the trans uh texas corridor until the fact that my wife turned it on and he
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:55.200]  sat down and he watched it and he was like oh my god and stuff kept out of the mainstream media
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:01.200]  like uh one of the things i recently saw um barack obama the lawsuits filed in philadelphia from the
[1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:06.640]  pennsylvania senator uh bird about obama being born in cania and all this information and they
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:11.600]  had so long to provide the information and uh obama's party won't provide the information
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:15.840]  saying was born in the u.s that's almost like you pointed out with uh them trying to get
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:24.880]  schwarzenegger as president a non-us citizen well he's he's 22nd amendment he's um he can't be
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:31.520]  president because he's not native born and that's what the lawsuit filed against obama
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:36.880]  because it's saying you can look it up on your google search the law we've we've had burg on the
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:42.000]  former deputy attorney general there in pennsylvania and we've gone over that but that's why the
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.920]  establishment also likes barack obama because they can destroy him anytime they want without
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:51.280]  information and people don't know it because it's not mainstream media and now all those
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:56.640]  republicans who supported the police state and torture and spying and north com all that power
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:04.240]  it's going to be handed to barack obama it's it's and you've heard him talk about us pathetic
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:11.120]  gun owners clutching our guns and in your opinion you what do you you think it's going to turn out
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:17.680]  to be a big civil war but they're going to turn it out to be if a rock loses or a barack wins
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:22.400]  black versus white and this and that and they're going to find out but i mean there is a serious
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.440]  chance of riots and things if obama doesn't win the think tanks have said that but but but
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:35.280]  but let me go ahead after hearing all that i heard that uh his vp joe biden head of the
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:39.680]  council of foreign relations called for a new world order twice last week in there newsreak
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:48.160]  is calling him the president of the world yeah not speaking as um trying to stay wrong or imply
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:53.760]  this or anyway but if something like with the executive orders that voices signed in if something
[1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:58.480]  did happen to obama with all these so-called uh terrorist threats and plots to kill him
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:03.520]  Biden would take over and that would give him the ability to declare martial law declare
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:07.440]  everything over the bush wants and they're saying they're going to try to shut down talk radio
[1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:15.680]  and the web but uh it will all unfold in the fullness of time want it just gotta say thank

[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:43.920]  for the president and the senate yes you didn't know you can do that i don't know him yeah well
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:48.960]  um i got my sample about about a week going he's actually on it i actually saw this guy
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.800]  i was at the 9 11 truth rally and uh in two months ago at ground zero he was there passing
[1:33:54.800 --> 1:34:00.080]  out literature and i had no clue who he was and i just want to know if you knew anything about him
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:04.960]  he's got if you go to his website i'm just going to put it out there i'm not even sure i'm gonna
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:10.640]  vote for him but it's jeff boss for president dot org i believe well regardless of he's a 9 11
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:16.080]  truther by being by by running he gets to talk at candidate forums and get on the news and so
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:24.720]  again that gets the truth out so sounds uh great to me resistance is victory yeah and uh i wasn't
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:29.120]  sure who i was gonna vote for president but i think right now it's Cynthia mckinney she seems like
[1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:33.600]  the only honest person that's uh that's on the ticket right now listen i hear you and i appreciate
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:38.240]  your call she's a very nice lady and exposed a trillion stolen by the pentagon and government
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:45.440]  white slavery rings and other things but uh she is an anti-gun person and um so i won't be voting
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:50.160]  for her chuck ball one's far better even ralph natives far better uh so i think you have a lot
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:58.000]  better choices there but uh you can make your own decision with that uh let's go ahead and uh
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.240]  see you always well-meaning liberals like mckinney oh let's have a bunch of taxes and regulations
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:10.240]  that's only for the big elites they only use that to straightjack at us uh but uh she's a nice lady
[1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:16.960]  let's go ahead and uh talk to scott in arizona you're on the air scott hey alex how you doing
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:25.520]  today good sir hey uh two things here i think that uh maybe mckinney might take this thing and
[1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:29.760]  it being like an upset because i'm starting to hear the mainstream press start to show that
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:34.160]  john mckinney's coming up in their polls and you know all the hogwash they feed everybody but i
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:39.040]  think they're saying that what happens if mckinney says an upset but see it's all about the spectacle
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:44.560]  that these guys run something and there's about to be some change either way yet the guys are
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:50.960]  identical on real policies oh i agree that i'm just saying as far as an upheaval as far as the
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.240]  you know thing with oh yeah i mean brocco bomba doesn't win i'll be surprised if we don't because
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:01.280]  people said a lot of these active groups have said they're going to burn major cities and uh that
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:05.440]  will of course will just destroy their own neighborhoods and make inner city folks look bad
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:10.320]  and the system will love sending troops in that will sell the general public on c we need to have
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:15.360]  an end deposit comment on us to keep us safe so either way the new order wins but i think they
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:21.440]  want the new front guy he is for them on every front he can sell the agenda i really think it's
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:25.760]  going to be brocco bomba but listen hillary was the annoying one and i was wrong on that so i'm not
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:30.720]  always right you know i i'm kind of i thought the same thing so i don't know man i think that
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.960]  mccain might throw an upset just to cause this thing to happen it would fit perfect in the plant
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:39.760]  look with forty percent electronic fraud machines at least the establishment's gonna have
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:46.800]  wednesday who they want okay but probably by late tomorrow night but for sure by wednesday
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:52.400]  uh let's see another supreme court deal i mean there's a no doubt in my mind that a brocco
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:57.280]  bomba doesn't win it's been a stolen election but but let's say there was an upset and people got
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:01.520]  scared mccain was winning if the system wants obama they're going to cheat for him either way
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:06.400]  who they want they get people go that's kind of a negative view we know these machines are fraudulent
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:10.960]  we know they're about 40 of the country you know the feds paid to have these put in and we and
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:14.960]  we're never going to get back our real voting look look notice the politicians would at least
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.400]  act like they were doing what we wanted before these machines went in and now they just don't care
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:24.080]  there's a reason for that there's a reason a congress does whatever they're told by the executive
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:29.040]  because they know about those machines i appreciate your call uh let's go ahead bring up some good
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:36.640]  points uh let's talk to us susanne in tennessee hey good morning alex hi um just the day before
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:41.200]  the election i'm catch the news early in the morning because i work in a hospital and chief is
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:46.720]  always on sure and uh one of the headline stories this morning was they're doing uh mock disaster
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:52.400]  drills they're having a nuclear accident a trope right and again they do that to train you to go
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:59.040]  under federal control and to create the psychological impression that terrorism is real and prolific so
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:03.760]  you will accept being conquered by the federal central power that itself is owned by private
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:09.200]  offshore banks openly setting up world government right now yeah that's just about the way it is
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:14.000]  and you know i too like you feel a little bit nostalgic and sad and i just uh you know watch
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:19.120]  the kid to play and and try to remember how beautiful america is today you know and that's
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:25.920]  what we got tomorrow well i mean it's guaranteed it's it's going to be engineered controlled
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:30.080]  depression with everybody getting a government job or a government paid paycheck you'll still
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:34.400]  work for private corporations but the checks are going to come from the government this is total
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:40.720]  enslavement total uh millions of environmental bureaucrats in your home your ranch your farm
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:46.000]  the the animal id the premises id total regulation national id cards to buy and sell
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:51.040]  people being arrested people disappearing i mean they are really openly announcing it
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:57.280]  this isn't just me reading documents now they are setting it up yeah they sure are well listen
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:02.160]  you try to have a good day anyway you too god bless you i appreciate your call uh mike in
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:08.480]  georgia you're on the air go ahead hey i'll tell you fine i'm doing fine oh i just wanted to
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:13.360]  make a point about ventures stance on the border um i'm not saying the fence is going to totally
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:18.560]  fix everything but he said it's going to be like a eastern situation where you know it's going to
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:22.240]  be there to keep us in but well it is too i mean now they're trying to make fishing boats to take
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:27.600]  your 10 miles out uh on since on the border of texas on the coast they're trying to make you have
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:33.040]  a passport to go fishing uh you know past the 10 mile marker of the 12 mile marker and so i
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:37.200]  understand i have huge arguments with him in private his view that it's going to be used to
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:42.720]  keep us in not out uh and they you know he says we should go after the employers but yeah i mean
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:47.360]  he's wrong on that okay and just one more quick point if anyone who thinks the government doesn't
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:52.560]  know they're shipping the drugs in i just saw this guy with a busted uh this high level federal
[1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:57.680]  criminal federal police criminal in mexico like that was a couple days ago and then they found
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:02.000]  out eight other criminals up there were doing business with the drug cartels and this happened
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:06.400]  every week and we're spending 60 million or 60 billion a year something like that down there
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:12.240]  to fund them yeah well they won 164 billion and again that's a drug war it is a drug war
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:17.680]  but only to stop the the cartels that aren't part of the chase manhattan city bank money laundering
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:24.400]  operation and that's on record so so it is a physical war uh in texas california borders down
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:32.960]  into southern mexico over who will control the drugs it's pretty sick and they tell the public
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:38.080]  oh we're stopping the drug dealers i mean they've had you know the the deputy president's caught
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:43.200]  with hundreds of millions in in in their house in their basements i mean it's all just a complete
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:48.320]  fraud they really want that money in this bank don't they well it's not just that it's the
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:53.680]  control see study how the british brought down china the chinese government wouldn't let opium
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:59.680]  in they knew how bad it was so the british east india came in this is mainline history this is
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:05.440]  being you know in psychopedia this is not my opinion and over 50 years they corrupted first
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:09.680]  the port cities in the internal cities they bought off local police because the cops are like yeah
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:14.960]  people want opium i'm going to get all this british money and so they were being corrupted
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:20.320]  and taken over by british intelligence and then they finally broke the country in 10 parts right
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:26.160]  they use a black market to corrupt the police and to create violent gangs that scare the public
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:30.320]  in to then saying give us a solution and then the british said okay we'll just bring our trips in
[1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:36.480]  did they have strict drug laws in china though absolutely they did absolutely it's the same
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:42.720]  model but then you see you get an army of drug addicts who will rob kill steel to get those drugs
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:52.400]  and who has those drugs british yep it's the same deal i can't listen cocaine and heroin were sold
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:57.440]  at every corner store and you had about 25 or 30 depending on the federal histories and studies
[1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:01.360]  who were on drugs they are today and it was pure and it was clean still it was bad and you had a
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:06.000]  lot of a lot of medics and a lot of people grew up drug addicts because rich spoiled families would
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.240]  give the babies laudanum in a sugar tit as they were called that's a sugar cube inside a piece of
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:17.440]  silk or cotton tied up they'd put a drop of laudanum in there and baby don't cry no more
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:24.640]  so i mean you know i'm not saying these things are good the point is is that
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.440]  they understood they said we'll make it illegal then we'll buy off all the police just like
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:34.320]  prohibition they're not in charge because they're stupid i appreciate your call
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:38.480]  let's go ahead and talk to uh alex in florida you're on the air alex
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:46.960]  hello yes sir hey how you doing alex do it i just wanted to note the connection between
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:56.080]  how how we control the earth as far as the studies on willhelm reiko and what are your thoughts on
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:03.120]  that there's a lot of suppressed technologies a lot of advanced technologies the fbi you know
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:07.920]  did shut him down did raid him did raid tesla there are a lot of things that were invented
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.880]  100 years ago 80 years ago that have been suppressed right but there's also a lot of quacks and
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:18.560]  charlatans on the internet selling garbage that gives all the real systems a bad name
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:26.320]  right i found a lot of that so see again things are complex it's not i mean now there are hundreds
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:35.120]  of university studies showing that uh colfusion is real and works mainline universities but the
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:39.440]  news came out and just put out one false report first they built it up and said it's huge it's huge
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:45.040]  back in the uh early 90s and then they killed the story and saying oh it's all fake and then
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:50.160]  people still have that memory in their head meanwhile they've got magnet machines they've got
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:55.600]  systems that separate water into gases and run power i mean they've got it all sir a lot you
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:01.200]  want i just wanted to say also i just wanted to say um if people don't really believe what you say
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:07.520]  about as far as uh if you say something on real tv and things like that if you say something about
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:15.280]  the 9 11 being an inside job just take a look at roseo donnell and how soon as she made her a little
[1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:19.440]  argument with somebody that was in the audience there about it being an inside job right away
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:26.640]  she was shut down that's right they fired her they kicked her out to to send a message and people
[1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:30.800]  say well why do you appreciate roseo donnell or charlie sheen or a willy nelson or the best
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.600]  actress this year all these people because they have a lot to lose they're showing courage
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:41.760]  and so i admire that courage and i appreciate your call and the people can you know attack the
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:46.000]  messenger oh well she's this and that well you know what so what she's got guts and guts is enough
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.560]  and we can't just sit here and judge and hate on everybody you know none of us are perfect
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:56.640]  folks we've all got problems in our own lives uh let's take a final call from four and then i
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:04.000]  got to play some clips four in norway you're on the air hi hi alex my name is thore i'm
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:11.200]  from from norway and my name is after viking god i wanted to thank you for the king of the gods

[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:25.680]  us i have been listening for several months it's a crazy world out there it certainly is well what
[1:45:25.680 --> 1:45:32.400]  is your message from norway yes i have a whole skull my friend from norway i want to tell the
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:40.320]  people out there about the list on the internet it's the norwegian free mason's on w w dot tv
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:50.240]  to n y h e t n n e it's nine thousand men shadow criminals we have to read we have to resist the
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:56.960]  the evil weed or we don't want weapons well well people oversimplify this but let me explain the
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:05.360]  new world order uses any fraternal organization or system to to influence pedal and to be able
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:09.920]  to control populations and so people say well it's the vatican or it's the zionist or it's the
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:14.160]  this or it's that no i mean we've got the protestant leader is calling for a new world order it's
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:19.520]  and pat robertson is calling for a new world order and calling for uh you know global taxes
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:25.760]  and global warming but yes they use the masons especially in europe and england this is main
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:30.880]  line news anybody can google it where there's not a judge or a barrister basically who is in a mason
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:35.680]  they're allowed to commit crimes and they get away with it and so people then out of hand
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.520]  to say the masons aren't involved at any level of this and they argue about which groups in control
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:46.320]  definitely the high level masons in england and scotland and ireland especially in the uk and the
[1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:52.720]  united kingdom they are the mid-level management group there are groups above them but but for
[1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:58.960]  people to say that the masons aren't interfacing and aren't being used it's just not true they are
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:07.840]  used it for sure i have met them with several occasions so i know they are the evil so thanks

[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:43.440]  consortium when the banks that he's talking about are the ones that orchestrated all this
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:48.560]  a global authority our federal reserve already is owned by the bank of england a global authority
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:54.640]  this is msnbc listen carefully a global reserve currency rather than having the whole system depend
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:49:00.800]  on the dollar goes up goes down uh has a good president has a bad president a global reserve
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:06.240]  currency kane's talked about that a global regulator uh it's clear that america exported
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:11.520]  its toxic mortgages all around the world people thought they could trust american regulation
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:16.960]  obviously they couldn't uh but it's very difficult for every country to enter to look at what goes on
[1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:23.040]  in every other country in the world of globalization uh america couldn't function if we had to rely
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:29.040]  exclusively on state regulation as a national economy so you need a global regulator needs to
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:34.640]  do something about global competition authority um one of the problems is that we have these
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:40.480]  institutions that are too big to fail but these are global institutions uh iceland uh
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:46.400]  small economy had banks that were in some sense bigger than that economy but that's the nature
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:52.560]  of globalization so we need to have to have some kind of global oversight uh on these financial
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:50:00.560]  institutions uh i think we all we we need uh regulations about uh transparency about disclosure
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:06.480]  but also about incentive structures because what we are seeing is the predictable consequences
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:11.600]  of there you go they engineer all this and then they pose as the saviors
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:17.040]  i mean it's just amazing we're gonna come back and get into the carbon tax get into

[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:43.120]  all right uh there's a bunch of clips here is one with rock obama on pbs where he says we're
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:47.520]  just gonna shut down the coal companies you know they can build a coal plant if they want but the
[1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:52.240]  taxes are gonna be so high on it the carbon tax for the carbon dioxide by the way is good for
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:58.320]  the earth and plants and they put out more oxygen all the studies show that he says um
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:03.120]  he says we're gonna shut them down we're gonna run them out of business we're gonna bankrupt them
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:08.880]  this is only one of thousands of taxes they're openly announcing here it is first it was this
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:15.760]  youtube clip from joe biden now another coal controversy for the obama campaign after an
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:20.880]  audio tape from january surfaced online so if somebody wants to build a coal power plant they
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:27.520]  can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're gonna be charged a huge sum for all that
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:33.120]  uh greenhouse gas that's being emitted senator obama is talking about his cap and trade proposal
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:39.520]  to cut down global warming he's maintained again notice how let's even a neocon site they just
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:43.520]  have to go along and say global warming is real we're having a record cold winter because the
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:48.480]  sunspots have stopped the sun cooled down huh yeah mar suddenly it's ice caps getting bigger
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:55.040]  instead of getting smaller your suv and doing that and coal plants aren't doing it now here's
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:59.840]  another clip of him talking about changing our lifestyles with these taxes and they state that's
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:05.760]  what it is surfdom making you so poor you can't educate yourself you don't have any freedom
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:11.840]  this is the new global system here it is following up on mike's question you've
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:15.760]  earned a reputation in the campaign for sometimes saying things that people don't want to hear i
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:20.160]  think you remember you calling teachers saying we merit pay might need to be on the table in america
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:24.480]  you told peace activists that know we may in fact have to spend more to rebuild a military stop right
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:29.920]  there reactive see what he's going to do more war more military cutting teachers pay
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:37.120]  liberal go ahead and keep playing it he told peace activists that know we may in fact have to
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.360]  spend more to rebuild a military that's been wrecked in iraq you just mentioned going to
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:47.520]  detroit and tell give me some examples of what you will tell americans that we don't necessarily
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:53.280]  want to hear well uh... number one we're gonna have to start doing a better job of conserving
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:59.600]  on energy uh... hit box notice how slick he is leaving your lights on driving big cars
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:04.160]  folks it doesn't matter if you drive a tiny car 20 horsepower doesn't matter
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:07.440]  you live in a tiny house with one light bulb you're going to get charged more but he plays
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:13.760]  class warfare here listen to it number one we're going to have to start doing a better job of
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:20.880]  conserving on energy uh... americans like to drive their big suv's they like to leave all the lights
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:25.200]  on in their house we're going to have to change our habits if we want to deal with the uh...
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:31.040]  climate change which i think we have to deal with we're seeing already uh... down in the southeast
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:35.360]  i mean they're seeing drought that they haven't seen in a very long time western states the same

[1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:46.080]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm
[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:56.560]  radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones roughly half of the power in this country
[1:59:58.480 --> 2:00:06.880]  runs our hospitals our schools our homes our factories our bowling alleys our car dealerships
[2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:15.120]  our churches 49 percent and growing comes from coal now the first thing bill clinton did and they
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:24.880]  were planning this way back then was in 1997 he laid off all of the clean burning coal in the united
[2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:31.040]  states in four states most of it in utah southern utah totally clean no mercury they don't care
[2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:36.240]  they say well they don't even care if it is clean coal you can't burn it or you can't even extract
[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:42.880]  natural gas from it they have a way of doing that no instead the coal fired plants burn the dirty
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:48.720]  mercury filled stuff and they're building them all over the united states rock obama comes out and
[2:00:48.720 --> 2:01:06.400]  says there's going to be a tax there's going to be a tax on those power plants and the uninitiated
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:10.160]  i've been listening to them on talk radio the last two days calling the ones defending a rock obama
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:17.600]  again i'm not from a cane we're analyzing both puppets and they come out and they say well good
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:21.360]  those are rich evil companies hurting us with their pollution folks carbon dioxide is not a
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:26.400]  pollute i don't care if they're trying to list it as one what plants breathe
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:39.040]  so you need to understand that shutting down coal plants are taxing them that's going to be
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:48.400]  tacked on to your power bill remember in ron some of their internal documents came out
[2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:58.560]  in 2001 remember out in california they blamed all that on gray davis who's a horrible socialist
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:05.840]  gun grabber i'm not a fan of him the point is wasn't about him schwarzenegger came out and said he's
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:10.960]  evil he he he's the reason you got charged a couple billion dollars a day for months on end
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:17.280]  extra for your power meanwhile schwarzenegger had been meeting at the beverly hills hotel
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:23.920]  with the heads of enron and others and he was all involved in it just it's just so incredible
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:30.160]  but he came into office you know against what had happened with the energy and enron in its own
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:36.640]  memos that came out later would turn the power off every day a couple hours just to panic the public
[2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:41.520]  because their internal psychological studies showed the public would then panic and accept
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:47.520]  doubling and tripling of power prices and it turned out enron had no problems supplying energy they
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:51.520]  were just trading all the energy coming into california through the lines and they would bring
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:57.040]  in members of congress and this legislature in california and federally and he later became
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:00.800]  secretary of the army white but he was the head of it there in california they would show them
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:05.600]  fake computer screens you know fake data wasn't even real energy they were just setting the price
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:15.600]  every day and cheating everybody billions a day during those summer months billions see it's
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:19.680]  artificial scarcity so they're getting you ready they're saying you're not going to have as much
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.120]  power you're not you're going to pay a lot more for it you're going to pay more for everything
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:29.040]  and then here's the key that no one wants to talk about with these global greenhouse taxes
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:33.760]  let's say carbon oxides deadly poison plants don't breathe it's horrible let's abandon
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:40.560]  by only having western europe and the united states and japan going online with this it will
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:47.280]  accelerate what's left of our industry to china to india to mexico and 160 plus other nations
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:52.640]  where they will have zero emissions controls in china they don't even put filters you know here
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:58.160]  they put filters on the power plants and it's pretty clean comparatively they're nothing just black
[2:03:58.160 --> 2:04:05.440]  smoke going up that's why the skies were black and they were a mask in the olympics
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:14.320]  so see it's a total scam even if you believe it's real because it's going to increase because the
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:22.720]  industry will move there it will increase the carbon dioxide you understand again basic logic
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:26.160]  but the people fighting against this don't know how to use that because they regard to take what
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:33.680]  the media tells them we'll be right back alex jones here with a question what does humidity

[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:39.040]  there exposing this fraud and just out of the gates mr natalman natalman bottom line from history
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:44.960]  in the view of history i have from studying it the british learned how to take down china by
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:48.800]  shipping in drugs to an area that where it was illegal to corrupt the police corrupt the local
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:55.120]  system we know the majority of narcotics are shipped in by groups controlled by the u.s government
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:09:00.240]  laundered through us banks but that's not enough for them and then they get the drug profits on
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:05.200]  the ground uh when young people and others are involved in the crime of using it or distributing
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:10.880]  it uh or or other folks but with the case of marijuana what you've got 80 plus percent of
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:17.760]  drug users illegal drug users only use marijuana so it's essential to keep uh cannabis illegal
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:22.480]  so that they can continue their whole phony war on drugs put millions of innocent nonviolent
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:26.640]  offenders behind bars to work in the private prisons so i want to throw up my view and see
[2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:31.440]  if you concurred with that and then talk about this important uh initiative that'll have international
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:37.040]  not just national implications going on in california yeah let me break into three pieces
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:41.680]  the first one is is about the whole international traffic you know on the one hand it's true that
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:46.320]  the intelligence agencies the cia have been involved with drug trafficking in one way or another
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:51.840]  for the last 50 or 60 years it was true in southeast asian in 1960s and 1970s it was true
[2:09:51.840 --> 2:09:56.880]  in afghanistan southwest asian the 80s true in mexico central america all of that as well so
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:01.760]  that's a long and old story and there's a lot of truth to it but it's also true that even if the
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:05.920]  intelligence agencies were squeaky clean even if they were never involved the slightest bit
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:10.400]  you would still have these drugs come into the country that basically marijuana cocaine heroin
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:14.720]  whatever these are global commodities markets this stuff is going to be produced wherever
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.320]  it's going to be sold wherever it's going to be trafficked wherever and you know whether it's
[2:10:18.320 --> 2:10:23.520]  legal or illegal think about these drugs the same way we would like coffee tobacco sugar
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:28.000]  alcohol whatever right so i think it's important to understand that notwithstanding the government
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:33.360]  involvement that put when push comes to shove the real problem is not about that government
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:38.240]  corruption that government involvement the real problem is an incredibly repressive punitive
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:42.640]  system with any united states that's relying overwhelmingly on systems of incarceration
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:46.400]  to deal with people who use drugs and that's why you see the prison population going from
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:51.920]  50 000 people for drug law violations in 1980 to half a million people tonight and then we have to
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:55.760]  pay for that charges tonight that we have a more brilliant drug rather than all of europe
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:11:00.080]  locks up for everything and they got more people than we do so you know we're talking about a system
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:04.960]  of oppression which is what we're trying to challenge in california well you're absolutely
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:11.120]  right and uh just the fact that we have to pay for all this and then a lot of good old boys say
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:15.680]  good make them criminals work they're working for 20 cents an hour on average displacing
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:20.720]  our jobs and our wages i mean the most horrible thing california right now is that if you look
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:25.200]  at who's that we have a ballot is just i can tell you listeners it's called proposition five if you're
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:30.320]  in california make sure you vote yes on prop five tomorrow but it will be the the biggest
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.400]  reform of prisons and sentencing in the history of the country and the biggest drug reform since
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:39.360]  repeal of alcohol prohibition if it wins tomorrow right this thing would essentially reduce the
[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:45.440]  california's bloated overcrowder prison population by up to 20 000 nonviolent offenders it would shift
[2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:50.080]  a billion dollars a year from the prison side of things to the treatment rehabilitation it would
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:53.840]  save taxpayers two and a half billion dollars because new prisons would not need to be billed
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:58.880]  right this is a win-win-win across the board helps people get their lives together reduces crime
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:04.000]  reduces recidivism and the problem right now is that we're at risk of losing this thing because
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:08.960]  the prison guards unions and their buddies in the alcohol industry in the indian casino tribe
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:14.720]  industry and you know meg wittman the the chairman chair of sheriffs and evils by advising john mccain
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:18.800]  had put reached three and a half million dollars to run these to push it aside to cross the state
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:25.040]  of california and we've got all these liberal poverty pimps fake liberals uh... running around
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:30.240]  telling everybody that it'll release rapist and murderers using total deception on the public
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.800]  because they have to well the public is for decriminalization of marijuana so they have to
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:39.280]  lie well they that mean that you know by the way in prop five does include a provision in there
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.000]  that would reduce the penalty for possessing a joint from a misdemeanor down to an infraction
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.560]  like a traffic ticket california police arrested like fifty thousand people last year marijuana
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:53.440]  charges so to make a huge difference as well but you know here you have jerry brown right jerry
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:58.400]  brown who's been a progressive at times in his past and he is featured now in the statewide or
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.440]  at least in an ad campaign paid for by the prisons guard union with almost a million dollars
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:08.800]  basically a puff piece for him condemning prop five in ways that are inaccurate and hopefully
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:14.240]  ineffective and then we have one of the state senators federal senators doing that oh yeah
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:18.720]  diane feinstein so sad i think she's never been a mandatory minimum penalty that she didn't love
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:23.280]  so far as i can tell she's up there saying that this will cost taxpayers money when the california
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:27.920]  legislative analyst office says it'll actually save taxpayers money she's saying that criminals
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:31.120]  are going to be running the streets with this thing when in fact there's tons of accountability
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:35.200]  in this thing what people really don't like what the people in the prison industrial complex
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:39.840]  really don't like about prop five is that it holds not just people involved in crime accountable
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:44.240]  it holds them accountable it says let's see the results of what you're doing let's see when you
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:50.240]  keep when the state prison budget has gone from five billion dollars in the year 2000 to 10 billion
[2:13:50.240 --> 2:13:54.400]  dollars now doubled in just the last eight years and it continues going up when the prison guards
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:00.160]  union membership has risen from like six fold since uh since since the 1980s when you see that
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:05.600]  type of just endless spending to lock up more and more people on a system which is obviously
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:10.080]  broke and then when there's a proposal to change it you see the presidential system
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:14.480]  rallying around and making sure all the politicians line up with them that's what's so sad about
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:20.720]  we're talking to ethan nadleman uh... look just a few days ago in california there was the case
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:27.120]  of a schizophrenic psycho stomping a baby for over 30 minutes to death in the street the public
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:32.640]  stood there sucking their thumbs and didn't go defend the child the police uh couldn't respond
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:37.760]  because they were too busy literally outbusting potheds and there's cases like that just like
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:42.240]  in dallas texas in places they won't respond in california won't respond to car thefts
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:48.640]  or home invasions but they will to marijuana i mean 50 000 arrest all the man hours all the time
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:55.760]  the jail and prison uh space the the the court's being clogged up i i mean this is the we've got
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:00.800]  to decriminalize well exactly i mean part of what we were saying is that part of this initiative
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:06.320]  increases the length of parole for truly violent offenders you know most ordinary americans want
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:11.600]  the law enforcement system focusing on the truly predatory and violent people who live in our society
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:16.080]  people understand that you know you need prisons for a reason and part of that reason is that there
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:21.600]  are some people who just will not abide by basic rules of civilization who cannot be trusted not
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:26.000]  to take advantage of their fellow citizen but then you're filling the prisons with people with
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:31.040]  nonviolent offenses especially just drug offenses people whose only offense is putting a substance
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:36.080]  into their body or having a drug addiction people who are trying to get their lives together and all
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:40.800]  the system wants to do is to spend tons of money locking them up rather than spending half the money
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:44.480]  to help people get their lives together i mean that that's how i mean that that's what's just so
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:48.640]  pathetic about this whole thing right now you know i mean i'm hoping there's a broader shift in
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.560]  this country but i look at these characters in california now and what they're doing in the
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:56.960]  way they're ripping off the taxpayers and just continuing the same old bankrupt policies and
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:01.520]  it reminds me of those guys and how we got to the whole you know mortgage and and banking crisis
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:06.720]  the last few years the system is set up to insulate itself from any sort of outside critical analysis
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:11.040]  it's self-reinforcing and ultimately it's the taxpayers and citizens who pay the burden on
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:15.280]  this thing you know when you look for example at the issue of marijuana we know at this point
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:19.920]  800 000 americans getting arrested each year for marijuana 90% of them for nothing more than
[2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:24.880]  the drug possession i mean that's ludicrous and now you know spending 10 to 20 billion dollars a
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:29.760]  year enforcing the laws against marijuana at the same time we could be earning in tax revenue that
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:34.160]  amount of money and helicopters flying around with infrared looking through our walls looking for
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:38.320]  people exactly exactly you know there are people who don't give a damn about marijuana people who
[2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:42.720]  hate marijuana in fact and they say call off the war on marijuana because we fundamentally care
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:47.280]  about preserving the bill of liberties well how many of these cops i mean uh well large
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:50.880]  portion of the population to smoke pot at one time in their life and i've smoked it
[2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:55.840]  you know before the whole point is and i didn't hail by the way but i don't particularly like it
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:00.960]  but my point is is that how can these cops arrest kids for marijuana when they know they smoked it
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:06.000]  well you know i mean where's the obstacle to being hit the critical about this thing how many
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.920]  politicians you know how many politicians do you have who uh you know who did this stuff in the
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:14.400]  past but they don't mind going after people in the future my hope with barack obama is you know
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:19.280]  he did smoke marijuana even use cocaine and he's actually talked in favor of decriminalization
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:23.120]  even if he's backtracked away from using that word because it's not politically possible that's
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:27.680]  about the only good thing barack obama has ever said or done other than claiming he tried in the
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:31.920]  war now he's reneged on that well we'll see how he is as president i'm feeling more i mean compared
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:36.080]  to what we've been through for the last eight years i am at least feeling some sense of optimism
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:39.680]  some sense of hope if only could you gotta have some hope at some point around this stuff
[2:17:39.680 --> 2:17:43.040]  you know i think the people who appoint will be better than we've seen in the past
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:47.520]  i think that the the whole the whole drug war will shift into a a different direction will be
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:52.080]  more emphasis on health more emphasis on civil liberties less on building up the uh prison
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:56.480]  industrial complex ever and ever you know i actually got a run in about a minute because
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:17:59.280]  i got to keep running on this campaign and because the election is tomorrow well that's
[2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:04.400]  perfect fire out the website for your organization well thank you and i it's drugpolicy.org please

[2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:37.920]  why do they want to shut down the alternative media on the internet why do they want to force
[2:23:37.920 --> 2:23:43.840]  you on internet too because they can't allow stories like the fact that bbc reported building
[2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:49.120]  seven fell before it did to get out they can't allow more and more whistleblowers and information
[2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:56.480]  to come out we are kicking their hind in thank god now we're about to cover this new story with
[2:23:56.480 --> 2:24:06.080]  paul watson that he's got up on prisonplanet.com but what backs this up is that remember it was
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:11.600]  called a conspiracy theory in the media but all the original articles in msnbc and in harats
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:17.360]  and others reported and and and and odigo the instant message company they're the ones that
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:20.880]  said it showing that i'm not saying they're involved they got the warnings they went public they said
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:24.720]  we were told get our people out four hours before it happened we sent out this text message
[2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:30.720]  saying get out of the buildings they're going to be attacked harats Jerusalem post msnbc reported
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:35.040]  that the arab kids the jewish kids the people in the community the buildings were half empty
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:37.680]  at that time of mourning for what they were you know usually had them
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:45.360]  you had all the insider trading leading back to the cia and fbi and people went to even
[2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:50.240]  some fbis with the president for that then you had that often air force based meeting hours before
[2:24:51.920 --> 2:24:57.040]  over 200 CEOs are told come to a secret meeting to meet with warren buffett and the president
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:01.360]  at this hangar and then bush flies there later in the day to get them out of the buildings
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:06.800]  most of them had been based in the buildings no one knows what was said in that meeting
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:13.440]  this all happened so this new story dovetails with all of that x cia man warned top executives to
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:18.560]  leave new york on 9 11 report wonder whether senior executive told staff something big is
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:23.120]  going to happen that day that fits in with what everybody else was saying and fema running a
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:31.360]  drill the night before in the day of tripod to paul at all this tripod to have an attack on
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:35.200]  the world trade center complex in building seven paul watson tell us about the latest
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:44.080]  piece of the puzzle hello alex yeah this is out of foreign policy journal which is an alternative
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:53.520]  news website but a very credible one from what i can see run by uh jeremy r hammond who's written
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:26:02.720]  this article and got this source which is basically uh an anonymous source which is to remain anonymous
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:10.000]  who worked under a managing director as number two were a european branch of warner brothers
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:16.560]  and it was his boss who was close friends with another senior executive for warner brothers
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:24.800]  who worked in the head office in la and who had also formerly worked for the cia and uh
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:32.800]  the story goes that there was a funeral service for a senior executive senior director for warner
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:39.200]  brothers from a foreign office who had died and though they were doing the uh memorial service
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:47.040]  arrangements but this uh when the date of september 11 2001 was brought up to this la executive
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:53.520]  he rejected it because he told his staff quote something big is happening that day
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:58.960]  and the top executives from the new york office would all be traveling out of the city and then
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:06.400]  when the source was pressed it was uh stressed that the the big you know there's something big
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:10.960]  that was happening the reason why they'd be out of the city was nothing to do with a corporate
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:18.000]  meeting or anything it was a different kind of event that was going to happen on 9 11 and this guy
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:24.320]  from his the cia sources had passed this message on to his staff and some of them were out of the
[2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:31.120]  city on that day now regardless and this is a good journal putting this out we've seen a lot of
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:35.280]  great reports from the past that have panned out regardless we need to go back and focus what went
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:40.800]  on at off at air force base hundreds of ceo's that they called away from the towers to go there
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:44.880]  and this dove tells us what you're reporting what this journal's reporting that they were told to
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:53.280]  be out of the city that day exactly um the towers were at low occupancy obviously a lot of people
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:28:00.560]  were evacuated but you know at 9 a.m. on a Tuesday morning the original estimates would
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:07.440]  whether there were 50 000 people in those towers obviously we know that what was it around 2000
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:13.360]  died a lot were evacuated but still low occupancy for the peak there was about 10 000 in the building
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:24.000]  about eight and a half thousand got out right even though that the usual occupancy is around 50 000
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:28.240]  from what i remember being reported let me go back it could hold 50 but they had been there were
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:32.960]  down about 30 000 but generally by that time they reported about 30 000 would generally be there
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:39.280]  right so you've got about a third there the occupancy of the airlines is completely below
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:44.400]  well every plane was exactly 22 percent on a day when it was what 89 percent occupancy on the
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:53.280]  east coast flying into new york at peak time yeah and then uh obviously news week reported in
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:58.560]  it's december 13th if you at top brass pension officials canceled their travel plans the very
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:29:03.280]  night before and that was reported out in the open and they cited a security threat on new york and
[2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:09.680]  washington yeah just another piece of the puzzle paul stay there let's do five more minutes on this
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:17.680]  key report really brainstorm together and add all the other little key information verbs into this
[2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:24.480]  piece so people can make up their own decisions we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:33:19.360 --> 2:33:22.080]  a lot of people get tricked into serving the new world order
[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:27.440]  a lot of people want power they're competitive
[2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:35.120]  they're slowly being manipulated into positions where they make decisions
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:41.680]  to destroy their lives and the lives of countless others

[2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:15.120]  in having to crush a fellow human as things become darker
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:21.840]  the warnings we put out the information we've disseminated the seeds we planted

[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:57.120]  it's an important testament that as things get worse people down the road will be shocked
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:04.480]  when they listen to these shows when they watch the films people you never thought would have
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:10.960]  woken up when they're in true bondage will that's the sad part about it
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:19.280]  as Winston Churchill rightfully said there may come a time when you are forced to fight when
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:24.720]  you have a good chance of winning it's still more often in history people wait and don't resist
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:29.840]  i'm paraphrasing so a time comes and they decide to fight when it's a tough fight and they don't
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:35.520]  have a very good chance of winning but it's better than dying on their knees of slaves
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:44.320]  but then there's a third even worse position and that's having to stand and fight when you
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:49.040]  have no chance of winning because at least the human spirit still beats in your heart and soul
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:55.200]  and you're not going to go quietly into the night a lot of times that's the one you fight
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:35:59.360]  the hardest isn't it are you going to wait until there's almost no chance of winning
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:05.840]  or are you going to stand up and speak out now that is the challenge that is the great commission
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:09.680]  against evil all right paul watson i'm going to get some calls cover a bunch of the news
[2:36:09.680 --> 2:36:14.160]  i know you're busy with a piece and there's so many hundreds of things i mean each 10 minute
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:22.400]  clip on youtube of the seventh tower conspiracy they've got as outside experts demolition control
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:27.120]  demolition incorporated involved in covering up oklahoma city and 9-11 act like they're impartial
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:33.120]  outsiders in the film they even get one of our people you know to go oh i didn't think it was
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:37.360]  a big deal that building seven you know that they reported it fell beforehand but you know people
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:42.000]  in our movement they made a big deal out of it poor god i don't know why everybody always wants
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:46.880]  to interview him because he does that kind of stuff but um people think they're friends with
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:51.920]  the mainstream media didn't work that way and you know they've got things in there about uh
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:57.200]  how the whole front of the building was knocked off and that's not true that lies
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:37:03.760]  regurgitated and uh just countless lies paul's doing a story uh on that
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:12.080]  hat but this false flag scripting like when they said that lee harvey oswald had killed
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:14.960]  john f kennedy with three shots from the book
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:18.640]  depository
[2:37:21.520 --> 2:37:27.920]  that was published in asia in australia in zeland thailand a bunch of places hours before
[2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:32.480]  he was even captured and his name was released i mean that's smoking gun and that's important
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:34.240]  they try to say oh no that's not important
[2:37:37.920 --> 2:37:42.240]  oh no that's that's not important it's not important and all they have cops saying get
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:46.640]  back they're going to bring it down it's coming down and witnesses saying they had count downs
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:51.600]  you know we have secret sources people say oh you don't have a secret source and it comes out
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:56.560]  it's berry jennings they threaten harassing he didn't fully recant he just said i said they
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:03.600]  looked like bodies felt like bodies they tried to say that was a lie they try to make me look like
[2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:11.440]  a fool of course he's dead now and they also say that jennings was in the building three hours
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:17.920]  that's not true he wasn't in seven three hours his key testimony they just overlooked that there
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:23.840]  were explosions and the building was blown in before tower one or two fell and he and he said
[2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:28.560]  that's my story i'm sticking to it but they edited it to where it looks like he's saying the opposite
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:34.720]  incredible deception but paul what is that story coming up i'm working on it i think i needed to
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:40.640]  get this tia warning one out first but well i've read your article and it's excellent but i would
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:46.240]  just add all those other points about my not about the otago people warning and say here it is Israeli
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:51.120]  newspapers not us you know i mean i've had mainstream media here in my office over and over again
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:55.200]  why are you anti-semitic saying israel is that all the jews are out of the building
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:02.320]  and i say i'm not any more than the jerusalem post and haratz is they got the warning and
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:06.400]  told her people get out of the building and it wasn't all the jews it was the otago employees
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:13.680]  you know i'm sick of it any more than worse than we're you know saying warner brothers is involved
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:20.320]  in the attack you know we know the facts go ahead the thing about it is that a lot of these
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:26.560]  so-called debunking websites will still try and claim that things are absolutely verifiably
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:32.480]  proven and admitted to by the authorities such as the uh palestinian boy at the new
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:38.400]  utrecht high school in brooklyn who on september six five days before the attack
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:43.120]  looked out of his classroom window pointed towards lower manhattan and the twin towers
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:48.400]  and said do you see those buildings they won't be standing there next week and he was sited
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:53.600]  and gotten trouble at the principal's office it's on record yeah that's just one of many and we're
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:59.200]  not saying we're not being anti-semitic against palestinians we're just reporting what was in
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:04.560]  the news and they still say it's an urban myth about these things and reporters have had to
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:10.000]  write reports emphasizing again and again it's not an urban myth it's been admitted to by the fbi
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:16.080]  um i just hope this story gets more attention than all the disinformation that's out there
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:21.680]  which infuriates me on an almost daily basis you know we've got this clap trap going around about
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:28.480]  bush the bush family being arrested by the justice department or whatever this video of bush
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:32.640]  walking across the white house lawn yesterday and then the media can point that and say see
[2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:37.840]  this the internet's disinformation it's clearly photoshopped and totally fake video just like
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:43.920]  the bin laden tapes are fake uh and uh you know he's been arrested by delta force in perigway
[2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:50.880]  all made up total crap like that the story three weeks ago all the atm's are going to close you
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:54.880]  not being all the banks are going to close and we told you that was bull and then we were attacked
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:41:02.240]  total bull unknown fbi informant mr baloney had and people still give these websites credence
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:06.640]  and we'll have to be you know we'll be getting emails next week about some new bull they come
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:11.360]  out with and nobody ever points to the fact that they've been caught lying in every instance
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:18.240]  and well then they announced the solicitor generals wife was arrested in france so there's
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:25.600]  shootouts and in the underground in uh chicago i mean it's always the same people i mean it's
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:31.840]  like the catholic run at all kingpin you know he says spaceships dropped black magic bombs to
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:37.520]  blow up hereshima and naka sake and his followers attack me and say yes it was black magic bombs
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:44.720]  i mean you know they're clearly operatives and it's this kind of you know zealous focus
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:49.680]  and obsession with these issues that can't be proven when we've got bona fide solid issues
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:56.160]  that can be proven and sometimes people just aren't interested in credence to their bullets
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:02.080]  this is the kid kind of a misplaced aggression towards us it's just a mental illness well
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:06.000]  paul a lot of people aren't even going to read your full article can you put at the top all the
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:13.360]  warnings the palestinians the israelis uh the minot uh and they're in there yeah no i know a
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:20.080]  lot of it's in there but i i i i mean they won't even read that date but did you hear about this
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:29.920]  one as well um across the country they're giving out free flu vaccinations for people who vote
[2:42:29.920 --> 2:42:36.400]  training people to line up and take the shot it's called vote and back oh it's total brainwashing
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.360]  they show up at the local uh radio station we broadcast out on sundays and every one we have
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:47.840]  three ones we love you three injections and i tell people i go you know the last six years they
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:50.960]  haven't even gotten the right mutation they have to guess what it's going to be and it didn't even
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:55.760]  help you and here's all these studies of Alzheimer's and they just roll their sleeves up with glee
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:43:01.360]  i mean to know we have total criminals running things and then we're all a bunch of well-meaning
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:08.880]  trusting morons going along with it oh man there's a report about that on info.net right now
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:18.160]  but yeah getting back to it i mean you had the warning for uh willy brown san francisco
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:24.080]  mayor who was going to fly into new york on the morning of 9 11 he gets a call from quote airport
[2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:31.280]  security late september 10th advising him of a security threat and he cancels his flight
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:33.920]  where did the investigation go into that
[2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:45.200]  then you've got all the pot options on united and american airlines speculation that the stock
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:52.080]  would go down and uh you know this is right after all the media was reporting quote airline stock
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:59.680]  set to fly so you've got all the of course that led up to the cia and it's uh you know brown
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:06.400]  deutsche bank and buzzy krongaard well the bigger issue is we need mine on in here we need to report
[2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:12.080]  that hey why do these 200 and something we got a plot against 220 something but pull it up why
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:18.080]  did they get told come to a secret meeting at the base to meet warren buffett and then most of them
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:25.920]  worked in the towers right i mean how obvious does this have to get and you know the biggest
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:30.240]  piece of 9 11 evidence that's an inside job is that the criminals that run our government
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:34.720]  they've done this over and they've been caught running terror attacks it's admitted they staged
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:40.560]  them you know what add a link to that 2004 army training manual that's a reprint of the 70s
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:45.360]  that's on wiki leaks people don't believe it the news is reported it is real mainstream news
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:49.360]  ash where they teach army captains how to stage false flag attacks will you post that in there too
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:55.680]  yeah you know i've been reporting on 9 11 since before it happened and i i just
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:02.240]  paul it's just so incredible i mean we have got some really bold people running things and god
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:06.320]  knows what they're gonna pull out of the hat next time i mean they're hearing everybody up for nuke
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:14.400]  attacks bio weapon releases and i know we know the power will be eaten all bright and now today
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:22.480]  or yesterday on cnn the big new brazinski trial actual commission co-founder said that um
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:29.840]  obama and of course brazinski's obama is one of his top advisors says that he's gonna have an
[2:45:29.840 --> 2:45:36.960]  imminent problem in the area of foreign policy after he elects a president so again echoing
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:45.200]  what biden said man which he promised and he guaranteed mark my words he said he was so
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:49.360]  vehement about it that obama would have an international crisis on his hands within
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:55.120]  six months and it's going to be unpopular what he has to do we already have the globalist
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:46:00.320]  through georgia sneak attacking the russians more insanity and uh people calling me a trader
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:05.760]  saying no georgia was snuck attack when now even the state department admits it was staged by georgia
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:12.880]  they're just claiming that they weren't involved um and then of course why is no one questioning pal
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:19.680]  he said on the 21st or 22nd there will be a huge international event a crisis he can name the date
[2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:27.440]  but won't say what it is i mean it's just an insult everybody's intelligence paul exactly i mean
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:35.120]  both clinton and bush faced you know the test within their first few months of coming to
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:41.440]  office clinton had the first world trade center bombing bush had 9 11 so you know what's obama
[2:46:41.440 --> 2:46:46.400]  gonna have a dread to think what they've got lined up for this time because it could be even bigger
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:54.800]  oh man well we got a lot of election reporting going on we'll be reporting on election fraud
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:46:58.560]  tomorrow and of course throughout the week bev harris and others coming on we'll be taking your
[2:46:58.560 --> 2:47:03.440]  calls dealing with any type of election fraud or anything you've been seeing go on in your area
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:07.440]  paul we got you we got curtain emma we got your brother steve we got air and we've got to get more
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:11.840]  writers but the fine writers that actually know what's going on and they're accurate in their
[2:47:11.840 --> 2:47:18.240]  world analysis um this stuff's also clear i don't know how they aren't we need more stories about
[2:47:18.240 --> 2:47:24.800]  about web censorship's already begun the global taxation uh the big banks openly announcing
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:30.320]  world currency run by the banks and you'll pay carbon taxes to them it's all happening we were
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:34.400]  right and i don't have the staff to go back and find all the videos and audios we've done
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:39.280]  but people finally are finding them themselves i was watching a clip of matrix of evil
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:51.120]  this morning and um you know from 2003 and um there i was talking about how that bush would
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:56.000]  do all this evil he'd be reelected then we'd get a liberal who would bring in the carbon tax and
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  demonize america and i laid out how the banks would take over and how they would implode the
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:07.120]  economy and then set up a world banking structure i mean i again it's all in the government
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:11.760]  documents i mean they're gonna hurt all folks they're taking the bailout money and giving
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:18.800]  themselves bonuses and giving us none of it you know what this means they're just they don't care
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:29.680]  anymore paul exactly and on the subject of the carbon tax you had the uh world wildlife fund
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:36.560]  last week coming out and saying basically that america is the chief offender in terms of the
[2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:43.760]  carbon emissions and they applauded the countries for keeping within their quote bio capacity and
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:49.920]  those countries are the likes of malawi in afghanistan and then today you've got a climate
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:58.480]  built in parliament which i believe has passed 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
[2:48:58.480 --> 2:49:05.360]  by 2050 basically what that means is almost all the cars off the roads and 80 percent of the
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:10.640]  little industry that we've got left completely shut down that's the third world country well
[2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:15.760]  they're also saying humans the new york times reported humans have to be reduced because we
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:22.640]  exhale carbon don't you see the trick don't you get the scam folks it's what the club of rome said
[2:49:22.640 --> 2:49:29.520]  in 91 the head of the cfr richard and haas this is to wage war against humanity it is to make us
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:38.960]  the enemy folks carbon dioxide is mother's milk to the planet oh man i mean the final jokes but
[2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:43.040]  you know that they've changed global warming to climate change now because you've got record
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:50.240]  low temperatures in dozens of us states um the arctic just expanded it for ice sheet
[2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:58.160]  at the size of germany 33 2008 30 percent and they're citing reports from 2007 without pointing
[2:49:58.160 --> 2:50:03.760]  out meanwhile i was watching tv last night they showed polar bears drowning again paul you can't
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:10.800]  make it up because paul's ass can't swim can't they treat us like idiots and again they have
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:15.280]  george bush come out against global warming so everybody knows he's bad so oh it must be real
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:19.680]  see how they play the left right off against you now the left will do all this evil and republicans
[2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:23.920]  will propose bad stuff and republicans will then support it thinking oh they're they're fighting it

[2:51:51.840 --> 2:51:56.960]  ties to intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:03.920]  are israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli
[2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:09.760]  citizens have been detained and laudan's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the

[2:52:40.320 --> 2:52:45.360]  are now available from solutions from science one of gcn's oldest and most trusted sponsors
[2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:50.560]  these emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas
[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:56.080]  generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:53:00.720]  like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps short
[2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:05.840]  wave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms
[2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:10.240]  brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:53:10.240 --> 2:53:15.280]  where the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solutions from science
[2:53:15.280 --> 2:53:22.480]  go to my solar backup dot com and get off the grid today that's my solar backup dot com today
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:31.280]  or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 don't wait call today
[2:53:37.200 --> 2:53:41.440]  we'll see you the iranians get this phone hooked up so you can be on the international television
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:51.040]  if not we'll uh continue taking phone calls people holding to find out the next five minutes
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:56.560]  speaking of iran up on prism planet dot com we've got this lou dobbs clip
[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:00.720]  they talk about the u.s. government funding millions of dollars to a russian institute
[2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:05.680]  that's building the bushar reactor now that is for peaceful uses but it can be used for nukes the
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:12.640]  whole point is dobbs says it's all incompetence and the government's just a bunch of idiots
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:18.480]  no that's not it it was it was england israel and the united states that help give them
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:22.720]  real components that can be used for nukes and pakistan through a qcon laboratories
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:28.240]  and it was donald rumsfeld the head of the big swiss company that transferred the systems for
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:35.040]  uh nuclear reactors for weapons to the north koreans in 1996 1997
[2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:41.280]  so again it's always far worse than even
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:47.840]  what you're hearing and what you're being told they they hand out these weapons like bill hicks

[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:07.760]  of u.s vote barack obama's huge on the threshold of history and monday as polls gave the democrats
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:12.960]  solid lead over john mccain on the last day of campaigning for the most dramatic u.s presidential
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:20.000]  vote in a generation but mccain who has no room for error in the tens battle for a handful of possible
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  states about to confound the pollsters and wrench victory from the african-american obama's grasp
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:32.800]  on tuesday the forty seven-year-old democrats trust the historic nature of his quest to be
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:37.440]  america's first black president striking an optimistic bonus fresh polls gave him a white
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:43.280]  lead and heat further pressure on mccain he said quote this is a defining moment in our history
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:49.040]  obama wrote in an article published monday the wall speed journal tomorrow i ask you to write
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:55.280]  our nation's next great chapter if you give me your vote we won't just win this election
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:11:01.440]  together we will change this country and change the world mccain a 72-year-old former president

[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:11.600]  house he said as he wrapped up a frenzy david campaigning with a midnight rally in miami
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:18.640]  the mac is back he said quote and we're going to win this election and of course the polls give it
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:26.480]  all to obama new wealth free journal mbc news poll put obama had 51 and 43 cnn's latest poll on
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:32.960]  sunday had obama with a 53 to 46 percent edge washington post abc news poll gave him 54
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:41.520]  percent to 43 rasmussen sat he was at 51 percent of mccain's 46 percent so let's go straight to
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:49.040]  texas wane slayer take a look at your crystal ball what do you think well i think the polls
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:54.560]  uh... really indicated brocco obama's year i just got off the plane i spent almost a week
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:12:00.320]  with brocco obama before that a week with john mccain and the obama campaign is very very
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:07.360]  confident what we're seeing here is a remarkable not only campaign by brocco obama if he happens
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:13.200]  to win tomorrow and i think the expectations already probably will but we're seeing a redefinition of
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:19.840]  who votes for democrats in america brocco obama is actually winning right now in some southern
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:26.320]  states something that no one has done and no democrat has done since 1976 with jimmy carter
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:30.880]  a fellow seven or one you see brocco obama challenging in a state like north carolina
[3:12:30.880 --> 3:12:36.160]  part of the old south where 40 percent of the uh... of the registered voters have already
[3:12:36.160 --> 3:12:41.840]  voted most of them are democrats and if brocco obama wins there and in virginia as well as
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:46.800]  the other states that he's expected to pick up it not only will be a victory for the first african
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:52.240]  american in the story victory but also a rather astonishing reconfiguration of the electoral
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:58.960]  map which shows that the south long republican territory might become part democrat territory
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:04.560]  starting to jump tomorrow writers writers agrees with you obama leaves mccain in six
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:09.600]  of eight key state democrat brocco obama leaves republican john mccain in six of eight to keep
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:14.880]  out of brown state one day before the election including the big price of florida and ohaya
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:20.960]  according to a series of writers dot b post release on monday alex jones your look at your
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:29.440]  crystal ball and do you see any any surprise all these polls going obama no i don't uh...
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:34.720]  the incredible support that we're witnessing uh... for brocco obama and almost every poll with leads
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:40.880]  of ten percent many of them the smallest only about five percent uh... show that people don't
[3:13:40.880 --> 3:13:47.120]  like the policies of george w bush the problem is uh... and and most pundits predicting a very
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:52.560]  short honeymoon including his running mate joe biden for brocco obama because he's gonna come in
[3:13:52.560 --> 3:13:57.120]  he wants more defense spending he wants more wars he wants to go into afghanistan and expand
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:03.120]  things pakistan he's for the warrantless fourth amendment destroying uh... wiretapping spying
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:08.960]  on the american people he's gotten three times the wall street money uh... that uh... john mccain
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:14.480]  has gotten four times the goldman sacks so he's going to be put into mara by the public's outrage
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:18.880]  and by a media that's been giving him most the attention uh... it's clear that the establishment
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:24.160]  knows they've written their republican pony as far as they can they want a new fresh horse
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:29.440]  brocco obama to give them left cover to pacify the left so you can move in bring in a global
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:34.400]  carbon tax uh... acquiesce to the banks were literally just looting the country of not eight
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:39.440]  hundred billion but trillions of dollars giving it to themselves in bonuses brocco obama is
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:44.240]  probably going to be elected tomorrow but he's also going to be a huge disappointment uh... for
[3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:47.680]  the american people you have a lot of conservatives voting for him because they're so sick of george
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.160]  bush but you also have about thirty percent of the us population saying you know that they're not
[3:14:52.160 --> 3:14:56.720]  totally decided that they don't like either candidate you you have congress with an eleven
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:02.560]  percent approval rating both parties are universally hated now at higher levels than we've ever had
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:07.040]  in history and so what's going to happen is brocco obama is going to come into office probably
[3:15:07.040 --> 3:15:11.040]  uh... ninety five percent chance i would say all the polls show that and then what people are going
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:15.600]  to see that it's a different face different rhetoric a better speaker than george bush but
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:21.600]  that the global corporate institutions uh... that control our executive branch are really in control
[3:15:21.600 --> 3:15:26.320]  and so you're gonna see a major crisis here in the united states uh... as things intensify
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:31.360]  all right you covered a lot of rent will be talking about that the choice of american people have
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:38.400]  whether or not uh... the two are two agents for change either obama or mccain no other choice
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:44.240]  uh... that's back to speak to themselves but new york times goes obama is often fancier that
[3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:48.160]  jinxes it all of the doctor boys for his speculation
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:53.280]  why do you see any of this james could be nothing other than the bradley effect do you see the
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:16:02.080]  bradley effect simply keep a lot of voting black on election day despite all the polling
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:08.240]  well certainly the bradley effect is something which the obama campaign are greatly fearing
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:13.120]  this idea that people could be saying one thing to the pollsters and something else
[3:16:13.120 --> 3:16:18.480]  to uh... themselves in private uh... it certainly got to be uh... fighting way at the heart of
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:24.160]  darkness at the obama campaign i think however that uh... as your polls have revealed there is
[3:16:24.160 --> 3:16:29.040]  enough of a uh... gap between the two candidates at this point they should be sufficient to see
[3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:34.320]  barack obama uh... coast of victory tomorrow uh... whether it'll be the landslide which some people
[3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:39.760]  that forecast i think is unlikely uh... we will have to have to wait and see exactly what the
[3:16:39.760 --> 3:16:44.320]  figures emerge but i think it's telling today that uh... we see john mccain very much on the
[3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:50.000]  defensive in states that he should have sworn up months ago and barack obama very much on the
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:56.880]  offensive uh... campaigning in those states which uh... george bush took relatively easily in 2004
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:02.640]  we see john mccain traveling from three thousand miles today to try to shore up his base uh...
[3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:06.720]  whereas barack obama appears to be taking it relatively easy traveling just under a biome
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:11.280]  all reckoning from seven hundred miles uh... very much to try to energize the democrats and get them
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:18.720]  out to vote well of course though we have uh... mccain saying obama is perhaps measuring the
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:23.920]  drape the white house well he should be according to the polls but you see that's barely affect the
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:30.080]  race factor uh... changing all the all the polls come november the fourth at his hours away
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:38.160]  now i think dr boyd has it exactly right uh... if this were a close race if in fact barack obama
[3:17:38.160 --> 3:17:44.240]  were leading in the polls in the battleground states and nationally by one or two percentage
[3:17:44.240 --> 3:17:50.000]  points then i think the potential of the bradley effect where people as he said my telepulster
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  that they would vote for barack obama but secretly when they actually go to vote
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:59.600]  would not vote for a an african-american and i think the bradley effect might have an effect
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:04.400]  but all indications are that even though this this race is narrowing to some extent
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:07.840]  and he's expected to narrow in terms of the voter turnout
[3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:14.000]  that the the margin of victory by barack obama in the key battleground states especially
[3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:21.360]  where he is expected to to win by more than two or three or four percent probably obviates
[3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:28.160]  the bradley effect uh... here if that happened if in fact the sub voters are going to not vote for
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:33.120]  him because he is black there's no question about that but if he's able to overcome that
[3:18:33.120 --> 3:18:39.360]  it will be a rather remarkable moment in american politics we had slavery in this country 140 years
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:45.280]  ago that's when we abolished it and now that we have an african-american who could win the presidency
[3:18:45.280 --> 3:18:51.760]  of the united states uh... you know 140 years since the uh... 15th amendment which was allowed
[3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:58.560]  the former slaves to vote is an extraordinary moment so while few americans may vote against
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:04.160]  barack obama because he is black the indications are that there is a phenomenon here which is
[3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:10.640]  bigger than that and that is likely though i'm not going to say predict absolutely but likely
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:16.560]  just sweep him into office tomorrow all right let's take a look at this c word of change of
[3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:22.160]  both campaigns have been talking about change obama says the change we need uh... their change is
[3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:28.560]  not authentic and uh... well here is what he wrote again in the wall street journal this is a defining
[3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:34.160]  moment in our history and then he said tomorrow i ask you to write our nation's next great chapter
[3:19:34.160 --> 3:19:39.280]  if you give me your vote we won't just win this election together we will change this country
[3:19:39.280 --> 3:19:46.320]  and change the world on alex jones last time a bush said i'll change the world after 911
[3:19:46.320 --> 3:19:50.960]  we see the change what change does obama really mean both inside the u.s. and outside
[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:55.040]  well there's going to be real change and it's the exact same change we would have seen
[3:19:55.040 --> 3:19:58.720]  uh... with john mccain these guys on the issues aren't any different
[3:19:58.720 --> 3:20:03.760]  you just get some different rhetoric and barack obama has openly called for a million person
[3:20:03.760 --> 3:20:10.880]  youth core youth brigades out enforcing uh... as intelligent spies he's called for a three million
[3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:17.120]  person environmental squads he's called for shutting down quote bankrupting the coal industry
[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:22.240]  that supplies forty nine percent of all of our power he's going to bring in big government
[3:20:22.240 --> 3:20:26.240]  i mean he's talking like he's the messiah he's running tv ads where he's already sitting
[3:20:26.960 --> 3:20:32.400]  in the white house and so what he's going to bring uh... is a lot of grassroots support
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:37.360]  just because the public thinks they're getting political change because he looks different
[3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:41.280]  but instead they're going to get change the whole george bush agenda
[3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:44.720]  on steroids and so that's the bottom line here that's why
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:49.840]  you have a rock obama unpopular on almost every issue
[3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:54.080]  the only reason he is popular with the people is because he's from a different party
[3:20:54.080 --> 3:20:58.880]  and they're hoping for some type of real change and they're not going to get it
[3:20:58.880 --> 3:21:04.640]  what they're going to get is what his running mate called for twice last week a new world order
[3:21:04.640 --> 3:21:08.080]  where the very private banks that have orchestrated the derivatives collapse
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:11.360]  for for a vertical integration a consolidation
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:16.880]  they are now openly calling for a world government run by a select group of banks
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:24.480]  out of london england that will set and control world taxes world regulations stock markets we
[3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:31.520]  will buy our carbon credits directly from a private group of central banks and so that
[3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:38.080]  is the change that barack obama is talking about he is talking about bringing in more control
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:42.560]  more of the same that's why he's getting more corporate contributions and more
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:48.080]  defense contributions and more big money contributions than john mccain the establishment
[3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:52.800]  position john mccain to win the republican primary because they knew they were basically
[3:21:52.800 --> 3:21:58.400]  running a political corpse just like the system ran bob dole in nineteen ninety six against bill
[3:21:58.400 --> 3:22:02.800]  clinton and so we're all talking about all the first black president while we're all talking
[3:22:02.800 --> 3:22:10.320]  about these little side issues we should as an american people talk about the fact that barack obama
[3:22:10.320 --> 3:22:16.080]  has lied about every major issue he has he has turned around and stabbed the american people
[3:22:16.080 --> 3:22:20.800]  in the back he got the nomination claiming he was going to end the spying in the police state
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:26.000]  in the war and now biden and others and has come out and said guess what we're not going to end
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:30.400]  any of it basically it's going to be very unpopular but this is what we're going to do we are going
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:36.800]  to see more of the new world order neocon agenda and we documented all at info wars dot com
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:41.840]  and prison planet dot com and so you're going to see massive resistance form in the next few years
[3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:46.800]  after the honeymoon is over and as the united states goes into this orchestrated depression
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:53.200]  you're going to see barack obama become incredibly unpopular and we're going to see all sorts of
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:57.360]  resistance at every level here in the united states and that's what i'm concerned about
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:23:02.640]  because the left was all against george bush and his globalist agenda but now because barack obama
[3:23:02.640 --> 3:23:07.600]  is set to be launched in there with this whole messianic uh... you know vision talking about
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:13.040]  he is the one he is coming to save the earth newsweek calling him the president of the world
[3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:17.760]  you know the whole world saying he's this wonderful sweet loving person if you look at
[3:23:17.760 --> 3:23:24.080]  what he really is doing he's bringing tyranny and into the free market a a crony capitalist system
[3:23:24.080 --> 3:23:29.200]  where a select group of inner banks and corporations loot the united states like we saw with boris
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:34.880]  yeltsin and the oligarchs in russia the united states is being looted from pillar to post by the
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:40.640]  transnational criminals joseph sticklets on cnbc yesterday called for a world government run by
[3:23:40.640 --> 3:23:50.320]  the banks they are coming out against the people i'll let's see if james online and agree
[3:23:50.320 --> 3:23:53.680]  well what kind of a political scientist is a real honor to be on the show with uh... with
[3:23:53.680 --> 3:23:58.000]  Wayne slated tonight but uh... maybe if i can add some sort of uh... people dimension to that
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:03.040]  from an international perspective um... you can hear an awful lot over the next 24 hours and
[3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:07.600]  moving in through the interregnum until the inauguration about change change is what we've
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:12.720]  heard from brack obama of course over the last 22 months or so but history would dictate that in
[3:24:12.720 --> 3:24:17.040]  every presidential election uh... while people talk heavily about change what you get a great
[3:24:17.040 --> 3:24:22.240]  deal of is actually continuity uh... any president coming into office is going to be forced to
[3:24:22.240 --> 3:24:28.320]  continue a whole raft of issues uh... and what often changes is the rhetoric now the rhetoric
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:33.760]  as uh... i'm sure many people realize is important uh... the rhetoric of george bush uh... really
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:39.600]  put people's backs up here in europe uh... in in london uh... and and these whole tone was very
[3:24:39.600 --> 3:24:44.160]  aggressive and uh... if the meaning would seem to be uh... very much odds with the european
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:49.920]  perspective i think obama uh... the change he will initiate uh... will be one of tone
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:55.520]  and of an approach a much more inclusive uh... multilateral almost clinton s i think approach
[3:24:55.520 --> 3:25:00.560]  to foreign policy which we much more in keeping with the european perspective and as a result i
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:05.680]  think very much ease america's position in the rest of the world uh... vis-a-vis the countries with
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:10.960]  which it is tempting to formal alliances both militarily and financial uh... whoever becomes
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:15.280]  president has got a series of uphill challenges to face with one could almost ask who would
[3:25:15.280 --> 3:25:19.680]  want to be president at this point and you've got the war in iraq war in afghanistan and a
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:25.840]  financial crisis uh... which is clearly going to dominate uh... their time in office so whatever
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:30.480]  the candidate's promise or pledge on the campaign trail they're really going to face
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:34.400]  an uphill struggle in just trying to manage on a day-to-day basis and all these promises
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:39.200]  about spending and uh... youth movement i think will take a secondary place once um...
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:42.400]  obama if he is installed in the white house uh... comes to pass
[3:25:43.040 --> 3:25:48.080]  alright waitress later of course you've been in the planes of both campaigns but you have
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:53.360]  had the chance of being on the planes of the two only major campaigns now we will be talking about
[3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:58.720]  the third party as well but it does change both are talking about the change any difference between
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:03.520]  the two if let's have a preview of the difference we'll get into the details of the second half of the show
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:16.080]  wait we have one i thought you were going to break there so look there's going to be a change
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:21.200]  now it may not be the kind of change that alex would would anticipate but there's going to be
[3:26:21.200 --> 3:26:26.480]  a change there's a difference between barack obama democratic party this approach and john mccain and
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:32.880]  part of that change is alex said correctly what this nation is sick and tired of george w bush
[3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:39.280]  eight years of the bush administration and by extension of the attitude that the rest of
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:45.920]  the world has uh... about america americans don't like it that much of europe much of the rest of
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:50.960]  the world doesn't particularly have used for us that the preemption policies with respect to the
[3:26:50.960 --> 3:26:56.000]  war towards bush administration the economic policies at home which both democrats and
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:02.640]  republicans have shared to cause big problems that all of that together has created an environment
[3:27:02.640 --> 3:27:06.960]  for significant change you're going to see in a barack we'll talk to you say more specifically
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:12.240]  later we're going to see an approach in terms of an outreach to europe and the rest of the world
[3:27:12.240 --> 3:27:18.080]  that is more robust than we have seen certainly under the bush administration but we're also when
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:23.840]  we're going to see an effort to deal with the economic crisis in a way that is somewhat more
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:30.880]  sensitive to middle-income americans not simply no wealthy at the same time it's going to have to be
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:37.440]  a recognition of that capital in the united states which was part of the problem in terms of a few
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:43.440]  greedy operators is going to have to be tended to so there's going to be an element of continuity
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:48.720]  in the way that barack obama administration if there is one you know it runs the way down but
[3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:53.520]  it's going to be different it's approached internationally it's approached here in the
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:28:00.720]  united states i should say that one area where it will be exactly the same i think is if in fact
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:07.920]  the barack obama is challenged and ran as a perfect example of what some republican conservatives
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:14.800]  and uh... john mccain and broccoli obama's own uh... uh... running mate suggest could be an early
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:20.960]  challenge a testing of this young president in the event something like that happened
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:26.320]  i don't think people ought to be fooled this president would act pretty much like john mccain
[3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:32.480]  would act george bush would act a traditional united states president would act and that would be
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:38.320]  very strongly to protect united states and court so well we have only just a few seconds left to
[3:28:38.320 --> 3:28:44.480]  the end of the first half but uh... something people haven't heard over twenty parties third
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:50.320]  party so-called third party running but even americans haven't heard the names of most of these
[3:28:50.320 --> 3:28:56.320]  they do not know the candidate we come back we'll discuss the third parties why it's only blue
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:29:04.400]  and and or read and then the change on the lips of both barack obama and his rival john mccain
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:30.400]  will be back to short break
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:44.160]  the headlines this hour pakistan warned the u.s. missile attacks inside its soil since
[3:29:44.160 --> 3:29:49.440]  parker violent backlash pakistani officials so visiting u.s. commander general david betrayer

[3:33:07.760 --> 3:33:13.680]  but let's take a look at uh... the website of a few other parties called third parties in the
[3:33:13.680 --> 3:33:20.240]  u of constitution party all the socialist party u of a all the peace freedom a peace and freedom
[3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:26.240]  party though the party of principle again of the all libertarian party the green party
[3:33:26.240 --> 3:33:30.240]  and of course the green party says the real difference is talking about the real difference
[3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:36.720]  between democrat the democrat and republican party do they represent your interest and value
[3:33:36.720 --> 3:33:42.080]  the democrats talk about the different policies positions and priorities would see from a democrat
[3:33:42.080 --> 3:33:46.640]  in the white house versus a republican most democrat and republican politicians including
[3:33:46.640 --> 3:33:51.600]  clinton gore kerry and bush called similar positions of major issues and that's why we
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:56.880]  need a real twice the polls a party that gives power to we the people instead of powerful
[3:33:56.880 --> 3:34:01.680]  corporations then the side brings up a list of different issues and say where they happen to
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:07.360]  be the same issue green party republicans democrats and it talks about major issues like
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:11.920]  invasion and occupation of iraq where it says green party opposes but republicans
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:16.480]  and democrats both support them when you go to detail that that even invasion of iraq most
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:22.640]  democrats if not uh... barack obama they supported that they actually signed the authorization and
[3:34:22.640 --> 3:34:28.880]  also still support that the patriot act on invasion of afghanistan these are what republicans
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:33.680]  democrats are all the same possible war in military budget uh... is really occupation of
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:39.120]  west bank and god the global warming reduction of greenhouse gas emissions a right to choose
[3:34:39.120 --> 3:34:44.240]  our national health insurance it goes on and on and on simply
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:49.360]  saying they're both the same but we've had alex jones already saying that but alex back to you
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:55.440]  you have any more comments yes yes i have a lot of comments that at the end of the last
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:34:58.640]  segment i was unable to finish what i was saying so i'd like to finish that but that
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:03.920]  dovetails that connects in uh... to your latest question
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:09.040]  you know both your guests are admitting that that we're seeing continuity you know whether john
[3:35:09.040 --> 3:35:13.040]  mccain gets in or whether barack obama gets in you're going to see continuity that's because
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:18.640]  the big multinational corporations the globalist who openly uh... you know own both the major
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:25.280]  parties uh... are in control of both of these men and until uh... the nineteen nineties
[3:35:25.280 --> 3:35:29.680]  you could get a third party in the debates you could get other parties in the debates
[3:35:29.680 --> 3:35:34.320]  and then the people could make a choice watching the presidential debates that's why
[3:35:34.320 --> 3:35:38.800]  you had ross perot getting close to thirty percent since then this private corporation
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:44.080]  the debate commission at the pressure from the republican and democrats has closed the debates
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:49.360]  and so we need to have larger debates the first debate should have five six seven
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:54.240]  eight different candidates they should be real debates not uh... just questions and answers
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:35:58.960]  you have uh... the mainstream media here in the united states gives almost no attention
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:03.920]  to third parties or alternative parties especially if they have any clout and so we have a
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:10.000]  a constriction uh... in the amount of choices the public has by the control corporate press
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:14.640]  you know that's owned by the same banks and bomb makers that on the two major parties and so
[3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:20.160]  that's the issue we're dealing here with in barack obama is only different from john mccain
[3:36:20.160 --> 3:36:23.920]  and george bush cause medically and that's why wall streets giving him more money
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:29.120]  than anybody else because they believe he can neutralize the left to support these wars he's
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:33.520]  talked about needing to have conflicts with russia he came out against russia with what happened
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:37.760]  in georgia when georgia it's now admitted in the state department admits snuck attack
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:44.320]  uh... the russian uh... held area uh... of osetia and abkhazia we have all of this going on
[3:36:44.880 --> 3:36:50.720]  and we have barack obama uh... no different from bush when it comes to the banker takeover bill
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:58.160]  known as the bailout so the point i'm making here is congress has an eleven percent approval rating
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:04.080]  now in fact that was a few months ago now it's a nine percent approval rating the lowest in
[3:37:04.080 --> 3:37:08.160]  u.s history i go back to that point i'd like to hear your guests speak to this the reason they
[3:37:08.160 --> 3:37:12.880]  have the lowest approval rating in history in the united states is because the people have
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:17.440]  figured out that both parties are controlled by the same interest right they just hate george bush
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:23.520]  so much that they're giving barack obama a chance and i'm telling you go ahead let's
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:28.320]  put the question across the way later way and of course uh... the only body a lot popular
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:32.720]  than other presidents right in the u.s happens to be the congress so does that mean that the
[3:37:32.720 --> 3:37:37.920]  americans are right now the word of the fact that democrats and republicans as alex suggests
[3:37:38.560 --> 3:37:41.840]  well simply are no different and they're not the ones they want an office
[3:37:41.840 --> 3:37:48.480]  uh... that's part of it i think that they're they're not distinct differences between the party both
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:52.960]  candidates tend to in this great race that's going to run toward the center but instead of
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:57.440]  being a recognition as alex suggests by the american public that they're owned by corporations of
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:03.920]  the corporate global elite i think it's more of the the fact that americans are simply not
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:08.400]  happy with their political institutions at all because they didn't do anything they basically
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:14.640]  have become more polarized the institutions of government the way we elect people the the shape
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:21.520]  of our of our uh... districts producing uh... different candidates and different office
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:29.360]  holders and and the rest of it has invited a kind of polarized gridlock deadlocked in places like
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:37.840]  washington where you have certainly under george w bush a polarized environment where very little
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:44.400]  gets done there's not a sense of compromise there's a sense of my way or the highway and for normal
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:49.360]  americans who are looking at their savings at home or looking whether they can pay their mortgage
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:54.240]  or they want to send their kids to college and they watch these guys up in washington
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:39:00.160]  whether it's in the white house or in congress simply having such difficulty solving problems
[3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:06.640]  that i think is more than anything else what is compared to the lowest rating let us let us also
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:12.080]  take a look at the so-called third party why is it just blue and red how would you explain the
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:17.360]  electoral college now people voting november the fourth but the real vote for president cast
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:22.400]  on december fifteenth when five hundred thirty eight people decided the end of the day canadian press
[3:39:22.400 --> 3:39:27.680]  goes off to electoral college how americans choose a new president uh... uh... current dot com
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:32.960]  goes electoral college our ballots should matter more borbs goes the electoral college why obama
[3:39:32.960 --> 3:39:38.000]  and mccain probably don't care about you that means the voters and to the uh... we have another
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:44.320]  headline popular vote versus electoral college this course back in two thousand was quite notorious
[3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:50.240]  so the electoral system to us is that really democratic i would like to comment go ahead i'll
[3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:55.600]  get back to you alex let's have wayne and this and then i'll get back very very briefly it is
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:40:01.840]  democratic in a sort of small way but you're right institutionally it works against the interest
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:08.960]  of a truly vigorous different approach which a third-party candidate has to do it as alex said
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:15.120]  the most recent example of a vigorous third-party challenge ross perot happened because he was
[3:40:15.120 --> 3:40:20.800]  offering something truly different from number two you saw tennie rosa bell the century ago
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:26.000]  who was offering something really different in neither case did they win but the institution
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:31.120]  i think alex is right the institution the mech the mechanisms of the way we do it including
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:37.280]  the electoral college which has been with us from the for a long time uh... does militate against
[3:40:37.280 --> 3:40:43.760]  the advantage of a third more inventive vigorous interested in different approach
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:48.240]  to our government all right now a challenge for alex to hold us by just a few seconds though
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:53.840]  why they go to a london doctor a boy's like to have your take on the democratic nature of us
[3:40:53.840 --> 3:41:00.320]  electoral system thanks very much i am i'd like to come back i should do alex is saying because
[3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:04.880]  i think there is a popular misunderstanding about the american political system we talk about two
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:09.440]  parties but i think you can make a very valiant claim that there are actually 50 parties because
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:13.920]  the national party system in the united states is very very different than it is here in england
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:19.200]  for example uh... people are much more powerful than a local state level yes uh... who uh...
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:24.160]  which allows someone like brack obama to come forward uh... to defeat the the sort of like the
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:28.240]  the candidate of choice for the party which would have been hillary clinton for example
[3:41:28.240 --> 3:41:32.000]  i'd also pull uh... police with his idea that third parties are
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:36.320]  not important american politics as wane righty points out we can think about the progressive
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:42.160]  movement that's the bull moose party uh... fidel rusevelt in the 20s uh... we can come forward
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:48.000]  to think about the dixie cracks in the 40s um... alex talks about this idea that only until
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:53.280]  the nineteen nineties could you have a uh... party of a third party coming through to challenge but
[3:41:53.280 --> 3:41:57.360]  ross perot of course actually challenging the nineteen nineties and if alex is worried about
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:42:02.560]  the influence of big money in american politics well the only reason that ross perot was able to
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:09.200]  stage his remarkable third party uh... success in which he achieved 19 percent of the electoral
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:14.000]  college of the electoral popular vote in uh... nineteen ninety two was because he was a billionaire
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:18.560]  so if alex is worried about big money in america i think ross perot is an interesting and uh...
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:23.520]  that's contradictory choice to hold up as an example no oh yeah let me counter that
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:28.640]  what i'm saying that's a misrepresentation i was talking about the last time
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:35.040]  there was a true strong third party challenge i wasn't discussing ross perot's money or how
[3:42:35.040 --> 3:42:41.440]  ross perot got into that position i was talking about the attempts since then to further freeze
[3:42:41.440 --> 3:42:48.080]  third party uh... uh... candidates and parties out of the larger discussion and out of the media
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:53.280]  and a circling of the wagons by the two party dictatorship that we have in this country now
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:42:58.640]  let me just be clear here the american people it isn't that nothing's being done in washington
[3:42:58.640 --> 3:43:02.960]  thousands of pieces of legislation are being passed okay at the state and federal level
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:07.440]  the people are frustrated because ninety one percent in every major gallup poll want to
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:12.000]  control the border both parties say no because the corporations want cheap labor and to drive down
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:18.080]  the wages the american people seventy five percent or higher don't want these wars but both parties
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:24.240]  are still for it and still push it on issue after issue the congress only has a nine percent
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:31.200]  approval rating because the people understand that special interest are in control of the process
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:37.360]  more and more they've always been there but more and more that's happening so that's why this country
[3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:42.640]  is moving towards revolution that's why the army times reported they have north com regular army
[3:43:42.640 --> 3:43:48.560]  brigades pull it up for yourself on google ready to quote deal with american insurrection because
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:55.040]  the american people understand that both parties are controlled and you're right there hoping morocco
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:59.920]  obama will do something different they're hoping that it's all just rhetoric that he's basically
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:03.920]  going to be locked step with what george bush did because george bush was locked step with what the
[3:44:03.920 --> 3:44:09.120]  last president did because it's a military industrial complex that is using america as the
[3:44:09.120 --> 3:44:14.880]  engine of world government and the engine of empire for the anglo-american establishment so
[3:44:14.880 --> 3:44:18.320]  that's what we're dealing with here and so instead of just talking about the horse race
[3:44:19.200 --> 3:44:24.080]  a barack obama and of course john mccain the supposed maverick i'm pointing out that it's
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:28.880]  like a don king boxing match where he owns both the fighters or it's like a horse race we're all
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:33.920]  ten of the horses are owned by the same person they're going to end up winning i'm saying our system
[3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:39.440]  fundamentally is breaking down and is corrupt and we need gridlock in congress by the way on the
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:45.520]  subject of the electoral college i'm all for it why am i for it our senators until the 17th
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:50.960]  amendment 1913 were appointed by the state they were appointed by the legislatures because the
[3:44:50.960 --> 3:44:55.760]  senators were creatures of the state so you couldn't have an all-powerful federal dictatorship
[3:44:55.760 --> 3:45:02.000]  and so now our popular vote is counted at the state level and then it goes up for the number
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:08.960]  of electoral votes that that state has representing its congressional districts and then and they've
[3:45:08.960 --> 3:45:14.720]  never gone against this the congress then goes with the popular vote so it's the same system of
[3:45:14.720 --> 3:45:21.440]  state power and that's what we're dealing with here and that's why i am against a quote popular
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:26.880]  vote because that allows more federalization more control imagine of our senators we're still
[3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:33.200]  creatures of the states the states are being turned into vassals of the feds this is empire and we
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:38.640]  need to turn this around to turn this around today all right now no alec we need to move on to uh
[3:45:38.640 --> 3:45:44.240]  this is a very important issue ap goes world closely watching the world closely watching
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:51.200]  us presidential elections and op-ed news is if the world could vote in the u.s election and of
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:55.520]  course many believe obama's international experience would go a long way in helping repair damage
[3:45:55.520 --> 3:46:00.480]  caused by the unpopular u.s lesbos and iraq and afghanistan with recent opinion polls for more than
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:07.120]  70 nations favoring him a resounding three to one over republican john mccain the wing slater
[3:46:07.120 --> 3:46:15.840]  wants to say for the world three foot broad but basically uh i have to tell you that many american
[3:46:15.840 --> 3:46:20.240]  voters if they knew that the rest of the world wanted barack obama it would not be a positive for
[3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:27.520]  barack obama on the other hand there is a general sense and i think barack obama is going to pull
[3:46:27.520 --> 3:46:34.800]  the troops out of uh of iraq i think he's going to reposition some troops into afghanistan as he
[3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:41.680]  promised i am back at stand and there is going to be a very active effort to reach out to the
[3:46:41.680 --> 3:46:47.200]  rest of the world in a way that bush administration has not done this is going to be a change a
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:46:53.120]  different now maybe some critics don't think that's enough but this administration is going to
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:46:59.040]  do that uh i have a great confidence we'll see barack is elected tomorrow you're going to see a
[3:46:59.040 --> 3:47:04.560]  different america in terms of its relationship with the rest of the country including the middle
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:11.440]  east way let me ask you this then real fast it what is going to why then is joe biden and others
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:15.920]  saying get ready for him to do something internationally uh what is this crisis you know
[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:20.240]  you're kind of an insider of the democratic party even flying around with obama all these leaders
[3:47:20.240 --> 3:47:26.000]  including in europe have said a major crisis on the 21st and 22nd of january when he is inaugurated
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:30.640]  colin pal said it on meet the press can you please enlighten us and tell us what this major
[3:47:30.640 --> 3:47:35.920]  international crisis is going to be that joe biden says his running mate is going to be very unpopular
[3:47:35.920 --> 3:47:43.920]  with the left sounds like going into pakistan to me way that's that's entirely possible
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:49.440]  uh pakistan is a more aggressive approach to pakistan as a possibility what what biden said
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:55.120]  was that the new president whoever it was would be challenged would be tested especially if it's a
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:00.000]  new president like barack obama i don't know what it's going to be alex it's going to be something
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  somebody's going to rattle their savers somewhere but i do think that most forces uh whether they're
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:11.920]  the middle east or elsewhere whether it's north korea understand that there is a continuity
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:16.960]  whether you like it or not in the united states no i know this one challenge of this president
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:23.120]  whoever it is is going to be met by this government absent that we're going to see a different
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:29.920]  approach and attitude by a barack obama administration to his dealings with the rest of the world a
[3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:34.240]  willingness to i agree it's going to be a velvet glove and that's why the corporations want him
[3:48:34.240 --> 3:48:38.960]  because he can sell the world on accepting a couple more wars if a lot let's let's have dr
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:44.960]  boys and dr boys from so many actually let's talk about continents right now of course the
[3:48:44.960 --> 3:48:48.960]  middle east as well let's talk about transatlantic relations let's talk about latin america let's
[3:48:48.960 --> 3:48:56.400]  talk about the middle east iraq afghanistan force briefly but broadly the difference well i i think
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:00.960]  it's interesting that the article that you initially referenced talked about barack obama's
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:06.080]  international experience uh i would have thought that if barack obama had a weakness it was his
[3:49:06.080 --> 3:49:11.440]  lack of an international experience i do hope the paper wasn't referring to his brief but glorious
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:16.640]  european tour which saw him come to london and berlin earlier in the summer the german serum the
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:22.640]  no sort of experience to you to base upon whatsoever uh john mccain argue he has a far greater
[3:49:22.640 --> 3:49:27.440]  international experience in dealing with the press and with the international leaders so i think
[3:49:27.440 --> 3:49:32.720]  that's uh a little bit of a misnomer on that account um in terms of how he's going to deal with
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:37.520]  things as i said earlier on tony's going to have an awful lot to do with this i think he will be
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:43.120]  more prepared to take an aggressive stance with pakistan and their perhaps inability and i mean
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:48.160]  a new war to uh does that mean a new war does it mean a new war no i don't think it means a new war
[3:49:48.160 --> 3:49:53.360]  i think it means taking on a slightly different approach with regard to pakistan uh i think uh
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:59.840]  what obama will do will be to shift quite rightly the focus away from iraq towards the battlefront
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:04.560]  in in afghanistan uh and to hopefully try to alleviate the pressure which is on the uh
[3:50:04.560 --> 3:50:07.920]  the british trip contingent in that part of the world but only on the surface they're going to
[3:50:07.920 --> 3:50:12.720]  stay in iraq they're going to leave at least 50 000 trips there and bring in more that's
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:17.600]  that's the question doctor boy how about iraq do you see just residual forces left in iraq
[3:50:17.600 --> 3:50:22.080]  according to barack obama what what does he mean by that 50 000 60 000 and permanent bases
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:28.000]  i mean you know i i'm not uh an insider the pentagon i can't comment upon exactly what
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:33.040]  figure's going to be there i'd agree with alex that uh america where it goes overseas tends to
[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:37.680]  remain uh and this is one of the main arguments against it yeah so they're going to depoliticize
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:41.920]  it they all it's a liberal it's a democrat it's okay to keep the troops there and then we'll just
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:46.800]  forget about it hang of it how so i think one of the main complaints against american foreign
[3:50:46.800 --> 3:50:51.360]  policy is the idea that it doesn't have an exit strategy because it doesn't intend to ever leave
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:55.840]  and i think there is a major problem there uh i think the main shift is going to move away from
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:51:02.480]  iraq towards afghanistan um but i i do think that uh as armies after armies and centuries
[3:51:02.480 --> 3:51:07.280]  off the centuries that discovered the british included uh afghanistan is very much a black hole
[3:51:07.280 --> 3:51:11.600]  into which a number of western powers have sunk and i feel the united states is just going to be
[3:51:11.600 --> 3:51:15.520]  the latest in a long line well i agree with you it's collapsing right now the force has already
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:21.200]  been down in what two or three major cities i mean mohammed carzai is really only the mayor of
[3:51:21.200 --> 3:51:25.680]  cobble and the rest of the troops are there just guarding the opium fields to make sure that gets
[3:51:25.680 --> 3:51:30.880]  shipped out to america's breakfast tables uh but bottom line here ladies and gentlemen get ready
[3:51:30.880 --> 3:51:35.040]  for the new world order get ready they have announced that they're going to have a small group
[3:51:35.040 --> 3:51:39.680]  of private central banks running the world's finance controlling everything through new
[3:51:39.680 --> 3:51:45.760]  international agreements and bush's legacy is going to be to demonize true conservatism demonize the
[3:51:45.760 --> 3:51:51.040]  united states uh and then basically set us up for the next phase of the new world order globalism
[3:51:51.040 --> 3:51:55.600]  based out of europe and so uh you know basically i wanted on record that george bush is not from
[3:51:55.600 --> 3:52:01.280]  texas george bush is not a real conservative george bush was a globalist puppet who was put in there
[3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:06.400]  to make everybody have rage and hate the united states so the establishment could then give us
[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:11.440]  their new savior their new world leader their new world president his newsweek calls him
[3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:17.520]  barack h obama and he is there to fool the world and i'm telling you we're in for hard times ladies
[3:52:17.520 --> 3:52:23.840]  and gentlemen just get ready in afghanistan and in pakistan and encircling russia and that sneak
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:29.200]  attack that nato in the u.s. did through their proxy in georgia and the nerve of our media that
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:34.800]  shows how reckless they are to come on our tv sets and say russia snuck attack them i mean we're in a
[3:52:34.800 --> 3:52:40.720]  lot of trouble and i'm telling you they have told us they have told us pal listed the days this is
[3:52:40.720 --> 3:52:44.800]  supposedly going to happen and i'm telling you they're going to try to make him look like a tough
[3:52:44.800 --> 3:52:50.640]  war hawk they may even do some more stage gulf atonk and stuff to to to you know uh basically
[3:52:50.640 --> 3:52:55.840]  christen have an inaugural uh... terror event or something so that so the barack obama can
[3:52:56.400 --> 3:53:02.080]  pose as a savior all right we have we have about a minute left wing slater like uh more
[3:53:02.080 --> 3:53:08.400]  from you on obama and the international scene one if his president if polls are proven right
[3:53:08.400 --> 3:53:15.760]  right the palestinian issue the latin america is already promised in this camp yeah he is going
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:19.360]  to be much more open and in dealing with latin america is going to be much more opening frankly
[3:53:19.360 --> 3:53:25.200]  in dealing with iran in an effort to deal and to reverse the attitudes of the rest of the world
[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:31.440]  uh... the bad attitudes about the united states uh... this is going to be a very different
[3:53:31.440 --> 3:53:38.240]  administration good cop bad cop and with respect to going actively again war the american
[3:53:38.240 --> 3:53:46.480]  people have no appetite for an active military expedition now after this debacle in iraq
[3:53:46.480 --> 3:53:50.480]  this administration will be governed by the american attitude in terms of the public
[3:53:50.480 --> 3:53:55.840]  will really be designed in engaging the rest of the world in a positive at least in in the
[3:53:55.840 --> 3:54:01.440]  community of way corporate they are what the instinct is what we're going to see all right
[3:54:01.440 --> 3:54:06.240]  that's pretty much the time we had for another edition of fight for the very special one hour

[3:55:18.480 --> 3:55:22.400]  okay we're back on jenesis john harman that all go good the last 50 minutes
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:25.680]  yeah it was excellent come up on air tell us what you thought of that
[3:55:25.680 --> 3:55:35.520]  that was quite interesting to be on you know international yeah i'm on russian i'm on british
[3:55:35.520 --> 3:55:40.800]  i'm on japanese every week now pretty much and a lot of these things they have me on my phone so
[3:55:40.800 --> 3:55:45.760]  that's good they're driving me down to the studios all the time but i found the iranians are just
[3:55:45.760 --> 3:55:50.480]  incredibly fair to the united states i mean people think of iranian tv is this america bashing
[3:55:50.480 --> 3:55:56.320]  it's usually two to one against me well not usually it always is where there's like pro
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:56:03.680]  you know nuke iran stuff you know with the us people even on their own shows oh yeah they think all
[3:56:03.680 --> 3:56:09.440]  foreigners are you know terrorists and whatnot but i mean iran even puts on the american view
[3:56:10.080 --> 3:56:15.840]  and so it's not fair and balanced they give the the western bs view two thirds of the time
[3:56:15.840 --> 3:56:20.240]  and that's completely true yeah so i mean but then meanwhile our fox tv are seeing
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:25.920]  ends like watching uh looney tunes or something it's it's it's so biased and and so full of lies
[3:56:26.800 --> 3:56:30.720]  ladies and gentlemen i'm glad we could do that simulcast here on the jenesis network to our
[3:56:30.720 --> 3:56:34.000]  aim and FM affiliates global shortwave satellite the internet and the rest of it
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:37.680]  that we're listening at info wars dot com we're watching on prison planet dot tv would have been
[3:56:37.680 --> 3:56:44.160]  able to see and hear the entire transmission by tonight they'll also have one of their top news
[3:56:44.160 --> 3:56:50.240]  shows worldwide and iran will be up there in their archive will just be in the programs click on the
[3:56:50.240 --> 3:56:57.920]  fine print and you can go and watch the video of course you can see it at prison planet dot tv
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:02.640]  we're piping it in but you can also watch it there with their feed without cutting into my video
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:06.720]  feed here in the studio but great technology or thank god for it it's really hurting the new world
[3:57:06.720 --> 3:57:11.200]  order that's why they're trying to shut it down i'm in austin jenesis is up in minnesota
[3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:15.760]  there in london and tehran and you heard that all nexus and they were dialed in to london
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:20.800]  they were dialed into austin they were dialed in all over that is definitely very very interesting
[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:27.760]  listen we're gonna have four hours of election coverage in your phone calls tomorrow and then
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:32.240]  of course on wednesday we'll cover election fraud whatever happens i hope there's no rioting or
[3:57:32.240 --> 3:57:37.360]  problems uh but we'll keep following this the point is barack obama is a puppet and nothing's
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:42.160]  going to change but the rhetoric they played they play good cop bad cop it'll be all the same
[3:57:42.160 --> 3:57:46.880]  policies of different rhetoric and uh so we'll see what happened you know the torture the secret
[3:57:46.880 --> 3:57:51.760]  arrest uh the military commissions act the john warren defense authorization act the end
[3:57:51.760 --> 3:57:56.800]  deposit comet taught us the patriot acts you're not going to see any of that repealed despite the
[3:57:56.800 --> 3:58:00.640]  fact that they're going to have the house the senate and the executive now that's the point
[3:58:00.640 --> 3:58:05.200]  god bless you all rebroadcast starts in one minute at info wars dot com on the streams and at the
