[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time Sooner or later gotta cut you down, Sooner or later gotta cut you down
[00:29.000 --> 00:45.000]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-fighter, tell him it's gonna cut him down
[00:45.000 --> 00:57.000]  You know, there's a big story up on infowars.com and it's a national news story. Ted Copple said the sky is blue and the bananas when they're ripe are yellow.
[00:57.000 --> 01:15.000]  He came out at the Carnegie Endowment, that's the top of the whole globalist pyramid of the tax-free foundations and he said, you know, the Washington Post, the New York Times are unified in their propaganda against Trump and it's very, very dangerous.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  But why do we need Ted Copple to tell us that?
[01:21.000 --> 01:36.000]  I mean, I've been saying for years, I believe Sandy Hook happened. I've never sent anybody to Sandy Hook family's houses, but they went on NPR this weekend and said that I was currently doing it and so that's why I need to be taken off the air,
[01:36.000 --> 01:49.000]  which I can tell you really upset some law firms in Washington, D.C. who don't even represent me, but who are beginning to understand what's happening in the organized plan to take down the First Amendment.
[01:49.000 --> 02:04.000]  This country and this world is in the grip of the end of free speech. Russia is passing draconian anti-free speech laws. Japan, China are moving forward, but China obviously already deepened the grips of it.
[02:04.000 --> 02:13.000]  The EU is engaged in massive censorship and when the EU criticized Putin, he said, hey, you're doing stuff more draconian than I am.
[02:13.000 --> 02:28.000]  It's out of control. They are arresting people in England and in Sweden and in states like California and the U.S. for using the wrong pronoun.
[02:28.000 --> 02:45.000]  You have a right if somebody looks like a man and you say, hey, man, to say that you have a right to say the moon is made of cheese. You have the right to say the deep blue sea is blue.
[02:45.000 --> 02:56.000]  You have a right to be right. You have a right to be wrong. And I know I'm stating incredibly obvious things here, but the left is a cult of control freaks.
[02:56.000 --> 03:10.000]  Here's one of the articles, NewsWars.com, Catholic journalist criminally investigated for using the wrong pronoun in a tweet.
[03:10.000 --> 03:27.000]  And then you get big old giant bullies, big old men. You can only tell they think they're a woman because they're wearing a pink shirt. Come in and they say, okay, guys, come on, we're ready for you at the cash register. Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[03:27.000 --> 03:44.000]  And you know the Globalist Master Plan when you see what they protect and what they're obsessed with and it's ending the family, ending the sexes, and ending language.
[03:44.000 --> 03:52.000]  There's a clip of Ted Koppel stating that, again, the ocean is wet. Here it is.
[03:52.000 --> 04:04.000]  I'm terribly concerned that when you talk about the New York Times these days, when you talk about the Washington Post these days, we're not talking about the New York Times at 50 years ago.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  We are not talking about the Washington Post at 50 years ago.
[04:09.000 --> 04:25.000]  We're talking about organizations that I believe have in fact decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.
[04:25.000 --> 04:39.000]  We have things appearing on the front page of the New York Times right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago. Analysis commentary on the front page.
[04:39.000 --> 04:48.000]  I remember sitting at the breakfast table with my wife during the campaign after the Access Hollywood table came up.
[04:48.000 --> 04:57.000]  We've got more of this coming up, big show lined up today. Whatever you do, spread the live links, tell folks at the local stations. That's how you defeat the census.
[04:57.000 --> 05:19.000]  That's how we continue to march forward.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  This is the Daily Digestive Pack today.
[06:27.000 --> 06:38.000]  I've been watching and I've been waiting. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[06:38.000 --> 06:49.000]  We're here live, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m., 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, the war room with Owen Schreuer, 3 o'clock Central.
[06:49.000 --> 06:57.000]  Roger Stone can't co-host. He's got a gag order. Can't even write books right here in the USA. Keep your mouth shut.
[06:57.000 --> 07:05.000]  And of course, we've got David Knight. He's not been locked up or gagged yet. 8 a.m. Central. But guess what happens tomorrow?
[07:05.000 --> 07:29.000]  We've got a stop the bias, hashtag stop the bias, stop big tech censorship, save the First Amendment, live, global 50 hour broadcast, where we have got a flotilla of top guest experts on with the main focus on the censorship and how to counter the globalist and what needs to be done.
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  We need section 230 to be stripped from big tech. Nobody else has immunity.
[07:36.000 --> 07:49.000]  If they want to act as publishers and censor and control and say they have editorial control like Tim Cook has said, then you lose 230, which by the way, I don't want to do.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  But you can't have your filthy cake and eat it too.
[07:54.000 --> 08:03.000]  So we've got just amazing guests. Everybody from Tommy Robinson to you. Name it. We'll be joining us.
[08:03.000 --> 08:16.000]  And Trump says we've been lighting the fire under his tail has been saying, OK, I won't wait till the campaign until I get back into office with it with a campaign pledge to go after big tech with anti trust suits.
[08:16.000 --> 08:25.000]  I'll do it now. Good. Let's keep lighting more fires under the president's.
[08:25.000 --> 08:38.000]  Because squeaky wheels get the grace here and this has got to be done. And there's a lot going on behind the scenes as corporate America actually wakes up and says, wait, they're actually going to end the First Amendment and New York Times versus Sullivan.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  What does that mean?
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  And so before a large part of corporate America was globalist and wanted this, but now a large part is waking up and saying, you're really going to do that.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  So a lot of big stuff going on behind the scenes that I'm not at liberty to tell you. And then I will never tell you because it's off record.
[08:55.000 --> 09:05.000]  But I've been talking to folks in California, people in Silicon Valley, people who have national talk shows, and I've been talking to a lot of other people.
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  And to the level of having to sign nondisclosures and things, which I will not violate.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  And there is a lot going on. A lot going on.
[09:18.000 --> 09:28.000]  And there's a big buzz going. I got two calls this weekend from big national host. We're going to go to Mark Dice's report first.
[09:28.000 --> 09:37.000]  I was going to play one report. My cab is going to play that next segment. I'm going to play Mark Dice's report first.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  And I got these calls and they said, wow.
[09:41.000 --> 09:51.000]  You know, at very high levels in Silicon Valley and in Hollywood, they're finally concerned about you being censored and realize it's going to be everybody.
[09:51.000 --> 10:02.000]  And that we need to turn this around and that there's been high level discussions with these other big law firms, the Democratic Party to stop doing what they're doing to myself and others because they know it's a fraud.
[10:02.000 --> 10:11.000]  And the Democrats agreed to do it and then double back and didn't stop.
[10:11.000 --> 10:25.000]  So this civil war in the government is not just between left and right. It is between people that want to have any semblance of due process and any semblance of rule of law and this authoritarian instinct that we're going headlong into.
[10:25.000 --> 10:43.000]  That by the way, planetary, without even looking for it, half my stack, probably 50 stories or more are about governments and corporations and universities all over the world just saying there's no more free speech. It's gone.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  Here's Mark Dice breaking some of the latest attacks down.
[10:48.000 --> 10:59.000]  First, they came for Alex Jones and a lot of people thought he said some crazy things and he's kind of on the fringe. They certainly won't censor any mainstream conservatives.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Well, I've been trying to tell you that he was just the beginning.
[11:02.000 --> 11:25.000]  YouTube CEO Susan Bajiski recently sat down for an interview with Kara Swisher. She also scored that historic interview with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and has interviewed all of the big names in tech.
[11:25.000 --> 11:40.000]  And at this year's Lesbians Who Tech Conference in San Francisco, Kara Swisher pressured YouTube CEO to ban Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator, perhaps best known for giving lectures on college campuses.
[11:40.000 --> 11:55.000]  Kara Swisher, who, as you may have guessed, is a lesbian and serving at the Lesbians Who Tech Conference, adopted a poor child along with her wife, who is now 13 years old, and is watching Ben Shapiro videos on YouTube.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  I'll get your recommendations. I have a personal beef with you about that.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  OK. I can't wait to hear.
[12:02.000 --> 12:15.000]  My son, who's 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos, and he's like the gateway drug to the next group. And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson, then it goes down, and in three clicks he was at neo-Nazi stuff.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  It was like astonishing. And then I had to listen to it at dinner. And I was sort of like, I'm going to kill Susan Bajiski first.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  OK, well, here I am.
[12:23.000 --> 12:43.000]  But it was sort of like, I was sort of like, is there anything like, it feels like, as I said, I think you've heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire, garbage, street signs, and stuff like that.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  And her brain damage behind the neo-Nazi stuff are probably clips of Tucker Carlson or PewDiePie.
[12:49.000 --> 13:01.000]  And then I've got this kid who's like, well, Ben Shapiro is sort of smart. I'm like, no, he's not. He's clever, but he's an idiot. Anyway, it's exhausting. But it has a huge effect on them.
[13:01.000 --> 13:12.000]  Do you feel like the people, on a bigger thing, and it's not your total responsibility, Susan, but do you feel like the people that's living on it have a sense of this, of the impact they have?
[13:12.000 --> 13:24.000]  Folks, I'm going to have to come back and play the rest of this. It's so incredible. I'm back in about 30 seconds. So you've got this woman married to the woman who was the head of Internet technology development for Obama.
[13:24.000 --> 13:38.000]  That means controlling the new rollout of censorship. And she's saying, my son likes Ben Shapiro, and it's horrible. So she wants to use her power like a giant Internet TV changer.
[13:38.000 --> 13:46.000]  Or basically giant Internet parental controls because Ben Shapiro needs to be stopped.
[13:46.000 --> 13:57.000]  Lady, you're not going to stop your son from rebelling against your authoritarian leftist crap. That's why humans genetically, the young rebel, even if your parents are great, they still rebel.
[13:57.000 --> 14:07.000]  God put that in us to take us on a new course in case we have bad parents. That's how the change works. It's meant so your kids don't stay with you. They're meant to move out.
[14:07.000 --> 14:19.000]  So they're meant about 13, 14 genetically to try to differentiate from you. You're such a big leftist, you're so smart. And so they're going to try to be the opposite of you.
[14:19.000 --> 14:36.000]  So if you wanted leftist sons who wanted to take Prozac and Ritalin and take chemicals to be castrated or whatever, you would pose as a right winger that beat them and told them that sex was dirty or whatever.
[14:36.000 --> 14:49.000]  Then you'd get a leftist, maybe. No, no, no, no, no. Now you're saying you can't have Ben Shapiro or Alex Jones. It's over, lady. You'll never be able to censure. You'll never be able to control it.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  China, the chai comms are going to lose control. You're going to lose control. Nationalism is spreading all over the world.
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  We'll come back with the rest of this intriguing report that's posted on infowars.com and newswars.com.

[20:17.000 --> 20:40.000]  So we're playing clips of Kara Swisher and she was married to Megan Smith, Dr. McCamshot, please, and you're tuned into the Alex Jones show.
[20:40.000 --> 21:01.000]  And she's up there talking about how they want to censor the internet because her son is tuned in to Ben Shapiro who's a gateway drug to Jordan Peterson and then you find people like Mark Dyson, Alex Jones, God forbid.
[21:01.000 --> 21:14.000]  And so that's why you're seeing all this draconian censorship. Think about this. There are tons of articles out yesterday and today saying Jones had another YouTube channel banned. Well, it wasn't our YouTube channel because on the channel, it said false flag.
[21:14.000 --> 21:34.000]  And the video that they are talking about is Rush Limbaugh saying a lot of people are saying this guy's a leftist from his own manifesto where he says he's an eco-fascist, where he says that he loves communist China, where he says he's not a conservative and that he's doing this to create a class of civilizations.
[21:34.000 --> 21:48.000]  Well, that would be a false flag. It doesn't mean nobody died. It doesn't mean people didn't get shot. It means like the PNAC document written by Dick Cheney in 2000. He said if we have about 3,000 people die the same size as Pearl Harbor.
[21:48.000 --> 22:03.000]  He actually said this. He said if the same number of people died say like a new Pearl Harbor event, we could use that as a catalyst for a new American century and have a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam and crush Islam.
[22:03.000 --> 22:18.000]  Now, as much as I don't like radical expanding Islam, I wasn't for that. And I read rebuilding America's defenses dozens of times on air. That doesn't mean 9-11 didn't happen. Towers didn't come down. People didn't get killed.
[22:18.000 --> 22:28.000]  It meant our government at highest levels was allowing the attacks to take place and that's since then come out. And they don't want me to be able to question that.
[22:28.000 --> 22:40.000]  Instead, I started getting phone calls from people going, hey, are you saying this didn't happen? No, I didn't say that. So when you read the articles, you don't never have quotes other than false flag.
[22:40.000 --> 22:51.000]  Well, I can say this is not a false flag and then they still have false flag up there. And it's not a classic false flag where you totally go blow something up yourself and then blame it on somebody.
[22:51.000 --> 23:09.000]  Or attack your own military base and blame it on somebody like Operation Himmler that started World War II. That's on record. But he says in the manifesto, I'm doing this to cause a global race war just like Charlie Manson did in 1969.
[23:09.000 --> 23:23.000]  Well, when you say you're trying to stage a horrible provocation to start a larger war, that is the definition of a provocative provocateur false flag. There's different types.
[23:23.000 --> 23:40.000]  But the corporate media lies to you and says Jones's channel was also taken down for showing the massacre. That's what injured get. How do you even say the name of the site?
[23:40.000 --> 23:55.000]  I know it's a big site. I can never read it right. I'm so ignorant. And it says here that I also showed the massacre. No, we didn't. We showed what the news showed him getting out of the car.
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  Blurred video, but oh CNN can show it. We can't show it.
[24:03.000 --> 24:25.000]  It's absolutely outrageous that they do this type of crap. But you hear this woman who scores all the big interviews with big tech. She's the darling. And they're talking about how they're going to keep their kids from watching popular nationalist right wingers and others.
[24:25.000 --> 24:35.000]  And you hear the disconnect and the arrogance as if she'll ever be successful. You suppress something. You only make it hotter. Let's go back to Mark Dice's report.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  I can't wait to hear.
[24:38.000 --> 24:48.000]  My son, who's 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos and he's like the gateway drug to the next group. And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.000]  And then it goes down and in three clicks he was at neo-nazi stuff. It was like astonishing. And then I had to listen to it at dinner. And I was sort of like, I'm going to kill Susan Majiski first.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Okay, well, here I am.
[25:00.000 --> 25:19.000]  I was sort of like, I was sort of like, is there anything like, it feels like, as I said, I think you've heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire, garbage, street signs and stuff like that.
[25:19.000 --> 25:32.000]  And again, the internet was millions of sites and you surfed the web and it was beautiful. Then big tech got together with these conglomerates to build their own contained systems so they can control you. They get you on YouTube.
[25:32.000 --> 25:46.000]  They get you on Facebook and Twitter and then they start the tyranny. We built all these sites. People's content built them. Without us, you're nothing. But it's this elitist attitude that we're lucky to even be on their platforms.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  You see how that works? Let's continue.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  Fine. The Nazi stuff are probably clips of Tucker Carlson or PewDiePie.
[25:53.000 --> 26:05.000]  And then I've got like this kid who's like, well, Ben Shapiro is sort of smart. I'm like, no, he's not. No, he's not. He's clever, but he's an idiot. And anyway, it's just like, it's exhausting, but it has like a huge effect on them.
[26:05.000 --> 26:16.000]  Do you feel like the people on a bigger thing, and it's not your total responsibility, Susan, but it's, do you feel like the people that's living on may have a sense of this, of the impact they have?
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  So getting to your son is lost.
[26:19.000 --> 26:27.000]  No, we can work on your son here. I have a son too, and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table.
[26:27.000 --> 26:42.000]  She just said that her 13-year-old son was lost because he's not a social justice warrior, and he's looking up conservative videos on YouTube and maybe looking at Jordan Peterson as a father figure because he's being raised by two lesbians.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  Maybe the park kids should be put into a foster home consisting of a normal family, you know, a husband and a wife.
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.000]  I think what you're describing is, and the way we think about it too, look, there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines. Ben Shapiro is going to meet the community guidelines.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform. Are you?
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  I would, but I can't. No, no.
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  Okay, okay.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  But no, you know, last time I saw you, I was like, get Alex Jones off that platform, and you're like, well, the community guidelines, and then you got him.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  You know, he's on the platform.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  I know, so I was right, but that's, that's.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  Get him off.
[27:15.000 --> 27:22.000]  She literally said if it was up to her, she would ban Ben Shapiro for the same reasons that she wanted Alex Jones banned.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  Now, I am no fan of Ben Shapiro. I know that a lot of you guys are.
[27:26.000 --> 27:39.000]  I just can't trust a guy who basically endorsed Hillary Clinton by default shortly before the 2016 election by announcing that he would never vote for Donald Trump and said that if Trump wins that he will never point conservatives to the Supreme Court.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  There's a whole bunch of reasons why I don't like neocon ban.
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.000]  Trump's three biggest crowds are evangelicals, conservatives, and he's a winner voters.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Trump is lying to all of them.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  Stop buying the lies because as entertaining as Donald Trump is, Donald Trump is a liar.
[27:55.000 --> 28:04.000]  And don't even get me started about him supporting Michelle Fields' hoax about getting assaulted and almost thrown to the ground by Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  He's about his Republican establishment as you can get.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  He's neocon to the core.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  He has billionaire backers who built his entire career.
[28:13.000 --> 28:26.000]  But because he has such a following amongst college kids, Kara Swisher sees him as the new Alex Jones who needs to be censored from the internet because he says such controversial things like there are only two genders.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  That is considered to be hate speech by the liberals today.
[28:29.000 --> 28:38.000]  And there was a gamer on Twitch who was reportedly banned for saying that on one of her live streams.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  And as you know, I was briefly suspended and locked out of my Twitter account for tweeting that.
[28:41.000 --> 28:49.000]  Since basically breathing is a violation of the terms of service of these big tech companies, tactically think has violated their policy.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  All right, great job.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Mark Dice, Full Report, infowars.com, newswars.com, markdice.com.

[31:00.000 --> 31:10.000]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-western speech all across the world.
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.000]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be the platform.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  Then they set the precedent.
[31:18.000 --> 31:24.000]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert, they take you off the internet.
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  Now Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[31:35.000 --> 31:43.000]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist,
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  who literally think they own and run our lives.
[31:46.000 --> 31:52.000]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[31:55.000 --> 32:24.000]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks.

[33:26.000 --> 33:54.000]  All right, I'm going to get into this extremely powerful counter-think episode that Mike Adams put together for InfoWare.
[33:54.000 --> 34:04.000]  Every Sunday after my Sunday live show ends, 4 to 6 p.m. at 6 p.m. Central, counter-think is a hard-hitting hour that he works a lot on.
[34:04.000 --> 34:13.000]  And sometimes the productions like HBO or something, other times it's just like this, clips and videos and radio put to television.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  But when I got off the air, I was in my office going over some notes.
[34:17.000 --> 34:26.000]  And there was a TV in there, and I turned it on as I routinely do. And it was a particularly powerful counter-think that you can find at Brighton.com.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  I'm going to ask the crew, obviously, to take this full episode. I think they already do that anyways.
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.000]  And upload it to the front page of InfoWare.com because it's powerful.
[34:37.000 --> 34:47.000]  And it deals with the lunacy of the left and how the craziest amongst them in the corporations, in the universities, and in the businesses becomes the leader.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  And then they get replaced by somebody even more extreme, and it's what happened to Islam.
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  And it's what happened to Christianity during the Dark Ages, where it just gets absolutely out of control.
[34:58.000 --> 35:08.000]  You'd catch a woman in the Middle Ages keeping some herbs or something that she knew kept her baby alive during the winter.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  And they'd say, you're a witch, and they'd kill your ass.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  So that's how this stuff works, where knowledge is evil and knowledge is bad.
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  And that's what the left's saying about language and communication and that there's two genders.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  And people say, well, why am I obsessed with this? Because they're obsessed with it.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  And that they can make us accept that there are 50 genders.
[35:29.000 --> 35:37.000]  And that they can make us accept that a full grown man can identify as a child and then come date your five-year-old son or daughter.
[35:37.000 --> 35:45.000]  Or if they can let convicted sex offenders come to your school and tell your kids that they should be a tranny for career day,
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  that's incredibly abusive and insane and takes advantage of our open free society.
[35:52.000 --> 36:00.000]  And notice the left is what wants to end the open free society that's tolerant and make us accept their cultural death.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  But there are a bunch of followers led by a bunch of cult leaders. It's very, very dangerous.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  We're going to go to that just just five, six minutes of the hour report here in just a little while.
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  We're going to post the full video to the front page of newswars.com and infowars.com.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  I'm going to say this again.
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  We're in a total war against the globalist and we're promoting things that work and are popular and are historical.
[36:24.000 --> 36:32.000]  We're promoting why everybody wanted to come to the U.S. back when we actually tried to follow those great ideas, the American ethos.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  And so I'm not inventing any of this. I'm just trying to bring it back in the 21st century.
[36:37.000 --> 36:45.000]  And guess what? Folks are buying. People want to live in free, prosperous, good countries where we are tolerant,
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  but we recognize what is superior, the family, men being men, women being women, savings, religious freedom, sovereignty,
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  honoring truthful people, real community.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  And the globalists are threatened by that because they can't compete with it.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  They want society that's falling apart.
[37:09.000 --> 37:19.000]  Now, we're going to get to this report in a moment. We had a father calling yesterday and he said,
[37:19.000 --> 37:26.000]  hey, are you going to air this video piece that my young son put together promoting your protein bars?
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  I said, I haven't seen it.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  And so he sent it in and here's this report.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  The reason this is so important is when the listeners get active, call into C-SPAN, go to city council and speak out,
[37:39.000 --> 37:48.000]  go to the PTA, write a book, create a website, send an email, call Congress, make a fan-based promo video for InfoWars.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  When you do that, it changes the world. That's where the real power is, is at the grassroots.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  So we salute this young man. Here's the video.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  You want to know how good this stuff is?
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  What's a call, you may ask? It's called the InfoWars protein bar.
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  Now, you might be wondering, what does it taste like? It's not a protein bar.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  It's legit chocolate brownie with chocolate. It's so delicious, it doesn't even taste like a protein bar.
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.000]  An adorable young man. That's Prince Franks and he put together that little promo video.
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.000]  And by the way, we're selling out of the protein bars and so we had to end the 50% off on those.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  Everything else is 50% off. We're about to have to end the turbo force. I think we just did because that's selling out.
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.000]  Everything else is still in somewhat of abundance. The fish oil is getting close to selling out.
[38:41.000 --> 38:50.000]  Store-wide free shipping, 50% off. But we went to, again, three of the top organic manufacturers of protein bars about a year and a half ago.
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.000]  It took over a year to get this done. We said we wanted organic, we wanted high quality and we don't want any filler.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  And they came back and they said, well, nobody out there does not put filler in it.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  It's because people are used to something that has some filler.
[39:06.000 --> 39:13.000]  And this is the equivalent of a $5, $6, $7 bar for $3. When you get it discounted, it's $1.50.
[39:13.000 --> 39:21.000]  Wouldn't special we had. And it comes in boxes of 12. And I'll be honest with you.
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  It takes a while to eat one of these. It's unlike any other protein bar you've ever had because there is no filler.
[39:29.000 --> 39:38.000]  It tastes really good, by the way. But then I got why the developers are like, you sure you don't want to add some wheat or add a little bit of cornstarch
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  or add some of those things in there? Because people aren't used to something being this solid.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  You've never eaten fudge this solid. You've never eaten toffee is easier to eat than this.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  It's not a bad thing. But they taste incredibly good.
[39:54.000 --> 40:03.000]  But I was driving when we were developing them and the final edition came in and I was driving to Fredericksburg and it's an hour and a half drive.
[40:03.000 --> 40:15.000]  It took me with a big old bottle of water 30 minutes to eat one little bar because there's no fillers. It's solid.
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.000]  Now you can bite into it easily. But you're going to be like, what in the world's going on here?
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  But here I am plugging something that's sold out basically so it doesn't matter.
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  We have store-wide free shipping, infowarstore.com. Everything has been abundant except the protein bars and turbo force.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  Those have been taken off the sale, at least they were supposed to be.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  And we've got BrainForce Plus, the great Neutropic. It's going to end up selling out in the next few weeks.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  So I'll have to pull that special in about four or five days.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  The other great products are selling out as well are the fish oils.
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  The honor roll that's a spectrum of the oils that are great for the brain particularly.
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  They're great for children, great for adults, but it's smaller capsules for children.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  It's the very best you're going to find out there.
[41:03.000 --> 41:10.000]  Then you've got the wild harvested salmon fjord oil. It's excellent for adults.
[41:10.000 --> 41:17.000]  And then you have the krill oil. And again, they're like, okay, you don't want it basically boiled.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  You don't want it denatured. You don't want it, you want it raw except for the extraction process that takes the mercury out.
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.000]  And I said, yeah. And so I'll tell you, the krill oil is the strongest stuff you've ever been around.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  But I'll tell you, you better eat it with some food.
[41:30.000 --> 41:37.000]  You don't get the burpees with the honor roll and the fish oil, ultimate fish oil.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  But the krill oil is dynamite and it's strong.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  And there's nothing better than krill oil for your brain and for your heart, your arteries.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's just what we're made out of. And it's electrochemical. It's just magic.
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.000]  I get more energy off the krill oil than I do off turbo force because that's what it does in the brain.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  It was my dad like a decade ago. He goes, you know, you're staying up late and stuff.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  I know, you know, you're drinking wine to stay up because that has the opposite effect with me.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  Coffee doesn't work in the afternoon or at night.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  So that's why I started drinking more over the years was what I'd work all night on overnight shows and things.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  I wouldn't drink to excess, but about glass of wine every hour would keep me up.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  It's a stimulant for me. And my dad said, why don't you take fish oil?
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.000]  He gave me a bottle and I was like, whoa, I pop two big old fish oils and it's like a lot of energy.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  You've got to experience it and no one advertises fish oil for that.
[42:28.000 --> 42:35.000]  But that's really what it does. Well, the krill, the krill is just, I've never experienced anything like it.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  The brain boost I get. Everybody's physiology is different, but it's about to sell out.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  Store-wide free shipping. And of course, 50% off and all the supplements about some other big specials.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Double Patriot points. I forgot to tell you that.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  Double Patriot points. Double Patriot points.
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  That's 10% off on your next order and free shipping when you sign up for AutoShip in FullWareStore.com.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  Okay, the big report with Mike Adams coming up.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  I've got some really good news though.
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  X2 is back. The original X2.
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.000]  Deep breath crystal. Pure atomic iodine. What you want in FullWareStore.com.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  It'll be here in a week. Manufactured in the U.S. in FullWareStore.com with the best iodine in the world.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  X2, it's available. I thought X3 is great. We still got another deep breath crystal source,
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  but I thought add the other two types of iodine. The scientists said do that.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  It sold a lot that people want original X2.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  We now have X2 again at FullWareStore.com, so hallelujah.
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company,
[43:39.000 --> 43:46.000]  the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  We want a pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy. Learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  Learn about how the other iodines are bound.

[43:59.000 --> 44:04.000]  We all know the importance of fish oils. While we are sure to provide them for ourselves,
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  by buying the great products at InfowarsStore.com, by spreading the articles,
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[46:56.000 --> 47:25.000]  You are the Infowark and I salute you.
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  And all you do is pray for their prosperity.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  The ministry of fear, the moment you live.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  The ministry of peace, the death forgive, the word you will.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  Hinerines have noticed throughout history that they can oppress populations
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  for a certain amount of time but then there's always resistance that builds
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  and the elite ends up getting overthrown.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  But if they could have a final revolution against the family
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  and against mothers and fathers and the sexes itself
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  and end mammalian interaction,
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  they could scientifically conquer us like Monsanto has produced the Terminator seed
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  where it doesn't produce more seeds that produce more crops,
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  you've got to go back to Monsanto that brought you Roundup
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  that's been proven to give you cancer by design and sterilize you.
[48:23.000 --> 48:29.000]  This is all part of a planetary control operation and they admit all this.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  That's what's so frustrating.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  This is the Carni Endowment's system.
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  They were charged over 100 years ago with a plan to end World War after World War I.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  They developed a world government plan,
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  but they said we have to end the human condition as it's known to create peace.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  Again, per Palpatine says in episode three,
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  now that the Jedi have been eliminated, we will have peace.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  But he means the peace of total tyranny.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  So when you think about it, it's a hardcore scientific plan, isn't it?
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  And they've done it to a great extent.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  And it leads into something very nightmarish.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  So here's part of Counterthink, the lunacy of the left by design
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  by Mike Adams is posted on Infowars.com right now. Here it is.
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  And what's really amazing is that I ran track as a male.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  I know it's shocking, right?
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  Because today, so many males in high schools, they pretend to be girls
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  and then they compete on the girls' track team, don't they?
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  And then they win, oh, they win all these medals and all these trophies
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  and then they get celebrated.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  So much applause.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  Oh my God, you're so courageous and you're such an amazing athlete.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  No, that's a guy.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  That's a guy running, that's a guy with long hair.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  Running with the women, winning all the women's trophies,
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.000]  beating all the women's track high school times and records and everything.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  This is insanity today.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  When I went to high school, which admittedly was a while ago,
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  I mean, it was back in the 1980s.
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  And when I went to high school, you know, boys ran on the boys' track team
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  and girls ran on the girls' track team.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  And if I had tried to say something insane like,
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  I'm going to pretend to be a girl and just win all the girls' track team records,
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  they would have thrown me off the team.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  They would have given me an atomic wedgie.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  They would have called me a fag or something.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  They would have beat me.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  I mean, are you insane?
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  The coaches would laugh you off the team.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  You'd be the laughing stock of the entire school.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Oh my God, look at this guy.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  He thinks he wants to win the girl trophies.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  What, he can't compete with guys?
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  Well, you can't run against your own gender?
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  No, you got to pretend to be a girl.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  What kind of person are you?
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  A cheater is what you'd be called.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  And the reason I bring this up is not to turn this into a comedy session,
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  but to say that biological males who declare themselves to be transgenders
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  and who are competing in women's sports today, they are cheaters.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  They are cheating.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  The reason we have men's sports and women's sports
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  is because men and women are biologically different.
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  And even that fact, that self-evident fact,
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  that men and women are biologically different,
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  now, leftists, liberals say that that's not true.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  They say there are no biological differences.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  Well then, why do you have women's sports at all?
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  Why not just have any gender sports?
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.000]  I mean, why have women's basketball, women's football, women's track, women's skiing,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  all that stuff?
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  Did you know even the Olympics now recently announced that biological men
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  can pretend to be women and compete against women in the Olympics?
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  And they don't even need to undergo gender reassignment surgery anymore.
[52:33.000 --> 52:39.000]  You can have your man junk and you can walk in there with a beard
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  and full of body hair, you know, built like a man physique,
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  a male physique strong, upper body, super athletic,
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  and you can just say, today I'm a woman, you know,
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  and then you just break all the records.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  Let's stop there right now.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  Get all the gold medals.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  Let's stop.
[52:55.000 --> 53:01.000]  If I as a doxin, they have a weenie dog run down in San Marcos every year.
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  I've been to it.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  It's totally hilarious.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  Maybe pull up the San Marcos weenie dog run.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  Why not just have a human on their hands and knees?
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  That's actually a whole movement or where you think you're blind.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  So you have your eyes removed and then the taxpayers have to pay for it
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  or they dump Drano in your eyes.
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  So really men who want to compete as women should be in the Special Olympics
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  because they're mentally ill.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  And then we're all mentally ill under Mass Stockholm syndrome
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  or I guess you'd call it the Impers New Clothes syndrome
[53:31.000 --> 53:36.000]  where you've got men competing with women
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  and you've got hemaphrodites already in the Olympics
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  that keep winning the women's races.
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  You understand because there's cash money and prizes,
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  you will end up having no women in women's sports.
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  You will have nothing but men saying they're women in women's sports.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  Now obviously for a TV viewer, that is an Italian polevolter.
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  I haven't just run into that this morning
[53:57.000 --> 54:03.000]  and just a beautiful female form, very graceful, so beautiful and amazing.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  That's a woman.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  But now they have men that are about to enter the Olympics as polevolters
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  and I'm not going to torture you with having to watch that.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  But these are big, strong men.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  They're winning all the cycling tournaments.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  They're winning all the major races in Texas, in Connecticut.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  And imagine your daughter has been in, what is it, swimming?
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  Or your daughter has been in track and now she gets into junior high
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  or high school and there's a dude?
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Oh, and I forgot the better part.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  He's in the dressing rooms with you.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  You know, Japan passed a law this year.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  They said you can say you're a man who's now a woman
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  but you have to have surgery and have your testicles removed
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  and I totally agree.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  At least go partway there.
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  Take the hormones, have your genitals cut off and I'm not saying do that
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  and then maybe we'll let you in the women's dressing room.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  I mean, you put some skin in the game.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  You put your huevos on the chopping block.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  But no.
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, every sport is already now being dominated
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  by biological men.
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.000]  And oh, Lance Armstrong's bad when all the top people were blood doping.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  All the top people were taking growth hormone testosterone.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  He was just doing it better than they were.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  And I'm not defending Lance Armstrong.
[55:22.000 --> 55:31.000]  The point is, is that Lance Armstrong's cheating, trying to be more male?
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  He's saving bags of blood and then putting them back into his body
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  a month later when he's grown new blood cells.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  So he's supercharged.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  I mean, he's cheating.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I don't ever want to hear Lance Armstrong cheated
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  or anybody else cheated the Olympics
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  because they let this type of thing happen.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  Look at the NBC headline.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  Trans athletes make great gains, yet resentment still flares.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  What?
[55:57.000 --> 56:07.000]  So men move in to the space and then they do all this.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  They dominate it.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  Men say they're women and then they win the powerlifting against women.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  When these men couldn't even place up against other men.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  So all these sports are doing is like the NFL,
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  ruining itself with 40% down in viewers with all political correctness
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  the last three years or Hollywood's way down.
[56:26.000 --> 56:34.000]  Just all these famous sports that go back to ancient Greece 2,500 years ago.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  They're all being ruined.
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  They're all being torched.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  They're all being destroyed.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Let me tell you something.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  People aren't going to go watch women's basketball when half of them are dudes.
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  They aren't good enough to play in the men's leagues.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  People aren't going to go watch women's baseball teams when they're dudes.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  So go ahead.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  Destroy yourselves.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Force fetish your mass mental illness.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  It's crazy.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  All right.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Here's what's coming up today.
[57:00.000 --> 57:07.000]  Laura Loomer, she's helped launch the whole hashtag movement that is Stop the Bias
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  and the president's signing on to that.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  Millie Weaver is going to be joining us as well.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  Robert Barnes on.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  We guys pull me yesterday's stack.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  I forgot to get the noon as lawsuit stuff in here.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  His $250 million lawsuit.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  What?
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  What?
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  All the top lawyers on this front thinks about that.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  That's all coming up as well.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  Please don't forget.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  If you don't spread the articles in the videos, if you don't tell people about the show and
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  say, hey, you hear it's off the air, it's not.
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.000]  You get the forbidden show at info wars.com forward slash show or news wars.com.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  That's how we beat them.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  And it just makes the globalist show angry and you're doing it.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  We're still surviving and actually growing in some ways.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  Thanks to you.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  So keep it up.
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  We're going to win, but it's all in your hands.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  Getting your protein has never been easier with info wars life protein bars available

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  big fat sweaty men and their ding dongs flopping around but again I'm the person who believes

[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  feels the title force of liberty rising to the central Texas command center in the heart
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  of the resistance you're listening to alex jones you know I'm not just about complaining
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  about problems I'm about action and we've seen all these former top olympic female swimmers
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  and all these former top tennis players and basketball players saying this is insane to
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  have biological men who have double the muscle mass all the rest of this in our sports it
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  be like having men compete in the MMA ultimate fighting championship or UFC against women
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  it's a joke it'd be like if somebody in the super heavyweight class that weighs 250 pounds
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  says I identify as a featherweight or as a lightweight or as a Walter weight and then
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  imagine Mike Tyson in his prime 230 pounds climbs into the ring it's 1989 Mike Tyson swinging
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  fish Mike Tyson swinging elbows nobody can stand in his way he's a wrecking crew taking
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  all the pain of his childhood and pouring it out on you guys that weigh 40 pounds more
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  than him heavyweight champions can't stand in his way and saying I'm Mike Tyson my voice
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  is kind of high I identify as a featherweight or as a Walter weight who's the champion lightweight
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  I don't really follow boxing that much the black guy that likes to wear Louis Vuitton
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  stuff Floyd Mayweather yeah let's put him in a time machine and let's send him 30 years
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  back in the past and he could be in his prime too and Mike Tyson goes I identify as a lightweight
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Mike Tyson would destroy him in 30 seconds and you'd say well that's cheating he outweighs
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  him by 100 pounds get him out of the ring but then men with shoulders way wider big muscles
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and more blood mass and testosterone and a big old Johnson between their legs they get
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  out on that bicycle they get out in that water for that swim race they get out in that track
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  race they're now in football and sprints and everything and dominate and they go hey these
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  guys are incredible because they don't want to compete against other women it's all a mind
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  game it's all mind control so what's the solution to this women and girls and families if they
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  put a so-called transgender person in your locker room on the field with you that's a
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  walk away you have all the power they're going to ruin your sports anyways they already are
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  walk away from the whole sport it's not real two plus two equals four there are men and
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  there are women if somebody wants to have a sex change somebody wants to gouge your eyeballs
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  out because you've got trans able now that's your deal I'm not paying for your lunatic asylum
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  I'm not paying for you when you're homeless on the side of the road you want to go gouge
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  out go starve to death you're a mental patient but this is all an assault by the disease
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  minds of San Francisco and Silicon Valley and the universities and it's over so just
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  like the NFL lost 40% of its viewers last three years badmouthing America and all the
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  rest is crap just keep it up because all these sports are ruined nobody's going to put their
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  daughter in there to go do swim practice every day or go do track every day and then have
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  some dude show up and win every race it's a fraud way beyond Mike Tyson in the ring with
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  Floyd Waymother and everybody knows it hell should I show up at little league you know
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  soccer game against eight-year-old girls and say I'm an eight-year-old girl a little bow in
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  my hair kicking girls aside kicking goals every time people would laugh fathers would walk
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  over and kick my ass but as long as it's liberal it's okay to abuse our daughters
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  and the feminists love it we'll be right back
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:37.200]  and
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.000]  with it's broad spectrum contaminant reduction you'll only need this one filter for clean

[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:17.640]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:43.820]  I'm Alex Jones your host we're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:50.080]  coming up tomorrow we kick it off at David night at 8 a.m. right through Saturday at 10 a.m. 50 hour
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:56.960]  global transmission to hashtag stop the bias against conservatives nationalist Christians
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.560]  conservatives you name it classical liberals all being banned off the major platform Trump now
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:08.440]  says he may take action under pressure it's a big banner at the top of info wars.com news wars.com
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:15.320]  defend the First Amendment stop big tech censorship stop the bias we have a bunch of special guests
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:21.760]  including Robert Barnes gonna be popping in Tommy Robinson Laura Loomer and so many others this
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.920]  is gonna be a very special transmission and when you get excited about it a lot of these
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.800]  trans special transmissions we do outside of the main show get a couple hundred thousand viewers
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.840]  that's great that's a huge double sports stadium but when you get excited and share the link to
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:43.400]  m4s.com for its last show when you tell folks hey the the the forbidden is on and people are
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:50.600]  watching it and that chain reaction happens we had a state of the union well Trump's first state
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.560]  of the union we have like five million people watch it that night and the streams throughout
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.720]  the evening we had another off-year election thing had about four million and that's how we
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.040]  reach the new people that's how we get past the censors that's how we move the ball down the field
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.840]  because again you're awake you know what's going on but we're reaching new people this is an
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.760]  information war and we're having big victories on a planetary scale but a lot of lawsuits are
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.560]  getting filed countering the left censorship and what's happening but a lot of my think I'm a lawyer
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.680]  are going in the wrong direction I think it's about collusion racketeering unfair trade practices
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.000]  monopolistic things they're always going into free speech or defamation we'll talk to Robert Barnes
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.520]  who's an established and respected lawyer on these fronts here in just a moment he also represents
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.800]  me and a lot of the matters we've got going but I wanted to play President Trump responding to the
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:50.720]  whole wish on the latest here it is gets appointed by a deputy he writes a report you know never
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.640]  figured that one out man gets appointed by a deputy he writes a report I had the greatest electoral
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:03.680]  victory one of them the history of our country tremendous success tens of millions of voters
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.400]  and now somebody's going to write a report who never got a vote so we'll see what the report says
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:19.520]  let's see if it's fair I have no idea when it's going to be released no no we're in Syria we're
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:27.200]  leaving 200 people there at 200 people in another place in Syria closer to Israel for a period of
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:35.760]  time I brought this out for you because this is a map of everything in the red this was on election
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:45.600]  night in 2016 everything red is ISIS when I took it over was a mess now on the bottom that's the
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:55.360]  exact same there is no red in fact there's actually a tiny spot which will be gone by tonight so that's
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:05.200]  ISIS red right there and the bottom one is how it is today this just came out 20 minutes ago so this
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:14.560]  is ISIS or an election day my election day and this is ISIS now so that's the way it goes
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.880]  oh that's good we're gonna get our guest but I want to play both those are both important points
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:27.840]  both those statements think about this I've been begging Trump since he got elected to do weekly
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:36.480]  fireside chats literally in the Oval Office like Roosevelt did but with a fire going he talks about
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.280]  30 minutes shows some graphs like Ross Perot people love that and then he has a guest
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.200]  and maybe it's a veteran maybe it's a farmer maybe it's a member of congress maybe it's a democrat
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.040]  and it's just an hour long program commercial free once a week he would dominate it with graphs
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.600]  but instead of him out there with an overblown and you know the light not showing it because the sign
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:04.320]  he'd have it controlled with either a television set or with a powerpoint he could do that is the
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.000]  answer do it for heaven's sakes everyone would tune in and have 20 million viewers 30 million
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.200]  viewers live you would have tens of millions after and it would it would it would really change things
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.560]  so I've been telling the president I've told him personally use graphs you do what Ross Perot did
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:26.560]  that is the final equation for you if you'll just do that and by the way I built the new studio
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.520]  so I could start doing special reports and graphs and presentations and we're going to get around
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.440]  to that it's just that they try to keep me off balance with the lawsuits and the attacks and
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.520]  the family stuff so that I'm not engaged in production but we're still moving forward thanks
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:47.040]  to all your prayers now bringing Robert Barnes on with us he's an established constitutional lawyer
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.920]  free speech lawyer but he's also a famous civil rights lawyer and and many other things and he's
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:57.520]  the chief strategist as we fight the deep state and their attempts to shut us down and and those
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:02.640]  admissions I wanted to get him on yesterday but I was unable but he's almost today talk about noon
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.520]  as is $250 million lawsuit and I know he's probably had a chance to look at that I've read over it
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.400]  and I'm gonna reserve judgment on it but I I think we're going in the right direction at least
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  where the left wants to launch all these anti-free speech things when they're a bunch of hypocrites
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.840]  but they're in glass houses and I think this is starting to change their minds Barnes's lawsuits
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.160]  other lawsuits with the Covington kids and it's really starting to cause a debate there about
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:32.000]  the litigious nature of the left but what is your first approximation of noon as is a big lawsuit
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.200]  against twitter I'm glad he's doing it I wish he would have maybe done it maybe a year or two ago
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.600]  and I wish that they would have done more when they were in control of the house
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.200]  so I think those aspects you know the but with that said it's better just to bring an action than
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.480]  not bring an action and the fact that it's someone of his high profile the utility it provides is
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.520]  that either the court system will start to provide real remedy enforce the first amendment principles
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.800]  when a big corporation effectively monopolizes the public square and decides who gets in that
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.720]  public square and who does not get in that public square or if the court systems are closed it reinforces
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:14.480]  to everybody in congress they need to change the laws not allow special immunity for big tech
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.840]  that big tech has now proven particularly in your case the in the way it that it will not be
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:25.440]  honest and honorable in following its role as a purely as a platform there's a platform is
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.000]  just like somebody who hosts a convention center venue that's how they got special immunity because
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.080]  they said they were never going to be a publisher never going to be censoring people never going
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.320]  to be editing people jacket twitter said don't worry we're going to be the free speech wing
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.840]  of the free speech party use that to get a contractual advantage and a competitive advantage
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.760]  at the time and now that they have it they're trying to monopolize it for the ideological left
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.160]  and in particular they're scared of the most powerful most influential most significant
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.520]  independent political voices like those at info wars and that's why you are the primary target
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.760]  so your case proved we cannot trust big tech to control and be the gatekeeper of the public square
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.320]  and so it's good in that context that newness is taking action because either it will flush out
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.400]  whether the court system will meaningfully enforce the first amendment when a big private
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.160]  company monopolizes the public square or the congress needs to take action that's right i'm
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.000]  not the expert lawyer like you but reading over his statements and part of the suit i had time to
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.800]  read i can read the whole thing he's saying you don't give us access to counter than you let them
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.080]  attack and you let him attack my mother my family and tell these lies while you're saying that you're
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.600]  this open and free group which you're not i'm going to get discovery i'm going to show what
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.920]  you're doing discovery we have project veritas and all these undercover videos of twitter facebook
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.320]  google we have their head people at events saying we're going to shut down alex jones i
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.400]  there's a new video out of cara swisher you know he's married to megan smith who runs the whole
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.520]  internet situation and set this up third chief technology officer of the united states saying
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.560]  we called for jones and took him down now we want men's Shapiro these people admit they're
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.920]  involved in a jihad to take people down and then later till congress like sergeant schultz i know
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:12.320]  nothing nothing precisely so there's clearly a coordinated campaign everybody knows it everybody
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.640]  recognizes it the joe rogan podcast that had a temple on it and jack from twitter and and their
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:23.840]  twitter's lawyer couldn't answer basic questions couldn't explain basic pieces of information
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.240]  came up with storylines that just don't fit anybody that's on twitter has seen some of the
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.680]  extreme actions the left has taken and as an example twitter and the other social media giants

[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:09.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:21.840]  and
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.320]  the left talks about how they want to censor everything because of dehumanization
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.280]  but then twitter facebook google they all work with pakistan you name it to round up political
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.240]  dissidents and execute them they helped china especially google and apple surveilled their
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:44.160]  own people and restrict even the the president of taiwan saying they exist and so now they've gone
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:49.680]  from oh alex jones violated our rules to just know we don't want him or anybody like him on the
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:55.200]  platforms uh anymore and you know nuna's and others should have as you said taken action
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:01.280]  two years ago when they had all the cards that trifecta what do you think trump should do because
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:06.720]  he's put out some emails he's put out some tweets saying a hashtag stop the bias that's
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.480]  laura lumars he's on next hour and he said okay we may have to do something now well just a week
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:17.440]  and a half ago he said well this is just how it is you have to behave yourself better than democrats
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.240]  or you'll get banned well now they want ben Shapiro banned now they've demonetized him i mean i mean
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.680]  they're doing this to everybody uh even though ben Shapiro is a never trump or don't they understand
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:32.800]  that when you let censorship happen it always becomes a total takeover and then whoever is
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:39.120]  in power basically almost always nepotistically puts their kids or their girlfriend you know in
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.600]  charge of positions when you let people control the public discourse they're always going to
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:50.240]  dominate and abuse it precisely and so particularly here he's on the right course strategically he
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.240]  just needs to take official action and remind himself that he's the president of the united
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.880]  states so he recently tweeted out about saturday night live about how really aren't they sort
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.120]  of violating election laws given they're using the public airwaves to propagandize for a particular
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.920]  party well that's precisely what big tech is doing and a much more frightening scale than a
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.240]  late night comedy show that has diminishing ratings so what he needs to do is appoint a special
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.240]  council appoint someone who's a lefty free speech person to that position and have them do a full
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.600]  scale wholesale investigation of big tech as to whether or not big tech is manipulating elections
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:29.680]  look at the alabama 2017 election look at the 2018 um midterm elections look at what they're
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.160]  doing in terms of manipulate because when they are censoring voices selectively censoring voices
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.800]  with a partisan and political agenda arguably they're making an in-kind campaign donation to the
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:44.400]  democratic party that's unreported and undisclosed so what should happen is use their political
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:49.280]  bias where their political bias is most legally problematic is in the way it impacts elections
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.760]  and public speech for a particular partisan end and go after them and and and what you should do
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:59.840]  is combine it with going after those fake charities like southern poverty law center that just had
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.400]  to fire its boss because of its history of its history of problematic behavior that are in in
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:10.240]  cahoots and colluding with the big tech giants to politically and socially censor their ideological
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.840]  adversaries and if he takes that step then then well big tech will learn they better behave better
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.440]  because if they don't they won't be able to manipulate the 2020 election like they plan on
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.920]  doing and they're gonna have to start reconsidering all of their options and how they strategically
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.960]  you just go back to being a platform no longer be a publisher no longer claim censoring controls
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.760]  no longer claim editorial controls no longer do any of that impose the first amendment rights as
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:37.680]  part of their terms of service by the way let me raise that because the new york times said oh this
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.560]  will go nowhere they have section 230 but but twitter and others have abandoned section 230 so i'm
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.520]  not saying it ready to 30 it's a great thing i don't think you are but you can't jump back and forth
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.680]  and basically say it exists but it doesn't exist so i think if we go after 230 they're
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:59.120]  going to have to sue for peace precisely i mean the goal is section 230 should be reinterpreted
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:04.800]  and reconstructed to be consistent with first amendment principles so that or if it very simple
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.720]  if they want to be a publisher they have two choices either stay a platform don't become a
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:14.240]  publisher and in that instance you can keep section 230 immunity entirely like most tech sites
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:19.200]  that are out there or if you want to have the privileges of a publisher then you have the
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.560]  obligations of the first amendment once you reach a monopoly size square the my view is that there's
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.840]  i don't have a problem with small publishers that have tech platforms uh choosing who they
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:35.520]  want to have on there the problem is when somebody reaches monopoly power when they have more than 75
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:41.120]  to 80 yeah when google got 93 percent of global searches and they're fixing results and lying to
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:45.280]  congress about it while putting out prospectus reports admitting they're fixing results
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.320]  precisely so i mean the old doctrine used to be established here in the u.s supreme court
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.960]  determined it many years ago and california has expanded it and what's called a prune or a doctrine
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.760]  but the point is that if you are a private company and you have the privilege of a public monopoly
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.920]  because of something whether it's an immunity law whether it's the way it sort of evolved
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.000]  technologically or for other reasons like the company towns that used to run the coal mining
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.440]  towns and throughout the small parts of the south and the and the appalachia if you achieve that power
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.800]  then you are accepting the obligations of the first amendment as it applies to the public square
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.120]  or you can simply forfeit that monopoly power nobody requires you to be a monopoly over the
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.720]  public square but once you choose to be a monopoly over a public square then you need to abide by
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.160]  first amendment standards if you want to continue to have section 230 immunity and that's a simple
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.720]  legal solution for them to have and it's the legal solution they'll reach if they realize the president
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.880]  of the united states is going to start having a special council that's even on the left so they
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.760]  can't even claim it's partisan but simply someone committed to free speech committed to the public
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.920]  square committed to public debate committed to free and open elections and that's what's in that's
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.120]  what's at risk that's what's been being threatened here the uh if trump doesn't get ahead of this
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.600]  if trump doesn't have institutional the the big tech knowing that they're being watched and monitored
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.160]  and surveilled like they watch and monitor he's totally greenlighting even worse behavior which
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:12.240]  which is which is just crazy let me ask you this well if you heard it but but mpr this weekend
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.960]  had a whole nother show with some of the sandy hook family saying he's sending people to our houses
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.320]  please just stop alex because that sounds really good like please stop leave us alone don't come
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.760]  to our houses quit saying our kids didn't die but i'm not saying any of that i've never seen
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:32.880]  people their houses i mean at a certain point what do i do when they're saying i'm saying things
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.200]  in and and then they're speaking for me i mean it's next level they're saying it's this big
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.840]  suitable evil offense and then they're the one saying it but saying i said it what do i do about
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.560]  that i mean at some point i think what what's happening is you have a lot of institutional
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.960]  members of the big press you have people that are connected to them within the so-called
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:59.600]  journalistic community who simply want to be the use the use the legal system use lawfare
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.280]  to achieve what big tech is doing shut down silent dissident independent small press voices
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.200]  so the freedom of the press is there to protect the little guy not the big guy the new york times
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.600]  doesn't need any special protection it's the it's the independent citizen journalists it's the
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.120]  independent dissident uh free minded free press that was that is who the first amendment is all
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.880]  about protecting and they're using lawfare in a discriminant and disparate way to target particular
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.280]  political adversaries uh in order to achieve certain objectives and they're in many cases
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.040]  trying to gin up lawsuits that would not otherwise exist but for their own misrepresentations of
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.160]  what took place in the past and so they're they're doing that combined event and and by doing so
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.600]  they threaten not only the freedom of speech but the freedom of the independent press well
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.600]  sure and then now when it's purely premeditated and people have a chance to face it like the
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.400]  covenant kids now they've opened themselves up by their own yardstick they're going to be in
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:58.160]  way more trouble than i am because they've actually done the things that you say they've done oh precisely
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.960]  i mean uh unlike the cases against you in the covenant case they specifically identified
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.280]  individuals they specifically went after those individuals kathy griffin said please name them
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.560]  please shame them please dox them uh people called for them to be physically assaulted and attacked
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:18.480]  the the false accusations that none of that is even effectively accused uh in the uh in the sandy
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.840]  hook related cases so the so what you see a major gap between the two you see defamation law being
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.240]  used in a discriminant and disparate way against dissident voices for things that do not constitute
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.320]  defamation is a matter of law under the first amendment to the i-states constitution whereas
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:38.160]  you see big media using their superior platform their bigger power their louder voice to go after
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:44.400]  an actually defame and libel and invade the privacy of in this case minor kids from a town

[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.960]  advisors though that give him conflicting ideas and conflicting plans it's very clear what needs
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.920]  to be done with these big tech companies have lied to congress they've been caught doing it
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.720]  they've been colluding they have monopoly status they're involved in election meddling talk about
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:16.720]  the russians that's a red herring a big tech google executives the day hillary lost uh november
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.680]  night they're saying we won't let this happen again on their own internal videos and trump's
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:28.880]  tweeted about that so he knows we have them with the hand in the cookie jar so catching a bank
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.320]  robber walking out with bags of money and a mask on their face i mean you got them but i wanted to
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:42.800]  mention this we're going back to robert barnes seven years ago we had six and a half years ago
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:53.680]  ted cruise and ran paul both newly elected senators come out and say to the world it's wrong to be
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:59.680]  al-qaeda's air force in syria and obama and hillary were funding the era of spring and overthrowing
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:04.880]  our allies putting radical muslims in and so the pentagon went to obama and so we're not going to
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.520]  do this so Assad made a deal that after isis and al-qaeda was was called al-qaeda them and they
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.000]  called it isis to confuse the public when they were removed they would then start the move towards
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.520]  having new elections and Assad would leave now we'll see if he follows the deal the next year
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.000]  but it was the russians who the u.s worked with who went in did 90% of work now the russians
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.040]  have pulled out because we agreed to go finish it so when trump takes credit for this yes obama
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:37.920]  sent isis in with all those new Toyota trucks he gave them all the u.s bases in um western iraq
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.600]  john mccain quarterback the whole thing to invade that's why they were all left alone like here's
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.280]  al-qaeda remember it wasn't isis when they invaded it was al-qaeda six years ago and then all these
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:55.040]  thousands of trucks and these convoys remember those pull up isis convoys entering syria six years
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:59.920]  ago like why don't we bomb them where are the predator drones i mean that whole place is militarized
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:06.240]  because it was obama's invasion force so yeah the russians came in kicked them out of the major
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.960]  cities the u.s came in and mopped it up we said to russia we'll have a full-scale invasion
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.040]  if you act like you're going to take it over so as soon as it looks like you've beaten them we'll
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.520]  come in and finish the mop up and then we'll pull out and then trump did what he said he would do
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:29.680]  and the neocons flipped out so that's what happened and now the last little enclave
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:35.760]  is pinned up against a riverbank and the president's come out with this map showing all this but
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:42.480]  let's give credit where credit's due the evil demon russians came in and did this and then our
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.280]  military finished it but notice russia's getting no thanks for this because you can't because you're
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.480]  a russian agent if you thank russia for standing up against radical islam so here's the president
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:37:02.000]  speaking about it just minutes ago this was on election night in 2016 everything read as isis
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.280]  when i took it over was a mess now on the bottom that's the exact same there is no red
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.200]  fact there's actually a tiny spot which will be gone by tonight president trump touting
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:24.480]  progress against the islamic state a short time ago and the isis uh making its last stand in syria
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.920]  fox news learning that us back forces are set to seize one of the last isis encampments and isis
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:35.120]  fighters are pinned on a riverbank in a last-ditch effort to hold territory our benjamin hall is
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:43.760]  live on the ground inside syria benjamin yeah hi harrison we are now just waiting for that final
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.480]  announcement that the offensive against the caliphate is done but no one wants to guess
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:52.320]  it exactly when that might be and that's because it has been delayed and delayed number of times
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:00.960]  isis have been resilient today we were back inside that village of bahoz hear what we saw we are the
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:06.160]  only news team to have come this far forward into this part of the village the fact is although the
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:13.280]  sdf have recaptured this area it is still believed to be littered with booby traps and ied's that
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:21.280]  may take months if not years to clear the fighters here are battle hardened and they're battle wary
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.280]  and even though there may be a very short time left till the caliphate is gone the census there
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.760]  won't be much celebration the losses have stopped right there yes it's only back in the first
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.240]  amendment where this is going but that's what really happened it's not debatable what i just said
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:40.640]  that's the facts and the west let these people in and then our military said this is really
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:46.080]  immoral and said no and then trump and the russians finished it so it's like you're watching a football
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:52.560]  game and a wide receiver catches 15 passes makes five touchdowns and you give all the credit to
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:59.520]  the quarterback but the russians are like the wide receiver and the offensive line i mean they did
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:06.000]  most of the work and it's just evil to sit here and not say that we didn't have an alliance with
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.120]  russia and we didn't do a good thing with russia and it's sick and i'm not some roosa file but i
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.720]  am a truth a file my north star is the truth and to me it's obscene to not be giving russia any credit
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.000]  robert i know you didn't come on about this where you're back into free speech and i appreciate you
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.080]  holding while i went to that big news but what i mean you're you're a historian i've had a lot of
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.240]  dinners that you hung out you you know a lot about history what's your take on this well there's
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:33.600]  really an integration between the two stories so the reality of what happened in syria as to whether
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.560]  certain chemical weapons attacks did or didn't happen as to the russians participation and
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:44.240]  contribution to the end of the one of the most dangerous threats and regimes and world history
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:50.320]  in terms of what isis was capable of doing and wanted to do and one important point isis's entire
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.120]  political predicate is that they control property and that they control land that they have sovereign
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.800]  control it's an as long as they don't have a state needs land exactly they believe from for their
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.360]  interpretation of their is islamic tradition that if they don't have land they have sovereign control
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.360]  over they no longer exist and no longer matter so that's why it was critical and essential to
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:14.160]  deprive them of that their entire appeal was not unlike al-qaeda and other terrorists they have their
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.280]  own manifest destiny exactly and if they don't have the land they're gone they're done they're
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.240]  finished period so the so that was critical but where the there's an overlap is if you look at
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.640]  how big tech is trying to control and censor the news and you look at how the goal and objective
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:34.160]  such as the cases against you the efforts to uh to completely censor you to completely remove
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.920]  you from any platform people can see you is if you go back to the first Iraqi war so they want
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.280]  only the government approved narrative to come out almost all major wars have been waged based on
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.360]  various public traumas that have occurred some whether they whether they did occur whether
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.520]  they didn't occur others where somebody else may have been the culprit and the goal of the state
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.920]  is to make sure nobody questions that public trauma and the so for example in the case of the
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.440]  incubator baby story from the first iraq war in if if cases like the sandy hook case go forward if
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:11.040]  the said tech censorship succeeds as it is attempting to hear against you who is going to raise the
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.160]  questions about whether the incubator baby story is true who's going to raise questions about whether
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.080]  weapons of mass destruction are actually there who's going to raise questions about whether the
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.560]  government's premise and predicate for going to war and killing hundreds of thousands of millions
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:30.480]  of people on destabilizing wars and regimes and societies for decades who is going to ask those
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:35.440]  questions if they can't be if they have no access to tech platforms and if they can be sued into
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.400]  oblivion for raising questions and challenging government narratives that's where the two stories
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.200]  come together in the end the government's goal and the big tech's goal and the institutional goals
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.480]  of the institutional actors is to only allow special approved messages to come out if it's from the
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:55.280]  new york times then it's okay if it's from anyone else they should be shamed censored and sued into
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:01.520]  oblivion that's where the two strategies overlap the bed the best resistance to illegal wars the
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.320]  best resistance to unlawful activity the best resistance to misrepresentations of what's
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.360]  happening overseas has always been the small independent press never the big institutional
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:17.440]  press and that's where it always starts because i didn't even say that uh the new church crisis
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.920]  christ church out in new zealand didn't happen i believe the guy did it i believe it's a monster but
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:26.640]  a lot of it in his own writing he says he's a leftist and russ lembaugh said the same thing
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.200]  he said well is he doing this to to blame right wingers he says he's doing it to cause a race war
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.680]  so that really is a type of false flag when you're doing something to cause a larger event as a
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:40.560]  trigger event that fits in historically and i know you as a scholar can can speak to that when we
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:45.360]  come back just briefly then because they said oh take jones off the web see he's saying it didn't
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:50.480]  happen again well i didn't say that but i have a right to say that if i did so they act like
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.040]  it's the most dirty thing in the world to question any big provocation event
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.360]  it's simple if you want to beat the globalist if you want to take on the new world order i'm not
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.880]  doing bitcoin pumping dumps with jack dorsi i'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures i'm not
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:11.040]  sitting here you know selling you late term abortion and all the great it is i just go out and say
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:16.160]  what is the top heart pill what is the top tumor it's a best-seller because it's anti-inflammatory
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.160]  and what's the best lab in the country okay they're the highest rate i'm like you're only 50
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:24.560]  percent curcuminoid well yeah they only put five dollars product and bottle but that's still incredible
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.160]  sir i'm like uh what's the highest you could do uh month later uh 90 95 percent no one's ever done
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.960]  i said how much did i cost for a bottle that cost ten dollars no one's ever done that sir the average
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.200]  competitors three to five percent you're the top brand's 50 percent i'm like we're going to have
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:43.600]  95 percent curcuminoid i mean you understand like that's like our information is explosive
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:49.120]  our fish oil i go out and i get the cleanest the best my children take it you think i'm gonna give
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.760]  you fish oil that didn't the very damn best on my soul you think i'm gonna screw somebody over
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.880]  like one of these devil worshipers never in foreshore dot com the globalist the eugenicists
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:06.000]  are always talking down to us they're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.560]  they try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:17.360]  information so you can make your own decisions they want you to believe you're powerless but the
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.600]  truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and and what we say and what we do
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:30.560]  that changes the world we are the power structure we are the inventors we are the trailblazers and
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:38.080]  the globalists understand that and they understand that they are basically trying to control and
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:43.600]  steal the future from we the people now to help fund our operation that's undoubtedly the very tip
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.320]  of the spear against these globalists i want to encourage listeners and viewers understand
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.880]  that throughout the second half of the month of march we're going to have store-wide free shipping
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:56.480]  and 50 off in forestore dot com something everybody should take advantage of
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:02.800]  you know the worst part about getting old and i'm still strong at 45 is that i won't be there for

[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:51.200]  all right robert barnes is our guest laura lumers coming up
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:58.080]  robert let's shift gears into what i mentioned earlier other forms of censorship by the so-called
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:07.200]  left uh making girl sports and women's sports from the olympics down to collegiate in college
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:16.800]  down to just regular you know peewee sports where you have to let men compete it's it's
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:23.280]  an obscene money python joke and now this story is up on info wars dot com from information
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:30.480]  liberation dot com catholic journalists criminally investigated for using the wrong pronoun and a
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:37.840]  tweet in our brave new world misgendering also known as accurately gendering someone is a crime
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:43.680]  worse than murder a british catholic journalist is being investigated by police for allegedly
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:49.920]  misgendering someone in a tweet caroline ferro was contacted by authorities after making an
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.880]  appearance on good morning britain in which she engaged in the debate with a transgender activist
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:02.240]  or a god susie green who has a trans child following because you can't protect these children
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:08.800]  following the parents which took place last september she reportedly got a visit from the
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:17.280]  police and of course california has passed a law on this so even if i wanted to call a man a walrus
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:24.480]  or i wanted to call a lady a monkey or i wanted to be you know crazy and say that
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.920]  a person was a fire hydrant i have a right to do that but but now it's a law that i have to when
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:35.120]  someone's really a man i have to say they're really a woman because they say so this is like a cult
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:40.160]  mind control so as a constitutional lawyer what can be done to strike back against these
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.600]  egregious affronts to free expression and free speech well the i mean it's happening on college
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:49.680]  campuses across the country uh canada should have learned their lesson because it was the
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:56.160]  passing of those laws in canada that unleashed dr jordan peterson and has made him famous now around
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:00.640]  the world for challenging questioning a lot of established narratives both within academia and
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.600]  the broader press this is classic news speak it's it's literally someone's looking at orwell's book
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.120]  and thought it was a wonderful script for how the world should operate and that's how pretty much
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.320]  this is going and to to say that a man is a woman or a woman's a man or lord knows what else is
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.640]  going to be coming down the pipeline and also to make that subjective i mean how's even someone
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.280]  supposed to necessarily know what pronoun they're supposed to use at the university of tennessee
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:29.680]  they're telling people to use the word z so it's not he not she just z uh it's becoming an uh an
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.240]  onion satire and as you know it's basically a money python script from about 25 years ago that's
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.880]  now real life so i think for first amendment purposes these kind of speech codes should not
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:43.200]  be allowed in the united states and historically whenever they've been challenged or contested
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.280]  they've been struck down so the first set of speech codes that happened in the early 1990s
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.440]  ended up going through the court system in the late 90s only 2000s and the courts recognized
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.920]  acknowledged that yes indeed such speech codes violate the first amendment rights to speak and
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.960]  express as you see fit uh now it doesn't always apply to private universities doesn't always apply
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:05.520]  to certain private employers and that's really their goal their goal is to get private universities
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:10.320]  and private employers and to privatize as much of the public square as possible so that they can
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.040]  achieve a censorist control over what you think because down deep what all of these things have
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.360]  in common is they do not have confidence in the audience to make up its own mind they believe
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.280]  they need to control what the audience thinks dictate what the audience sure and i mean the
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.320]  idea of saying you're going to have some six foot four dudes wearing a pink shirt clearly
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.880]  he's trying to start a fight and they're like hey guys come on over here which they say to men and
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.160]  women hey we're ready for you hey got a register open and then he starts assaulting everybody
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.600]  and attacking and the media defended it like this is a good person it's a good woman and then it
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:50.880]  turns out he's some super hardcore ex felon psycho i mean this is crazy i think he's even got a he
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:56.560]  she has even got a rap song out there now so it's all about momentary social media fame and that sort
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:02.480]  of crazy world i mean when you had people like the uh the man who decided to declare himself a woman
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:07.920]  and compete in the australian handball and other competitions and then just dominated those competitions
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:13.840]  it's really what's coming about is feminist true original first order feminists of the cameo palia
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:18.800]  crowd are starting to push back against this more aggressively assertively as they realize women's
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.840]  sports are now being uh distorted by well yeah imagine if if men just start going to women's
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:29.280]  restrooms saying no i can be in here don't women get this is like a group of sickos assaulting them
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:34.160]  well at some point it basically denies i mean the entire premise of feminism is that there are
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:39.280]  certain traits unique to women certain attributes unique to women certain history of discrimination
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:43.040]  against women solely based on their gender transgenderism says there's no such thing as
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:48.320]  gender period effectively that it's a purely a selective uh social i just can't believe they let
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:56.000]  dudes dominate girls in cycling and running it's all a joke the girl right behind the guys the
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.160]  real winner it's just i can't believe these guys do this it's just incredible oh exactly i mean it's
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:06.720]  like a bad south park episode so if you know if my daughter was competing in one of these competitions
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.440]  and some guy went out there and pretended to be a woman uh i would be highly offended because it
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:15.760]  interferes with the actual competition standards that were supposed to be established so it's another
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.600]  place with a social construct subjective mindset of gender definition uh runs into the reality that
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:24.880]  we all believe it's down deep that's complete sure and of course we're debating total mental
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.480]  illness the plan to break up the family here so it's scientifically deployed but to make us
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:32.880]  mentally ill and the acceptance of it but why is Lance Armstrong in trouble for taking steroids
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.080]  to be more male than you normally are when a male can then just step in and dominate women there's
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.880]  no weight class there's no nothing totally different biology you know everybody knows that
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:49.120]  men on average are about twice as strong as women on average i mean this is insane oh it's
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.680]  completely insane i mean and it's a total redefinition of what's supposed to be happening in terms of
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:58.880]  the terms of of athletic competition but it's also cultural control it's an attempt to reconstruct
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.040]  how people perceive the world ultimately it's going to reach other steps you already have
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:08.160]  some people trying to normalize pedophilia and other behavior trying to basically make extreme
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.120]  unusual behavior the norm and the customary to the point to where you your basic understanding
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.720]  of biology and history is gone and it's uh but i mean i'm looking at these dudes the men that are
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:25.280]  on women's rugby teams they look like they could kick my ass like six foot four giant dudes and girls
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:32.400]  have to i mean this is this is a joke man i mean that he's a dude precisely and it's obvious to
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:37.120]  everyone that's the case and pretending it's otherwise is is deeply orwellian but if you're
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:42.400]  watching on tv or radio we have obviously men winning powerlifting competitions against girls
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:48.560]  exactly i mean it's it's it's ridiculous i mean it's like an animal house skip
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:54.560]  and that has become social reality and it's it it's very anti-feminist at core because at the
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:00.400]  end of the day it's undermining women it's it's it's uh denying women equal independent access
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.600]  it's denying women the the achievements that they have rightfully earned uh and so really it's sort
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.720]  of a chauvinistic thing it is imagine because it's everything feminists said they feared but
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.080]  now it's coming back to their own leftist situation i want to do five more minutes for
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.440]  you and i gotta go i want to get into what else you think trumps should do and what you think
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:21.280]  is coming up in the election and uh so much more with robert barnes i want to ask you what you think
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:27.040]  trumps achilles heel is but first ladies and gentlemen they want to shut down the free market
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:31.920]  because what's left of it still allows you to vote with your ideas still allows you to vote with your

[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:22.080]  plastic too that's a lex of pure breeze and that's just an example of my philosophy what is the best

[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.480]  because that's how i want to be treated didn't go to college for that didn't take marketing

[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:06.240]  to have been chosen first last year to be platformed then they set the precedent now if you try to

[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:41.360]  that is san francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.840]  of the planet humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks

[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:59.600]  of them are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist

[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.520]  i went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:15.120]  trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been that's why

[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.160]  heel and i think trump's achilles heel is compromising uh people want the bull in the china
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.400]  cabinet they want him to execute i think it's achilles heel is that he's surrounded by so many
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:53.760]  enemies i mean nothing against conway but her husband and all that she's be fired i mean i i
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:57.440]  would not i mean that guy's completely out of control pushing the 25th amendment agenda what
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.360]  do you think trump's achilles heels are because i know the white house listens and i and they only
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:09.040]  we only get their attention uh when we get a little bit aggressive uh but i i i do i overall
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:12.800]  love what the president's doing in many ways love the president but i'm seeing him slide off his
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:18.000]  trajectory and you know think about a few point percentage at first doesn't look like a big point
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:24.960]  change but then after a while that's how it works so he's planning to zig and zag that's okay but
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.600]  he needs to tell us he's about to do a loopy loop because i don't like this
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:34.880]  no doubt about it i think one of his fundamental uh achilles heels is his belief that he can
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:41.280]  persuade people to come to a particular outcome rather than use his power to achieve that outcome
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:45.360]  so i think in particular this has been the case in big tech i think you know his son has been very
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:51.040]  aggressive promoting that the fact uh the issues that are related there too he has himself tweeted
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:56.480]  on it and commented on it repeatedly but i think he really thinks well he you know if i just lecture
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.480]  people enough and i talked about it enough they'll come to the common sense solution that's just not
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.640]  going to happen with big tech in the modern left the modern left believes it powered all costs
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:08.400]  that's why they're talking about scrapping the electoral college that's why they're talking
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:14.400]  about stacking the u.s supreme court that's right they're on a jihad they're on a attack they're
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:19.520]  they're going for broke precise they believe in power at all costs they don't care about principle
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:24.640]  they don't care any limitations on their power they their principle is more power period and until
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:30.640]  he recognizes that and accepts that and embraces the power of the presidency he's at constant risk
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:36.480]  because if he doesn't get in control of what big tech is doing in terms of not only censoring voices
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.520]  but controlling manipulating and monopolizing the public square for the purposes of a political
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:46.640]  partisan agenda that's hostile and adverse to him then they will do the same thing the 2020 election
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:51.440]  but they'll do it in a more sophisticated way than what they did in the 2017 alabama senate race
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:56.640]  and the 2018 midterms and he will lose election that he may have legitimately won with actual
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.720]  that's right he must embrace the power of the presidency against this outside globalist take
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:06.400]  over or be destroyed us with him we're in radical extreme times and and that's why they've got obama's
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.720]  professor saying they're scared trump will stage an emergency to stay in power he must be removed
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:15.840]  before then well they're the one saying in his own statement we're going to stage the emergency to
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.080]  remove him saying he's going to stage an emergency we've got to have an emergency and remove him
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:26.560]  before the election because he's a dictator no you just said you're a dictator precisely and they
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.720]  pose a direct and imminent threat the greatest threat to the freedom of speech the freedom of
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:35.520]  the press the freedom of the market the freedom of american democracy and liberty is at stake
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.320]  because big tech has a degree of control that has never been afforded before and unless the president
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:46.320]  directly confronts it and uses his presidential power see uses his power to do so lawfully correctly
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.880]  uses that there's a legitimate factual basis to have a point of special counsel right now
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.520]  to investigate what big tech has been up to based on published reports and of their interference
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:00.560]  and intervention in the 2017 election and based on them censoring you and removing you from all
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.200]  of your platforms in discriminant and disparate ways those two facts allow predicate right now
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.880]  to investigate whether they're politically manipulating their big tech control and the
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.680]  public policy and the public platform that they monopolize in order to favor one political party
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.760]  over another which is a violation of various campaign finance and other laws that's right
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.240]  they started the fight they've announced their tyrants they're out of control they brought us
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:26.000]  here i don't want this to happen i don't want martial law the democrats are saying civil
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.160]  emergency to overthrow everybody's rights and freedom and they're going to have reparations
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:34.720]  and take property this is a classic authoritarian takeover robert barnes thanks for spending time

[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:33.760]  hi i'm used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer then in the early 1970s most commercial
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:39.760]  manufacturers switched to bromide instead research from a world health organization study
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:44.800]  show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine in fact over 90 percent of
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:52.240]  americans are low in iodine since 1970 the iodine they collected in urine is 50 percent less now
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:59.520]  than it was then in 2004 a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58 percent were between
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:05.280]  moderately and severely deficient in iodine maternal iodine deficiency is particularly
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:10.400]  dangerous to the developing fetus most people i think everybody for most parts should be
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:16.080]  supplementing with iodine well another element that you have to have and if you don't have it
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:24.080]  you'll die that's the fact is iodine and the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:30.560]  almost totally debased of true atomic iodine we have the most absolutely clean deep earth
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:36.160]  crystal source of iodine x2 you're probably going wait a minute for the last year you've been saying
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:42.080]  x2 is selling out it was the last run it's been sold out for two months how is x2 back it was very
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:46.480]  hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12 000 feet we got put over the
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:51.040]  barrels and industrial sabotage we couldn't get anymore but by really putting pressure on from
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.400]  the original manufacturer we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:03.200]  absolutely atomic that nobody else has and bring it to you so x2 original is backed by the grace of
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:09.360]  god look here's the bottom line you need to do research into iodine the iodine conspiracy for

[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:57.040]  but first i knew this but i'd forgotten it you know like you're sitting there researching
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:04.080]  something a year ago you mean to make it a whole show and then you forget and then i was reading
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:12.400]  the news today jury finds bares roundup weed killer caused man's cancer san francisco wall
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:19.200]  street journal and i go wait a minute bear bought monsanto and i'm like oh that's right and then
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:25.360]  the fda approved the replacement for roundup which is the same thing but stronger it's kind of like
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:30.560]  heroin cured you from opium at the end of the civil war they saw it off hundreds of thousands
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:34.800]  arms and legs i think it was over a million actually it's close to a million died in that war
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:43.760]  and people were addicted to opium and so they go oh we got something that cures it it's heroin
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:50.640]  that's 30 40 50 times stronger depending on the heroin so yeah that'll cure you that'll fix it for
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:56.800]  you it's it's it's much stronger that way you don't want opium anymore when you got heroin show this
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.080]  new product they've come out with they admit is even stronger and even messes up your body and
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:08.960]  gives you cancer worse that's their replacement and it was so fitting that it's a bear everybody
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.040]  overuses the nazi stuff you know if you believe in family or the second amendment you're a nazi
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:20.320]  or if you're white you're a nazi bear was the second most powerful company in world war two
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.720]  under the australian gary and empire because world war two was about that empire coming back
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:31.920]  supposedly ended in world war one it didn't end just say the germans it's simpler that way but
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:42.000]  bear was the second most powerful family and company in pharmaceuticals in industrial chemicals
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:50.240]  in weapons in in everything and bear is probably one of the most evil companies i can't decide
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:54.640]  whether it's ibm or whether it's bear where's ibm help the nazis as well can't make that up it's just
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:03.920]  so crazy it's true and it was bear worked with the clintons on purpose for a decade to get bad blood
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:11.200]  out of uh arkansas out of prisoners that all had hiv and hepatitis on purpose they wanted it and
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:15.680]  they put it in factor eight it came out in the corporate documents like 12 years ago they were
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.040]  purposely shipping it out and said yeah we want to get rid of hemophiliacs we're culling the population
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:25.200]  so really it oh yeah it's in the corporate documents there's even been nbc pieces about it back
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.240]  when they told the truth that that bear executives that came out in lawsuits were putting it on paper
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:36.800]  that show what if it's got hiv we need to get rid of these hemophiliacs infected millions killed
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:48.320]  probably a million people nobody knows so bear bought monsanto how perfect is that bear that gave
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:55.280]  you dioxin bear that gave you age and orange thought i think about how much my family's been
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:58.880]  touched by these people i'm not gonna get into private stories but my god
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:08.160]  everybody i know went to vietnam their first kid was deformed no history of deformities of the family
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:18.800]  multiple members of the family different sides because you bio accumulate and it takes a decade
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:22.960]  or so to get out these men came back had their first and they're just it's tall fried chromosomes
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:31.360]  are all fried but i'm not going to digress that that's just another story you know like my grandmother

[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:03.200]  there is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist pro-free market
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:09.040]  pro-western speech all across the world and i don't want to say i'm honored but in a way i am
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.040]  to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed then they set the precedent now if you try to
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:20.640]  tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert they take you off the internet
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:26.160]  now google announced just today that they're not going to take christian advertising of
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.560]  most types on their platform because it upsets the san francisco google employees
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:37.200]  our country in the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech hyper leftist
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:43.440]  anti-human transhumanist who literally think they own and run our lives and if we keep bowing to
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:49.360]  these cults the cancer that is san francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:54.640]  operating system of the planet humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:01.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:20.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show i'm alex jones your host we're about to talk to laura
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.600]  lima for the balance the hour she's been really pushing stop the bias her name's been trending
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:29.840]  every few weeks the top of twitter after she was banned she's been doing incredible activism around
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:33.680]  the country in the world she's gonna be with us during the 50 hour broadcast coming up the kicks
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:38.960]  off 8 a.m thursday runs through saturday at 10 a.m to stop the bias to stop big tech censorship
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:44.640]  we're gonna develop plans to take action lawsuit you name it be sure and be part of that but if
[02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:50.960]  you just joined us monsanto stock which is bear stock they bought it last year is way down right
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:55.760]  now after more and more courts are ruling it does cause cancer it does kill people well it's designed
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:21:01.680]  to do that but why did bear buy it bear did with the clinton's uh the whole blood doping scandal
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:07.280]  where they put on purpose hiv and hepatitis blood into the factory rate for hemophiliacs and others
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:15.680]  this is about population reduction and it's about getting away with it and seeing what they can do
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:22.080]  that's why these groups are so dangerous and they're all testing and seeing what you'll put up with
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:27.360]  i expect the government to create like they did back in the 80s a roundup damage fund that's secret
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:31.280]  so if you're damaged by roundup you secretly have to go through court and get a little
[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:36.480]  stipend or tiny payoff for your dead family or deformed children or the cancer you got
[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:40.320]  but then of course they'll probably still keep using roundup but their answer
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:45.840]  is to come up with something even stronger even more deadly and again we broke that down
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:50.000]  we'll get into it more coming up but that's what they always do
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:54.080]  gloriel ummer joins us if he had the telephone hopefully get her on skype during the 50 hour
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:59.920]  broadcast uh but trump says i'll be looking in to stop the bias hashtag stop the bias uh you know
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:04.480]  he said just last week everybody's hard or it's a bright mark oh just be better behave than the
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:10.240]  leftist so you don't get banned what like prager university and uh now you've got these top leftist
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:16.320]  uh you know out there like the recode podcast with cara swisher who talks to all the top tech
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.840]  people saying ban ban Shapiro now so so where do you see all this going lauren i know you've
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:27.680]  got a lot of breaking news yeah well it's only going to get worse thanks for having me on alex uh
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:33.040]  i'm currently in uh california you know the heart of where all of this big tech censorship is taking
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:37.360]  place which is why i couldn't get on skype today i'm in the middle of some investigations and some
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:42.960]  some work that i'm doing here but now we see the president himself is starting to
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:50.240]  realize the significance and the magnitude of the social media bias yesterday uh his uh
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:55.760]  director of social media received a notification on facebook that said that facebook was blocking
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:02.080]  him i believe for 30 days from responding to people's comments on the president's page so facebook
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.720]  now is being so brazen they're not even trying to hide the fact that their shadow and let's be clear
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:11.920]  they said oh we apologize we thought you were a bot every time they get caught they go oh it's an
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:18.640]  accident no it's not an accident yeah no it's uh never an accident right but i think trump now
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:24.720]  finally realizes that he really needs to act on this because uh the 2020 election really depends on
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:31.360]  it because now the social media companies are really starting to signal to trump that the the
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:40.560]  digital board uh is it is in full uh full effect and like i said i've been saying this for for for
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:47.280]  almost two years now right the social media bias uh was really going to amp up during the election
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:52.640]  and if you recall on september 5th i believe it was last year at the social media hearing you
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:56.800]  and i were sitting next to each other we were watching these social media executives like
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:02.480]  jack dorsi and marc meckerberg perjure themselves uh in front of these congresspeople and isn't it
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:07.600]  funny alex isn't it funny how people like marco rubio and others they mocked me and you and they
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:12.720]  and then they threw me out uh when i confronted dorsi when he was uh testifying and called him
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:18.400]  a liar isn't it funny now how these same representatives are now complaining and
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:23.680]  they're saying oh look i have to do twitter now because of all the shadow banning like uh like
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:28.640]  devin juniors i think it's great that he's doing but where were these people seven months ago when
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:36.080]  the media and social media was making a laughing stock out of the you and i uh when when um when
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:42.640]  we were thrown out of the hearing well what's crazy is we have all their internal documents we
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:46.880]  have all the internal videos they admit they're doing it and then they lie before congress they
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:52.640]  do all this uh and then trump just sits there and takes it going well it doesn't matter my message
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:56.960]  will still go out no your message is not getting out they're blocking videos of the president all
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:02.880]  over the internet and just because he gets his news from fox or cnn because he's 72 years old
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:08.560]  that's all fine and dandy most people don't mr president they're they're basically banning you
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:13.760]  from the public square trump so i'm not your enemy i'm your friend but i'm saying your house is on
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:21.440]  fire either put the damn house out or let's evacuate yeah no they need to do something about it because
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:26.000]  really if it's a human rights violation as far as i'm concerned it's not even just a matter of
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:33.280]  receipt uh our civil liberties uh are being violated uh to the maximum level of this country
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.400]  and just like skin and color like race uh religion those are protected classes and in our
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:43.600]  discrimination laws and our civil rights uh acts and our laws in this country i think political
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:48.960]  affiliation really needs to be added to that as well to protect conservatives because if trump
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:55.440]  wins in 2020 which i honestly think that he will now given that the democrat party is so
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:00.160]  fractured and you have these kind of i was about to say they've gone completely insane left and
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:04.160]  we'll talk about the next segment but sure if he abandons us what's the point they were saying if
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:10.880]  he wins go ahead right yeah no and and so if he does win it's only going to get worse and i think
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:17.280]  that this is going to transition to the grocery store to our electric company to the water company
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.920]  and you may think that sounds insane but i think laura they've already banned thousands of
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:26.800]  conservatives from uber they're banning people from air bnb this is trust me i know i was one of the
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  first no i know for speaking truth about islam and isn't it funny how islam seems to be the thing
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:41.120]  that you're not allowed to talk about i mean look they even can judge janine piero so isn't it funny
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:46.880]  i love judge janine right but they called you and i crazy right they said oh laura lumar and alice
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:52.320]  jones their conspiracy wackos she's a racist she hates muslims right that's what they said about us
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:56.720]  uh but now they're coming for the more mainstream people and by the way there's still no word she
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:02.960]  didn't show up for her show is she just suspended or is she banned i believe they suspended her for
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.600]  two weeks but i'm not sure because fox news is even denying that it's a suspension but come on we
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:12.160]  all know what's going on but look they suspend judge janine for two weeks and then they hired
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:17.760]  donald brazil fox news i mean these people are turncoat and they're turning no i agree let's talk
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:23.120]  about that all but let's talk about you let's talk about you i'd try to find out who started uh
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:27.600]  hashtag stop the bias you were the first person i ever heard you sent me a hat you handed the hats
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:32.240]  out you asked me to get behind it months ago are you the progenitor of a stop the bias because the
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:39.520]  president's endorsing that yeah i believe so i mean you can see in my videos that um that when i
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:45.840]  confronted jack dorsi i shouted stop the bias and that's really when it became a massive trend so
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.040]  i would say that i am the person who made stop the bias mainstream that's correct the president
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:56.080]  trump did tweet my uh my hashtag yesterday and also we've got oliver darcy you confronted
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:05.680]  we've got oliver darcy yeah boy is he not a little slimy creature oh no he is he's uh he's a
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:11.280]  terrible individual and look oliver darcy is just really jealous right oliver darcy used to be a
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.920]  conservative you know james oakie was telling me that oliver darcy used to send him text messages
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:21.440]  and i hope oakie will be okay with me saying this on air but oliver darcy used to like message
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.640]  teams of people about how he wanted a job at veritas and how uh he used to do these affirmative
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:32.800]  action big sales uh to try to seem edgy you know when he was in the conservative clubs in college
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:38.160]  and i know that he wanted a job at info wars too but you end up he both turned him down you know i
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:42.720]  forgot that i forgot darcy did ask for a job here like five years ago he's probably infiltrating
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.320]  now i think he's been an operator for the beginning laura you are awesome stay there tell us what's
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:52.000]  coming next laura loomer she's taking action more than 10 000 men are so where are the men in this

[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:09.200]  started to spiral out of control after my divorce i went into a depression cycle and started drinking
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:15.760]  more often and using prescription drugs after my second dwine arrest my ex-husband threatened
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:21.920]  to take our children away from me i was 17 when i became addicted to heroin and meth i thought i

[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:13.600]  honored but in a way i am to have been chosen first last year to be platformed then they set the
[02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:18.720]  precedent now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:24.400]  they take you off the internet now google announced just today that they're not going to take christian

[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.120]  lot of my undercover work from from my time at bear toss and i'm planning on going undercover again

[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:15.040]  taking place but we all have to stick together and you know a lot of people have thrown you under
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:21.680]  the bus alex but you know i think you're a goddamn hero and i plan on standing with you and info wars

[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:42.160]  sorrows funded a literal nazi collaborator yeah they're now calling joe rogan for having my shelf
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:48.160]  and other people on a far right person that it supports richard spencer joe is very liberal
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:53.200]  socially that is a total lie and i'm not going to do his private life but joe is not a racist
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:56.560]  and i'm and you know i've had my problems with joe but he's now going up against the censorship
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:00.240]  and i appreciate that we're gonna be hanging out this weekend together and have a dinner but
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.680]  i mean it's just the idea to call him away from the podcast don't have me on i will have me on
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:09.920]  but he needs to have me on i don't know what his problem is but he's always talking about me and
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:14.960]  you know he's called me a crazy lunatic on his show and i am far from a crazy lunatic i am ahead
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:19.840]  of the curve i am always breaking stories before anybody no i know joe was kind of getting off the
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:25.920]  reservation and he's kind of woken up now because i think i'm not going to speak for joe he just he's
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:30.400]  just trying to be an entertainer and live his own life and i get that but i'm glad he's i will
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:33.840]  definitely say he should have laura lemur on one thing joe hates is being told who he should have
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:37.920]  on but uh you know you're absolutely right laura he should have you on that's a smart interview
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.640]  hell the president just tweeted you and said he's gonna you know you know get behind and and and
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:48.160]  uh hashtag stop the bias how angry laura is twitter that since they banned you you're bigger than ever
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:53.200]  like obi won can obi yeah i mean that's what happens you know it's the same with you i think they're
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:58.320]  pretty pissed and uh you know jack dorsi keeps getting asked about me in interviews the rolling
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:04.080]  stone actually sat down with him and they asked him about me and he had no other choice but to
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:09.360]  say that he respects me and he thinks i'm like punk rock and that he thinks that protest is cool
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:15.520]  and that he admires my why the hell you didn't do anything to get banned put you back tell him
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:21.200]  what they claim you did well they claim that i committed hate speech because uh because i said
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:26.560]  that yohan omar was anti-jewish and crouched urea and if you recall by the way you said that before
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:31.360]  anybody had it and she also is for pro cutting genitals off so that's pretty feminist to not
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:36.480]  want your genitals cut off right right and i like i said i was the first to really start talking about
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:42.000]  yohan i'm the only person on this planet who confronted her to her face along with reshia
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.440]  to leave about their true hatred and support for hama right right when she was running you went
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:51.040]  and covered her as a reporter we're very polite but they called you a stalker in the media yeah
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:58.320]  yeah no exactly and people didn't want to listen but now everybody wants to jump on the oh my god
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.920]  yohan's a jihadist uh train but they should have really been paying attention to the reports that
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:07.520]  you know i was reporting that you were reporting on and they could have avoided this whole entire
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:12.080]  situation but now we have a woman did you see this did you see that yohan omar last year she
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:17.680]  met with erdogan erdogan okay we're talking about muslim brotherhood central she's backed by care
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.960]  and let's be and let's be clear erdogan said we're going to send new zealanders and people back in
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:30.480]  massive body bags as if new zealand is all guilty for what happened that's how sick that is erdogan
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:36.720]  called for global islamic caliphate he called for global islamic dominations and here yohan
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:41.840]  omar is meeting with him look i was the first person to have the balls to say on the ground in
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:48.960]  minnesota yohan omar is a muslim brotherhood operative he is backed and endorsed by care you
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:54.480]  know care is essentially hamas in america and this woman is now on our foreign affairs committee
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:00.480]  god only knows what type of classified information she's receiving she supports men who were accused
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:06.080]  of joining isa she's meeting with with uh you know bloodthirsty aglomics dictators in the world
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:11.440]  i mean what kind of information is she giving to these you have it right i mean we could potentially
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:19.200]  have 9 11 to point out no i agree and you can tell her iq is like 75 i mean she she can't stop spewing
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:24.960]  her hate she is a she's so molly she's so molly and i mean that that also goes back to you know
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.920]  this whole concept of inbreeding and incest as well but uh you know there's there's a lot of iq
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:35.360]  politics and scientific research to explain why she is the way she is but i mean that's another
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:40.160]  we could talk about that for well i just know she's a raging lunatic and and and she just met with
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:45.440]  air to gun who said he's in islamic father world will all submit by the sword and he wants to kill
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:50.640]  everybody in new zealand now and the whole leftist media covers it up laura lumar changing the world

[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:04.960]  Laura limeron everything we do is about action about delivering not just talk the enemy can
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:11.120]  track almost all their defeats right back through this show not that we did it but on the line of
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:17.440]  their defeat at the epicenter of where the resistance forms where it starts and then marches we are
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:25.040]  the headwaters infowars lies directly in the zone the nursery the the the the the progeneration the
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:33.840]  fount like the mountains and the snow that turns into the snow melts in the spring and then the
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.920]  rivers that come out of it and they keep trying to shut it down but they can't because of you
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:43.200]  and that isn't talk that's the epic thing that's happening here's the bad news
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:52.160]  and the good news is everything's double-sided the globalist are completely desperate because
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:58.160]  everything they've done is failing nationalism populism free market love of the family is
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.360]  exploding again everything that's globalist is losing 30 40 percent of its ratings hollywood
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:10.240]  the nfl everything the globalist touch is falling apart they admit and their own internal documents
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:17.440]  they're they're they're done they just want to wreck things and make the fall of civilization so bad
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.080]  and the fall of america so incredible that somehow they get forgotten it's not going to happen
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:31.600]  but obviously and i've talked a lot of high level folks in it the next move is url banning and then
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:40.000]  ip address banning that's where all this is going because they thought demonetized people
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:45.360]  they'll roll over okay since from the rollover well this is pavlovian they're not giving into
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:53.680]  the conditioning they're not submitting what are we going to do it's up on info wars dot com
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:57.920]  we've got news wars dot com and prison planet dot com and a bunch of other sites were affiliated
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:02.960]  with that we don't run we're going to be launching the next few weeks so that our content's there
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.360]  and it's free to air everywhere we have to create a gnome diploma where the name now
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:11.760]  shows the big band everywhere so we'll have to call it something else maybe the new code name
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:16.320]  will be rex jones and they'll ban that by the time they ban that we create something new like
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:22.240]  spartacus jones who knows but this is the game now where people aren't just going to get direct
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:26.560]  access to the veritas they're gonna it's going to be blocked but humans once they figure out
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:31.520]  something's being kept that's the big gamble of the globalist they think you're stupid they think
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:35.120]  you're in such a day as you won't look for the truth you're gonna look but here's the bad news
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:42.320]  when the lore rumors take on this after blocking zero hedge and others new zealand telcos demand
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:50.960]  big tech censorship surge to protect consumers and begin blocking zero hedge dot com because
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:56.400]  i've told you i don't know the zero hedge people i'm not affiliated with them i just know
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:00.720]  it's some of the most piercing deep reporting they must have some of the same sources we have
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:05.440]  and the story is red linked on drudge report dot com
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:13.840]  and i should add drudge report dot com is linked to our posting of zero hedge
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:20.880]  so that's where this is going is url and then ip address level
[02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:29.120]  level they don't censor laura lumar because she's bad they don't censor zero hedge because
[02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:34.640]  they're lying they don't demonize drudge report constantly because he's telling people lies no
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:38.720]  it's because they're jealous most of the traffic they get soft drugs they admit like half the
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:42.320]  traffic the new york times off drudge and they want drudge shut down these are crazy people
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:47.760]  i wish drudge linked half as much to me as he did in the new york times or the washington poster
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:54.960]  cnn so after blocking zero but does drudge get hate from me no no because drudge is great
[02:51:54.960 --> 02:52:01.680]  they just hate hate hate it's the entitlement of these people after blocking zero hedge and others
[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:08.000]  new zealand telcos demand big tech citizenship surge to protect consumers because you can't
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:12.640]  decide what you're watching and then they go on and lie and say that we're denying the shooting
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:17.760]  happened never said it the guy's a monster we believe it happened we just played rush limbaugh
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:22.320]  saying it could be a false flagged by a leftist to do it to blame conservatives which he says in
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:27.520]  the manifesto he's trying to cause a race war like charlie manson we're just having a real
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:34.880]  discussion not white people did it whites are evil race war cnn in the wake of last week's terror
[02:52:34.880 --> 02:52:40.080]  attacks at two new zealand mosques which left fifty dead several websites which either reported
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:45.040]  the incident hosted footage of the attacks have simply allowed people to engage in uncensored
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:50.560]  discussions such as dissenter or zero hedge have been partly or completely blocked by both new
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:56.880]  zealand australia to the sake of protecting consumers according to ceo's of three new zealand telcos
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:53:01.120]  working in censorship tandem you thought it was just big tech banning me in one day together
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:06.960]  this is a practice run and it goes into it and facebook brags about it all of them and then
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:11.680]  here's the thing once they took zero hedge down they went zero hedge says no one died
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:16.800]  zero hedge didn't say that you liars same thing with me jones is being taken off youtube anywhere
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:24.080]  he is because he says no one dies show the video in the immediate aftermath of the shooting which
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:29.760]  was broadcasted for facebook live by accused gundman brenton terrant to an initial audience of
[02:53:29.760 --> 02:53:35.040]  200 million viewers none of whom reported it and have 4 000 overall views before it was taken down
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:40.960]  facebook deleted 1.5 million videos of the attack which 1.2 million were blocked at the time of upload
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:48.640]  but doesn't matter they're okay zero hedge is bad and then it goes into ip is going to be the next
[02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:53.920]  but right now it's urls uh laura i know you've got several websites speaking of the devil we always
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:58.880]  say oh we've been censored off the big tech platforms youtube google facebook twitter come
[02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:04.320]  to our websites but they're trying to take our servers they're trying to take our bank accounts
[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:08.480]  i know they've done that to you so so where can people find you at least for now is it laura
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:14.080]  loomer dot us where's the best place yeah it's laura if laura loomer dot us and you can subscribe
[02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:18.880]  to my email list because i send out emails every week and that's where people can get my information
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:25.040]  i'm also still on uh on instagram so my handle is loomer instagram censors me too but i've been
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.840]  telling people to follow me there but but yeah no you're right i mean this is exactly what
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:35.680]  they want to do and i could see in the future i could definitely see like the less now that
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:42.000]  they see how this guy like look at this guy who started the mods right he wasn't even really a
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:49.120]  trump supporter he if you look at his manifesto is a communist right like he's a godless communist
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:55.040]  and a lot of the stuff that he was saying in there is just kind of uh troll like right i mean saying
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:55:00.080]  that he believes in white supremacy but then saying is you know he he was inspired by a kanda
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:04.000]  felons i mean it's just ridiculous it's absurd right i mean how are you white supremacist
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:08.160]  and then you're inspired by some black and he specifically admits he's trolling he paced all
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:13.760]  these famous trolls by the navy seal that somebody else wrote he says well i'm for violence but not
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:19.680]  as much as kandace when she's anti-violent and he's purposely lying i mean he's trying to troll he
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:25.280]  was just trying to it was it was a form of magnetic warfare but it was like you know really crazy
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:30.080]  shit but the thing is is that they see how effective it is right you send in this leftist
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:34.960]  do you create this narrative that he's a trump supporter i honestly think it's highly suspicious
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:40.960]  that this guy claims to um you know have have just liked Islamic immigration but then he spent time
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:47.440]  in in pakistan and turkey and by the way former cia section chiefs have come out and said they
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:53.120]  think it's an islamic false flag whether that's true or not they have a right to say it yeah well
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:58.480]  i mean look it i think people are really just kind of going overboard with this um you know i got i
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:03.200]  got in a little bit of hot water but you know i'm used to making comments like this so i'm just going
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:08.400]  to go out and say it i mean i don't really care i don't really care about christ church right because
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.600]  why is it that we are expected to care about christ there's so much when every single day
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:17.760]  all around the world you know muslims are slaughtering christians and jews there's a christian
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:23.280]  genocide taking place right now and every single year an estimated 90 000 christians are murdered
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:30.160]  by muslims and in Israel right i mean oh yeah when there's a suicide bombing that kills 20 people
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:36.320]  or a mosque you know uh blows up another muslim group nobody cares no it's true and that's what
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:41.120]  that senator in in australia said listen there are thousands of churches blown up hundreds of
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:46.640]  synagogues bombed constant attacks on christians and jews no coverage and so a kid smashes an egg on
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:52.960]  his head for saying that yeah and i want to know too like do i get to go crack an egg on ilhan
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:59.200]  elmar's uh she jobs now because this guy i mean the leftist celebrating cracking an egg on someone's
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  head because they view it hateful well look i'm a zionist and i think that ilhan elmar is very
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.000]  hateful in her rhetoric towards israel and the jewish people and even christians and americans
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.400]  and so i want to know like what's going to happen if i go to congress and i crack an egg on her
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:19.040]  heat job and by the way they make zionist a dirty word what's wrong with jews believing israel has
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:24.560]  the right to a homeland when the muslims what the whole world the muslimism is well stay there when
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:28.000]  come back talk about that then i got millie we were coming on do five more minutes the point is the
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:33.360]  muslims say they they're gonna get the whole world i mean they're saying everything is there and i'm
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:38.480]  supposed to just roll over and say well cut come cut my daughter zenith was off and throw gay people
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:42.080]  off buildings i mean i'm not gonna put up with it we'll be right back stay with us
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:52.640]  there is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist pro free market pro
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:58.960]  western speech all across the world and i don't want to say i'm honored but in a way i am to have
[02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:04.800]  been chosen first last year to be platformed then they set the precedent now if you try to tell somebody
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:11.600]  the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert they take you off the internet now google announced
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:16.800]  just today that they're not going to take christian advertising of most types on their platform because
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:23.200]  it upsets the san francisco google employees our country in the world more and more is in the grip
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:30.560]  of anti free speech hyper leftist anti human transhumanists who literally think they own and
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:36.320]  run our lives and if we keep bowing to these cults the cancer that is san francisco and many of
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:42.160]  these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet humanity must awaken and say

[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:03.280]  to the gut level in this fight for free speech well it's going to get real nasty and i think
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:09.440]  that uh donald trump needs to do some type of executive order uh because well a lot of people
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:14.400]  are going to learn that unfortunately these protections that are out uh outlined in section
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:20.240]  230 right um it's going to cause a lot of dilemmas for people and i think that for far too long
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:24.720]  these companies have been able to acquire massive amounts of power making them even more powerful
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:30.880]  than the federal government which uh is wrong and uh i think that it really needs to go to the
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:35.840]  supreme court or you know there needs to be some type of executive action taken on this and as a
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:41.440]  conservative you know i hate to say that because you know we are uh against uh you know government's
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:45.920]  intervention but i really do think that this is an exception well exactly i mean there are human
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:51.280]  rights violations they're operating as government entities in collusion to censor and suppress
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:55.440]  people they're clear and present dangers and i don't like government involved go back to section
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:00.560]  230 as it was leave everybody alone as long as it's not illegal leave it on there and stop it
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:06.000]  and quit it or loser 230 and they've got to see now i never even got to this all these state
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:09.680]  attorney generals are getting ready to go after them and all these governments are going after them
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:14.880]  i mean they've got to understand that by them becoming censors they have opened the door to
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:21.440]  their own destruction it's very very foolish yeah well like i said i'm going to be uh you know going
[03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:26.080]  after a lot of these executives then i have investigators monitoring their behavior their
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:31.440]  patterns and we're keeping tabs on them we're monitoring them very closely and so stay tuned
[03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:37.520]  because come this year i'm going to be releasing a lot of really groundbreaking um exposes and
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:42.000]  investigation that's right because they think they control cyberspace we control third dimension
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:46.560]  and now they force us back into third dimension and now the fight's just begun laura loomer dot

[03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:29.600]  texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones and we believe that if we offer freedom and classic
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:36.560]  americana and renaissance and jesus christ that people want that and they're gonna respond to
[03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:41.760]  that we believe in humanity we believe in your strength i want to see you stronger than i am
[03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:47.120]  i want to see you more successful than i am because i have a connection to you your success is my
[03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:55.040]  success it's like a path the sociopaths think i'm weak because i feel connected to everybody
[03:06:55.600 --> 03:07:02.640]  including animals and plants the universe and god but that's all there is and it's like a cancer
[03:07:02.640 --> 03:07:09.440]  and i've said this many times because it's so true if cancer had a consciousness as it reprogrammed
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:14.000]  cells and took over the body for the six months would take to kill you it would think it was the
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:20.960]  elite it would think it was dominant it would think it was god it would think it had all the power
[03:07:21.520 --> 03:07:27.600]  because it could reprogram an existing ancient system it couldn't even imagine when all it was
[03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:34.800]  was a malfunction a runaway train a building fire cholera in the water supply
[03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:42.880]  we're gonna go to millie weaver and the big report she's gonna be breaking during the 50-hour
[03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:50.480]  broadcaster in a moment the fact that zero hedge and i'm sure if we check the ip addresses i'm
[03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:55.600]  getting calls and emails everywhere from australia and new zealons and they can't go to info wars.com
[03:07:55.600 --> 03:08:00.160]  now but they can't go to news wars.com that's that's why we created that
[03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:09.120]  dreadreport.com is toppling to it right now but that's the season we're in
[03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:16.400]  that's what's going on you know i didn't plug any less dollar and i've said i'm
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:21.920]  my own biggest set of me but the listeners tend to get it they they respond when i plug
[03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:28.400]  but i get so obsessed with news the most profitable time to plug isn't the very start of a show
[03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:32.480]  anybody will tell you that's always like coming up the andy griffin show with andy griffin brought
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:38.720]  to you by jello or michelin tires i bought this dvd set years ago because i only would let my kids
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:48.160]  watch old television like the most racy's like dallas or something but stuff like i dream of
[03:08:48.160 --> 03:08:58.480]  genie green acres gilligan's islands their favorite um andy griffin is one of their favorites
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:03.360]  and then later that they like a why five oh so that's on cable we watch the old
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:09.200]  why five oh so migaret and once they watch wholesome shows like that anyone to watch the new stuff
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:12.800]  because the acting's better it's all more real it's like it's like wow you watch those old shows
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:15.840]  those are the comedy's funny it's it's all just ridiculously good but
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:22.640]  i don't know why i'm going down that road i was just thinking about
[03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:30.560]  how they plug up front on those old shows because i bought a dvd set years ago off amazon
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:36.080]  and it was the i was the andy griffin like first season i didn't know it was like the first season
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:40.480]  off tv it was even kind of low razz but it was like andy griffin's going this hour is brought to
[03:09:40.480 --> 03:09:46.640]  you by jello here in mayberry we like jello cherry flavor grape flavor uh you know mint flavor we
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:53.520]  put a little bit of this you know cool whip on it it's so good i'm like telling my wife hey go to
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:59.200]  the store and get some cool whip get some cherry cherry whatever the point is is that the most
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:04.800]  profitable time for us to plug this hour is not brought to you by jello by the way i'm telling
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:13.200]  your story and the most profitable time to plug a product is the first 10 minutes of a show or
[03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:18.160]  right up front this hour brought to you by i never do it i just can't do it i do it at the end
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:23.120]  because i just get so obsessed with the news and then i can't hire the dozen or so reporters i'm
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:30.400]  ready to hire i can't do all these big things we've got ready on the drawing board because i
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:36.320]  won't do my job and raise the money i won't cut the ads i won't promote the products i'm the problem

[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:32.640]  and children how i want even more i could have 50 children if i could get away with it but millie
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:36.960]  you're awesome uh tell us about this big report you've got coming up but also first we'll do that
[03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:43.200]  next segment what do you make about zero hedge and others having their having their urls banned in
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:48.720]  australia new zealand that's top story on drugs that's pretty scary well this is all what they're
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:56.080]  going toward internet censorship you can talk to most leftists today and ask them whether or not
[03:12:56.080 --> 03:13:01.360]  that the internet needs policing and they'll tell you yes because of things like the new zealand
[03:13:01.360 --> 03:13:07.440]  shooting so that tells you that obviously the mainstream media leftist news outlets that
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:13.040]  they're watching is giving them the right amount of propaganda to make them reach that conclusion
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:20.320]  it's problem reaction solution the hegelian dialectic we have instances like this new zealand
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:26.720]  shooting where this guy was using social media he was we don't know if he was a troll or not but it
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:32.320]  sure looks like he was a troll and engaging in trolling behavior he said i'm a troll but we're
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:37.760]  not supposed to even say that right i mean that's the whole thing with trolls is you can't really
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:42.560]  figure out are they this or are they that and that's part of the game of trolling it's part of the
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:48.960]  sophistication where no one can really fully put their finger on what's going on and that is part
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:53.680]  of the whole point of trolling so i would say in essence because we can't really tell what he is
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:14:02.480]  he's most likely a troll why are they we see kennedy getting killed we see nazis killing people you
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:06.880]  know it's sad stuff but we need to see it since when is it 10 years in prison if you even have
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:12.640]  this video why are they why are they so scared even let anybody have the video well alex don't
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:19.120]  you remember when we were talking months ago and yeah i showed you that facebook had already
[03:14:19.120 --> 03:14:25.040]  acquired the government id verification systems and softwares they bought the software companies
[03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:33.200]  that that allow for scanning ids so that people then have to have government id in order to even
[03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:38.320]  keep or create their facebook so that's it they're going to use this crisis as the role out of the
[03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:44.400]  global internet id to tax to control the internet that's what this is about they want to shut the
[03:14:44.400 --> 03:14:51.120]  whole thing down and start it back up to where everyone has to have a fingerprint on the internet
[03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:57.840]  and that's why we're seeing instances where okay troll farms which are mostly happening on 4chan
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:15:05.440]  poll hn and discord apps and other various encrypted message boards we're going to see an
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:13.440]  abuse happening there but who is motivating that abuse financially who's paying some of these troll
[03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:23.280]  farms that's a real question and we're seeing in a misuse and abuse intentionally in order to justify
[03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:29.680]  internet policing that's right billy i don't know what we call this segment but that's really what
[03:15:29.680 --> 03:15:38.240]  they're announcing uh new zealand massacre big tech says new zealand massacre warrants world
[03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:44.800]  internet id or big tech pushes internet id in wake of new zealand massacre that's it big tech
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:50.480]  pushes internet id in wake of new zealand massacre and when that comes tracking censorship taxing
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:57.600]  control hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my

[03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:06.160]  us feel small to feel insignificant they try to censor because they fear you and don't want you
[03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:12.160]  to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions they want you to believe
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:17.600]  you're powerless but the truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:24.720]  and and what we say and what we do that changes the world we are the power structure we are the
[03:18:24.720 --> 03:18:33.360]  inventors we are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they are
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:39.600]  basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people now to help fund our operation
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:43.520]  that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists i want to encourage
[03:18:43.520 --> 03:18:48.240]  listeners and viewers understand that throughout the second half of the month of march we're going
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:52.800]  to have store-wide free shipping at 50 off info store dot com something everybody should take
[03:18:52.800 --> 03:19:00.560]  advantage of there is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist pro
[03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:06.560]  free market pro-western speech all across the world and i don't want to say i'm honored but
[03:19:06.560 --> 03:19:12.560]  in a way i am to have been chosen first last year to be platformed then they set the precedent
[03:19:12.560 --> 03:19:17.920]  now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert they take you
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:24.240]  off the internet now google announced just today that they're not going to take christian advertising
[03:19:24.240 --> 03:19:30.320]  of most types on their platform because it upsets the san francisco google employees our country in
[03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:37.840]  the world more and more is in the grip of anti free speech hyper leftist anti human transhumanist
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:43.520]  who literally think they own and run our lives and if we keep bowing to these cults the cancer
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:48.080]  that is san francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating
[03:19:48.080 --> 03:19:52.880]  system of the planet humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks
[03:19:52.880 --> 03:20:03.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:29.840]  i'm alex jones and i'm a hundred man
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:37.840]  where else am i supposed to be but right in the face of the global
[03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:46.720]  they got to catch me if they want me to
[03:20:46.720 --> 03:20:48.720]  hang out
[03:20:54.720 --> 03:21:00.080]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're back info wars dot com news wars dot com millie weaver
[03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:06.720]  our intrepid reporter on the eve of breaking huge news about these internet troll farms joins us
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:12.640]  and she brings up the incredible mergers and acquisitions of facebook of internet currency
[03:21:12.640 --> 03:21:18.160]  companies of credit card companies of other companies for a global internet id and they've
[03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:22.320]  said they want you to do their banking with them everything but if you're not a good globalist
[03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:28.960]  then your banking's turned off so that's really where all this is moving and i've been told that
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:34.960]  by white house sources they said you're worried about censorship wait till they let you buy and
[03:21:34.960 --> 03:21:42.640]  sell so it's right out of revelations and it's here facebook launches facebook set to launch
[03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:49.040]  mark of the beast system millie weaver tell us about it yeah facebook acquired this actually
[03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:55.520]  last year the government id verification systems and it's not really that big of a shock because
[03:21:55.520 --> 03:22:03.120]  we've already seen various social media companies require id for verification status so on twitter
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:09.440]  if you wanted to be verified you had to submit your id anyway to prove who you are so this was
[03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:15.600]  something they wanted to kind of test the waters in and we will just be at a point where essentially
[03:22:15.600 --> 03:22:21.040]  everyone then has to use id is to get on social media networks but what we're talking about really
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:28.160]  is a a broader possibility of internet policing where we could see an intentional shut down
[03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:33.520]  following some kind of a terrorist event or terrorist attack which then our government would
[03:22:33.520 --> 03:22:38.640]  say okay let's let's legislate and let's reopen that's what they're prepping for is when there's
[03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:43.520]  a big event we've got to cover it no one can see it so we've got to just shut the web down until
[03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:49.040]  this new thing is in place exactly because they can't handle the freeness on the web right now
[03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:53.520]  they can't handle that it's a wild west and that yeah sometimes you're gonna see good things sometimes
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:58.560]  you're gonna see bad things but bottom line is we have to be able to have free speech and people
[03:22:58.560 --> 03:23:05.360]  have to be able to have open dialogue and the the globalist the elite they don't want that to happen
[03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:10.960]  because look what happened we got trump elected during the 2016 presidential campaigns hillary
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:17.040]  was their choice she was supposed to get in and toe the establishments line and policies and agendas
[03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:24.640]  and we totally disrupted that they can't have that happening so rather than try to meet and
[03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:31.040]  and battle people on ideas and policies and just arguments and debates they know that they're
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:36.800]  pushing lies and deception and that the truth will always rise to the top so that's why they
[03:23:36.800 --> 03:23:41.920]  need to shut it down they can't have this open dialogue happening because too many people are
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:48.240]  being awoken just to think back when before the internet was such a big deal and big thing
[03:23:48.240 --> 03:23:53.920]  how many people were so asleep and so blinded and then they started looking into 9 11 and looking
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:23:59.040]  into all these different things and the truth was revealed and another big truth is going to be
[03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:05.280]  revealed when we release this this documentary that I just made you know deep it's called deep
[03:24:05.280 --> 03:24:13.600]  inside a leftist troll farm and it really just poses a question what about all this extremism
[03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:17.440]  that we're seeing online we're hearing about it the leftist media is talking about it all day
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:23.440]  is it artificial that's what we're really looking at and investigating in this short
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:30.240]  documentary this exclusive report where we go into a leftist troll farm with an infiltrator
[03:24:30.240 --> 03:24:37.360]  essentially that is given passwords now these you know these discords these private encrypted
[03:24:37.360 --> 03:24:44.320]  apps and chat rooms these were password protected rooms that you had to have access to with passwords
[03:24:44.320 --> 03:24:52.320]  and this infiltrator got in and was able to watch trolling happening and really we kind of we can't
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:58.560]  really say exactly who is doing the trolling because the whole point of this trolling network
[03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:04.480]  is that they all know how to use VPNs and mask their identity so they're they're essentially
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:11.440]  anonymous but we can get an idea of who they might be by looking at the memes and the content that
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:17.920]  they're generating and when we're looking at it we initially went down this rabbit hole to
[03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:24.800]  investigate this meme activity surrounding the whole yang gang phenomenon I mean recently we've
[03:25:24.800 --> 03:25:32.160]  seen all these yang memes come about and a lot of them are showing discord amongst Trump's base
[03:25:32.160 --> 03:25:38.160]  we saw some people prominent Trump supporters actually starting to come out and and say things
[03:25:38.160 --> 03:25:44.880]  against Trump and at the same time pro yeah as you said it's meant to create a revolution a crisis
[03:25:44.880 --> 03:25:49.680]  to bring down the country not to repair the country which is that again the helter skelter
[03:25:49.680 --> 03:25:55.760]  charlie manson it's the admitted plan in his own manifesto of the shooting that did happen
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:03.120]  in in christ church in fact i thought it would be ready tomorrow you say it's ready now millie you
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:08.400]  come in and introduce it and premiere it here always a lot of surprises here folks on the other
[03:26:08.400 --> 03:26:15.040]  side how's that sound millie that sounds great alex yes we just now released it it is up right now
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:19.520]  on my channel millennial millie but like you said alex it sounds like we're going to be premiering
[03:26:19.520 --> 03:26:25.680]  it here right now on air and it's just really amazing because we actually see we can watch
[03:26:26.400 --> 03:26:32.320]  these trolls sharing the list of different content to target in this password protected a
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:40.560]  site where they have post bins and essentially right after that my youtube video which was one
[03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:46.800]  of the content that was targeted literally gets trolled with all of these bot accounts well listen
[03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:51.680]  i listen this happened to kandace owens where they had leftist posing as racist harassing her and
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:56.240]  the leftist poses saviors to get her to come to them this is what the universities do this is
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:01.280]  their plan we know this goes on and then every time we try to cover it they try to shut us down
[03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:05.280]  and then back we should do our own comments we would see somebody saying i'm going to kill all
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:08.960]  the black people i'm going to kill all the white people and we checked the ip address it was the
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:16.160]  same group so we know obviously there's not huge amounts of comments saying inward and cracker and
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:20.640]  all this other stuff this is being done to make us fight with each other it's very very uh
[03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:30.320]  the directive is to color our websites our platforms as hateful far-right extremist and
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:34.880]  then oliver darcy uses that as an excuse to have us taken down you're about to take over millie

[03:33:03.760 --> 03:33:20.800]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:33:24.400 --> 03:33:29.840]  i'm millie weaver and you're listening to the alex jones show and we are about to release
[03:33:29.840 --> 03:33:36.960]  my new report it is an exclusive report called deep inside a leftist troll farm
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:44.720]  where we sent under covers to go in and find out what is behind the mysterious meme activity that
[03:33:44.720 --> 03:33:51.200]  we're seeing on the internet and what many people are calling extremist hate speech content that's
[03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:59.600]  being perpetuated by bots online now we've seen many governments now calling for internet policing
[03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:07.840]  and censorship under the justification of these hate groups and hate speech online and we have to
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:13.440]  ask ourselves how much of this hate speech that we're seeing online is actually real and how much
[03:34:13.440 --> 03:34:20.560]  of it is potentially bots and troll farms that are perpetuating this quote unquote hate speech
[03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:26.480]  in order to justify internet sensing and policing you know when you have leftist out there saying
[03:34:26.480 --> 03:34:33.120]  that our own president is engaging in hate speech and that he's responsible for the new zeland shooting
[03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:40.240]  you're also looking at how the leftists are pushing and pointing the finger at these groups online
[03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:47.040]  such as info wars alex jones bright bar many of these conservative sites are now being blamed
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:53.600]  for these shootings these terrorist attacks because the left is painting them and coloring them as
[03:34:53.600 --> 03:35:00.400]  extremist sites now you're about to see this exclusive report which shows you what it's like
[03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:08.000]  inside a leftist troll farm curiously i wanted to see what it was like to be inside of one of these
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:13.440]  discord groups that were propagating the gang game meme so we had an undercover infiltrate a
[03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:19.200]  leftist troll farm the last week and what's interesting is this troll farm was getting
[03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:26.320]  actual directives on how to sow division and discontent their belief currently is that the
[03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:32.720]  united states is going to collapse and that we should do everything possible to make as quickly
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:37.840]  as possible prior to anyone reporting it we obtained documents which have subsequently
[03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:44.000]  been leaked on fourchan that connect to the new zeland shooters manifesto we've got an insider
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:51.520]  watching in live time them troll you yes there was a large effort to do a file dump of the discord
[03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:57.120]  servers that uh will appear to be where these beings are being coordinated from this new zeling
[03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:03.920]  shooting happened and we're watching the troll farms come into action we've discovered a network
[03:36:03.920 --> 03:36:09.280]  of tech stock units and post snap loot to each other so you're saying you've got the proof of
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:14.080]  their pull in this crap and then all the mercy that snake says shut down info wars they've got
[03:36:14.080 --> 03:36:20.720]  racist commenters that's right on friday game waking up to our acceleration is shooting up a
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:26.720]  moss that publish a manifesto like like the gang game me for profit on fourchan and other social
[03:36:26.720 --> 03:36:33.040]  media sites for the act of accelerationism the release of documents several days ago on fourchan
[03:36:33.040 --> 03:36:39.920]  and eightchan were basically the game plan to influence the public discourse uh on the message
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:45.680]  boards literal psyops going on right now on the american public to basically drive the united states
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:52.640]  into the wall to put the foot on the accelerator which is to accelerate things to its inevitable
[03:36:52.640 --> 03:36:57.360]  point as quickly as possible to sell more hatred so they want full spectrum dominance this could
[03:36:57.360 --> 03:37:03.840]  be seen as a perhaps a grassroots effort by disaffected groups to spoil the plan of the go
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:11.200]  globalists or it could be seen as a plan by the globalists to basically induce chaos into a system
[03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:17.200]  that they're losing control of we must ask ourselves how much of this supposed hate speech that we
[03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:24.080]  see on the internet today is really just artificial rather than lose control of meme culture of the
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:30.880]  internet of public discourse maybe they want to drive us into open conflict using the concept of
[03:37:30.880 --> 03:37:40.080]  accelerationism and therefore scare people cause civil war cause the meme war to erupt into a
[03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:44.240]  shooting war to get the united states to be destroyed or get a thousand dollars in the process
[03:37:46.240 --> 03:37:51.760]  the investigative report you're about to see is in no way an attempt to contribute to the debunked
[03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:58.320]  hoax that there is a jewish plot to manipulate for chan into sharing pro yang content this is
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:04.400]  merely an attempt to gain insight into a new and dangerous social trend that's occurring online
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:11.360]  trying to gain understanding behind this apparent hoax and who may be perpetuating it we were able
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:17.360]  to gain access to a private chat room within the yang gang's inner circle the initial traffic around
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:23.760]  the yang gang meme really drove me to ask questions about it where was it coming from how was it being
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:31.200]  populated an insider leaked to clover chronicle that 2020 democrat hopeful andrew yang is paying
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:37.840]  groups of online meme operators to influence future voters so we decided to investigate this
[03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:45.120]  alleged yang gang troll farm seeking recruitment information we received directives resources
[03:38:45.120 --> 03:38:51.840]  and info on how to cover your tracks online there has been a massive increase in the posting of yang
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:58.480]  yang gang posting in other words the creation of a massive amount of threads related to andrew yang
[03:38:58.480 --> 03:39:04.000]  as you can see the yang gang chimes in making comments about the video nudging the viewer to
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:09.280]  understand the type of trolling desired this is known as the divide and conquer strategy
[03:39:09.280 --> 03:39:13.600]  by essentially splitting trump's user base and preventing them from talking about trump in the
[03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:19.120]  first place attacking them where they're weak by specifically targeting policies that are against
[03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:25.040]  the entire idea that trump is a white nationalist when in reality trump just wants what's best for
[03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:32.400]  america we discovered these trolls were posing as right-wing extremists spreading anti-semitic
[03:39:32.400 --> 03:39:40.160]  sentiment while at the same time playing the side of the left i would discover a network of text
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:47.360]  documents and posts now linked to each other and then these text documents were videos that had
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:53.840]  approved music in its and video files to use it with and take column a and column b and mix them
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:40:01.840]  together it also would link to the next documents or the previous documents into a chain of information
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:09.520]  very nonchalant uh paceman where you just paste text in it can sit live on the internet um very
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:14.880]  nonchalant no one would really look for stuff there we were able to watch this troll farm in
[03:40:14.880 --> 03:40:22.000]  action as they dog piled one of my youtube videos comment sections with comments that matched their
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:27.920]  directives verbatim when millie weaver put out her video on andrew yang within hours it showed
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:34.960]  up in the group and they would actively call her a jew and assume very hateful things about
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:40.960]  her motivations with it our undercover also gained access to detailed instructions about meme
[03:40:40.960 --> 03:40:48.320]  generation and content to troll here you can see links to selected content for this troll farm to
[03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:55.680]  target jack passovic the red elephants millennial millie even my content daily caller articles
[03:40:55.680 --> 03:41:02.800]  and much more we discovered these trolls were posing as right-wing extremists spreading
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:09.760]  anti-semitic sentiment while at the same time playing the side of the left essentially acting
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:16.480]  as sock puppet a and sock puppet b aimed at controlling both sides of political discourse
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:22.880]  what at first appeared to be mere trolling promoting a particular political platform
[03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:29.600]  turned out to be a more serious operation engaged in deception and political subterfuge
[03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:35.600]  the true culprits behind this are what are known as discord trannies and that is not my own terminology
[03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:42.880]  or phrasing but rather a group of young men who have chosen to instead spam the boards online on
[03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:48.400]  fourchan to make sure that trump is not elected president for a second term while they're typically
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:53.840]  fanatics about communism and they really really enjoyed the idea of a communist state however
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:41:59.600]  you can see that someone meticulously took the time to make a variety of yang gang memes and post
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:04.800]  them all at once which is extremely suspicious after doing further research i discovered the
[03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:09.680]  discord that would actually allow them to gather together and make sure that their psychological
[03:42:09.680 --> 03:42:15.440]  operation went into effect en masse at a certain time looking from an outside perspective on the
[03:42:15.440 --> 03:42:20.800]  means you see a lot of anti-semitism within them and this is completely true within these
[03:42:20.800 --> 03:42:28.000]  discord groups the release of documents several days ago on fourchan and hn were basically the
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:34.400]  game plan to influence the public discourse uh on the message boards we see efforts to push
[03:42:34.400 --> 03:42:41.360]  andrew yang when fourchan had looked into the yang gang meme phenomenon they had discovered
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:48.240]  documents that coordinated yang gang memes over the weekend friday march 8th going in through the
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:54.880]  12th these descriptions outlined things in highly anti-semitic terms and now through the end of march

[03:47:14.480 --> 03:47:21.120]  we see efforts to push andrew yang when fortune had looked into the yang gang mean phenomenon
[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:28.240]  they had discovered documents that coordinated yang gang means over the weekend friday march
[03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:34.800]  8th going through the 12th these descriptions outlined things in highly anticipated terms at
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:41.280]  the same time you see the daily storm release their support for yang an article titled making the
[03:47:41.280 --> 03:47:47.280]  case for the establishment of the yang dynasty in the article they outline yang's appearance on
[03:47:47.280 --> 03:47:53.920]  joe robin's podcast and comparing his warnings about automation to the gunna bombers manifesto
[03:47:53.920 --> 03:48:00.480]  then on tuesday you see the daily storm right an additional article with support with yang highlighting
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:08.240]  the meme releases that trended into the hashtag of mega make israel great again through these memes
[03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:16.320]  that condemn the u.s funding of israel and celebrate their wishes for yang to defund israel
[03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:22.720]  and give the money to united states citizens so discord within trump's base sock puppet a to push
[03:48:22.720 --> 03:48:28.880]  narrative that trump will drain the israel swamp sock puppet b to push narrative that trump is an
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:36.240]  ally to israel color the website as hateful by pushing over the top racist and divisive posts
[03:48:36.240 --> 03:48:44.560]  that make no real contribution people who advocate peaceful means should be condemned as zinus shills
[03:48:44.560 --> 03:48:51.120]  andrew yang disclosure coming up flood alt-right twitter sphere with praise for andrew yang until
[03:48:51.120 --> 03:48:58.640]  the disclosure as a show of power andrew yang's promotional posts by alt-right plants to be redacted
[03:48:58.640 --> 03:49:04.640]  hide cover-up event there was a large effort to do a file dump of the discord servers that
[03:49:05.520 --> 03:49:10.400]  will appear to be where these memes are being coordinated from and within the conversations
[03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:17.520]  of it they also unearthed coordinated raid instructions the batter pants along each day
[03:49:17.520 --> 03:49:23.680]  the rain it appears someone got kicked out of the group and didn't get paid so they leaked the
[03:49:23.680 --> 03:49:30.560]  docs out of spite we noticed a bizarre header and footer on these documents so we had a professional
[03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:37.040]  crypt analyst and code breaker analyze them with more than a dollop of insanity the author of the
[03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:44.480]  attached gives it the subtitle confidential stenography used to prevent leakage the protocols
[03:49:44.480 --> 03:49:51.600]  of the elders of zion is a publication dated to 1903 that was purported to have been the result
[03:49:51.600 --> 03:49:58.480]  of several jewish elders with a dream of the fulfillment of zionism another such document
[03:49:58.480 --> 03:50:04.240]  has very recently surfaced and was written and formatted to suggest it was produced by jews
[03:50:04.880 --> 03:50:10.560]  there isn't a jew on earth stupid enough to come up with a title as ludicrous as this
[03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:16.640]  it is noted that adolf hitler references the fraudulent protocols in his book mind conf
[03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:23.680]  similar to the new zealand shooter and modern white nationalist groups here is what adolf hitler
[03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:30.320]  had to say quote i took all the social democratic pamphlets i could lay my hands on and sought the
[03:50:30.320 --> 03:50:37.520]  names of their authors jews i noted the names of the leaders or trade union secretaries the heads
[03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:44.880]  of organizations or street agitators it was always the same gruesome picture and so too was the
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:51.440]  attached set of documents produced by an updated cabal of neo-nazi wannabes purporting to be jews
[03:50:52.560 --> 03:50:59.920]  a lot of people who identify with a growing trend on fortune which is acceleration is acceleration
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:07.200]  ism is the twisted philosophy that if one accelerates class conflict pushes capitalism to its limits
[03:51:07.200 --> 03:51:13.440]  oppresses the working class and creates as much political conflict as possible you can force about
[03:51:13.440 --> 03:51:20.000]  revolution and radical change which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:27.440]  possible and their belief currently is that the united states is going to collapse and that we
[03:51:27.440 --> 03:51:34.000]  should do everything possible to make this quickly as possible waking up to acceleration is shooting
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:39.840]  up a mosque and publish a manifesto quite like the game game games are propaganda unfortunate
[03:51:39.840 --> 03:51:45.360]  other social media sites for the act of acceleration ism the gunman was live streaming the killings
[03:51:45.360 --> 03:51:51.520]  at one mosque on social media under his name online is a racist manifesto claiming that
[03:51:51.520 --> 03:51:56.720]  white christians are under threat from other religions and races he posted his manifesto
[03:51:57.520 --> 03:52:03.920]  using many the same talking points and memes and jokes and trolling that have been going on
[03:52:03.920 --> 03:52:10.320]  in message culture for the past several months and years well having worked on a nobelia documentary
[03:52:10.320 --> 03:52:15.600]  about the oakland city bombing i can't help but be struck by the similarities of the media response
[03:52:15.600 --> 03:52:23.280]  to that attack and the recent crisis or massacre in new zealand and christ church at the time of
[03:52:23.280 --> 03:52:26.800]  the oakland city bombing there was a patriot movement in this country people were talking about
[03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:31.920]  restoration of the constitution the expansion of the police state powers they were resisting the
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:36.960]  anti-terrorism legislation that was trying to be passed after the oakland city bombing it completely
[03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:44.880]  silenced anybody that opposed the globalization agenda now all libertarians conservatives the
[03:52:44.880 --> 03:52:49.840]  republican party themselves they're basically terrorist here's the headline corporate media
[03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:55.840]  mcvay's anti-government sentiment now mainstream and republican party imagine how this would hurt
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:53:01.520]  the globalists because their secret weapon is false flag it is their go-to zeitgeist we got to
[03:53:01.520 --> 03:53:09.840]  take that weapon away from them apparently this has been something that's been set up and in the
[03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:18.080]  works for a very very long time by the deep state and that essentially these terror organizations
[03:53:18.080 --> 03:53:25.760]  or groups would use social media then later social media can be scrutinized and they could
[03:53:25.760 --> 03:53:33.120]  essentially say that we have to now make sure that everyone has a government issued id attached to
[03:53:33.120 --> 03:53:40.560]  every single social media account they're making their move for an internet id to dial into banking
[03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:45.600]  so that oh isis can't recruit online when it's hillary had been gauzy in the left that empowered
[03:53:45.600 --> 03:53:52.560]  isis alex jones on twitter posted this week uh what essentially is a video calling for people
[03:53:52.560 --> 03:54:00.000]  to get their battle rifles ready i know a pr rollout when i'm seeing it and now seeing it came out
[03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:05.440]  this morning and said alex jones is a domestic terrorist planning terror attacks with no links
[03:54:05.440 --> 03:54:10.720]  or no proof but the fact that they're saying i'm calling for this whenever said it is chilling
[03:54:11.920 --> 03:54:16.960]  all of her darcy tweeted on the day of the new zealand shooting you don't have to go to places
[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:22.640]  like for chan to see vile racist commentary just go to some of the far right websites in the us and
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:28.160]  look at the comments message boards breitbart gayway pundit info wars many reprehensible
[03:54:28.160 --> 03:54:35.120]  comments from users on stories regarding the new zealand attack so he's pointing the finger here
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:42.560]  now at the websites of info wars and breitbart is he now trying to call for your website to be banned
[03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:47.760]  alex it's not good enough to just ban you from twitter he wants to pull you off the internet
[03:54:47.760 --> 03:54:53.200]  all together and it what's crazy is this is literally one of the directives that these
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:55:00.720]  leftist trolbot farms had this week so what's going on why is oliver darcy following directives
[03:55:00.720 --> 03:55:06.000]  that this leftist trolbot farm is giving out after the christ church shooting the new zealand
[03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:11.040]  government blocked sites that they claimed were spreading hateful material the headline in the
[03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:16.080]  new york times following the attack was new zealand institute is going to institute harsh
[03:55:16.080 --> 03:55:21.840]  gun control measures which is a strange headline following that attack because it is not my concern
[03:55:21.840 --> 03:55:26.080]  or the concern of the american people what the gun laws in new zealand are which by the way
[03:55:26.080 --> 03:55:31.920]  are very harsh so those gun laws will only apply to those who already follow the gun laws as is the
[03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:36.480]  case if they try to institute gun laws here in this country if you don't have the second amendment
[03:55:36.480 --> 03:55:42.480]  how can you protect the first in every country where they have disarmed the people free speech
[03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:48.400]  is next because the people are powerless to resist no government corruption the shooter deliberately
[03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:55.040]  trolled the media and they're doing exactly what he wanted he gave them all the cues to fulfill
[03:55:55.040 --> 03:56:01.360]  his agenda the media while portraying themselves as being against what he thought is fulfilling what
[03:56:01.360 --> 03:56:07.520]  he wanted but really hilly clinton was aware of this white nationalist underground movement
[03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:14.560]  will be trolls galore these are actually manufactured trolls it's an astroturf
[03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:21.040]  outrage machine of these paid trolls it's part of a program called breaking barriers as we see them
[03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:28.880]  become more mainstream we see them for adopting their own art style and genre which is to remix
[03:56:28.880 --> 03:56:37.440]  vaporware the art subculture of the alt left with a fascistic roman imagery this trend was
[03:56:37.440 --> 03:56:42.240]  observed everywhere and had columns written about from vice to dailybees anyone would be
[03:56:42.240 --> 03:56:47.920]  partisanly critical to the fringe alt right the alt right version being dubbed fast wave
[03:56:47.920 --> 03:56:54.320]  or fascist wave this was to create a subculture to counter the kindness vapor wave you now see
[03:56:54.320 --> 03:56:59.600]  both of these symbology and imagery combined together now that you see equally at the two
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:06.720]  groups are working together it is also very important to notice that the new zealand shooter
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:14.000]  posted the image of fast wave right before a new zealand shooting we all feel bad for the people
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:19.440]  who are shot new zealand is a horrible horrible act what the media should not be doing is fulfilling
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:26.240]  the shooter's agenda which was to trigger censorship to trigger gun control and to start basically a
[03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:32.240]  civil war that's what he wanted that's what he stated and as the media cherry picks his manifesto
[03:57:32.240 --> 03:57:38.080]  for example claiming that he was a trump supporter when the when the shooter most abundantly clarified
[03:57:38.080 --> 03:57:45.760]  his position and said he did not support trump at all there are thousands of ideologies out there
[03:57:45.760 --> 03:57:52.080]  hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist info wars
[03:57:52.080 --> 03:57:56.320]  is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's what the globalists are obsessed with it
[03:57:56.320 --> 03:58:01.760]  trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana
[03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:06.720]  and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's
