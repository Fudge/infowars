[00:18.320 --> 00:20.320]  of our constitutional rights.

[00:54.920 --> 01:04.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:09.200 --> 01:10.200]  You want answers?
[01:10.200 --> 01:12.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16.520 --> 01:32.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:32.840 --> 01:41.560]  We're going to have an extremely jam-packed information overload broadcast today.
[01:41.560 --> 01:45.320]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:45.320 --> 01:52.960]  We have the director and others from the film Shadow Government joining us coming up in
[01:52.960 --> 01:53.960]  the next hour.
[01:53.960 --> 02:00.760]  Then we have Declan McCullough coming on to talk about the Cyber Security Act to get
[02:00.760 --> 02:08.880]  into, of course, the calls for Internet censorship by governments across the Western world, mirroring
[02:08.880 --> 02:15.880]  or in some cases even going further than what we see in Communist China.
[02:15.880 --> 02:20.760]  That is what is coming up today.
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.920]  We're also going to have masses of important news and information throughout the full four
[02:26.920 --> 02:37.640]  hours with a disciplined news blitz burrowing deeply the news and information and your phone
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.720]  calls in the last hour today.
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.400]  I'm also going to be covering a lot of news in this hour.
[02:44.400 --> 02:55.120]  The highly anticipated gubernatorial Republican primary in Texas is now history with Rick
[02:55.120 --> 03:01.360]  Perry hitting 757,461 votes.
[03:01.360 --> 03:09.800]  You got 25 million people in the state and less than a million decided this for Perry.
[03:09.800 --> 03:18.480]  Getting 51%, these are the final numbers from the state of Texas own website.
[03:18.480 --> 03:25.600]  When the polls supposedly closed last night and they announced at 9.30, K. Belly Hutchinson
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.480]  capitulated and said that Perry had won.
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.480]  That was 52% and she was 31, Debra Medina 18.
[03:32.480 --> 03:41.840]  The final numbers are Perry, 51, K. Belly Hutchinson at 30 and Debra Medina at 19.
[03:41.840 --> 03:46.360]  There is no doubt if the Glenn Beck event wouldn't have happened with Debra Medina at 20 points
[03:46.360 --> 03:54.280]  at that time, getting five points a week that she would have gotten more than 30% and gone
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.560]  into a runoff with Rick Perry and could have had a chance to really expose him on his big
[04:00.560 --> 04:05.000]  government New World Order agenda.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.400]  But alas, that didn't happen.
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.680]  I don't think her campaign handled that very well with all the different waffling and different
[04:10.680 --> 04:19.560]  statements to different audiences, but the main guilt lies with Glenn Beck and the Republican
[04:19.560 --> 04:23.760]  party that admittedly targeted her and now we see all these top Republican strategists
[04:23.760 --> 04:30.200]  and Politico and the Washington Times and other big sites and newspapers coming out
[04:30.200 --> 04:34.440]  and saying, we've got to take over the two parties and kick out all the birthers and
[04:34.440 --> 04:40.920]  the truthers and the constitutionalist and the minute men and the three percenters and
[04:40.920 --> 04:43.760]  the, oh, they really don't like oath keepers.
[04:43.760 --> 04:46.520]  I mean, how do you demonize oath keepers?
[04:46.520 --> 04:48.920]  They just say follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[04:48.920 --> 04:55.640]  It's pretty tame stuff, but it's so radical because telling the truth is a revolutionary
[04:55.640 --> 05:01.760]  act in times of great deceit and corruption.
[05:01.760 --> 05:06.200]  And there's a big Southern Poverty Law Center report demonizing myself and many others.
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.760]  We've got a MSNBC report as well.
[05:10.760 --> 05:19.200]  They are clearly, clearly getting ready for a big false flag to be blamed on constitutionalist
[05:19.200 --> 05:22.680]  who oppose the globalist takeover agenda.
[05:22.680 --> 05:29.800]  Now I don't know if Joe Stack was the opening salvo in that, but with all the evidence weight
[05:29.800 --> 05:36.680]  on either side, it's inconclusive, but leaning towards black ops staged event, but I have
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.840]  no doubt they're going to stage big attacks.
[05:38.840 --> 05:43.320]  And if I had to guess, I'd say April 15th or April 19th, and I don't like to put dates
[05:43.320 --> 05:46.080]  on things, but that's a key zone.
[05:46.080 --> 05:53.240]  And one big indicator is I know Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, HBO and others are all producing
[05:53.240 --> 05:59.600]  anti Tea Party films to air in the middle of April to coincide with their fake terror.
[05:59.600 --> 06:03.520]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the a cola blue atmospheric water generator
[06:03.520 --> 06:06.480]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[06:06.480 --> 06:07.840]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[06:07.840 --> 06:08.840]  It's very real.
[06:08.840 --> 06:12.720]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[06:12.720 --> 06:16.240]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with a cola blue, you'll know what's

[06:17.240 --> 06:19.640]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[06:24.200 --> 06:25.640]  for your home or business.

[06:30.360 --> 06:33.520]  The a cola blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[06:33.520 --> 06:35.960]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[06:35.960 --> 06:39.920]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including
[06:39.920 --> 06:43.480]  reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[07:01.920 --> 07:05.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[07:05.640 --> 07:08.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[07:08.760 --> 07:13.120]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[07:13.120 --> 07:14.120]  at home.
[07:14.120 --> 07:18.760]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[07:18.760 --> 07:19.760]  calling the shots.
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.040]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[07:25.040 --> 07:30.680]  Full, the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[07:30.680 --> 07:35.160]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[07:35.160 --> 07:39.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[07:39.600 --> 07:41.600]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[07:41.600 --> 07:47.120]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[07:47.120 --> 07:48.960]  a fall of the Republic.
[07:48.960 --> 07:55.040]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[07:55.040 --> 08:01.800]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[08:01.800 --> 08:19.160]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[08:19.160 --> 08:20.160]  day.
[08:20.160 --> 08:22.640]  Think it can't happen here?
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.840]  Executive order 10990 locks down all highways.
[08:26.840 --> 08:31.720]  Executive order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[08:31.720 --> 08:36.280]  Executive order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[08:36.280 --> 08:42.040]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[08:42.040 --> 08:46.160]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.560]  about how to survive it, go to marshallawsurvival.com.
[08:50.560 --> 08:52.920]  That's marshallawsurvival.com.
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.000]  Go to marshallawsurvival.com right now.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.160]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[09:00.160 --> 09:06.080]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[09:06.080 --> 09:24.080]  a war on for your mind.
[09:24.080 --> 09:36.400]  I've got Washington Post articles, CNN stories, all saying, oh, the White House is very secretive
[09:36.400 --> 09:44.280]  about this initiative, the Bush era initiative that Obama is continuing, like the wars and
[09:44.280 --> 09:51.040]  the Patriot Act and the torture and the secret arrest and the bank looting, absolute flawless
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.880]  integration from Obama to Bush, but now the establishment can play the part of the left.
[09:56.880 --> 10:05.920]  And then, oh, Rick Perry and Sarah Palin, they're going to come soaring out in 2011 into 2012
[10:05.920 --> 10:11.000]  as your Republican presidential candidates.
[10:11.000 --> 10:12.720]  You heard it here first.
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.040]  I put them at the top of the ticket.
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.880]  They don't give me that, oh, we've already seen another president from Texas, George
[10:22.880 --> 10:23.880]  W. Bush.
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.680]  There's no way America's going to go for it.
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.480]  After people are done going through what they're going to go through in the next two years
[10:32.480 --> 10:37.520]  into the election cycle, they will worship George W. Bush.
[10:37.520 --> 10:42.080]  They will beg for him back because they're ignorant.
[10:42.080 --> 10:44.440]  They think Bush actually ran something.
[10:44.440 --> 10:46.280]  They think Obama's running something.
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.600]  I hear these fools on talk radio echoing Rick Perry's talking points of, Texas only
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.360]  got 5% unemployment, rest of the country got 10%.
[10:56.360 --> 10:59.800]  I think Perry's done pretty good for Texas.
[10:59.800 --> 11:06.320]  No, that'd be like if you had a strong swimmer and you tied a 20 pound weight around their
[11:06.320 --> 11:07.320]  ankle.
[11:07.320 --> 11:11.760]  Yeah, they could probably stay afloat for 10, 15 minutes before it pulled them under.
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.880]  But you don't praise the 20 pound bowling ball or dumbbell tied to your leg for the
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.120]  reason you're able to stay afloat.
[11:20.120 --> 11:26.200]  You do it because of the people that live in Texas and the resources and the skills
[11:26.200 --> 11:33.880]  we have in this second most populous, second most largest geographic area as well, second
[11:33.880 --> 11:38.040]  most populous, second largest geographically.
[11:38.040 --> 11:47.800]  You praise the swimmer for being able to stay afloat, not the bowling ball, not the
[11:47.800 --> 11:56.320]  lead shoes, not the cement buckets that the feet have been planted in.
[11:56.320 --> 11:59.920]  The whole country has had its feet planted in cement buckets.
[11:59.920 --> 12:11.080]  It's been thrown overboard and yeah, New York, Michigan, California, Florida, New Jersey,
[12:11.080 --> 12:20.840]  and many other states are going bankrupt, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois is officially
[12:20.840 --> 12:21.840]  bankrupt.
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.000]  That was all over the news the last week.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.480]  And so here come the bankers.
[12:27.480 --> 12:28.920]  They're going to save you.
[12:28.920 --> 12:30.760]  They're going to give you a hand out of the water.
[12:30.760 --> 12:32.920]  You're fighting or thrashing to stay above the water.
[12:32.920 --> 12:36.080]  You've got cement shoes on.
[12:36.080 --> 12:39.920]  You're about to go under and the bankers lean over the side of the boat.
[12:39.920 --> 12:48.180]  They're the ones that put you in the cement shoes and they, they drop a 40 pound bench
[12:48.180 --> 12:52.040]  press bar with 200 pounds on each end of it.
[12:52.040 --> 12:56.360]  So 240 pounds into your hands.
[12:56.360 --> 12:57.860]  That's your bailout.
[12:57.860 --> 12:58.960]  That's your jobs bill.
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.200]  That's your green jobs.
[13:04.200 --> 13:07.600]  You know, I don't come up with these ridiculous analogies beforehand.
[13:07.600 --> 13:12.320]  They just come out of me, but bear with me.
[13:12.320 --> 13:15.120]  The whole office just has an incredible headache.
[13:15.120 --> 13:17.920]  I live in Austin, Texas, the capital of allergies.
[13:17.920 --> 13:20.800]  You know, this is more than allergies.
[13:20.800 --> 13:25.040]  My grandmother, of course, grew up and lives in Austin.
[13:25.040 --> 13:32.600]  My mother grew up and lived in Austin her whole life and nobody had allergies.
[13:32.600 --> 13:36.520]  Now people are walking around like they're choking to death everywhere.
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.520]  It's the GMO food.
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.560]  It's the GMO pollen blowing around.
[13:42.560 --> 13:44.560]  It's the chemicals in the water.
[13:44.560 --> 13:47.680]  It's a cocktail of things.
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.520]  When I feel like I drank a half bottle of Jack Daniels last night and I didn't have any Jack
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.840]  Daniels folks.
[13:52.840 --> 13:59.520]  So did everybody in the office describe you as like a hangover or a fog?
[13:59.520 --> 14:03.720]  I mean, what is going on?
[14:03.720 --> 14:06.960]  They call it dragon ass.
[14:06.960 --> 14:10.440]  Okay.
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.360]  We've got the makers of shadow government.
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.680]  By the way, it's a really hot video.
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.520]  It's our hottest seller of anybody's book or video that we carry that wasn't produced
[14:22.520 --> 14:23.520]  by us.
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.600]  Our best seller is fall the republic in the next Obama deception, but shadow government
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.680]  is even outstripped sales of in game terror storm, fabled enemies, other films I produced
[14:35.680 --> 14:42.680]  and directed, which shows the market has spoken and when I told you this is a hot video and
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.320]  very informative with Daniel Estolin, Catherine Albrecht, G Edward Griffin and others.
[14:48.320 --> 14:49.720]  I'm in it.
[14:49.720 --> 14:53.520]  So we're going to break down the film.
[14:53.520 --> 14:56.120]  And there was so much material, they couldn't even put it all in there.
[14:56.120 --> 15:04.480]  And so we're talking about their next project as well with Andre Van Heerden and Jeffrey,
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.080]  Grant Jeffrey will be joining us coming up and then Declan McCullough.
[15:08.080 --> 15:10.320]  I've seen that news.
[15:10.320 --> 15:20.760]  But the media, as I said, is running around saying we don't know what's in the cyber security
[15:20.760 --> 15:21.760]  act.
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.800]  The White House won't tell us in this White House press release they put out yesterday
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.880]  that I've read over the media isn't just controlled.
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.320]  They're a bunch of lazy baboons.
[15:37.320 --> 15:39.440]  I don't know when it passed the house a few months ago.
[15:39.440 --> 15:40.440]  We read the house version.
[15:40.440 --> 15:41.880]  We've read the Senate version on air.
[15:41.880 --> 15:44.760]  We've gone over it line by line.
[15:44.760 --> 15:49.480]  We've written articles and info wars.com at prisonplanet.com.
[15:49.480 --> 15:54.360]  Mother Jones has seen it news has.
[15:54.360 --> 15:57.720]  It is the most draconian takeover of the internet ever seen.
[15:57.720 --> 16:01.840]  It makes what China has set up look like child's play.
[16:01.840 --> 16:08.320]  They just put up firewalls and block IP addresses and website addresses that they don't like
[16:08.320 --> 16:10.600]  on blacklist.
[16:10.600 --> 16:16.320]  No, this bill creates a, which is already being set up.
[16:16.320 --> 16:17.320]  They're already building it.
[16:17.320 --> 16:18.320]  They always do that.
[16:18.320 --> 16:21.800]  They always try to pass a bill after they've already built it.
[16:21.800 --> 16:31.280]  Total surveillance of everything you do on the web, internet service providers that give
[16:31.280 --> 16:39.400]  customer service or services of any type to more than a hundred people.
[16:39.400 --> 16:45.560]  That's tiny ISPs in the smallest towns.
[16:45.560 --> 16:51.080]  You have to put government software on your computers and comply with their hardware specifications.
[16:51.080 --> 16:59.000]  It creates licensing for anyone involved in any type of IT, any type of IT federal licensing
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.280]  or it's a felony.
[17:01.280 --> 17:07.760]  It establishes tens of billions a year in the colleges and high schools where the government
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.520]  literally makes the schools, they've been moving towards this for 20 years where the
[17:11.520 --> 17:14.880]  school tests you and then decides what you're going to be.
[17:14.880 --> 17:22.480]  And then like North Korea, like North Korea, communist Russia wasn't even this bad.
[17:22.480 --> 17:24.360]  Communist China isn't even this bad.
[17:24.360 --> 17:31.320]  They will decide what you're going to be and direct you for a out of high school scholarship
[17:31.320 --> 17:36.000]  where you go directly to work for Homeland Security.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.680]  All schools in the United States, England's doing the exact same thing, so is Europe.
[17:40.680 --> 17:47.440]  Your children, it's in the, it's in the bill, it's past the house, will be tested in computer
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.640]  labs that are compulsory under the federal guidelines that will be, oh great, you know,
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.680]  your class two hours a day, they will find the best and brightest and many of them will
[17:56.680 --> 18:02.240]  go directly into Homeland Security at a high school or they will advance you into college.
[18:02.240 --> 18:08.680]  So within four years of this passing, they will have tens of millions of high school
[18:08.680 --> 18:10.080]  and college graduates.
[18:10.080 --> 18:18.120]  And already the largest sector of scholarships and government grants for college, we passed
[18:18.120 --> 18:23.680]  this line about six years ago, is Homeland Security related data mining, spying, criminal
[18:23.680 --> 18:26.000]  justice.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.280]  They are converting the economy over to an armed spy camp and they're using the government
[18:32.280 --> 18:36.200]  to do it and money.
[18:36.200 --> 18:40.720]  They destroy the economy and all you can do is join the military or the police or be a
[18:40.720 --> 18:43.040]  IT manager.
[18:43.040 --> 18:46.720]  And I already knew this, but I've heard these guys call and talk radio and go, I'm getting
[18:46.720 --> 18:52.640]  out this year with a master's from A&M and we datamined everything you do, rental cars,
[18:52.640 --> 18:58.240]  hotels, where you travel on the web, psychological algorithms, until we keep America safe.
[18:58.240 --> 19:03.680]  Well, I'll never forget that particular call I heard, just so proud of it.
[19:03.680 --> 19:04.960]  And so that's how it works.
[19:04.960 --> 19:12.720]  They take your tax money and they then take over the entire educational process.
[19:12.720 --> 19:18.440]  See, it's not enough what Eisenhower in 1961 warned about the military industrial complex
[19:18.440 --> 19:26.400]  in control over 90% of raw research in private industry funding and in universities, psychology,
[19:26.400 --> 19:35.360]  biology, weapons, metallurgy, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, everything, computer
[19:35.360 --> 19:37.880]  engineering, everything.
[19:37.880 --> 19:44.640]  Now they go in and they only fund the universities and high schools to produce this already.
[19:44.640 --> 19:53.480]  Every major state in the union has military homeschools and my military homeschools.
[19:53.480 --> 20:01.600]  I mean, the military's taken over the public schools and so they're locally controlled
[20:01.600 --> 20:04.480]  and are in the community.
[20:04.480 --> 20:10.480]  And so the children leave their homes every day and go to a public school run by the Pentagon.
[20:10.480 --> 20:15.160]  This is not a private military school everywhere.
[20:15.160 --> 20:17.320]  Just it's a total conversion.
[20:17.320 --> 20:19.320]  This is what it's like to live in North Korea.
[20:19.320 --> 20:21.760]  The state controls everything.
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.800]  Incredibly rich families get even richer because they get all the contracts for this and it's
[20:25.800 --> 20:29.000]  an up, down vertically integrated economy.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.840]  Welcome to the new world order and from Australia to England to the United States.
[20:33.840 --> 20:36.840]  It's all identical being rolled out.
[20:36.840 --> 20:39.920]  I didn't even get started on cyber security.
[20:39.920 --> 20:47.440]  It's just NSA, Air Force, Pentagon run, giant spy centers already built all over the country,
[20:47.440 --> 20:55.200]  giant one just south of me in San Antonio and it's just a total criminal takeover and
[20:55.200 --> 21:23.000]  they're going to stage terror attacks and everything else you go along with it.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.080]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[21:26.080 --> 21:27.240]  It was empowering.
[21:27.240 --> 21:31.220]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[21:31.220 --> 21:34.060]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[21:34.060 --> 21:37.120]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[21:37.120 --> 21:38.120]  Thank you so much.
[21:38.120 --> 21:41.080]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the Boonys.
[21:41.080 --> 21:42.080]  Thanks again.
[21:42.080 --> 21:45.120]  Knowledge is power and that power brings peace.
[21:45.120 --> 21:48.620]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[21:48.620 --> 21:52.080]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.

[21:58.640 --> 21:59.640]  secret.
[21:59.640 --> 22:03.520]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:03.520 --> 22:07.960]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[22:07.960 --> 22:08.960]  for your IRA?
[22:08.960 --> 22:14.820]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the
[22:14.820 --> 22:20.660]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[22:20.660 --> 22:26.840]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs,
[22:26.840 --> 22:28.760]  yet no word about IRAs.
[22:28.760 --> 22:32.920]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[22:32.920 --> 22:34.240]  you in paper.
[22:34.240 --> 22:40.160]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[22:40.160 --> 22:44.680]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[22:44.680 --> 22:47.520]  Call 800-686-2237.
[22:47.520 --> 22:50.040]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.520]  Call 800-686-2237.
[22:53.520 --> 23:01.920]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[23:01.920 --> 23:05.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[23:05.640 --> 23:08.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.160]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[23:13.160 --> 23:14.160]  at home.
[23:14.160 --> 23:19.160]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[23:19.160 --> 23:20.160]  the shots.
[23:20.160 --> 23:25.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[23:25.160 --> 23:28.480]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[23:28.480 --> 23:34.280]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[23:34.280 --> 23:35.280]  world government.
[23:35.280 --> 23:39.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the
[23:39.320 --> 23:41.680]  Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[23:41.680 --> 23:47.680]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[23:47.680 --> 23:48.680]  of the republic.

[24:00.240 --> 24:05.400]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[24:05.400 --> 24:06.400]  company?
[24:06.400 --> 24:07.400]  Don't.
[24:07.400 --> 24:10.360]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[24:10.360 --> 24:11.360]  Why pay?
[24:11.360 --> 24:16.520]  When you can get their solution absolutely free, with New York Times bestselling author

[24:22.520 --> 24:23.520]  companies.
[24:23.520 --> 24:26.720]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[24:26.720 --> 24:27.720]  Here's Herb K.
[24:27.720 --> 24:31.880]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need
[24:31.880 --> 24:33.960]  to do it yourself for free.
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.240]  Herb K was right.
[24:35.240 --> 24:38.440]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[24:38.440 --> 24:39.880]  What have you got to lose?
[24:39.880 --> 24:43.520]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt and have more money.

[25:05.400 --> 25:11.160]  In my stacks of news today, a whole bunch of different states in the US are passing taxes
[25:11.160 --> 25:13.880]  on everybody's food at the grocery store.
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.400]  The worst dictatorships don't tend to do that.
[25:18.400 --> 25:20.920]  They're passing new gas taxes at the state level.
[25:20.920 --> 25:26.720]  They're passing new healthcare taxes when you go to a restaurant to eat.
[25:26.720 --> 25:36.040]  It's just a swarm of disease-locust grasshoppers blacking out the sun, landing on our fertile
[25:36.040 --> 25:42.360]  fields, eating us out of house and home, and the government and their parasite hordes are
[25:42.360 --> 25:48.200]  just getting started, and they're training the police to hate the public and to despise
[25:48.200 --> 25:55.520]  us and to use force on us instantly and to squeeze us and drive us into utter submission.
[25:55.520 --> 25:58.240]  It is not a pretty picture.
[25:58.240 --> 26:04.040]  I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven stacks of news here in front of me, but I want
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.080]  to open the phones up coming up in the next segment on any subject you wish you'd discuss.
[26:09.080 --> 26:21.640]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[26:21.640 --> 26:22.640]  Here's some of the news though.
[26:22.640 --> 26:24.040]  Let me just read headlines.
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.880]  Economist, another financial crisis on the way.
[26:28.880 --> 26:34.320]  Something group led by Nobel winner calls for stronger financial reforms.
[26:34.320 --> 26:36.360]  ABC News.
[26:36.360 --> 26:39.240]  Lawmakers cry jobs to push through bills.
[26:39.240 --> 26:40.760]  They're not calling it another stimulus.
[26:40.760 --> 26:42.480]  It's really a banker robbery.
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.960]  They're calling it jobs bills, as we told you months ago, internally leaks came out that
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.120]  we were going to call it a jobs bill, and here it is.
[26:52.120 --> 26:53.120]  Here's another one.
[26:53.120 --> 26:54.120]  New York Times.
[26:54.120 --> 26:56.120]  Fuel taxes must rise.
[26:56.120 --> 27:03.800]  Harvard Research says, yes, yes, we've got to raise your taxes.
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.080]  Justices may extend gun owners' rights nationwide.
[27:06.080 --> 27:10.400]  Oh, they're going to give us our rights, but then you read what the gun grabbers are saying.
[27:10.400 --> 27:12.120]  We've got Larry Pratt on this tomorrow.
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.240]  It looks like they're going to say, yes, you have a right at the state level, but the state
[27:16.240 --> 27:18.560]  also has a right to restrict that right.
[27:18.560 --> 27:22.160]  See, there's never been a ruling at the Supreme Court saying they can restrict the Second
[27:22.160 --> 27:25.360]  Amendment because it was just common law and common knowledge.
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.040]  There was no laws and rules because criminals won't follow laws to begin with.
[27:29.040 --> 27:31.720]  So why restrict citizens?
[27:31.720 --> 27:33.560]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[27:33.560 --> 27:35.240]  There's also a Wall Street Journal article.
[27:35.240 --> 27:41.480]  The flu season that fizzled, oh, cases of H1N1 have dwindled.
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.720]  Seasonal flu has been a no-show, and doctors wonder why.
[27:46.720 --> 27:52.280]  It was all a hoax, and we knew in January of last year, three months before the fear
[27:52.280 --> 27:59.120]  mongering started in Mexico in April, that the government was gearing up for something
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.920]  big dealing with the flu, and we said it may be staged, it may be real, but they are saying
[28:03.920 --> 28:07.160]  it ready for martial law.
[28:07.160 --> 28:08.840]  But you didn't go along with it.
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.240]  The mainstream media and government have no credibility, and now there's criminal investigations
[28:12.240 --> 28:18.400]  in Europe dealing with big pharma paying off the heads of the EU and World Health Organization.
[28:18.400 --> 28:19.600]  And I've got the graph here.
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.200]  We go live at PrismPlanet.TV later, I'm going to show this, tracking the flu.
[28:24.200 --> 28:29.640]  This is one of the lowest flu seasons on record, and they've now put out a report two weeks
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.640]  ago.
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.680]  The feds admit that the H1N1 vaccine didn't even protect you from the weak swine flu.
[28:35.680 --> 28:40.080]  A total hoax, but you got whatever it was.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.760]  They wanted you to get in those shots.
[28:41.760 --> 28:52.080]  The mercury, all the other goodies, parry to face showdown against white in November.
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.960]  White is a gun grabbing globalist.
[28:54.960 --> 28:57.320]  Rick Perry at least has to act like he's a conservative.
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.080]  Remember, this is a guy that said young girls had to take the Gardasil shot, but they admittedly
[29:02.080 --> 29:06.080]  was killing people in trials and did kill people once it went widespread.
[29:06.080 --> 29:07.080]  That was a hoax.
[29:07.080 --> 29:11.720]  They told the state health department to put it on the list of recommended vaccines for
[29:11.720 --> 29:13.600]  school or college entrance.
[29:13.600 --> 29:17.480]  They don't tell you there's a waiver form.
[29:17.480 --> 29:21.760]  And of course, he's the guy that brought you the NAFTA superhighways and kept vetoing
[29:21.760 --> 29:24.640]  the legislature.
[29:24.640 --> 29:25.640]  But it doesn't matter.
[29:25.640 --> 29:33.720]  Republicans are feeling real good right now about governor hair, the guy that's got the
[29:33.720 --> 29:34.720]  great hair.
[29:34.720 --> 29:35.720]  That's what matters.
[29:35.720 --> 29:41.600]  He talks with a West Texas accent, so he must be good.
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.560]  But the bigger news here is he did act like a patriot.
[29:45.560 --> 29:50.200]  He did claim he wanted to succeed or have 10th Amendment powers declared.
[29:50.200 --> 29:58.480]  He did play the part of an anti-New World Order person and look at how he won.
[29:58.480 --> 30:01.680]  An unprecedented third term.
[30:01.680 --> 30:05.200]  He finished up two years at George W. Bush, so he's been in 10 years.
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.880]  He'll be in 14 years.
[30:09.880 --> 30:10.880]  But there's no term limits.
[30:10.880 --> 30:15.920]  He may just be governor for life, though they're positioning him for president.
[30:15.920 --> 30:16.920]  Mark my words.
[30:16.920 --> 30:26.640]  But the good news is this vision of America, a constitutional patriot vision, is popular.
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.720]  And all over the country, Republicans that sing to that sheet of music are winning.
[30:31.720 --> 30:33.960]  And that again tells you we are the majority.
[30:33.960 --> 30:40.200]  Ron Paul has an 84% approval rating with Texas voters.
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.200]  That was out yesterday.
[30:41.200 --> 30:42.200]  84%.
[30:42.200 --> 30:46.640]  No other congressman in the country has that.
[30:46.640 --> 30:50.720]  Big news blitz your phone calls coming up.
[30:50.720 --> 30:52.000]  We're on the march.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.480]  The empire's on the run.
[30:54.480 --> 31:00.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[31:00.200 --> 31:01.280]  What's your home worth?
[31:01.280 --> 31:05.480]  How can you compare local real estate agents and how do you get MLS listings for the entire
[31:05.480 --> 31:06.480]  country?
[31:06.480 --> 31:09.760]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your
[31:09.760 --> 31:14.240]  house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[31:14.240 --> 31:17.800]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[31:17.800 --> 31:20.240]  It's so easy and best of all, it's free.

[32:01.960 --> 32:05.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[32:05.720 --> 32:08.880]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[32:08.880 --> 32:13.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[32:13.200 --> 32:14.200]  at home.
[32:14.200 --> 32:19.360]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[32:19.360 --> 32:20.360]  shots.
[32:20.360 --> 32:25.200]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[32:25.200 --> 32:28.520]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[32:28.520 --> 32:34.320]  The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[32:34.320 --> 32:35.320]  world government.
[32:35.320 --> 32:37.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[32:37.760 --> 32:41.680]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[32:41.680 --> 32:47.800]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[32:47.800 --> 32:48.800]  of the Republic.

[34:20.600 --> 34:27.440]  Also, I've been lacking last few weeks in playing questions from the info wars comment
[34:27.440 --> 34:31.680]  line where you can call in any time you wish and leave a question or comment.
[34:31.680 --> 34:40.120]  We'll get to it here on air sometimes got a caller asking if I believe a sudden onset
[34:40.120 --> 34:43.920]  of earthquakes may be related to harp.
[34:43.920 --> 34:49.640]  Another one out of Quebec, Canada caller states that Copenhagen tax is passing in the form
[34:49.640 --> 34:51.240]  of gas tax in Quebec.
[34:51.240 --> 34:52.240]  Yes, I was aware of that.
[34:52.240 --> 34:54.160]  We'll talk about it.
[34:54.160 --> 34:59.440]  So Robert asks if governors can call the National Guard troops home.
[34:59.440 --> 35:06.480]  So we will talk about that coming up after we talk to Rene, Jeff, Sean, Seth, Rusty,
[35:06.480 --> 35:13.920]  and others and go through a ton of other news.
[35:13.920 --> 35:17.960]  Genesis does not have an accurate affiliate list up on their website, but I know they're
[35:17.960 --> 35:22.480]  working on getting that together properly, and I thought I would just tell you the new
[35:22.480 --> 35:27.840]  stations that have picked up this radio broadcast in the last week, we're gaining a new affiliates
[35:27.840 --> 35:28.840]  every week.
[35:28.840 --> 35:34.960]  Now the radio show is exploding both terrestrially and on satellite radio.
[35:34.960 --> 35:40.560]  They put their toe in the water about a year ago, putting me on three hours a day on Saturdays
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.160]  from the Friday show, and they're still carrying that and putting their toe in the water a little
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.160]  bit deeper.
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.960]  Now they're up to their ankle with one hour a night.
[35:51.960 --> 35:54.720]  So let me tell you, we're on XM Channel 158.
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.680]  It's taking the fourth hour starting this week of the Monday through Friday show and
[35:59.680 --> 36:02.920]  running it from 8 to 9 p.m. central time.
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.520]  Brandiga didn't say if this was central.
[36:04.520 --> 36:06.520]  John, is this central for sure?
[36:06.520 --> 36:10.480]  Yeah, let's double, double check that.
[36:10.480 --> 36:19.480]  But whatever, 8, 9 o'clock, whatever time zone on XM 158.
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.040]  So it's 8 p.m. central, okay.
[36:23.040 --> 36:31.640]  And then K E Y S 1440 a.m. Corpus Christi is taking both hours of the Sunday show live.
[36:31.640 --> 36:33.240]  I just love Port Aransas down there.
[36:33.240 --> 36:40.120]  I've lived down there if I could K L R G 880 a.m. 50,000 Watts Little Rock, Arkansas taking
[36:40.120 --> 36:53.440]  all four hours of the show with a one hour delay W I F L 104.3 f.m. in Florida from Gainesville
[36:53.440 --> 37:04.920]  to North Tampa is running the show from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. K M L S 100.1.9 f.m. and Carl's
[37:04.920 --> 37:14.080]  Bad New Mexico, that's another cool town that'll love Carl's Bad Caverns K M L S 101.9 f.m.
[37:14.080 --> 37:22.120]  taking the show daily from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. And then also rearing us on Saturday and
[37:22.120 --> 37:28.040]  Sunday W T A N 1340 a.m. in Tampa, Florida.
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.120]  Went from only taking one hour of the show nearly morning to running the show live from
[37:32.120 --> 37:37.920]  2 to 3 p.m. and more on the way.
[37:37.920 --> 37:44.440]  So look, you can't have the head of the IMF calling for world government and a new world
[37:44.440 --> 37:50.440]  currency and every other world leader calling for world government and then have the media
[37:50.440 --> 37:54.080]  making fun of me and calling me a liar when I talk about it.
[37:54.080 --> 37:57.480]  I mean, the show is almost passé.
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.360]  I mean, everything we've talked about has come true and unfolded and do you want the
[38:02.360 --> 38:08.760]  next phase of this to unfold because it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[38:08.760 --> 38:14.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, under this new world order, it's all written down by the UN and
[38:14.040 --> 38:21.120]  by the top fortune 100, what they're setting up a global private corporate dictatorship
[38:21.120 --> 38:29.000]  that wants to bankrupt you that thinks you're consuming too much.
[38:29.000 --> 38:43.400]  And they're using psychology and social engineering to get the job done.
[38:43.400 --> 38:46.840]  Po talk from the Southern Poverty Law Center was on MSNBC.
[38:46.840 --> 38:51.880]  I'm going to play it later in the show today and analyze it.
[38:51.880 --> 38:58.320]  He was on there two days ago, Paul Watson's got an article up on prisonplanet.com about
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.560]  it in a separate article by Curt Nemo also covering all the demonization and he says
[39:03.560 --> 39:12.080]  there's these crazy people and in the Southern Poverty Law Center report, they list mainline
[39:12.080 --> 39:22.760]  Congress people and they list former Congressman Tom Tancredo and say he's bad and they demonize
[39:22.760 --> 39:34.080]  me and they say we're crazy and believe there's a world government being formed as if po talk
[39:34.080 --> 39:39.720]  can sit up there and say there is not any water in the Atlantic Ocean.
[39:39.720 --> 39:49.440]  I am po talk, I speak from the mountain, I am God, I say so and so it is so.
[39:49.440 --> 39:56.320]  So let it be written, so let it be done and they get up all over TV and say you are not
[39:56.320 --> 40:00.880]  allowed to talk about the new world order or global government or banks robbing you.
[40:00.880 --> 40:04.680]  If you do, you're a Ku Klux Klan member.
[40:04.680 --> 40:09.120]  You are not allowed to call the government health care socialist or you hate black people
[40:09.120 --> 40:12.120]  and they say that on the newscast that it's racism.
[40:12.120 --> 40:14.680]  I mean, it doesn't work anymore.
[40:14.680 --> 40:16.180]  You're not God.
[40:16.180 --> 40:19.600]  You're discredited idiots.
[40:19.600 --> 40:29.160]  Everyone knows you're trying to set the political parameters of kosher discussion that you control
[40:29.160 --> 40:39.520]  reality and you don't control reality.
[40:39.520 --> 40:44.880]  It's very simple, but they think you're so weak minded and they think that you'll just
[40:44.880 --> 40:49.800]  go off of what is seen as politically correct and popular that they can sit there on the
[40:49.800 --> 40:55.720]  same news channels announcing world government and on the next show come out and say dangerous
[40:55.720 --> 41:00.680]  crazies believe a world government's being formed and they're they're evil and they're
[41:00.680 --> 41:03.840]  going to attack us.
[41:03.840 --> 41:07.920]  Now I talked to the very start of the radio broadcast today about the fact that and Michael
[41:07.920 --> 41:10.080]  Savage agrees with me.
[41:10.080 --> 41:11.960]  Many others do.
[41:11.960 --> 41:14.840]  We know that Bill Clinton's people bombed Oklahoma City.
[41:14.840 --> 41:24.480]  That's even come out in federal documents that the FBI ran the whole operation.
[41:24.480 --> 41:26.320]  They are going to play the terror card.
[41:26.320 --> 41:32.120]  There is nothing they can do but play that card and they're clearly prepping everyone
[41:32.120 --> 41:34.560]  for that to happen.
[41:34.560 --> 41:38.520]  And I've been saying, I believe they're going to stage a terror attack in Austin and you
[41:38.520 --> 41:45.040]  saw the Joe Stack attack and now it turns out that the person that owned the hanger
[41:45.040 --> 41:51.080]  that had a few small planes in it worked in remote control aircraft for L three and was
[41:51.080 --> 41:55.560]  in the homeland security and then you've got his family saying he didn't write the letter
[41:55.560 --> 41:59.400]  and witnesses saying no one was in the plane and witnesses saying emergency equipment was
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.240]  there beforehand and the FBI was out there beforehand and then all that was confirmed
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.240]  and then you've got the government grandstanding and Geithner coming down and playing victim.
[42:09.240 --> 42:12.280]  It has all the hallmarks of a staged event.
[42:12.280 --> 42:23.680]  But regardless, they've got TV documentaries from HBO to MSNBC all in production on five
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.640]  cable channels I know of to air in the middle of April.
[42:29.640 --> 42:36.000]  They had Chris Matthews people down here interviewing me for one of them.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.440]  And it's just like they mass troops around Afghanistan before they stage 9 11 or they
[42:41.440 --> 42:45.280]  start massing troops in Yemen before they stage the underwear bombing.
[42:45.280 --> 42:51.680]  And if you didn't know and just tuned in, that is absolutely staged Detroit news reported
[42:51.680 --> 42:55.600]  the State Department admitted they were ordered by the CIA to protect the underwear bomber
[42:55.600 --> 42:57.360]  to get him on the plane.
[42:57.360 --> 42:58.960]  And then it just goes on from there.
[42:58.960 --> 42:59.960]  It's unbelievable.
[42:59.960 --> 43:07.360]  And they sell the body scanners and the police stayed new wars out of it.
[43:07.360 --> 43:12.840]  They have to pre produce all these television shows and I happen to know from inside sources
[43:12.840 --> 43:14.720]  what's in several of them.
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.960]  It's all about how the tea parties are violent and are going to kill people and how they're
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.120]  tied in with extremists and white supremacists.
[43:23.120 --> 43:28.440]  And it's all being pre produced to air when they stage the terror attack in the middle
[43:28.440 --> 43:29.440]  of April.
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.960]  Now, by exposing this right now, they may not do it.
[43:34.960 --> 43:41.560]  But I went on air in January last year, three months, three and a half months before April
[43:41.560 --> 43:43.480]  in Mexico in the flu outbreak.
[43:43.480 --> 43:46.840]  And I said, all I know is I've got all these internal documents that they're getting the
[43:46.840 --> 43:49.840]  Bureau of Cemetery's and major states.
[43:49.840 --> 43:54.280]  We posted the memos state of New York letterhead.
[43:54.280 --> 43:57.160]  We had the emergency manager on from Indiana.
[43:57.160 --> 44:00.360]  They had Illinois officials there across the border saying it ready for millions dead from
[44:00.360 --> 44:03.960]  Chicago buried out here in your cornfields.
[44:03.960 --> 44:06.720]  And I went on air and I said, I don't know what they're doing with the flu, but they
[44:06.720 --> 44:10.400]  say they're going to have martial law and they may not do it.
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.280]  It may just be a drill, but they're certainly gearing up for it and look what happened.
[44:15.280 --> 44:21.320]  And I believe our being aware of this and watching their preparatory brainwashing, they're
[44:21.320 --> 44:27.160]  conditioning for this, got enough people pre positioned to know what was going on that
[44:27.160 --> 44:32.280]  once they launched their operation, we were on top of it, all of us together day one and
[44:32.280 --> 44:41.680]  that we disarmed this ticking time bomb that Obama was going to use, but the military industrial
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.040]  complex is going to use the smoke screen and an even bigger takeover of our society and
[44:46.040 --> 44:50.560]  the banks even looting us at a more accelerated rate.
[44:50.560 --> 44:54.440]  And they may stage an attack on Iran as the smoke screen, or it may be an even bigger
[44:54.440 --> 45:01.040]  financial collapse, but I'm telling you the main opposition to the new world order banking
[45:01.040 --> 45:07.760]  takeover is libertarian conservative in the fed constitutional groups, pro second amendment
[45:07.760 --> 45:11.680]  groups, groups that don't want more taxes, people that don't want America to turn into
[45:11.680 --> 45:16.680]  100% government system.
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.960]  And so they are going to stage something in April, I believe, and I've seen them do this
[45:21.960 --> 45:22.960]  before.
[45:22.960 --> 45:27.000]  I've seen them start the bin Laden programs.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  He's going to get you.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  He's going to attack watch out and then it happens.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.680]  I saw that before 9 11 and I'm seeing the drumbeat even harder now.
[45:36.680 --> 45:40.120]  There's a big article from Paul Watson that details it up at present planet.com right
[45:40.120 --> 45:41.120]  now.
[45:41.120 --> 45:42.120]  Okay.
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.520]  Let's go to some of your calls.
[45:44.520 --> 45:46.680]  Renny in Utah, you're on the air.
[45:46.680 --> 45:52.680]  Hey, Alex, I just want to kind of get something off my chest and make a short and sweet.
[45:52.680 --> 45:53.680]  I am a Mormon.
[45:53.680 --> 45:57.720]  I'm a veteran and I despise Glenn Beck.
[45:57.720 --> 46:02.480]  I know he's a Mormon, but you know, not trying to turn anything into religious wars.
[46:02.480 --> 46:04.760]  I don't trust Mitt Romney either.
[46:04.760 --> 46:12.480]  I do love Ron Paul and I'm a follower of Deborah Medina and I love what you're doing, Alex.
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.160]  And I just wanted to get that off my chest.
[46:16.160 --> 46:19.400]  What because a caller called in talking about Mormons yesterday?
[46:19.400 --> 46:25.480]  Well, yeah, there was an earlier caller today talking about Glenn Beck and his white horse
[46:25.480 --> 46:27.520]  prophecy and all that.
[46:27.520 --> 46:35.120]  You know, the Mormon church does not officially, they tell the members that that's not something
[46:35.120 --> 46:36.120]  we teach.
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.240]  I mean, that's just kind of rumor stuff.
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.600]  And Glenn Beck, I think the guy's just a fruitcake and he doesn't speak for the Mormon
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.600]  church.
[46:44.600 --> 46:51.360]  He says, you know, most of my friends, we listen to you, we like Ron Paul and you know,
[46:51.360 --> 46:54.440]  we kind of see through Glenn Beck's smoke screens and all that.
[46:54.440 --> 46:58.880]  Well, I noticed that, I mean, I mean, I've noticed that grassroots Mormons are big supporters
[46:58.880 --> 47:03.480]  of this show and statistically, you know, for a very small minority group, what, two,
[47:03.480 --> 47:08.640]  three percent of the country or even less, that most Mormons I run into are listeners
[47:08.640 --> 47:09.920]  of the show.
[47:09.920 --> 47:12.640]  So I appreciate your call, Renny.
[47:12.640 --> 47:14.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in New York.
[47:14.840 --> 47:16.240]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[47:16.240 --> 47:17.240]  Yes.
[47:17.240 --> 47:18.240]  Thank you very much.
[47:18.240 --> 47:19.240]  My name is Jeffrey Smith.
[47:19.240 --> 47:24.680]  I'm the director of the American Free Press and I want to call in to your show.
[47:24.680 --> 47:28.680]  There is something going on here in Manhattan, which is very disturbing and it does tells
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.760]  exactly what you're saying over the last three months for whatever reason, New York
[47:34.760 --> 47:40.720]  City, New York state has pulled tremendous amounts of police and MTA workers out of the
[47:40.720 --> 47:42.120]  subway system.
[47:42.120 --> 47:45.520]  You can now wander around for hours down there.
[47:45.520 --> 47:47.520]  And that was done before 777.
[47:47.520 --> 47:50.080]  That was done on 9-11.
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.240]  It was done in 1993 when the feds bombed the World Trade Center.
[47:54.240 --> 47:55.400]  And again, that's on record.
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.480]  Cook the bomb, train the driver, Burmese's film, and I've never seen this or heard it
[47:59.480 --> 48:00.480]  before.
[48:00.480 --> 48:01.480]  I've read it in the New York Times.
[48:01.480 --> 48:08.000]  He has the actual declassified audio tapes of the FBI ordering them to cook the bomb
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.400]  and let the bombing go forward.
[48:09.400 --> 48:10.400]  But side issue.
[48:10.400 --> 48:11.400]  Sorry.
[48:11.400 --> 48:12.400]  Okay.
[48:12.400 --> 48:17.280]  What should be the case is that this has created so many ways, so many cops have come to me
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.040]  and said they're so disturbed about the fact that this forced reduction.
[48:22.040 --> 48:23.040]  That's called the...
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.000]  They pulled the security off the World Trade Center the month before.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.280]  That's New York Daily News.
[48:28.280 --> 48:29.280]  All right.
[48:29.280 --> 48:30.280]  Now look.
[48:30.280 --> 48:35.640]  The thing is that tomorrow there is going to be a tremendous rally in protest against
[48:35.640 --> 48:37.440]  the security reduction.
[48:37.440 --> 48:43.120]  At the Fashion Institute of Technology, 7th Avenue and 27th Street, it's going to start
[48:43.120 --> 48:49.480]  at 5 p.m., 7th Avenue and 27th Street, Fashion Institute of Technology, there is going to
[48:49.480 --> 48:55.240]  be a large number of public groups there, and every patriot in the sound of my voice
[48:55.240 --> 49:00.560]  that is in this New York area should be there to yell bloody murder, and they should directly
[49:00.560 --> 49:09.280]  say to the board, the MTA board, you are getting ready to stage an event, a terrorist
[49:09.280 --> 49:10.280]  event.
[49:10.280 --> 49:11.280]  Why is that?
[49:11.280 --> 49:18.840]  If you were here, you would see the tremendous crescendo of criticism of the banks, of how
[49:18.840 --> 49:21.560]  things have been run, of the financing.
[49:21.560 --> 49:24.240]  People are openly talking in the streets about the value of the...
[49:24.240 --> 49:30.800]  And there was open talk of arresting the Federal Reserve Board in 1920, and so they staged
[49:30.800 --> 49:36.280]  a bombing attack on Wall Street that killed a bunch of people, and I appreciate your call,
[49:36.280 --> 49:37.280]  Jeff.
[49:37.280 --> 49:40.800]  Now, some people are probably saying, this sounds schizophrenic.
[49:40.800 --> 49:47.240]  This is always saying, stop the Viper team, stop the warrantless searches, stop the checkpoints
[49:47.240 --> 49:49.120]  and subways all over the country.
[49:49.120 --> 49:54.200]  Well, yeah, because the government is staging it, and if you do have a loan nut that does
[49:54.200 --> 50:00.280]  something sometime, I'd rather have that than lose my freedoms, because the danger of a
[50:00.280 --> 50:05.560]  government taking over your society is always statistically much worse than loan groups
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.720]  or small organizations that do exist sometimes.
[50:09.720 --> 50:12.680]  There's only one group that's ever attacked the New York subways.
[50:12.680 --> 50:19.920]  It was declassified in 1977 by the church committee in 1968.
[50:19.920 --> 50:24.640]  Multiple cases of a dangerous biological weapon still classified, it's declassified that they
[50:24.640 --> 50:31.000]  did it, just not what it was, were time released out of light bulbs.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.680]  Death resulted, details remain classified, 1968 U.S. government murdered people going
[50:37.680 --> 50:39.440]  to work on the U.S. subways.
[50:39.440 --> 50:43.680]  They took days to kill them, whatever it was, and they had Pentagon doctors placed in the
[50:43.680 --> 50:48.600]  local hospitals to not treat them, but watch how they died.
[50:48.600 --> 50:51.960]  That's declassified.
[50:51.960 --> 50:54.480]  So there's only one group ever to attack the New York subway.
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.560]  Again, if you've got a group that's always killing people and always testing nerve gas
[50:58.560 --> 51:02.440]  on troops and always doing things like this, then that's always your main suspect, who
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.640]  stands to gain, who gets to play the part of the victims, who gets to have a police
[51:05.640 --> 51:06.640]  state.
[51:06.640 --> 51:11.400]  People are saying this sounds schizophrenic, no, Jeff is absolutely right.
[51:11.400 --> 51:15.640]  What we're saying is, suddenly, and I've seen these reports, they've pulled almost all
[51:15.640 --> 51:20.280]  security out of there, and they always do that, and then they'll come back with even
[51:20.280 --> 51:24.400]  more later after they stage it, to sell you on accepting it.
[51:24.400 --> 51:28.040]  But yes, I've seen the reports of them the last two weeks pulling almost all of the police
[51:28.040 --> 51:34.040]  out of the subways, which isn't good because everybody I know from New York's been mugged
[51:34.040 --> 51:39.040]  or attempted to be mugged, Rob Jacobson had to get in a few little tussles with people
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.520]  trying to take his watch his parents gave him on the subway.
[51:44.520 --> 51:48.000]  I mean, it's pretty scary on the New York subway, especially late at night.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.400]  I've been on that thing at like 3 a.m. and let me tell you, you'd like to see some cops,
[51:53.400 --> 51:57.400]  but they're always there at rush hour when there's not really a danger.
[51:57.400 --> 52:00.360]  We'll be right back.
[52:00.360 --> 52:05.760]  A revolution in smoking is underway, a revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should
[52:05.760 --> 52:06.760]  know about.

[53:02.520 --> 53:06.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[53:06.280 --> 53:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[53:13.760 --> 53:14.760]  at home.
[53:14.760 --> 53:19.400]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[53:19.400 --> 53:20.400]  calling the shots.
[53:20.400 --> 53:25.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[53:25.600 --> 53:31.240]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[53:31.240 --> 53:35.880]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[53:35.880 --> 53:38.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[53:38.320 --> 53:42.320]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[53:42.320 --> 53:48.320]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[53:48.320 --> 53:49.320]  of the Republic.

[55:17.880 --> 55:19.920]  We are in a critical juncture.
[55:19.920 --> 55:27.000]  The New World Order has already taken over, now they're trying to bring us into full bondage.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.360]  Sean in Texas, you are on the air.
[55:30.360 --> 55:31.360]  Yes, sir.
[55:31.360 --> 55:33.360]  How are you doing, Alex?
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.360]  Good.
[55:34.360 --> 55:35.360]  Good.
[55:35.360 --> 55:39.080]  Yeah, I just real quick just wanted to say, you know, first off, thank you very, very much
[55:39.080 --> 55:41.720]  for everything that you're doing.
[55:41.720 --> 55:46.760]  And you know, basically, I just wanted to come in and talk a little bit about the currency
[55:46.760 --> 55:49.400]  situation thing with the Federal Reserve.
[55:49.400 --> 55:55.080]  You know, I just really think that, you know, and you've been talking about different solutions
[55:55.080 --> 55:56.480]  and stuff that can be done.
[55:56.480 --> 55:59.480]  You know, basically, you know, get rid of Federal Reserve and whatnot.
[55:59.480 --> 56:05.600]  You know, my big issue is why are we even using a currency that's not backed by anything
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.400]  that basically, you know, we basically are, you know, buying and selling debt, you know,
[56:10.400 --> 56:14.440]  and giving, you know, the big corporations, you know, the private banks even more controlled.
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.200]  It's a debt based system where from day one under a Federal Reserve banking cartel, more
[56:19.200 --> 56:21.720]  debt is created that can ever be paid back.
[56:21.720 --> 56:26.440]  Here's the reason I'm not, and people misrepresent when I'm for, we just had debates and discussions
[56:26.440 --> 56:29.640]  with monetary experts on different sides about it.
[56:29.640 --> 56:36.040]  I personally am not for a gold back currency because the banks, the very bankers have used
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.480]  all their fiat money to buy up most the real gold.
[56:39.480 --> 56:44.520]  Then they would have a new dictatorship, a financial dictatorship.
[56:44.520 --> 56:50.520]  If that happened, I am for the Congress and the American people that elect them deciding
[56:50.520 --> 56:58.760]  what monetary system we want and phasing us out of this debt money system that we have,
[56:58.760 --> 57:03.800]  and you know, we could be backed by something maybe like silver, because that is something
[57:03.800 --> 57:08.160]  the globalists don't have full control over, or it could be partially gold back with some
[57:08.160 --> 57:09.360]  silver backing as well.
[57:09.360 --> 57:14.000]  But you can always run into the inflation, deflation manipulations, but as long as the
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.720]  government's just issuing it itself and not having to create debt to get it, then the
[57:18.720 --> 57:24.200]  money is just the symbol of the agreed upon mode of exchange, so we get past a barter
[57:24.200 --> 57:25.200]  system.
[57:25.200 --> 57:29.480]  Why are we even, you know, why do we even, you know, need to move past barter system?
[57:29.480 --> 57:32.560]  Why don't we, and there's, you know, and I don't know if you're familiar at all, you
[57:32.560 --> 57:36.720]  know, with some of the different, you know, some of private companies and whatnot online,
[57:36.720 --> 57:41.760]  itech.com is one of them where they basically use a barter system, you know, with different
[57:41.760 --> 57:45.000]  businesses and whatnot, and you can sell stuff on barter, you can sell stuff on trade
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.680]  map, you know, different type of currency that they use on there as well.
[57:48.680 --> 57:54.400]  Well, I am for truly local communities, and having that at the micro level, it's just
[57:54.400 --> 57:59.040]  for this complex world and all the trade that goes on, I mean, we need currencies, it just
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.480]  doesn't need to be in the hands of private banks, but I appreciate your call.
[58:02.480 --> 58:03.480]  Interesting point, Sean.
[58:03.480 --> 58:05.680]  Seth, in California, you're on the air.
[58:05.680 --> 58:07.680]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[58:07.680 --> 58:08.680]  How you doing?
[58:08.680 --> 58:09.680]  Worldwide broadcast.
[58:09.680 --> 58:10.680]  What's going on with you?
[58:10.680 --> 58:15.280]  I'm doing good, I have to keep a list here, so I know what to talk about, because listening
[58:15.280 --> 58:20.360]  to you, I just start to think of more things to say, but I just want to say we got in-game
[58:20.360 --> 58:24.160]  off of our Netflix, watch it with my wife, it was great, I've been listening to you about
[58:24.160 --> 58:28.400]  a year, but it was really good to just watch that and get a whole new perspective on what's
[58:28.400 --> 58:29.400]  going on.
[58:29.400 --> 58:34.920]  Well, thank you, yes, in-game and terror storm are on Netflix, go ahead.
[58:34.920 --> 58:38.880]  I have an opinion about the false flag attack coming, but I think it's going to be on the
[58:38.880 --> 58:42.600]  internet, actually, I don't know if it's going to be like a 9-11 style.
[58:42.600 --> 58:46.000]  Oh, I agree, they're gearing up for false flag attacks on the web, but they will launch
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.040]  themselves as a pretext to take it over.
[58:48.040 --> 58:52.960]  Completely, and I don't ever hear you really talk about ACTA too much, I mean, I don't
[58:52.960 --> 58:58.800]  listen every single day, I try to, but the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement that's
[58:58.800 --> 59:00.280]  going on with the internet.
[59:00.280 --> 59:04.000]  Absolutely, the secret internet treaty that's now been leaked.
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.040]  Yes, it's crazy because the reason they're doing it, it's not even a treaty because it's
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.240]  a trade agreement so that it can bypass Congress, just like the EPA with the carbon tax.
[59:14.240 --> 59:19.360]  But it really is a treaty, we've got Declan McCullough coming up in T-minus one hour to
[59:19.360 --> 59:21.720]  talk about that, anything else, Seth?
[59:21.720 --> 59:25.600]  You know, anyone who listens to Tom Foulden should give him a call because he mentions
[59:25.600 --> 59:30.360]  you a lot, but doesn't give you credit for anything, so I was about it.
[59:30.360 --> 59:32.840]  What do you mean he mentions me a lot?
[59:32.840 --> 59:37.840]  He kind of talks a lot about you, says that you make up things about 9-11, and I want
[59:37.840 --> 59:38.840]  to...
[59:38.840 --> 59:39.840]  Well, good for him, I don't even know who he is.
[59:39.840 --> 59:40.840]  You are listening to GCN.
[59:40.840 --> 59:41.840]  Visit GCNLive.com today.

[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:34.280]  Another example, buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[1:00:34.280 --> 1:00:39.640]  You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.

[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:55.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:01:04.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:09.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:10.560]  You want answers?
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:12.720]  Well, so does he.
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:16.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:25.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:33.240]  For number two, March 3rd in 2010, you're taking your calls in the next couple of segments.
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:37.680]  You're going to be joined by the makers of shadow government on the global elite, trying
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:41.440]  to destroy your freedom.
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:47.440]  Amazing documentary film, the Declan McCullough breaking down the Cyber Security Act, and
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.800]  a lot more coming up in the next hour.
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:56.160]  And a bunch of other important news, the media is now seeing it ready for another financial
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:57.160]  collapse.
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:58.760]  You've got to accept the new Bank of the World.
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:00.720]  The banks have to set up a world government.
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:02.640]  Only that will save you.
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:06.360]  Everything is going according to their plan, except the people are really waking up and
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:09.160]  getting upset.
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:10.920]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:13.320]  Rusty in Iowa, you're on the air.
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:16.160]  Hey, Alex, what's going on?
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.040]  Worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:23.240]  Well, I just noticed that you guys were talking a little bit about the vaccines earlier.
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.240]  My son's autistic.
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.120]  He's six now.
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:32.480]  And I did see regression after his two-year shots, and every six months they gave him
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:33.480]  a battery of shots.
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:38.040]  Well, my second child is an autistic because I did research after listening to your program
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:43.680]  and had them given one shot at a time instead of combining the stuff.
[1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:49.080]  The media says that this British doctor who lives in Austin is discredited, but if you
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:51.960]  actually read his research, it's not discredited.
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:53.960]  And there's all the other big studies.
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:58.520]  Meanwhile, the studies the government pushes saying Mercury's good for your child's brain
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.240]  have been proven to be total frauds.
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:02.960]  I saw something on ABC about that.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:06.640]  The British doctor, they're smearing his character now saying that he was doing that
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:11.560]  because he was developing his own vaccine and it was, you know, he was being greedy
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.320]  and trying to make money off of it.
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:19.160]  And that's just not, I mean, no, he was promoting Mercury's free vaccines.
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:24.160]  And he did the medical testing and taking the blood himself, which is completely ethical.
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:28.520]  I mean, there's all sorts of drugs being developed by doctors and people.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:34.240]  My dad has worked on developing drugs with other big companies.
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.680]  I mean, that's just what's done.
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:37.680]  Right.
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:44.120]  Well, it's just, it's insane to me how they can sit there and tell you something and then
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  say something completely different.
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:50.240]  I mean, the guy's research does prove to be accurate as far as I can tell.
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:57.320]  Well, we know this 20, 21 years ago, the national statistic was one in 25,000.
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:03.080]  Now it's one in 65 or 68, depending on the numbers and you hear national ads saying one
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:04.080]  in 150.
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:10.800]  Now, I mean, look, the vaccines in their own internal memos, they know what they're doing.
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:16.280]  In 2000, there was a secret meeting at the CDC, it was declassified 2002, even ABC News
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:21.120]  covered it, where the head of the CDC said, I would never give this to my grandchildren.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.160]  We've got to cover this up.
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:30.000]  That's very shocking and it shouldn't be, though, I mean, if they're willing to do other
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.880]  things to us like a population control and things like that, then why would this be any
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:35.880]  different?
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:39.440]  Yeah, all they do is run around and say, we need to drug your water to sterilize you.
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:40.440]  It's reasonable.
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:41.440]  It's good.
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:42.440]  There's too many of you.
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:45.400]  Your carbon footprint, humans are bad, but we have a shot for you.
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:47.520]  We're your friends.
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:48.520]  Trust us.
[1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:49.520]  We like you.
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:50.520]  We're friends.
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:51.520]  Drink some fluoride.
[1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:54.440]  Yes, all the studies show it attacks your organs and bones, but it doesn't matter.
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:55.880]  Don't listen to conspiracy theorists.
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:56.880]  Take it.
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:57.880]  Take it.
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:04:58.880]  It's good.
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:04:59.880]  We love you.
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:03.920]  And the one thing that really kind of sticks out to me is, you know, I've been listening
[1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:09.160]  to you for a couple of years now and a lot of people, when I mentioned that I listened
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:12.880]  to you, they say that I'm crazy and it's not because I listened to you.
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:16.400]  It's because I believe everything that you say and I don't believe everything that you
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:17.400]  say.
[1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:21.000]  If I don't think you're telling me the truth, I go look it up like what you always say.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.360]  Have you ever found this line?
[1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:26.920]  No, no, I have not.
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:31.120]  And to be clear, sometimes I get stuff wrong, I'll be listening to my rebroadcast sometime
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:36.800]  and hear me flip a number or get a date wrong, but I mean, everybody does that.
[1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:39.480]  The difference is we try to tell the truth.
[1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:40.480]  We do our homework.
[1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:45.120]  We do our research and we have a great track record of really being accurate and predicting
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:47.480]  a lot of big trends that are developing.
[1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:51.040]  And hey, people shouldn't just listen to what we have to say.
[1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.920]  Check it all out for yourselves.
[1:05:52.920 --> 1:06:00.520]  Just start thinking for yourself, looking around you, questioning more.
[1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:07.200]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:12.400]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:20.960]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:28.040]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:34.160]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch when you need it most.
[1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:39.120]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:45.920]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:50.480]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:52.640]  ride all day with confidence.
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:55.560]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:07:01.560]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:05.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:12.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:13.800]  at home.
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:18.960]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:19.960]  shots.
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:24.720]  It's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:30.240]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel,
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:34.840]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:39.280]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:41.320]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:46.800]  Today it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:48.640]  a fall of the Republic.
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:54.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right

[1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:05.560]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:10.400]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:14.400]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:19.040]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:24.280]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:31.160]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:34.580]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:40.200]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:45.480]  Three easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:51.440]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.040]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:09:01.840]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:03.880]  We live in a surveillance society.
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:08.000]  Why do I have to come down?
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.400]  After every human being on the planet.
[1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:14.960]  I don't know how they knew all about us.
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:20.200]  A big government will take more and more of their rights away from us.
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:21.200]  Are you aware?
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.920]  Yes or no.
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:29.200]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:31.920]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:36.720]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:39.160]  And we are warned of such a global system.
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:44.000]  A great experiment that was once America has been prostituted by special interests.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.400]  All they're thinking about is, oh, government, do something, protect me, save us from all
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:50.680]  of this.
[1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:53.200]  We are living in the last days.
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:59.520]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:15.800]  how a casual society surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:17.840]  This film needs to be seen.

[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:30.800]  Shadow Government.
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:33.240]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:39.240]  Available at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:54.640]  With the balance of the hour, Andre Van Herden, the producer and director of the hit film
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:59.160]  Shadow Government joins us along with the author of the book that it's based on and
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:06.960]  of course the host of the film, Grant Jeffries, who's a documentary maker, author, film producer
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:13.040]  in his own right, a leading film and documentary producer out there.
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:16.740]  And of course, I was honored when they reached out to me to see if I wanted to carry the
[1:11:16.740 --> 1:11:22.320]  film or endorse it, and this is the best-selling film we've got next to my documentaries.
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:25.760]  And that's the market speaking that the people are really impressed with this.
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:29.640]  I mean, it's an amazingly informative DVD.
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:34.680]  It's available at infowars.com, and of course, you can get the book from Grant Jeffries'
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:38.540]  outfit and we'll give you that website before he leaves this, but we also have a discount
[1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:42.880]  with my other books and videos at infowars.com.
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:44.560]  And it's got Daniel Estelin in it.
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:46.240]  It's got Katherine Albrecht.
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:51.120]  It's got G. Edward Griffin and so many others, and it's really waking people up because it's
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.040]  not just the naked body scanners that are going in or the cell phones tracking us or
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:56.820]  the RFID.
[1:11:56.820 --> 1:11:59.320]  This has been globally agreed to by the UN.
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:05.160]  It's globally standardized, and it is a beast system, even if you don't believe revelations.
[1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:08.560]  For all intents and purposes, that's what this is.
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:14.040]  Total control, where they can even predict human activity before it happens by tracking
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:15.520]  your previous activities.
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:21.000]  Not just individuals, but groups of people, and it's covered in the film Shadow Government.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:28.080]  I want to thank Andre Van Heerden and Jeffrey Grant, or Grant Jeffries for joining us here
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:29.080]  today.
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:30.080]  Gentlemen, good to have you on with us.
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:31.080]  Thank you, Al.
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:32.080]  Thank you.
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:34.520]  Where do we start?
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:38.720]  You wrote the book, Grant Jeffries, Break Down What the Shadow Government Is, Why You Have
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:43.680]  That Title, and In a Nutshell What's Being Built, and then let's go through the film
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:45.720]  and break down the information in it.
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:51.480]  Well, I believe, as a result of 20-some years of research, that we are very, very close
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:57.440]  to the imposition of a global government that none of the citizens of the Western world,
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:59.720]  in terms of a majority, want.
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:04.080]  Every time people have been asked if they want global government, the vast majority
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:09.940]  love their nation, their history, their culture, language, and they want to keep their things
[1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:11.440]  as they are.
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:17.280]  The global elitists that desire global government, they know that the only way to introduce this
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:22.960]  is by self, and they have found that they can go around the U.S. Constitution, which
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:25.680]  is one of the major impediments.
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:31.800]  The founders of the U.S. Constitution were brilliant men that were very afraid that America
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:36.960]  needed to stay out of European entanglements and wars, and they made the Constitution
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:39.000]  very hard to change.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.440]  But the lawyers in Congress found that there was a loophole, that according to the Constitution,
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:50.120]  if there is an international treaty signed by the president and 67-plus senators, that
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:55.200]  takes precedence over the U.S. Constitution if there is a conflict.
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:00.400]  And so they began using treaties like the World Trade Organization and 95 signed by
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:07.800]  Clinton, a 2000-page treaty that effectively robbed the United States of its economic independence
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.000]  and trade policy.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Only one senator out of a hundred, Alex, actually read the treaty.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:21.560]  Most of them have a 1-8.5-by-11-page summary, and based on that, the vast majority of them
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:27.240]  voted for this, which effectively put America's hands in handcuffs.
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:33.560]  Economically, they cannot respond to unfair trade practices, for example, from China.
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:36.920]  Otherwise, all the other nations will retaliate.
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:41.480]  America, though, is the leading economy in the world, has the same voting power as 80
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:43.320]  or Uganda, one vote.
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:49.720]  So we're outnumbered by people who do not share our free enterprise policies, our pluralism
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:52.720]  of religion and politics, et cetera.
[1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:58.200]  The next thing is these global elitists, who think of themselves as global citizens.
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:02.520]  They no longer think of themselves as Americans or French or German.
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:08.480]  They are not suggesting that they're all evil individuals, but rather, they believe that
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:14.600]  in a world with 200-plus sovereign nations and weapons of mass destruction that are widely
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:20.800]  available, inevitably, they will be used and there will be a third world war in genocide.
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:26.240]  The only solution they can think of is a global government that would eliminate nations and
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:27.920]  their ability to go to war.
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:31.360]  Which just so happens to be authoritarian, and I was playing in the background for Prison
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:37.600]  Planet dot TV viewers a short clip of a census worker coming up and marking your GPS point
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  on your home.
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:43.720]  I mean, the film covers the big picture, it zooms into the micro, that's what's so powerful
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:46.200]  about it, and it's got great actors.
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:51.160]  I mean, the whole thing is illustrated where people can really get an idea of what's happening.
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:58.120]  Yes, I think that we were able to convey with Andre's help and direction the real truth
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:04.280]  that what is happening behind the scenes is our politicians are ceding our national independence,
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.800]  our constitutional independence.
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:11.280]  These people believe that global government is the solution to avoid a third world war
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:17.040]  as one of their motives, but even I both know that the history of the planet shows that
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:22.240]  civil wars are by far the worst type of war, whether the American Civil War, where we'd
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:25.200]  look at the Russian Civil War, and there's going to be civil wars against this global
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:29.240]  government because it's authoritarian, even in the words of the Financial Times of London,
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:31.640]  they endorse an authoritarian system.
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:35.600]  Meanwhile, the globalists always hand out weapons to other countries and actually stir
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:40.240]  up the conflicts, and internal memorandums like State Department Morandom 200, they
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:43.400]  talk about starting wars to reduce population.
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:46.040]  So I, at the top, they're pure evil.
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:50.360]  I agree, they have a lot of useful idiots that support them at the governmental and
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:53.920]  academic and corporate level believing in the propaganda.
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:17:00.320]  Right, and when I point out in both the documentary and the book with a very ample source citation,
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.800]  there are three major groups.
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:08.080]  The Bilderberger group, who call themselves internally the Alliance, primarily European,
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:15.520]  Royal, as well as multinational leaders, incredibly wealthy people who want world government.
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:19.680]  Then you've got the group, the Council of Foreign Relations, that is primarily American
[1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:24.880]  with about 3,000 members, and then you have a trilateral commission that was formed by
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:31.800]  Jimmy Carter, and Vig Brzezinski, his security advisor back in the 70s, which basically has
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:37.680]  representatives from both the Asia and from Europe and from North America.
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:44.000]  All three groups absolutely are aiming toward global government by stealth, by international
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.880]  treaties, and by other means.
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:51.840]  These individuals have set an agenda, which they know the public does not support, and
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:56.880]  so they're introducing it step by step without people being fully aware that we're ceding
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:00.840]  our national independence and our representative government.
[1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:08.440]  I really point out that the European Union with 27 nations is really an executive commission
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:14.920]  of appointed individuals who make decisions behind lock doors, and the so-called European
[1:18:14.920 --> 1:18:20.440]  Parliament is nothing more than a high school debating society, because all the power is
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:24.920]  exercised by 27 appointed people, and there's no remedy.
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:27.440]  There's nothing an individual can do to make that.
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:28.440]  Well, they admit that.
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:31.760]  I mean, when Obama became the first US president to be president and the head of the UN Security
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:37.520]  Council, CNN said, this is the ultimate level of power in the global government.
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:41.760]  This is the only group that has any power in the UN, and all of those individuals are
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:46.480]  Bilderberg group members or members of the regional roundtable groups, and Carol Quigley,
[1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:48.040]  as you know, wrote a whole book about this.
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:53.720]  He worked for them 900 pages, tragedy and hope, breaking it all down, and my listeners
[1:18:53.720 --> 1:18:57.840]  are aware of this true global architecture, and of course the film covers that, but you
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:03.720]  also break down how they plan to implement their control and surveillance over the population.
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:08.680]  We're going to go to break in a moment, but I want to go to Andre Van Heerden, the director
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:11.120]  and producer for a moment.
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.440]  What do you think's most important in the film's shadow government, the masterpiece
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:16.160]  that you've produced?
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.440]  I have to say right off the top that when I approached this topic and was talking to
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:22.840]  Grant, I was approaching it as a skeptic.
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:25.600]  I was looking at a lot of stuff as a conspiracy theory.
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:29.400]  I didn't believe a lot of it, but I thought there was nuggets of truth may be buried within
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:30.400]  it.
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:35.440]  But as I started doing the research and working with Grant and looking at his book and started
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:41.560]  interviewing the various people you mentioned, some Dr. Cass Albrecht, Daniel Astellin, Richard
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:49.120]  Griffin, and the information that was coming out and the evidence, the support evidence
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:54.240]  for all of it, documentation for all of it, made it implicitly clear that this was true.
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:56.640]  Yeah, this is an open conspiracy.
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:00.680]  That's what's so frustrating is they're announcing World Government on the nightly news, and
[1:20:00.680 --> 1:20:04.400]  then next they cut to the Southern Primary Law Center saying these Tea Party people are
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:07.760]  dangerous, they're delusional, they believe in the global government.
[1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:12.240]  And what you just said is the most striking thing about the documentary is that if you
[1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:16.400]  don't believe in it, suddenly you look at the headlines of your newspaper and exactly
[1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:20.240]  what the documentary is talking about is right there, it's all right in front of you.
[1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:23.560]  And I think people are really getting the sense that it is there, even if they think
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:27.760]  it's a conspiracy theory, they can look in the world around and say, yeah, you know what,
[1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:29.560]  I know I'm being tracked, yes.
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:33.680]  I know all my financial transactions are being tracked and monitored.
[1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:37.320]  I know this is all happening and that's what makes it so scary and so true.
[1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:41.280]  And then you look at the research of the terror attacks in the U.S. and other countries and
[1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:46.840]  you find out the NSA every time bare minimum knew exactly what was happening and let it
[1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:49.840]  take place like the case of the underwear bomber.
[1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:52.560]  Again, this surveillance cuts two ways.
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:59.120]  We'll be right back with the makers of the film Shadow Government available at infowars.com
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:01.280]  discounted right now.
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:04.840]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water

[1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:02.440]  Gold isn't for you.
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:06.420]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[1:23:06.420 --> 1:23:07.720]  metal investing firms.
[1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:08.720]  I get it.
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:12.440]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:16.960]  Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:18.160]  be there for you.
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:19.400]  That's not what's happening.
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:24.240]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:27.840]  dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:31.280]  If all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold.
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:35.640]  For the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:41.560]  Since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:44.920]  But now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:45.920]  You should too.

[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:05.320]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:06.680]  begins in the colon?

[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:14.680]  If allowed our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:18.920]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat but also a healthy digestive system
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:20.680]  and a strong immune system.

[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:12.920]  Grant Jeffery is our guest.
[1:25:12.920 --> 1:25:17.880]  He's the writer of the book Shadow Government made into the documentary film by Andre Van
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:18.880]  Herden.
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:21.040]  Both of them are with us.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:26.200]  And the film covers so much and consciously gets people to realize how everything we're
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:29.600]  doing is being tracked and traced.
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:32.880]  Continue breaking down other key parts of the film that people need to be made aware
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:33.880]  of.
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:34.880]  Mr. Jeffery.
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:39.560]  Well one of the aspects that makes Shadow Government a reality is that not only do you
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:46.760]  have this very deeply held agenda by these globalist groups, which by the way is an example
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:55.760]  of the Bilderberger group during the 2008 election, back last summer, a summer ago,
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:26:02.120]  a year and a half ago, they invited both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to their secret
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:05.480]  meeting in Virginia just north of Washington.
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:11.280]  And knowing that one of them within seven months would be taking their inauguration
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:15.840]  as President of the United States, taking a note to defend the Constitution of the United
[1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:19.280]  States against all enemies, domestic and foreign.
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:25.400]  And yet they were invited to attend the secret meeting, which they don't talk about.
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:29.960]  Part of the rules of the Bilderberger and the other two groups are what's called Chatham
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:35.680]  House Rules, which mean that no one who goes there by invitation only is allowed to quote
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:39.400]  anything that is said or identify who said it.
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:45.040]  And they were invited to go to the secret meeting and the planners of that meeting definitely
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:51.640]  want to bring America down in both its economy, its military and politically.
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:53.840]  And they publicly say that now.
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:58.400]  And they publicly say that in China is the new model where they give tax incentives and
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:01.220]  everything else to move all our industry over there.
[1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:05.200]  And we've got all the phony environmentalists calling for a global government run by the
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:10.360]  very banks that meet at Bilderberger group meetings, saying that we will pay our taxes
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:11.760]  directly to them.
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:16.360]  From your research, Mr. Jeffrey, there's no doubt, certainly in my mind, but I want to
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.760]  know from your research that we are now entering the final phase of open world government.
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:21.760]  Absolutely.
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:26.400]  And I found an interesting document that you might find interesting, Alex.
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:30.880]  This document was written by the Council of the Club of Rome, and it was published in
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:36.480]  1993 in a booklet called The First Global Revolution.
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.320]  And in fact, is on the internet, someone can look it up if they want.
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:41.840]  Here's a quote.
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:47.960]  It says, quote, in searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, meaning the globalist.
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:53.120]  We came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming and water shortages,
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:55.840]  famine and the like, would fit the bill.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:01.160]  In their totality and their interactions, these phenomena do constitute a common threat
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:04.240]  which must be confronted by everyone together.
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:08.240]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention and natural processes.
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:12.840]  It's only through changed attitudes and behaviors that they can be overcome.
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:16.720]  The real enemy then is humanity itself.
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:23.480]  Now that's chilling, because that means that back in 1993, the globalist identified man's
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:29.280]  natural love of Earth and the environment as a way to achieve their real goal, which
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:36.120]  is an incredible socialistic control of nations, companies, and individual activity, and to
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  also achieve it on a global level and do it by stealth, appealing to something which they
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:49.600]  would emphasize and exaggerate so that people would be willing to take any type of restriction
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:53.840]  whatsoever and taxes to achieve saving of the planet.
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:59.080]  And this is the underlying real motive that I have found in the research that I have been
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:04.400]  doing that is pushing the exaggerated danger of global warming.
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:09.760]  And they chose carbon dioxide, the life-giving gas, because that's what humans exhale.
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:16.520]  And now we have video from just two weeks ago of Bill Gates saying, here are humans,
[1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:20.080]  they put out carbon dioxide, we have to get rid of at least half of them.
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:26.240]  The UN in their document says 80%, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the head climatologist
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:31.240]  at NASA says the global taxes are meant to destroy our industrial economy.
[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:36.400]  I mean, this is a very dangerous group who have control of the issuance of currency
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:39.080]  and credit, and they don't want a free market.
[1:29:39.080 --> 1:29:40.760]  They don't want us living well.
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:43.360]  They want us poor and under their control.
[1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:48.280]  And they proposed three months ago at Copenhagen a global one-child policy.
[1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:52.600]  And that's why shadow government is so important because it shows we are under a global shadow
[1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:59.240]  government now coming out of the shadows through the G20 announcing that later this year or
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:03.760]  early next year they are going to set up a global constitution of the banks, the private
[1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:09.080]  central banks setting up a global government publicly even above the UN that we will pay
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:12.120]  our carbon taxes to.
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:13.720]  And it's here.
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:17.400]  And we have to warn people, and that's why the film shadow government is so important.
[1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:20.360]  We've got a long segment coming up, so we won't have these interruptions.
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:25.920]  We come back, I want to get the director and producers to take on what we're discussing,
[1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:30.120]  Andre Van Heerden, and of course we've got Grant Jeffery on the line with us, the writer
[1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:35.440]  of the book that just became a film, also the host of shadow government.
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:41.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you may be awake out there, a lot of you more awake than I am.
[1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:46.400]  The point is the public's now ready to be awakened, and films like Obama Deception,
[1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:51.080]  Fall of the Republic of the Shadow Government are the tools to get out to the people.
[1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:54.800]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:30:54.800 --> 1:31:00.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:09.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:09.040 --> 1:31:13.360]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:14.680]  allows you to have.
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:20.400]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:24.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:28.720]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:32.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:31:32.200 --> 1:31:35.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:40.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:44.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:44.440 --> 1:31:45.840]  one of my old sponsors.
[1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:51.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:32:59.120 --> 1:33:02.840]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:07.200]  Well here's an unbelievable chance for you to jump start your food savings plan from
[1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:09.040]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:13.600]  One placing food orders on the large-volume production run scheduled for the week of March
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:17.120]  22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:21.560]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:23.600]  a fourth week of food free.
[1:33:23.600 --> 1:33:25.680]  That's buy three, get one free.
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:28.520]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:33.200]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings
[1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:36.240]  to you in this buy three, get one free program.

[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:36.880]  It's available again at eFoodsDirect.com, shadow government, it's available
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:46.760]  at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139, that's 888-253-3139.
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:50.440]  The best place to show this is to your churches.
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  We need to get the churches in America awake to this big brother grid.
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:56.720]  I mean, they're saying they want to implant us with microchips, they're putting RFID
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:59.720]  and most of the products now, they're tracking everything.
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:05.520]  I mean, this is literally what was envisioned on the Isle of Patmos, but most churches aren't
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:06.520]  discussing it.
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:10.840]  And you've got Pat Robertson saying biometrics, thumb printing is fine, naked body scanners
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:18.000]  are good, Obama's of the Lord, ladies and gentlemen, this is sick and the great delusion
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:21.760]  is upon the people right now, shadow government exposes it.
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:29.600]  Okay, going back to Andre Van Herden and of course Grant Jeffery, Andre, again, I've
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:34.760]  heard this story a million times, I mean literally, just callers, emails, people think we're
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:37.400]  making this stuff up.
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:41.480]  They think that Catherine Albrecht's making it up, or G. Edward Griffin, or Daniel Leslin
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:47.200]  in your film, until they actually look at the statements and publications of the government,
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:48.840]  of the elites and what's being built.
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:50.960]  I mean, what was the process like for you?
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:57.800]  You get approached because you're already a successful filmmaker in your own right by
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:05.720]  the author of the book that this film is based on, Grant R. Jeffery, and I mean, what was
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:06.720]  the process like?
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:11.560]  You thought it was conspiracy theory at first, how long did it take you to have a crash course
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:12.560]  in reality?
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.240]  Actually, it's a bit of a backwards scenario for us.
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:21.520]  We had worked with Grant Jeffery 15 years ago on a documentary called Final Warning,
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:24.640]  which looked at a lot of the same things in shadow government.
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:29.960]  Now, very tellingly, 15 years ago when we produced Final Warning, and we were talking
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:34.160]  to the cast, to the crew, and when we were marketing it, we kept being told, oh, you
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:38.160]  know, this stuff isn't really true, and so what if someone's watching me, I have nothing
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:39.160]  to hide?
[1:36:39.160 --> 1:36:41.240]  That happened time after time after time.
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:47.000]  Now, suddenly 15 years later, the same sort of material, you look at it, and you know
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  what?
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  We were dead on.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.920]  Everything that we had said was going to happen in Final Warning has already happened
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:55.280]  faster than we thought was going to happen.
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:58.520]  And now when we're producing shadow government, everyone's paying attention.
[1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:03.440]  So we were aware of Grant's book Shadow Government's thought and thought, you know what, we're
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:07.720]  a feature film company, we're best known for producing the left behind series of films,
[1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:12.160]  but we wanted to get back to our roots, to doing a documentary, particularly because
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:13.160]  of this title.
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:18.120]  And so we actually approached Grant and said, you know, we would like to do the documentary
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:19.120]  for your book.
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:24.320]  And thankfully, Grant said yes, we had a good relationship before, and really kind of dove
[1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:25.320]  into it.
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:30.960]  And I was planning to pull out the nugget of the truth, things that we could verify.
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:34.640]  And you know, that's a big thing, I'm a former journalist, and so I'm always looking for
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:39.560]  background sources, so, you know, backup sources looking to say, yeah, no, this is true.
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:43.800]  Now the very best source of information is what you call an antagonistic witness, someone
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:48.040]  who is not on your political side, someone who doesn't really like where you're going
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:51.000]  with the information, yet they will confirm what you're saying.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:55.880]  Well, you go to the UN document, you go to the Calcon Foreign Relations document, you
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:01.440]  go to the very source, and you can find, you're supporting exactly what you're saying.
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:06.040]  It's right there, it's hiding in plain sight, as you said earlier, and that was what was
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:08.680]  so compelling for us in producing it.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:11.400]  Well, let's cut to the chase.
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:13.240]  We know this is real.
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:17.040]  We've researched it, we've got to educate the public, the public is now ready to receive
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:23.660]  this information because we're so deep in this system now, but imagine what Hitler or
[1:38:23.660 --> 1:38:30.280]  Stalin or Mao or Pol Pot would have done with the cashless society, the power it gives the
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:34.720]  system to track everything you do, to be able to turn your card off, to turn your biometric
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:41.760]  scan off, to record your naked body and the body scanners and have a 360 biometric scan.
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:49.200]  Let's break down from your research what a totalitarian system can do once they fully
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:53.960]  get us on a cashless system, which they're now moving towards demonizing cash, a lot
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:58.320]  of places won't accept cash, even if you go buy food, they still want to see an ID card
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:38:59.360]  many places.
[1:38:59.360 --> 1:39:04.480]  We're being indoctrinated, they're shutting down the family farms and ranches, Grant, Jeffrey,
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:05.480]  get into that.
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:10.640]  Well, we're already about 98% cashless, and there are some northern European countries
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:15.280]  where cash is really seen as an anachronism.
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:21.600]  For example, I have a computer ring called an i-ring, it has a computer chip inside it
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:27.280]  with a credit, and you rather than pay for a subway, a train, a bus, you just simply
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:33.880]  touch that i-ring that you wear as a ring, or you can have like a key fob on a child's
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:38.240]  book pack, and you just touch that to the screen and instantly they withdraw the amount
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:39.240]  of money.
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:44.120]  Now there's a complete computer record of how long you were on that subway, who else
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:50.680]  was in that subway car with you, and the tracking technology that comes with this type of technology
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:52.240]  is phenomenal.
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:40:00.120]  For example, after 1948, the English-speaking victors of World War II, Britain, United States,
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:04.280]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, decided to do something that had never been done before
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:05.280]  in intelligence.
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:09.400]  Well, they still have the James Bond, Cloak, and Diger spies.
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:14.040]  They created a new type of system which would be an electronic vacuum cleaner that would
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:22.720]  listen and record on hard drives every single radio and telephone conversation, every fax,
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:27.600]  then with the introduction of personal computers, every email, and now all of your internet
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:28.600]  surfing.
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:33.680]  Because it's so vast, there's obviously not enough human listeners to monitor this stuff,
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:39.560]  and frankly, they're not interested in your conversation discussing yesterday's movie.
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:46.880]  But what they do is they use the tremendous computer technology, the cheapness of hard
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:53.480]  drive memory to store everything just on spec, and so they record every phone call, even
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:40:59.880]  the voices, and then they use deep data mining to instantaneously at trillions of calculations
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:06.200]  per second to look for key voices, addresses, names of weapons systems, or names of individuals.
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.760]  And that's 25 years old with the echelon keyword, but it's a lot worse than that.
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:16.720]  They now admit that they're able to predict off your cell phone travel where you move,
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:21.520]  patterns you have up to 93%, it's actually much worse, and to literally begin to predict
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:27.800]  mass movements of society and predict the future and test their propaganda on the media and
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:32.680]  see if people are buying it in their private emails, phone calls, and it's all crunched
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.320]  into giant graphs and data.
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:38.880]  And then if they want to zoom in and say, have your recorded voice, they then have computer
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:42.240]  programs that can copy your voice.
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:46.160]  Now most of the toll roads you don't pay with a swipe or even a tracker chip, they read
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:50.480]  your license plates, they track you in real time on the roads.
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.440]  The public schools and the government are dialing in, watching people over their laptops, even
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:42:00.640]  at home, that's now admitted, and in states like California, over a million government
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:07.320]  bureaucrats, police, and others are exempt from the license plate camera tickets and
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:09.720]  things and are literally above the law.
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:14.320]  So we also, as one of the Rockefellers told Aaron Russo, we cover this in my film Reflections
[1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:18.720]  and Warnings, they said, look, we're all going to have a chip and my chip will say basically
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:21.280]  I'm above the law because I'm an elitist.
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:24.560]  And that's the thing, these private globalists are building this private corporate world
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:26.680]  government and they are exempt.
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:32.360]  It's like in the EU, the EU bureaucrats, the rest of the EU is paying over 50% income tax.
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:33.360]  They pay 17%.
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:37.880]  I mean, it's just, it's an absolute class system.
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:39.640]  Well, you're right, Alex.
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:44.720]  And one of the things, the natural person who's the innocent law abiding Christian church
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:47.880]  going person would say, well, look, I live an honest life.
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:51.040]  I do not break the law if you don't count speeding.
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:54.760]  And therefore, why should I really be worried, even if what you're saying is true?
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:56.200]  You're who they don't like.
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:42:57.200]  You're who they don't like.
[1:42:57.200 --> 1:42:59.040]  They want to track you, understand you.
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:02.520]  They want to raise the taxes until you rebel and bring a police state in.
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:03.520]  I'm sorry.
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:08.160]  That's not only that, but let's say, while they're recording all this stuff and, you
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:10.520]  know, no one's really personally listening to this.
[1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.440]  It's all going into the computers.
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:16.600]  But let's say your son applies for a high security position with the military, the government,
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  a bank.
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.920]  And then, and at that point, they then go back and look at his family and friends and
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:27.120]  associates and they do an instantaneous search of all the communications, including your
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:28.120]  internet surfing.
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:33.000]  Well, Alex, if I know all of your phone calls and your emails, and I know all of your internet
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.080]  surfing, I know more about you than your spouse or your parents.
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:43.000]  Because by our internet surfing, we reveal our religious, political, sexual preferences.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:47.040]  We reveal our, the books we read, the magazines we're interested.
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:51.760]  We reveal our whole life when we expose our internet surfing.
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:59.000]  I talk about the social networking sets, the sites that are out there, Facebook and Twitter.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.880]  And I point out that young people especially, you know, a girl, for example, I used the
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:10.560]  illustration, 60-year-old girl tells her 57 best friends on Facebook about this wonderful
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:14.480]  Christmas romance with a 22-year-old college senior.
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:20.760]  And they had underage sex and underage drinking, perhaps some illegal substances, and she thinks
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:21.760]  nothing of it.
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:25.840]  Six years later, she's going for the dream job of her life.
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:31.320]  And all of a sudden, they don't call her back anymore because as a final thing, they, human
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:33.400]  resources went back and did a check.
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:38.840]  And once you put something on the internet or in an email or in a phone call, it cannot
[1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:39.840]  be erased.
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:43.440]  It's a computer data shadow that will follow you the rest of your life.
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:46.720]  And let's expand on that because you're now hitting at the very heart of it.
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:50.360]  And that's what shadow government covers and why it's so important.
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:56.080]  Take three years ago, the air marshals, the head of their union in Colorado came out and
[1:44:56.080 --> 1:45:01.880]  said, we're ordered every month with a quota to put innocent people on a list to create
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:05.400]  the illusion of security threats to get more funding.
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:10.120]  If a five-year-old takes a photo with their camera or an old woman does it or you order
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:15.520]  a vegetarian meal, there's over a million, 200,000 people in the no fly list, no judge,
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:16.520]  no jury.
[1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:20.280]  They're now saying they want to put you where you can't buy a gun.
[1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:23.880]  If you're on the no fly list, they have these criminal databases.
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:25.920]  There's all sorts of corruption of the data.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:31.400]  They've been caught putting fake data into the systems and there's no judge, no jury,
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:32.400]  no review.
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:34.580]  You can't find out why you're on the list.
[1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:39.840]  This is an incredible discriminatory system, but oh, they got you all worried about, let's
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:45.360]  not profile people with turbines to then sell everyone being violated and discriminated
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:51.680]  against whenever they want because the corporate board beast machine says so.
[1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:56.120]  And then meanwhile, the NSA can also track when good cops, good military, good police
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:46:02.680]  are aware of government drug dealing, child trafficking, sex trafficking, money laundering.
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:07.680]  It comes out they use NSA to actually block real investigations of the global corporate
[1:46:07.680 --> 1:46:08.720]  crime syndicate.
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:14.600]  So this is the criminals surveillance network to make sure they stay safe and no one gets
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:17.680]  on to them or no journalist ever gets on to them.
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:18.680]  They can shut them down.
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:23.160]  Well, one of the most amazing things that's happened in the last few months, Alex, is
[1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:28.760]  that on December 17th, the president of the United States signed an executive order which
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:37.000]  has the force of law, which immunizes Interpol, the international police organization, represent
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:43.320]  157 nations, including such wonderful supporters of law such as Russia.
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:48.800]  And this organization can now operate inside the borders of the United States to arrest
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:53.600]  people, to do rendition or anything else.
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:47:00.080]  And it is no longer subject to congressional oversight nor to a judge's order.
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:02.360]  They do not have to produce evidence.
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:08.040]  And therefore, Interpol, for reasons that no one can explain to me because Interpol
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:13.200]  has never asked this of any other nation before, why Interpol should be allowed this
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.600]  immunization against American courts or congressional investigation.
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:21.320]  Now, they're given diplomatic immunity and under diplomatic immunity.
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:25.600]  All these groups have been caught in narcotics, child kidnapping, snuff films.
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:29.320]  I mean, this is the global government is run by criminals.
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:32.400]  And I mean, you get my point that this is actually there.
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:33.800]  It's not just to surveil us.
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.400]  It's to protect themselves and to find out who's good in government and who's bad so
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:39.960]  they can promote the bad people.
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:46.680]  Well, I have a point out that even in a dangerous world in which obviously our governments would
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:52.320]  be remiss in their responsibilities, if they did not try to use technology to find the
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:59.200]  terrorists and find the criminals, etc., however such incredible power, unprecedented in human
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:03.920]  history, a population surveillance system that Hitler or Stalin would have given their left
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:10.000]  arm for, cannot be able to operate with impunity and immunity.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:16.760]  And the watchers need to be watched by a genuine democratic oversight, but that, in fact, is
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:17.760]  not happening.
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:21.760]  And now they're expanding it with a cyber security takeover.
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.400]  Run through the film, going to the director and producer.
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:31.720]  Run through the film in somewhat of a chronological order, just the basics that people will discover
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:33.280]  and learn in it.
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:37.760]  There are four main sections, and it's great the way they all kind of interrelate.
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:43.200]  The first section is really looking at surveillance technologies, new surveillance technologies,
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:45.800]  how you're being monitored, how you're being tracked.
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:50.000]  And we give lots of examples of what's currently in place, what is just on the drawing board,
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.880]  what is coming down the line towards us.
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:57.920]  And it gives great evidence, great examples of all that sort of technology and what's
[1:48:57.920 --> 1:48:58.920]  around today.
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:03.040]  We asked a few of the people, if you wanted to live off the grid, if you wanted no one
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:07.360]  to be able to track, monitor things that you're doing today, what would you have to do?
[1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:10.800]  And every single one basically answered, you'd have to live naked in the forest.
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:12.760]  It's literally to that extent.
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:16.440]  The next section, that's the first section, surveillance and tracking capabilities.
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:21.600]  The next section is looking at how those technologies affect your rights and freedom.
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:23.560]  What is happening to our rights and the privacy?
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:26.880]  What is happening to our freedom of speech, freedom of free expression?
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:27.880]  Those sorts of things.
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:33.680]  The double standard, if you happen to be a Christian or a Jew, what is happening to your
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:34.960]  rights and freedom?
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:40.440]  What has already happened with your rights and privacy basically already at the window?
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:45.240]  We then look at, okay, you have your technologies that are monitoring and tracking you.
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:49.400]  You have your erosions of rights and freedom, who's behind all this?
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:54.640]  And you really look at the global government, the institutions that are already in place.
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:50:00.640]  You mentioned some of the people with all the money and all the power from the media
[1:50:00.640 --> 1:50:01.640]  that are controlling all this.
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:06.280]  You have the Bilderberg group, the bilateral, the council on foreign relations.
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:11.600]  You have the United Nations, all working with the media, all working with the money to control
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.600]  their agenda.
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:13.600]  That's the third part.
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:16.880]  And the fourth part takes it a step further.
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:21.280]  Has this been predicted, has this already been foreseen?
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:26.280]  And it really looks at Bible prophecy, it looks at, okay, where is all this leading
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:27.280]  to?
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:29.400]  And it really looks at what does the Bible say?
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.240]  And again, you say, how do you prove it?
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:33.240]  Well, it's written down.
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:37.440]  It's written down 2,000 years ago, and you can read in the book of Revelation, read in
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:38.440]  the book of Matthew.
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:39.440]  Read.
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:43.760]  Well, Andre, more than that, I'm a Christian, you're a Christian.
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:48.260]  But the issue here is, if we can get this message to Christians, who are the majority
[1:50:48.260 --> 1:50:54.320]  of this nation, that will be a powerful force to say no to this big brother that's bad
[1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:55.320]  for everybody.
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:51:00.800]  And even if you don't believe in God and all this, and some people are deceived and foolish,
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:06.600]  no one can disagree that all this surveillance is being used to hurt people and to control.
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:10.880]  And we know now that the establishment's coming out with all the surveillance and admitting
[1:51:10.880 --> 1:51:15.640]  more of it, because they've already gone way down the road past what we even know they're
[1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:17.520]  currently doing.
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:22.120]  And so the federal circuit court, a night circuit, two weeks ago rule, police can search
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:25.240]  your house without a warrant or probable cause.
[1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:27.440]  There's all these other rulings against freedom.
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:31.920]  They now want to come out with all the surveillance and openly use it in court.
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:36.120]  And so that's why they're having rulings for warrantless wiretapping of citizens.
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:39.200]  The list goes on and on, gentlemen, stay there.
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:46.680]  It is so important that we expose this for what it is, that we reveal it, that we let
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:50.520]  people know just how dangerous it is and point out it's wrong.
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:51.520]  This is America.
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:55.800]  I mean, worldwide, we know this is tyranny.
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:57.680]  The film is shadow government.

[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:08.400]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:12.720]  and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted
[1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:15.360]  almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?

[1:54:01.080 --> 1:54:02.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:06.440]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:08.080]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:12.120]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  or gold?
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:16.480]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:18.680]  possible that could even happen again.
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:23.120]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:24.120]  seeds.
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:28.880]  You can call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:31.000]  dense food for you and your family.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.120]  And here's the best part.
[1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:36.320]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:38.800]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:42.040]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:52.840]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:57.840]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:00.520]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:20.880]  We're going to continue exposing the control grid with Declan McCullough of CNET News breaking
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:22.920]  down the cyber security bill.
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:25.560]  Jason Burmes is going to be in studio with us a little bit, going through point after
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:26.840]  point in the bill.
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:31.600]  We're going to look at all the calls for internet censorship, because they've gotten the grid
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:32.920]  in place now.
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:37.640]  The whole economy shifted over to wireless and internet and the web.
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:40.800]  Now they're coming in with the censorship and the control.
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:45.560]  So part two of this whole discussion coming up at the five after when our guests leave
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:46.560]  us.
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:50.440]  We've got about five minutes now and five minutes in the next segment, gentlemen.
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:54.080]  Another important point you want to make about shadow government, how important this message
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:58.000]  is, other parts of the film people should be made aware of and why they need to get
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  it.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:06.320]  Well, I was just saying off air to you, Alex, that we had some people come over to our house.
[1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:10.800]  There were parents of some of the friends of my daughter.
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:15.160]  They were interested in my work and things like that and mentioned that we'd done a documentary
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:16.160]  called Shadow Government.
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:18.760]  They were immediately interested because they can see it.
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:21.720]  As I said, in the headlines, they can see it all around in their daily lives.
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:25.600]  They know they're being monitored and tracked and are obviously interested in how that affects
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:27.600]  their lives.
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:31.840]  But at the same time, they didn't know that the part of the theme was Bible prophecy.
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:35.000]  And it's oftentimes when you're talking about Bible prophecy, people will kind of look at
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.600]  you a little differently than they had before.
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:43.760]  And so we started playing it and it got through the opening, which is very gripping immediately.
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:45.160]  It dives right into it.
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:49.320]  And there's this dramatization that shows, you know, this everyday guy going through
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:51.320]  his life and what's happening to him.
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:54.440]  And so then I stopped it and they all turned to me and there's about eight of them all
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:55.800]  said, no, no, we want to see more.
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:56.800]  We want to keep going.
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:57:00.000]  And it was like, this is at a dinner party, they're like, okay, keep going.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.640]  And they were fascinated and suddenly they were asking questions, which is a wonderful
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:11.000]  opportunity to share just about anything because now they're interested in that information.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:12.360]  That's how you wake somebody up.
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:16.360]  That's how you unlock their mind to see the wider world.
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:22.920]  And as the Bible says over and over again, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:27.080]  And if we can give people the knowledge, they know something's wrong, but when they see
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:33.640]  shadow government, they really start understanding just how serious this is.
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:35.600]  Comments from Grant Jeffrey on that point.
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:41.600]  Well, one of the things that I point out in my book, my book and refer to it in the documentary
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:48.200]  is in addition to the rather secrets, but also partly an open conspiracy plan by the
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:53.760]  global group to achieve global government and destroy the constitution of free countries
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:55.840]  like Canada, the United States.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:00.840]  There's another aspect and that is the practical preparation for what is called continuity
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:06.240]  of government in this world in which there are weapons of mass destruction and the dangers
[1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:11.720]  from both terrorists as well as nation states, any government that does not prepare for the
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:15.280]  worst would be very, very irresponsible and foolish.
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:20.960]  For example, during the inauguration a year ago, one member of the cabinet, the defense
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:28.400]  secretary, Robert Gates, he was in an underground city north of Washington in Mount Weather
[1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:32.760]  where he was designated to take over the presence of the United States if the worst happened
[1:58:32.760 --> 1:58:38.600]  and the capital disappeared with the Supreme Court and Congress and the president.
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:42.160]  Governments have to prepare and think this way in such a world.
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:49.400]  One of the things that we noticed as a Canadian observer watching the 2005 Katrina disaster
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:55.480]  was the absolute appalling lack of organization and preparation by FEMA, the Federal Emergency
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:59:00.520]  Management Agency, which has now become part of Homeland Security.
[1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:05.920]  What I discovered and documented in the book Shadow Government is that 96 percent of the
[1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:13.440]  entire $30 billion budget of FEMA was in fact used not for natural disaster relief efforts
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:18.960]  like Katrina, but was designed for continuity of government with secret bases gathered throughout
[1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:24.360]  the United States, filled with food and soldiers and equipment and backup computer records
[1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:29.640]  for every part of the functioning of government so that if the worst ever happened, they can
[1:59:29.640 --> 1:59:30.640]  take over.
[1:59:30.640 --> 1:59:34.640]  And they can also produce a global government.
[1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:35.640]  Stay there.
[1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:37.640]  We're going to come back in a final segment and finish up with what you were just saying.
[1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:42.400]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:44.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:39.360]  News website, formerly Washington's top correspondent for Wired Magazine.
[2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:46.440]  He'll be breaking down the control grid coming up with us in the latest on cybersecurity.
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:48.080]  I can now start shipping this book.

[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:27.400]  I recommend you get both of them today or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:36.680]  Now, you were trying to finish up Grant Jeffery with the point about shadowgovernment.
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:42.520]  The issue is this, throughout the world, dictatorships and tyrannies use their continuity government
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:48.520]  system to circumvent the Congress or the parliament or the legislative system.
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:53.640]  And as you see in the film Valkyrie, a true story about Adolf Hitler and attempts on
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:59.400]  his life by parts of the German High Command, they use the continuity government program
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:00.840]  to try to take Hitler out.
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:02.480]  Well, it can be the reverse of that.
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:10.400]  They can use continuity government to take out Congress by saying terrorists did it and
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:12.080]  then bringing in the world government.
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:16.920]  This is a very dangerous system, and Congress back in the 80s had hearings about how this
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:19.480]  could be used to take over the legitimate government.
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:23.000]  So there's an amazing danger here, and we know what they're doing with all the surveillance
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:24.280]  is illegal.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:25.560]  It's targeting the American people.
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:30.120]  We have the internal Homeland Security documents that the main focus is Christians, conservatives,
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:33.720]  libertarians, patriots, returning veterans, gun owners.
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:35.720]  This whole system's pointed at us.
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:37.800]  We're the number one enemies of the globalist.
[2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:38.800]  So we've only got about...
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:39.800]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:40.800]  Go ahead.
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:46.880]  And I think most Americans are woefully ignorant of the fact that under the U.S. situation,
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:53.080]  the Constitution never even had a mention of something called executive orders.
[2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:59.280]  Yet executive orders now have been published, and some of them are still secret, that have
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:04.760]  the force of congressional law, and few Americans realize that the president, by the stroke
[2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:07.600]  of a pen, can suspend Congress.
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:13.920]  They cannot even vote on it for six months, and the president can seize all transportation,
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:21.520]  all civilian labor, all weapons, all energy, in fact, all financial institutions.
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:27.440]  And what we're seeing in the takeover of the one-fifth of the U.S. economy in the healthcare
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:32.320]  system, after the takeover and control of Wall Street and the bankers and General Motors,
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:38.160]  is that increasingly the government is manifesting a desire to not move in a free enterprise
[2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:45.640]  capitalistic way, but in a managed society with central planning, so that they will use
[2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:51.560]  in a variety of pretexts, including the environment, global warming, et cetera, are literally moving
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:55.160]  toward a point where they'll tell you what kind of car you can drive, what kind of car
[2:04:55.160 --> 2:04:56.560]  will be available.
[2:04:56.560 --> 2:05:02.760]  But the thermostat must be set at, and they are creating a propaganda base where people
[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:07.360]  are willing to accept these unbelievable restrictions on our freedom.
[2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:09.040]  They're turning us into a prison planet.
[2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:10.040]  We're out of time.
[2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:11.320]  I'm very impressed with the film.
[2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:16.640]  I'm just as impressed with Andre Van Herden and Grant Jeffery here on the show with us
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:17.640]  today.
[2:05:17.640 --> 2:05:21.440]  Gentlemen, I want to invite you back for an hour and a half, two hours, in about two
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:26.480]  or three weeks, so we can open the phones up and get into more of what you were just
[2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:27.700]  now discussing.
[2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:31.040]  You guys are really on the ball, and I'm very impressed with what you've done, and I'm
[2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:35.160]  honored that you reached out to me to promote the film and sell the film, and I look forward
[2:05:35.160 --> 2:05:38.360]  to speaking to you both in the near future, gentlemen.
[2:05:38.360 --> 2:05:40.280]  Thank you for coming on with us today.
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:41.760]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:45.760]  And next time they're on, we'll talk more about other work that they've done together.
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:47.280]  Declan McCullough coming up.
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:49.200]  We'll only scratch the surface.
[2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:51.680]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:52.680]  Shadow government.
[2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:54.640]  Show it to everybody you know.
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:55.880]  It's dynamite info.
[2:05:55.880 --> 2:06:00.360]  It's vital to the future of humanity.
[2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:09.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:06:09.320 --> 2:06:13.640]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:06:13.640 --> 2:06:14.960]  allows you to have.
[2:06:14.960 --> 2:06:15.960]  It's true.
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:20.660]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:32.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:36.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:06:36.200 --> 2:06:40.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:44.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:06:44.760 --> 2:06:46.120]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:20.560]  Close to senior correspondent for CBS News website.
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:24.480]  He's one of the head guys over at the CNET News.
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:29.000]  He's written for Wired Magazine as their Washington bureau chief.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:38.760]  He, of course, also has written articles for the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:43.600]  He, well, it just goes on and on, Playboy Magazine, you name it.
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:46.840]  And he's one of the leading experts on the full spectrum of what's happening with the
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:53.040]  Internet, surveillance, cybersecurity, shutdowns of websites like Cryptome, all these calls
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:56.320]  for censorship that are going on and he's been fighting it, so we're really honored
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:58.320]  to have him with us for the next 40 minutes or so.

[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:07.760]  house bill that passed to go over some of the subsections with Declan McCullough for
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:10.880]  all the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and, of course, the radio listeners.
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:12.880]  Declan, it's great to have you here with us.
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:14.400]  Hey, it's my pleasure.
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:17.800]  Well, a lot's going on, obviously.
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:19.040]  What should we get into first?
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:23.600]  I mean, it looks like they're making their move to start clamping down on the Internet.
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:31.600]  Well, let's start with what's happening this week, which is probably the largest Internet
[2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:34.000]  computer security conference in the world.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.720]  It's taking place at the block from where I am here in San Francisco.
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:38.720]  It's called RSA.
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:44.280]  After the computer security company, the same name, and yesterday you had a White House
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:51.160]  advisor, Obama's cybersecurity coordinator called Howard Schmidt, speak there about a
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:59.800]  secret cybersecurity directive that, in effect, has now a little bit more public.
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:01.640]  And you've been at some of these meetings recently.
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:10.920]  Yeah, there's, well, let me talk about yesterday's speech, and this is Howard Schmidt, who's
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:13.320]  the White House cybersecurity coordinator.
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:19.120]  And the background is that two years ago, President Bush assigned a secret cybersecurity
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:26.760]  directive, his son is NSTD54, for National Security Presidential Directive 54.
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:34.160]  It's never been released, the government acknowledged that it exists, but the text
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:35.560]  has never been made public.
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:44.320]  You had, what's it called, a Manhattan Project for the Internet, there's, it's a multi-billion
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:49.600]  dollar fund for it that's part of a classified intelligence budget.
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:55.240]  I've heard numbers like 30 or 40 billion, which is huge.
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:59.640]  And also, one component of it is a network monitoring component called Einstein, which
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:04.920]  is aimed at monitoring people who vote on federal government websites, but there have
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:10.680]  been concerns about how far that monitoring by the Einstein program goes, and also whether
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:14.360]  that would be expanded to the private sector website.
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:18.960]  Well, remember the Cash for Clunkers program, you would go to the Cash for Clunkers program
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:23.560]  and there'd be a message, the federal government has taken over your computer, it is now owned
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:27.640]  by them, we are tracking everything you're doing, I mean, that really freaked people
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:28.640]  out.
[2:12:28.640 --> 2:12:35.440]  You do have a good memory for that, I haven't even come to mind this time around, but yeah,
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:43.880]  what happened is that the government said, oh, this is a problem, we won't do this again.
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:49.160]  But there's the interesting thing about this, that yesterday, if you go to WhiteHouse.gov
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:58.960]  slash cybersecurity, you'll see a three-page or five-page summary of this secret Bush
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:05.080]  era directive, and the summary says that Obama basically supports what President Bush
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:10.880]  is doing on cybersecurity, so this is not something that's different between the administration.
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:15.280]  And that's not a surprise, he's basically continued everything Bush has done.
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:24.000]  There's not a whole lot of daylight between them on many, many, many issues, there's bailout
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:30.560]  there and so on, but on cybersecurity, the interesting thing is that there are 12 points,
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:37.560]  and one point says that we want to expand the sign-to-sign program to involve the National
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:43.760]  Security Agency, and of course, this is the same NSA that was engaged in warrantless surveillance,
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:46.880]  it might still be engaged in warrantless surveillance.
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:53.760]  And the second point is that the Homeland Security wants to, quote, extend the cybersecurity
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:58.560]  into critical infrastructure, and that basically means the internet, because nowadays the government
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:00.560]  uses the internet as critical.
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:03.600]  Well, yeah, I mean, I have the bill, and coming up in 15 minutes we're going to go over it
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:08.560]  with you, but it talks about going into all of the internet service providers that they
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:13.880]  have to have a licensed person that's federally approved, that they're going to track what
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:19.440]  everybody's doing, that you have to basically have their software initiatives in middle
[2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:24.040]  school, high school, college, creating an army of cybersecurity warriors.
[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:26.000]  We know the government's surveilling people.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:32.840]  They're not warrants, they're tracking email, they're tracking cell phones, I mean, they're
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:33.840]  all over the map.
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:37.840]  Well, we can talk about cell phone tracking if you want to change the topic.
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:40.840]  No, no, no, continue with cybersecurity, continue.
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:42.840]  Well, we should talk about this.
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:46.840]  This is actually probably more interesting than cybersecurity, but let's continue.
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:55.920]  So the interesting thing about the cybersecurity plan is the potential for NSA monitoring
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:02.080]  or Homeland Security-flash NSA monitoring of the private sector, and you had, when this
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:07.920]  was Bush, and when this was the Bush administration running things at the Asia, you had a lot
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:15.960]  of complaints from members of Congress as this is probably a partisan issue, but you had
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:25.000]  folks like, let's see, you had Barack Obama running around screaming bloody murder about
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:29.360]  the Patriot Act and warrantless surveillance, and then now that he's in power, he's reauthorized
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:30.360]  it.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:36.320]  I won't dig into my notes, but let me just say that this is back from memory, and you're
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:42.760]  looking to prove me wrong, that back when the Bush folks doing this, the Democratic
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:46.920]  Congress was yelling about, you know, that there's not enough information about the secret
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:52.160]  directive, and who knows what our intent is going to do, and maybe this is their privacy
[2:15:52.160 --> 2:15:59.440]  issues, and let's just put the brakes on this whole project, it's not slowing it down completely,
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:05.160]  and now that it's the Obama administration renewing what the Bush folks started, and
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:09.960]  actually even saying nice things about Bush in this document that the White House posted
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:14.960]  on the White House, like those about cybersecurity yesterday, you do not hear any gowling from
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:19.880]  the Democrats in Congress, so maybe it'll happen, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
[2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:25.360]  So, anyway, we'll see more about this, I mean.
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:29.000]  Well, Declan, hold on just a minute, so people understand this.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:35.720]  I saw a bunch of headlines today saying, White House press release doesn't explain anything,
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:37.640]  what are the secret directives?
[2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:43.280]  But then if you read the bill, they've passed in the House that's now in the Senate, I mean,
[2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:48.160]  it's incredibly draconian, and you've had cybersecurity people come out and say it's
[2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:54.120]  the Pentagon and Air Force and NSA basically overtaking the Internet and putting in the
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:59.280]  type of snooping hubs they put into the telecommunication systems after the Telecommunications Act of
[2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:05.120]  1996, so we do know quite a bit of what's going on, I mean, but do we have any idea
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:07.640]  of what the secret directive is?
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:10.960]  And the answer is no.
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:19.920]  We only have a few from administration members, both Bush and Obama, saying that this is the
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:24.720]  single largest request for funds in last year's classified intelligence budget, for instance.
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:30.760]  Now, I think the single largest request for funds in the NSA and the CIA and defense intelligence
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:35.640]  agency and all these other black organizations, the single largest request for funds, this
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:39.960]  is a lot of money, folks, and we know virtually nothing about it.
[2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:45.800]  All we have is a very vague summary, and we don't even know if the summary adequately
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:49.760]  represents what's in the entire document, I mean, it only might cover 10 percent of
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:55.160]  the secret NSPD 54 directive, for instance.
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:58.800]  So basically, we have a little bit of, we have a pit bit or two from the White House,
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:00.600]  but we don't have very much information to go on.
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:02.560]  Most of it is still secret and classified.
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:05.880]  Well, let's expand on that, though.
[2:18:05.880 --> 2:18:12.440]  The biggest classified funding request they put out in the last year.
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:18.000]  But separately, we saw congressional hearings two years ago about censoring conspiracy theories
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.600]  and other criticisms with the government on the web.
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:26.960]  We see Cass Sunstein, the regulations are writing public papers saying basically restrict
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:33.160]  criticism, restrict global warming conspiracy theories that it isn't man-made, climate
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:38.760]  gates, a conspiracy theory, even when it's admitted, and he talks about cyber armies
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:45.360]  out posing as alternative media to cause infighting, co-and-tell pro type stuff.
[2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:49.960]  So I mean, we know they've got SENTCOM and others out blogging and writing their own
[2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:53.800]  reports and encountering, quote, disinformation on the web.
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:58.040]  So I think a lot of evidence points towards this is massive funding, not just for the
[2:18:58.040 --> 2:19:06.920]  snooping and control grid, but also as a way to put more boots on the ground and cyberspace
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:08.440]  pushing the establishment line.
[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:09.440]  It could be.
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:10.440]  And this is the problem.
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:15.440]  I mean, look, if you're going to defend the federal government network, I mean, what
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:22.080]  this means is the same thing that they, you know, Google.com or Yahoo.com have to deal
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:28.320]  with all the time of people trying to break into the servers and read your Gmail or Yahoo
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:29.320]  mail.
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:33.320]  And you don't need to make how you defend against that secret.
[2:19:33.320 --> 2:19:35.320]  It doesn't have to be classified.
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:40.040]  It doesn't have to be the single largest request for funds in last year's classified
[2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:42.040]  intelligence budget.
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:50.280]  So it's a bit of a mystery about where exactly these tens of billions of dollars are being
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:51.280]  spent on.
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:59.280]  The budget by comparison is only about $6 billion a year and that's a lot with that.
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:05.160]  Well, well, separately, I mean, we have the secret copyright treaty that was leaked a
[2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:06.880]  few months ago.
[2:20:06.880 --> 2:20:11.080]  And in that they're talking about using all these snooping systems like John McCain said
[2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:18.280]  five years ago to go in and basically kill your computer and this was actually your memory
[2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:19.280]  is good.
[2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:26.280]  I think this was actually, it was a bill introduced by Senator Hollings and maybe McCain was
[2:20:26.280 --> 2:20:33.960]  a co-founder of the CBD TPA and that did include these kind of kill switches and kill
[2:20:33.960 --> 2:20:40.600]  ships inside computers and it was being backed by more of the movie industry than the recording
[2:20:40.600 --> 2:20:41.600]  industry.
[2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:45.440]  No judge, no jury, no proof, they just do it.
[2:20:45.440 --> 2:20:47.440]  Declan McCullough is our amazing guest.
[2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:51.320]  We're going to see if we can get a better connection on his phone and come back.

[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.840]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:13.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:14.480]  at home.
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:19.120]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:20.120]  calling the shots.
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:25.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:30.920]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:35.600]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:38.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:42.200]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:22:42.200 --> 2:22:48.040]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:49.360]  of the republic.

[2:23:31.480 --> 2:23:35.200]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:36.200]  IRAs?
[2:23:36.200 --> 2:23:40.760]  It's been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold

[2:23:41.920 --> 2:23:45.440]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:07.560]  Don't.
[2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:10.720]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.280]  Declan McCullough is our guest, we're going to have Jason Bermas in the studio in a moment.
[2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:30.480]  Five minutes to go over some of the cybersecurity subsections but let's shift gears now, Declan,
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:35.040]  into all these calls for internet censorship, then we'll get into cell phone tracking that
[2:25:35.040 --> 2:25:36.040]  you've been reporting on.
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:40.600]  I mean, we're seeing the New York Times call for a kinder, gentler, gate-kept internet,
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:46.880]  phasing things over to internet too, making you have a license to get online, WebID, worse
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:48.880]  than Communist China.
[2:25:48.880 --> 2:25:55.880]  Well, we'll see, what's this in perspective?
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:58.960]  There have been calls for something akin to an internet driver's license for as long
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:25:59.960]  as I can remember.
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:04.880]  I remember sitting in a, I think it was a house of representatives of Rayburn building
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:11.720]  hearing room in 1998 when Louis Free said, you know, it would be nice to be able to attract
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:19.320]  people online and we could do something like this that might also deter fraud and more
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:22.960]  authentication and security into all these wonderful words.
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:28.200]  But what it amounts to is more surveillance and limiting anonymity and we know from the
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:36.040]  Supreme, even the Supreme Court, which is not always a great protector of civil liberties
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:41.920]  that acknowledged in the McIntyre case, I think that was a 1994 case, that people, Americans
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:44.840]  that do have a right to remain anonymous.
[2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:49.880]  And so, how do you reconcile the right to remain anonymous with the idea of a board
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:52.800]  internet tracking system or driver's license system?
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:59.520]  We had something, we heard another mention of this, a curb on anonymity yesterday here
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:04.160]  in San Francisco when the White House of Cyber Securities, Howard Smith, said, it would be
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:06.240]  nice to do something like that.
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:08.080]  So we've heard this call for a while.
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:12.440]  I don't think it's really going to go anywhere just because of the tremendous technical difficulties.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  If they could have, if the government could have controlled the way the internet developed
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:25.160]  from early on, it was pretty easy for them to do, but unfortunately for them, folks about
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:28.600]  online millions of people were using it before, they came up with a great idea of an internet
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:29.600]  driver's license.
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:34.800]  So I think actually speaking, if it's not going to work.
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:36.760]  The point is though, they're proposing it.
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:41.720]  Are you familiar with Cass Sunstein's calls to censor the internet and put taxes on people
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:43.440]  that criticize the government?
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:52.720]  I've read some pieces that he wrote a few years ago, and it seems to be someone who,
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:59.680]  let me back up, I'm not a fan of what he wrote.
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:07.920]  I think that he would usher in a more regulatory approach to things, perhaps more taxes and
[2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:08.920]  less anonymity.
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:13.040]  But then again, the nice thing is that he is not at the position to do much about it.
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:17.400]  He is the regulatory czar, but what this basically means is not pushing regulations,
[2:28:17.400 --> 2:28:18.400]  but slapping them down.
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:25.640]  More as a veto power, veto power as opposed to some of the proposed things.
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:29.840]  Bottom line, we've seen Australia call for Chinese style net censorship.
[2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:35.000]  We've seen Italy calling for licenses to get online, passing a bill to do it or to upload
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  video.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:40.080]  Why do we see governments, and I don't know if you agree with this, but I've clearly
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:43.560]  seen it, calling for more and more controls over the internet.
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:49.880]  Is it because mainstream media and government mouthpieces are being more and more challenged
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:53.840]  by the growing power of the internet and alternative news?
[2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:57.840]  I've seen reports in the last week that we finally passed that number, where there's
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:01.680]  more people getting their news from the web than from traditional news sources.
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:21.640]  This is a challenge for the mainstream media, because unless we adapt and remain relevant
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:29.440]  to try to publish stories that are free from bias and they're true and honest facts, readers
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:31.600]  are going to flee to the internet.
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:40.800]  If that happens to us, we deserve it, but to respond to your broader point, I mean,
[2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:44.560]  governments don't like what they can't control.
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:49.840]  They don't like people doing things that are unlicensed.
[2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:54.880]  I think that the bureaucrats that inhabit Washington DC would be pleased to license
[2:29:54.880 --> 2:29:59.360]  every single person for any reason in any occupation, including journalists and radio
[2:29:59.360 --> 2:30:02.360]  broadcasters, if they could get away with it.
[2:30:02.360 --> 2:30:07.000]  And of course, if you're once you've once you're licensed and your license comes up
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:12.160]  for renewal, if you're off the relative government entity, then, well, you may not have a job
[2:30:12.160 --> 2:30:15.160]  in your livelihood that may be at an end.
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:19.680]  And so I think this is just the dislike of things that they can't control and regulate.
[2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:24.960]  And we're seeing it in more and more disturbing ways that it's more like this ratchet effect
[2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:30.440]  for getting worse thing really better, we're going to get briefly back into the cyber security
[2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:34.880]  bill and whether or not what form it will pass the House or Senate version.
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:39.640]  The Senate, it appears, is even worse than we're going to shift gears into other surveillance
[2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:46.200]  that most concerns you and the latest developments on cell phones and things like Google's buzz
[2:30:46.200 --> 2:30:47.400]  as well.
[2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:48.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:51.240]  Declan McCullough of CNET News.
[2:30:51.240 --> 2:30:55.040]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:30:58.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:03.640]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[2:31:03.640 --> 2:31:09.840]  Well here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:31:09.840 --> 2:31:14.360]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March
[2:31:14.360 --> 2:31:17.880]  22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[2:31:17.880 --> 2:31:22.360]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship
[2:31:22.360 --> 2:31:24.360]  a fourth week of food free.
[2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:26.440]  That's buy three, get one free.
[2:31:26.440 --> 2:31:29.280]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:34.000]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food passing the savings
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:37.120]  to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:40.720]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[2:31:40.720 --> 2:31:44.840]  Another example, buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:50.520]  You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime or call
[2:31:50.520 --> 2:31:53.560]  800-409-5633.
[2:31:53.560 --> 2:32:00.720]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[2:32:00.720 --> 2:32:07.440]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:12.600]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:21.200]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:28.360]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:34.360]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:39.360]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:41.840]  We turned jeans inside out.
[2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:46.160]  Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[2:32:46.160 --> 2:32:50.720]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you could
[2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:52.880]  ride all day with confidence.
[2:32:52.880 --> 2:32:55.800]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[2:32:55.800 --> 2:33:01.800]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:05.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:33:05.520 --> 2:33:08.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:33:08.680 --> 2:33:13.040]  We're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:14.040]  at home.
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:18.680]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:19.680]  calling the shots.
[2:33:19.680 --> 2:33:25.080]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:33:25.080 --> 2:33:28.320]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:34.160]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:35.160]  world government.
[2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:39.600]  Jim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[2:33:39.600 --> 2:33:41.480]  saying who do we make the check out to?
[2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:47.560]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:48.560]  of the republic.
[2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:53.800]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:34:07.040]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:11.080]  Next hour I'm going to break down the demonization of the Tea Parties.
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:14.360]  The media is saying that they're terrorists about to strike.
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:20.360]  Meanwhile Rick Perry was swept back into office an unprecedented third term by posing as a
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:21.360]  Tea Party person.
[2:34:21.360 --> 2:34:26.800]  So you have the republican leadership in some areas mimicking it, other republican leadership
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:29.000]  attacking it, the democrats attacking it.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:32.360]  We're going to decode all this in the next hour.
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:39.640]  Declan McCullough, writer and editor over at CNET News, one of the preeminent news websites
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:44.560]  out there covering all things technology and internet.
[2:34:44.560 --> 2:34:47.520]  I mean there's so many other things I want to cover with you, but briefly I wanted to
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:52.760]  get Jason Bermas who's been here with us the last year working on his new film that's
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:59.960]  going to be out April 15th and of course that is Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:05.080]  But Jason has gone over the cyber security bill and I wanted Jason Bermas to just briefly
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:08.360]  read over some of the subsections to Declan McCullough and get his take on it.
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:13.080]  Then we're going to cover the latest other things that Declan's most concerned with.
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:14.080]  Go ahead Jason.
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:20.160]  One of the most alarming things in this bill outside of the FCC takeover, outside of the
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:26.440]  non-profit organizations they will prop up as front groups is Section 12, Federal Cyber
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:29.040]  Scholarship for Service Program.
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:32.160]  Now earlier you were talking about all high school and college students, it's much worse
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:33.160]  than that.
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:37.160]  Yeah we know Obama has city year and wants national compulsory service, he's on record.
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:39.680]  Now this is grabbing the kids out of schools.
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:41.560]  Absolutely grabbing the kids out of school.
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:47.520]  Section 4 shall provide a procedure for identifying promising K through 12 students for participation
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:53.000]  in summer work and internship programs that would lead to certification for what federal
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:56.080]  information technology workforce standards.
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:57.080]  So there are literally-
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:59.960]  And it says that anybody later in there that's going to work with any IT related stuff has
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:02.600]  to have this government certification, we'll get to that in a moment.
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:04.240]  What's your take on this Declan McCullough?
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:05.240]  It's unnecessary.
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:12.720]  Out of the realm of things to get worried about, I'll be more worried about active surveillance
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:19.360]  and tracking and monitoring, I don't get as alarmed about this bill, but this is an area
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:21.360]  where reasonable people can disagree.
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:26.920]  But I think this is where they're coming in and engineering the society and creating
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:30.720]  the industry of surveillance and control.
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:35.560]  There is spending a lot of money, hundreds of billions of dollars on surveillance and
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:36.560]  control.
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:42.520]  And this is yet another example, I don't see why we need the federal government to spend
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:43.520]  this much money.
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:49.600]  I think it's something like the agency that already spent $6 billion a year on cybersecurity
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:55.840]  and about a third of a billion dollars on research, and this is ramping up those efforts.
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:01.720]  But you don't need the federal government to decide what, what are security is more important
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:02.720]  than a biotech.
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:03.720]  I mean, what is this?
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:06.440]  This is a commanded role, this is something.
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:08.120]  I totally agree with you.
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:13.600]  I think biotech is the real danger because of the incredible disasters that can take
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:14.600]  place from it.
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:17.800]  Jason, go over some more subsections for him and get his take on it.
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:18.800]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:23.080]  What really alarms me about the K-12 students is that in order to get these scholarships,
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:25.680]  you have to work for the government.
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:28.640]  You have to work for the federal government.
[2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:33.000]  And when you see an economy that's totally faltering, totally falling down, of course
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:34.960]  you're going to take these scholarships, Alex.
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:37.040]  And these are young, impressionable minds.
[2:37:37.040 --> 2:37:41.200]  They're going to be the ones that are trained to watch the CCTV cameras and the drones they
[2:37:41.200 --> 2:37:42.200]  release.
[2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:43.200]  Well, let's get into some other sections for him.
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:44.200]  Absolutely.
[2:37:44.200 --> 2:37:49.400]  Let's move into how they're creating a cybersecurity advisory panel.
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:54.600]  They'll have real-time cybersecurity dashboards where everything will be watched and monitored.
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:56.760]  But they want to do this regionally as well.
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:00.480]  They want to make sure that the infrastructure is not only federalized, Alex, but it's in
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:01.680]  your local and state government.
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:05.800]  And they say they give it sections of it to private corporations, and then you have all
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:06.960]  these sweetheart deals.
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:12.320]  It's like Chertoff making the order for the body scanners, and then he gets money from
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:13.320]  it.
[2:38:13.320 --> 2:38:18.880]  I mean, isn't this also a big boon to the military industrial surveillance grid where
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:23.400]  they get to make all these big profits off cybersecurity?
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:24.400]  Declan McCullough?
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:25.400]  Yeah.
[2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:26.400]  Right.
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:27.400]  It's along the same vein.
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:30.840]  I mean, there are lots of problems with this.
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:35.720]  I mean, the first is where in the Constitution does the government explicit authority to
[2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:36.720]  do this.
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:37.720]  I haven't found it.
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:42.320]  I mean, maybe eventually we'll be on earth.
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:50.120]  There's also a secondary question of, you know, if these people conducting surveillance
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:55.880]  or watching the dashboard, and I'm not familiar with the bill, but I haven't actually written
[2:38:55.880 --> 2:38:56.880]  about it.
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:38:57.880]  Can you speak up for us, Declan?
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  Sure.
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:02.600]  There's the folks who are running the or monitoring the dashboard.
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:07.240]  I'm not familiar with the bill, but I haven't actually written about it.
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:12.320]  If we could, these people were paradigm of virtue, but the platonic ideal of civil servant
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:17.840]  thinking could be trusted perfectly, then maybe it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:24.080]  But the problem is that civil servants, bureaucrats for humans, they have flaws, surveillance
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:28.040]  programs are abused, and who's going to watch the watchers?
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:29.040]  Exactly.
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:30.720]  Let's get into some more subsections, Jason.
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:35.280]  Well, you talked a lot about standardizing software, so I want to read that subsection
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:36.280]  as well.
[2:39:36.280 --> 2:39:39.200]  This is section six, and we're putting this all under NIST, the National Institute of
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:43.480]  Standards and Technology, that we both know have been corrupt in the past.
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:45.400]  This is subsection five.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:50.920]  Standard software configuration, the institute shall establish standard configurations consisting
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:56.560]  of security settings for operating system softwares and software utilities widely used
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:01.520]  in the federal government, by government contractors, and grantees, and in the private
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:05.560]  sector owned critical infrastructure, but everything to them is critical infrastructure.
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:09.520]  Then they define critical infrastructure, NEIT, down to anybody that has a company that
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:10.880]  serves 100 or more.
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:11.880]  That's right.
[2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:18.320]  Now, special, this is in subsection six, right here, make loans on a selective short-term
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:24.840]  basis of items of advanced cybersecurity countermeasures to small businesses with less than 100 employees.
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:29.320]  They're going after everybody, big and small, to get this grid into place, Alex.
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:30.320]  I'll tell you what I want to do.
[2:40:30.320 --> 2:40:33.400]  I want to finish up with Declan McCullough from CNET News.
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:37.400]  Let's have you back in the last 15, 20 minutes of the show to go through that subsection
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:40.640]  by subsection, because I've covered it a few months ago, you covered it a few weeks
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:41.640]  ago.
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:44.480]  I want to go back over this, because this is getting ready to probably pass the Congress.
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:47.400]  Declan McCullough, any word on when this could pass?
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:48.400]  It's passed the House.
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:53.520]  I think it passed the House in early February, but a lot of things passed the House and behind
[2:40:53.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  the Senate.
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:58.240]  I wouldn't say, I'll say the odds are that are very good.
[2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:03.560]  It will not become law, the yearbook in part, that also depends on whether this becomes
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:06.520]  the controversial piece of legislation that people are actually calling their senators
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:11.320]  about or not, and I don't know whether that's going to happen.
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:15.360]  We've got about eight minutes left with you, Declan McCullough, CNET News, fire out the
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:20.840]  website for CNET.
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:26.400]  Tell folks the best place to go on the CNET website and read your articles.
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:33.000]  The best place to go is news.com, that's NEWS.com, pretty easy to get to, and you can type in
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  my name, B-E-C-L-A-N, and that's the first box you'll find.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:37.840]  Well, you do write a lot of great articles.
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:39.360]  I learn a lot from you.
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:42.800]  What are you most concerned about with Big Brother surveillance?
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:48.040]  It's actually a cell phone right now, but I've spent a lot of time thinking about it
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:53.000]  and writing about it in the last month or so, and there are two aspects.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:56.240]  The first is tracking, and the second is examining them.
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:59.560]  They're probably more interesting.
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:06.120]  There's an open question about whether or not the federal government can track the location
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:09.440]  of your cell phone without a warrant.
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:10.440]  Courts have split on this.
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:16.000]  The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this, and it depends, in part, on whether the courts
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:21.080]  are going to say that the Fourth Amendment applies, that it's a constitution, a reasonable
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:26.840]  expectation of privacy, and unreasonable purchase of features applies.
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:31.960]  There's the Bush administration made the argument that warrantless tracking is perfectly okay,
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:35.160]  and the Obama administration has made exactly the same argument.
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:39.880]  DOJ is saying that warrantless tracking is permitted because Americans enjoy no reasonable
[2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:43.760]  expectation of privacy in their cell phones whereabouts, and this is an important issue
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:47.800]  because your cell phone is a radio transmitter and a receiver.
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:52.880]  It costs the radio towers, and through triangulation or through GPS, the radio towers have a pretty
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:53.880]  good idea of where you are.
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:43:00.800]  And now cell phones are becoming your briefcase, your calendar, your wallet, everything in computers
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:04.760]  as you know, but for some of the audits that may not know, is going into cell phones.
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:11.520]  They are now, like my iPhone, is just a little mini laptop, and so they're saying you have
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:17.680]  no privacy in your own home business or your own corporate business, and that dovetails
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:22.160]  now, first it's the borders, now regular airports inside the country, are seizing people's
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:28.480]  laptops, phones without, and they put a ruling out two days ago on this, without any perception
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:32.120]  that you've done anything wrong, no due process, no probable cause.
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.040]  What an amazing statement that we'll do whatever we want with your cell phones.
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:37.040]  We don't care.
[2:43:37.040 --> 2:43:41.400]  Okay, so that's the second half of this, let's put tracking aside for the moment and
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:45.440]  talk about examining your cell phones, which is really more of a privacy threat in some
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:51.560]  way, because your cell phone knows more about you than maybe your closest friends do.
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:56.920]  It knows where you're going to be for your calendar, knows where you had dinner, knows
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:43:59.360]  who you've been emailing with and all that.
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:04.640]  It's basically like a diary and probably even more personal than your laptop nowadays.
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:09.640]  And so this is another unresolved legal issue.
[2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:15.960]  When police arrest you, and maybe you're not charged with crime, if you're just detained,
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:20.440]  maybe you're at a protest, and you're arrested and released an hour later without any charges
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:25.600]  being filed, can they look at your cell phone and they book it into their police computer
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:28.840]  and copy over all the content?
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:57.560]  Well, I saw that in the night circuit two weeks ago and the dissenting judge was the
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:44:59.120]  chief justice of the night circuit.
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:01.200]  He said there's no more Fourth Amendment.
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:06.600]  The police went in this guy's house with no expectation or no idea he committed any crime.
[2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:09.840]  I mean, it's just they're blasting past the Fourth Amendment.
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:12.760]  And I think people are just too calmly accepting this.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:18.840]  This precious hedge of the Bill of Rights and Constitution is there for a reason.
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:22.840]  And every time governments go over that edge, they slide all the way to the bottom.
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:33.200]  Of course, it's almost like the Bill of Rights is the word lawyers use untethered from its
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:34.200]  actual language.
[2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:40.160]  Of course, interpretations don't really track what the Constitution says, in many cases.
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:41.720]  There are exceptions.
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:42.720]  There are loopholes.
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:48.280]  I mean, you had the Supreme Court yesterday in the Second Amendment case, the McDonald's
[2:45:48.280 --> 2:45:49.280]  case.
[2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:53.720]  And unfortunately, it wasn't there, but I read the transcript in its entirety.
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:46:02.000]  And you had all of the blocks of liberal justice saying, well, we may have to extend
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:09.480]  the Second Amendment to the state, but we'll make it a really weak right that can be infringed
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:12.480]  at any time the state government can stop by the Fourth Amendment.
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:13.480]  Exactly.
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:17.920]  This is being billed as a pro-gun ruling the one a year and a half ago, and now the new
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:23.000]  one because we haven't seen the ruling yet, but they're making noises from the court watchers'
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  perspective.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  And they're saying, you got a right, and the right is we can take your guns.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:34.400]  And the bad thing is that you have a right, but it's a really weak right.
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:42.920]  Maybe you can keep a single, or maybe a 12-gauge single-shot shotgun in your house, but you
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:44.920]  can actually leave the house.
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:48.320]  I mean, you can imagine, you have the right, but the right is so small it may not even
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:49.320]  exist.
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:54.920]  And you didn't have any justice, unfortunately, not even, say, Justice Scalia talking about
[2:46:54.920 --> 2:46:59.520]  the actual test of the Second Amendment, which shall not be infringed, which sounds
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:01.920]  pretty clear to me.
[2:47:01.920 --> 2:47:03.360]  Well we know what the Founders said.
[2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:05.120]  We know what the state constitutions say.
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:07.640]  We know what the common law practice of the Second Amendment is.
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:14.440]  It's Vermont style, open carry, and they started out in the 60s, oh, let's stop felons and
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:20.080]  all that did was make the felons safe to rob and rape the public in Chicago and New York.
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:24.880]  And yeah, I've been reading the text of what the Supreme Court justices were saying in
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:27.360]  these arguments in the last few days.
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:33.220]  And it's very clear they're going to rule yes states, you do have to extend some right,
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:37.440]  but as you said, that's a right for us to basically restrict your Second Amendment.
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:40.200]  So you have a right, but we have a right to restrict it.
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:42.640]  And so they're saying, oh, for the first time, the Supreme Court's going to say you have
[2:47:42.640 --> 2:47:43.640]  a right.
[2:47:43.640 --> 2:47:47.480]  Oh, for the first time, they're saying you don't have a total right.
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:50.080]  And it's just unbelievably evil.
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:52.440]  We've got Larry Pratt on about that tomorrow.
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:57.120]  In the last minute and a half, Declan McCullough, other areas, other areas of surveillance and
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:48:01.320]  tyranny and corruption that you're reporting on that people should be made aware of.
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:07.360]  Here's one that actually combines the internet and the McDonough rights.
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:10.640]  So Palo Alto is the city, it's where Stanford University is.
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:14.200]  It's about maybe 40 miles south of San Francisco.
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:19.920]  And you may have actually covered this, that there was one of the police detectives in
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:26.200]  East Palo Alto apparently posted a note on Facebook, turning to kill anyone, he found
[2:48:26.200 --> 2:48:30.360]  openly carrying a handgun, even if that person was carrying it perfectly legally, this is
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:31.360]  open carry.
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:39.520]  And so I wrote about that, it was an interesting story, you can find it on news.com, even under
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:43.160]  California law, Sacramento hasn't gotten around to restricting this yet, it's generally legal
[2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:48.000]  for California residents to carry handguns openly as long as they're unloaded.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:54.280]  But this fellow, Rod Doulasson, is a detective that said, well, if we, if he saw someone
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:57.800]  doing that, he would have pulled the AR out and thrown them all out, and if one of them
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:01.880]  made a furtive movement two weeks off, which is a reference to two weeks of death's duty,
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:04.440]  if an officer just charges a weapon.
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:09.240]  And so I talked to these Palo Alto police captains about the Facebook comments, and he said they
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:13.120]  are not reflective of our department of policies, but then again, he knows the personal web
[2:49:13.120 --> 2:49:16.320]  days, and I'm not really defending the officer, but I thought he thought it was a personal
[2:49:16.320 --> 2:49:18.760]  web date, so like, let's not really get too worried about it.
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:23.800]  But it shows their attitude, and now we have the ATF seizing $30,000 plus of not even
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:29.480]  VB guns, rubber pellet toy guns, and then now I have news articles today where they're
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:34.160]  defending it saying we want the federal government to pass laws restricting toy guns.
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:39.120]  I mean, if they're arresting kids who draw a picture of a gun at school now, I mean,
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:44.640]  they're acting like guns in the hands of common slaves is like the ultimate evil, it's worse
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:45.640]  than child porn.
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:50.040]  Well, I mean, we're going down the path that great person has already taken, I mean, we
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:53.680]  should ban even toy guns because that might give people the idea that guns are okay, it's
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:55.240]  perfectly clear.
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:49:58.880]  And there's no real lobby to support toy guns, so they may get away with it.
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:03.320]  Declan McCullough, amazing information, thank you for spending the last 45 minutes with
[2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:04.320]  us.
[2:50:04.320 --> 2:50:05.320]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:09.280]  You guys can read your great work at the CNET News website or news.com as you said.
[2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:10.280]  Take care.
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:11.280]  Thank you much.
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:12.280]  All right.
[2:50:12.280 --> 2:50:13.280]  There he goes.
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:16.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back, get into some financial news.
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:18.320]  Next hour is going to be completely jam-packed.
[2:50:18.320 --> 2:50:21.520]  I'm covering all this news and the cybersecurity bill.
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:23.520]  I mean, it's on every subject.
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:25.280]  It's all coming up before we go to break.
[2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:28.960]  I want to thank some of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:31.240]  One of them is eFoodsDirect.com.

[2:50:45.240 --> 2:50:46.640]  They've got it for special diets.
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:48.000]  They are the big kahuna.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:51.080]  They're number one because they're the best and it's who I buy my storeable foods from.
[2:50:51.080 --> 2:50:52.960]  You'll never stand on a bread line if you have your own bread.
[2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:56.000]  These uncertain times don't count on the government.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.520]  Look what happens in disasters and financial crises.
[2:50:58.520 --> 2:51:02.240]  You need to have a year's supply of food or a six-month, a month, whatever.
[2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:04.280]  This stuff lasts for more than 10 years.

[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:15.960]  Also want to thank the great folks at Front Sight Firearms Training.

[2:51:59.680 --> 2:52:02.560]  Stay with us.
[2:52:02.560 --> 2:52:06.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:09.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:13.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:52:13.800 --> 2:52:14.800]  at home.
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:19.440]  They've determined to set influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:20.440]  calling the shots.
[2:52:20.440 --> 2:52:25.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:25.720 --> 2:52:29.040]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:34.880]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:52:34.880 --> 2:52:35.880]  world government.
[2:52:35.880 --> 2:52:38.280]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:52:38.280 --> 2:52:42.400]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:47.800]  Today, it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:49.640]  a fall of the Republic.

[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:09.640]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[2:54:09.640 --> 2:54:11.840]  The world is changing fast.
[2:54:11.840 --> 2:54:14.080]  Are you fully prepared?
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:17.320]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:25.800]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:28.040]  meat for half price.
[2:54:28.040 --> 2:54:36.200]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:39.560]  10,000 heirloom seeds.
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:44.560]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:49.000]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.600]  Food insurance just in case.
[2:54:51.600 --> 2:54:56.920]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me Radio Show.
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:55:07.760]  Folks, the news is so important in the next hour.
[2:55:07.760 --> 2:55:10.920]  I mean, just all of this is so key.
[2:55:10.920 --> 2:55:14.440]  We know where the future of this country is going and the globalists have their way.
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:16.480]  I wanted to get some into the economy right now.
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:19.640]  I keep hearing the media out on one side of their mouse say it's gotten great.
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:23.400]  The other side is saying it's fallen apart with record joblessness, factory shutting
[2:55:23.400 --> 2:55:25.240]  down, government growing.
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:31.320]  I have articles like USA Today, New Ghost Towns, Industrial Communities, Teeter on the edge.
[2:55:31.320 --> 2:55:38.400]  Gold hits six and a half week high went up to $1,141.70.
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:39.400]  It's even higher.
[2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:40.560]  It's at the highest level.
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:44.160]  It's ever been in Europe because the euro is in so much trouble.
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:45.880]  The dollar is in trouble.
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:49.240]  We know what's going to happen with what these banks are doing.
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:54.560]  Anglo-Gold plans to scour ocean floor as gold reserves dwindle.
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:56:00.320]  So you have this gold rush going and the mines can't find enough gold.
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:01.600]  It just goes on and on.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:06.200]  So I briefly wanted to get Ted Anderson up for the next three or four minutes to talk
[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:08.360]  about the same offer he gave yesterday.
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:13.840]  He can still give you the same offer from when he bought gold at $1,065 an ounce with
[2:56:13.840 --> 2:56:16.960]  it $1,141.
[2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:21.480]  So he passes on all those savings and the free international forecaster newsletter.
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:25.160]  That's 45 to 50 pages that comes out twice a week.
[2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:29.720]  You can get a hard copy or the digital when you call up and buy one fifth of an ounce
[2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:32.480]  European gold Frank coin.
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:35.720]  That's like buying gold at $500 an ounce with that deal.
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:37.160]  He has a bunch of other deals.
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:41.680]  Ted, give people today's important offer so they can protect themselves from currency
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:42.680]  devaluation.
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:43.680]  Yeah.
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:49.520]  Presently right now the Frank is at $261.61 and if you do buy that one coin, you will
[2:56:49.520 --> 2:56:54.280]  get a full year subscription to the international forecaster, which will give you the information
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:56:59.000]  you need to make sense of this crazy environment that we're in, of course.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:05.240]  20 dollar liberties right now at $1,363, I mean that price is unheard of US Eagles are
[2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:06.960]  over $1,200 an ounce.
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:09.080]  That's $100 over a US Eagle.
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:13.240]  That coin is a pre-1933 100 year old coin.
[2:57:13.240 --> 2:57:19.320]  So it, you know, just trading pretty much at its melt as well, which is, you know, rarely
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:20.640]  do I get that opportunity.
[2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:23.960]  Of course I did buy those at 1,053.
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:31.200]  We did hit the resistance point of 1,146 20 today and that is a resistance level.
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:33.360]  The next one is 1160.
[2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:35.960]  So we want that's what Bloomberg and others are saying.
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:39.360]  They're saying it's probably going to go to 1,160.
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:42.600]  If it goes past that, they're saying the sky could be the limit.
[2:57:42.600 --> 2:57:43.600]  Yeah.
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:47.800]  That's when you get past your 1220 1240 like we did last time around.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:52.160]  And of course, the only thing standing in the way of that is that the dollars closer
[2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:54.880]  to 80 than it is to 70.
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:59.760]  The euro is already taken the depth and they've already seen the market peak out to a level
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:03.040]  that it's never seen before in Europe and also Britain.
[2:58:03.040 --> 2:58:06.000]  So what's the case here with the United States?
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:10.520]  I think that the United States dollar is in as much trouble as the euro and I'm sure
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:12.520]  that the dollar, that goal to reflect that.
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:17.800]  So and that's because all these currencies are being lowered and valued in a coordinated
[2:58:17.800 --> 2:58:24.040]  fashion by the G 20 and they're now economists, ABC News and other financial crisis on the
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:25.040]  way.
[2:58:25.040 --> 2:58:26.040]  But don't worry.
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:31.560]  The Nobel Prize winning group calls for stronger financial reforms, higher taxes, more money
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:34.280]  to the bankers or will end up like Greece.
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:40.240]  We saw the leader of the Democratic Senate talking about that yesterday.
[2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:42.520]  They're holding us hostage.
[2:58:42.520 --> 2:58:43.880]  We've got to expose these people.
[2:58:43.880 --> 2:58:46.200]  That's one way to politically stop them to point out.
[2:58:46.200 --> 2:58:50.960]  They are the harbingers and the people creating all of this to get more power, but individually
[2:58:50.960 --> 2:58:54.960]  on the micro level, people need to get into gold and silver to give people some of the
[2:58:54.960 --> 2:59:00.680]  gold coins, some of the silver coin, a specific offer so people understand how good of a deal
[2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:01.680]  this is.
[2:59:01.680 --> 2:59:02.680]  Sure.
[2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:03.680]  Of course.
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:04.680]  Well, let's take a look.
[2:59:04.680 --> 2:59:09.120]  First of all, that Montana silver round is at 1873 silver right now is just approaching
[2:59:09.120 --> 2:59:10.800]  $17 an ounce.
[2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:14.000]  That thing usually trades at about $2 over spot.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:16.120]  You know that Lakota is right on our low.
[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:18.160]  There's a lot of things that I have that are real low at this point.
[2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:20.120]  The point is, we're out of time.
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:21.120]  People need to call the brokers.
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:22.120]  Hello.
[2:59:22.120 --> 2:59:24.880]  It's the Alex Jones special to get these huge discounts or to get the free newsletter
[2:59:24.880 --> 2:59:31.880]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:32.880]  They've got Franks.
[2:59:32.880 --> 2:59:33.880]  They've got Sovereigns.
[2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:34.880]  They've got Eagles.
[2:59:34.880 --> 2:59:39.280]  They've got a bunch of great silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[2:59:39.280 --> 2:59:45.560]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:59:45.560 --> 2:59:52.400]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:52.400 --> 2:59:56.360]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:59:56.360 --> 3:00:01.040]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:05.200]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:00:05.200 --> 3:00:09.840]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:15.080]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:21.360]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:25.680]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:31.000]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:36.240]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:42.200]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:43.800]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:01:09.080]  This is www.silverlungs.com.
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:26.520]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the first line of defense for the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:43.040]  I am Alex Jones, we're live here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard
[3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:44.040]  Time, 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:45.040]  And we're very excited to have all of you tuning in today.
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:46.040]  I want to tell you about some of the new stations that are picking up the show as well as XM
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:51.720]  weeknights coming up in the next segment, so be ready for that information.
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:54.320]  Here is what's coming up in the hour.
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:58.840]  The most important news after I cover some other information that I'm going to really
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:04.840]  spend the lion's share of the time on is, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:13.000]  they are demonizing Bachman of Minnesota, Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, myself, but really
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:19.320]  a lot of main line conservatives and implying that we're dangerous terrorists, that we're
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:22.840]  going to strike, that we're going to attack.
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:27.560]  And Paul Watson has written an article detailing how the FBI, the Southern Poverty Law Center
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:31.800]  and others were involved with McVeigh, this came out in court documents.
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:39.240]  They're using crises, stage crises in many cases, in many cases, to demonize their opposition.
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:46.600]  And they're trying to demonize the only real opposition to their new World Order program,
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:48.920]  and that is what is known as the Tea Party Movement.
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:52.520]  And they're worried about it growing, becoming more mainstream, so they're trying to label
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:59.720]  it as bad, but you saw Rick Perry come to office, back into office, well, to get the
[3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:03.880]  Republican nomination, he'll probably beat the Democrat easily in this Republican state
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:07.720]  by posing as one of these supposed radical Tea Party people.
[3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:12.840]  So we're going to be going over all the Democratic and Republican gatekeeping as they try to
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:18.200]  demonize the patriot movement in this country, but they can't have it both ways.
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:23.960]  And leadership acting like they're patriots, but at the same time demonizing patriots,
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:24.960]  that is coming up.
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:32.200]  Also, you heard Declan McCullough of CBS News, CNET News, explaining to you, and I agree
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:36.960]  with him, we've got Larry Pratt of Gunners of America coming on tomorrow, that this Supreme
[3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:39.760]  Court ruling they're set to make, and they've basically told the world what they're going
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:43.360]  to do in their arguments, is anti-gun.
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:46.200]  They're saying, yes, you have a right to have a gun, but we have a right to restrict your
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:47.560]  right to a gun.
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:55.520]  This is very, very serious news, so we need to girt ourselves for this coming down the
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:03:56.520]  road.
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:03:59.400]  I also want to get into the fact they're going after replica guns.
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:04.480]  We covered that some yesterday, but more on that coming up in the broadcast.
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:09.000]  Also, we'll talk about the Chilean quake.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  May have shortened the day, may have changed how fast the earth rotated.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:21.160]  That's out of CBC, Canadian Broadcasting News, and I'm getting a lot of emails and calls
[3:04:21.160 --> 3:04:29.160]  a weekend of this saying, well, Alex, or less than a week into it, or we four or five days
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:33.080]  into it, you know, Alex, is this an earthquake weapon?
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:37.560]  Well, the government says Secretary of Defense Cohen told the Army Times they have earthquake
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:39.040]  weapons in 97.
[3:04:39.040 --> 3:04:41.160]  I don't know.
[3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:46.600]  It's been reported that that's some of the things harp can do, but if we continue to
[3:04:46.600 --> 3:04:51.560]  see big cities being hit by unusual earthquakes, but I mean, it's natural though to have a
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:52.560]  lot of earthquakes.
[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:53.560]  So I don't know.
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:55.400]  I know the government says they have this.
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:05:01.080]  I know in countries that have these earthquakes, they say the sky lights up before it happens.
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:02.360]  That's never been seen before.
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:08.400]  That was talked about on CNN and MSNBC will be playing that clip coming up because that
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:12.080]  kind of gets into conspiracy theory area and I don't cover that much, but when the government
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.600]  admits they have these systems, it's just like they've declassified chemtrails to a
[3:05:16.600 --> 3:05:17.600]  certain extent.
[3:05:17.600 --> 3:05:18.920]  Oh, yes, we're doing weather modification.
[3:05:18.920 --> 3:05:23.840]  Yes, we're spraying you to save you from global warming where geoengineering as the
[3:05:23.840 --> 3:05:27.640]  White House science are, John P. Holdren has been saying.
[3:05:27.640 --> 3:05:30.120]  So we're going to get into the second amendment issue.
[3:05:30.120 --> 3:05:36.640]  Then we're going to get into the demonization of true Americans and how I believe they're
[3:05:36.640 --> 3:05:40.760]  going to stage a false flag terror attack very soon to be blamed on us.
[3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:43.440]  The whole stack thing could have even been that a lot of evidence points towards that
[3:05:43.440 --> 3:05:46.400]  being a false flag inside stage provocation.
[3:05:46.400 --> 3:05:49.760]  Jason Burmans will join us for about 10 minutes towards the end of the show to go over the
[3:05:49.760 --> 3:05:53.440]  cybersecurity act because even Declan McCullough wasn't aware of what was in it.
[3:05:53.440 --> 3:05:57.400]  So we've got a job to do to let everybody know what's really in this bill and just
[3:05:57.400 --> 3:05:58.400]  how bad it is.
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:05:59.400]  Yeah, we're weirdos.
[3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:00.560]  We read the bills.
[3:06:00.560 --> 3:06:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:06:05.240 --> 3:06:09.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:14.200]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[3:06:14.200 --> 3:06:15.200]  you to have.
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:16.200]  It's true.
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:20.880]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:06:20.880 --> 3:06:25.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[3:06:25.200 --> 3:06:29.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:32.720]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:36.440]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:41.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:06:41.200 --> 3:06:44.960]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,

[3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:10.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:11.640]  You want answers?
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:13.840]  Well, so does he.
[3:09:13.840 --> 3:09:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:23.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:30.960]  Okay, we don't know exactly what the Supreme Court ruling will be in the next few months
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:32.600]  when they release it.
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:35.360]  But the last week, they've been hearing arguments on it.
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:42.280]  And court watchers from the Associated Press, anti-gun groups, pro-second amendment groups,
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:45.480]  all agree that it's bad news.
[3:09:45.480 --> 3:09:49.840]  Some of the media is billing it as pro-second amendment.
[3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:58.080]  But if you read what the justices were saying, including Scalia and others, they are saying
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:06.040]  that states have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations
[3:10:06.040 --> 3:10:12.960]  said Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is among the majority.
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:15.880]  And they talk about other previous rulings.
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:21.520]  And it appeared that all of the justices agreed, and then this may be some type of unanimous
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:25.720]  decision when it comes out, that, oh, yeah, you got a right to keep bare arms.
[3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:26.840]  It isn't an individual right.
[3:10:26.840 --> 3:10:32.000]  But if we want a locally or federally totally restricted down to almost nothing, we can
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  do that.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:40.480]  I mean, the Violence Policy Center, handgun control, Incorporated, and others have now
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:44.280]  come out and said, oh, we kind of like this ruling.
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:50.240]  You see, there were never had to be rulings at the federal level about the Second Amendment
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:52.160]  because everyone knew what it meant.
[3:10:52.160 --> 3:10:54.920]  And so when they say there's never been a ruling on the Second Amendment until a year
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:58.720]  and a half ago with the D.C. versus Heller.
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:04.680]  And in that case, you know, people's own homes, their businesses, they would be robbed, raped,
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:10.800]  killed at gunpoint because D.C., New York City, and Chicago all have the highest crime
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:16.640]  rates in the country because they have absolute gunbands in place for the citizens.
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:18.960]  And the criminals don't follow the law.
[3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:20.800]  And they understand that.
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:23.880]  And look, it's simple.
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:26.000]  They want you to be their slaves.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:27.960]  They don't want you armed.
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:29.640]  It's the same all over the world.
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:34.840]  Every country in the world has banned or is moving to ban and restrict people's right
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:36.560]  to self-defense.
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:41.160]  And the police will tell you all the federal and state courts have ruled over and over
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:43.040]  again.
[3:11:43.040 --> 3:11:48.520]  Police have no responsibility to protect you from the commission of a crime, rape, robbery,
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:51.800]  murder, torture, any of it.
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:56.080]  They are there to respond after laws have been violated.
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:11:59.520]  And that's why in court cases, people say on the cops didn't show up for 20 minutes
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:03.720]  to my 911 call and, you know, my daughter got killed and they say, well, they have
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:05.800]  no responsibility to.
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:14.680]  We have a responsibility to defend ourselves and they want us domesticated as a society.
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:21.240]  So we've gone from, if you looked at polls 30, 40 years ago, people kind of got brainwashed
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:25.680]  about guns for a while and it became trendy to be anti-gun until people saw how crime
[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:28.600]  went up when they started restricting guns.
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:30.160]  And the polls were pretty much 50-50.
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:35.920]  Now the polls are in the mid-70s and it's growing every year where the vast majority
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:41.880]  of Americans know the second amendment is good and want no laws.
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:46.920]  They don't even want felons barred because they know felons will still have guns regardless.
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:48.440]  They don't want their rights touched.
[3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:54.120]  They want their right to defend themselves back and they are going to fight in the courts
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:57.680]  and in the court of public opinion to defend it.
[3:12:57.680 --> 3:13:01.080]  And so the government's kind of shut up on the surface about going after guns, but is
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:07.240]  using the ATF to restrict legal importation of firearms, to harass gun dealers, gun manufacturers,
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:12.440]  to go after states like Montana and Tennessee and others that are passing laws or have passed
[3:13:12.440 --> 3:13:18.680]  laws saying they can manufacture their own guns in their state outside of federal control.
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:23.880]  Then the feds try to use the commerce clause to come in and shut that down and not allow
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:26.280]  that.
[3:13:26.280 --> 3:13:28.280]  So the fight is on for the second amendment.
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:29.280]  The American people know this.
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:34.560]  That's why, what is it, 16 million guns the last year and three months since Obama got
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:39.960]  into office, he got into office 13 and a half months ago, but after he got elected back
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:43.400]  in November it's about 15 months, 16 months.
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:50.360]  Since then you've seen a million guns a month being sold.
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:54.680]  They've got over 200 million guns in the country, over 150 million gun owners and they've got
[3:13:54.680 --> 3:13:55.760]  a big problem.
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:13:59.520]  Now anywhere they can though, whether it's not a lobby or anybody to protect the second
[3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:04.760]  amendment, they're going after it like the case in Oregon where the guy for years has
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:09.400]  been importing to their toy store airsoft BB guns, they don't even shoot real BBs.
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:12.120]  The ATF has no regulatory authority over BB guns.
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:16.040]  They've now grabbed toy guns that shoot plastic pellets and say there's no law, no judge,
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:17.040]  no jury.
[3:14:17.040 --> 3:14:18.240]  We're just doing what we want.
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:22.560]  And I played the ATF officer basically saying, well, this gun's scary.
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:26.520]  It looks like a real gun, so I'm going to ban it because I'm God, kind of like the Austin
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:31.320]  police chief with the ATF shutting down an 18 year old gun show with no law just saying
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:33.680]  I feel like it had shut down.
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:34.680]  But look at Canada.
[3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:38.560]  This is from the CBC replica gun should be licensed.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:42.960]  Safety council says replica guns should be licensed and registered just like the real
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:45.680]  thing says safety advocates and police.
[3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:49.080]  That's the government that thinks where their slaves in recent years, police officers across
[3:14:49.080 --> 3:14:51.600]  the country have shot and killed several people holding guns.
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:53.040]  They later turned out to be replicas.
[3:14:53.040 --> 3:14:57.680]  Well, I mean, so take everybody's rights because somebody might be hurt.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:00.800]  Again, that's how they do it.
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:07.080]  So we see these deceptive headlines about US Supreme court set to extend gun rights.
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:09.840]  But then you read deeper into the AP and ABC news articles.
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:13.160]  It says, oh, but they're allowed to restrict your right.
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:15.720]  You have a right to turn your guns in.
[3:15:15.720 --> 3:15:17.840]  You have a right to be disarmed.
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:23.120]  You have a right to have a disassembled gun locked in a safe that you can never use and
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:26.240]  you can't take it out and shoot it.
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:29.640]  Basically what's happening in DC now.
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:34.880]  In other scary news, New York Times, EU clears biotech potato for cultivation.
[3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:42.400]  The European Commission began a new push Tuesday to allow farmers in Europe to grow more biotech
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:47.280]  crops, clearing a genetically modified potato for cultivation, despite persistent public
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:50.760]  opposition to the technology.
[3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:58.120]  And folks, every one of these tomatoes, potatoes, corn, you name it, in every study, in every
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:03.920]  study reduces fertility or outright sterilizes rodents, guinea pigs, rats, mice that it's
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:05.840]  fed to.
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:12.160]  There's massive studies about honeybees eating the pollen from GMO Monsanto corn and dying
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:15.040]  in just one example.
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:24.560]  That corn grows in it a natural pesticide that kills bugs that eat it.
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:26.920]  But then you, a human, it's supposedly safe.
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:36.080]  They're saying for you to eat that when every major director or sub director of the FDA in
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:40.520]  the last few decades has been a former Monsanto executive and Obama just appointed a new one
[3:16:40.520 --> 3:16:46.680]  over all the regulatory affairs who will decide, I mean, this is a disaster.
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:54.080]  And you have the globalist deceiving the public saying, look, GMO, cross species, you know,
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:17:00.000]  where they put insect genes and corn or human genes and salmon, I mean, it's, it's wild.
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:04.560]  Sometimes they stack hundreds of different animals and insects into one plant and all
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:08.280]  these genetic traits.
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:11.160]  What fake conservatives do is they say, oh, that's all a liberal thing.
[3:17:11.160 --> 3:17:12.160]  You know, they're lying.
[3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:13.160]  They're demon.
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:14.160]  I don't know.
[3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:18.280]  The Obama's supporting all of this Europe, the people don't want it, but their governments
[3:17:18.280 --> 3:17:19.280]  are forcing it on them.
[3:17:19.280 --> 3:17:21.320]  It's a nonpartisan issue.
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:23.640]  And what Limbaugh and others will do, I've heard them do it over and over again, they'll
[3:17:23.640 --> 3:17:28.440]  say, look, George Washington Carver cross different types of sweet potatoes and different
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:36.800]  types of varieties of wheat and different varieties of watermelons and different varieties of squash
[3:17:36.800 --> 3:17:41.160]  and different varieties of soybeans.
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:46.120]  And well, yeah, I mean, I mean, if you take two different varieties of plant and mix them
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:49.720]  naturally through pollinization, that's completely normal.
[3:17:49.720 --> 3:17:51.220]  That's natural.
[3:17:51.220 --> 3:17:52.280]  That's like dog breeding.
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:55.800]  You take different dogs and breed them together to get a new type of breed.
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:18:02.640]  You're still dealing with the original genetics of canine, familiar us, the dog.
[3:18:02.640 --> 3:18:08.280]  When you breed different types of cows with cows, other cows, you're still dealing with
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:10.000]  the original water buffalo.
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:17.720]  You're still dealing with the original bovine species, but when you take spider genes and
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:23.520]  put them into goats, so the others, the breast of the goat produce body armor and the goat
[3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:26.840]  is now part spider or you make pigs part human.
[3:18:26.840 --> 3:18:29.320]  So you can take their hearts and transplant them in humans.
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:31.600]  That was done 20 years ago.
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:34.240]  And it causes new viruses.
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:39.120]  It allows cross species, different diseases and viruses to spread.
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:43.960]  And this is the real threat societally.
[3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:46.200]  And you're worried about terrorism or nuclear weapons.
[3:18:46.200 --> 3:18:51.280]  That is nothing compared to genetic engineering, nanotech and the globalist could care less.
[3:18:51.280 --> 3:18:56.200]  They're just running headlong with all of this and every major GMO crop they bring out
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:19:00.640]  for some reason happens to reduce fertility and all mammal species.
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:04.720]  And you got these big fortune 100 companies always having conferences about how they want
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:08.880]  to forcibly put stuff in the water to reduce world population, the White House science
[3:19:08.880 --> 3:19:14.760]  are writing 1200 page books about it proposing doing it.
[3:19:14.760 --> 3:19:17.480]  They're already doing it through the food.
[3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:22.200]  This is being done by design.
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:27.520]  Now when we come back, I'm going to get into today's top news.
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:32.720]  I believe the establishment is getting ready to stage false flag events, false terror in
[3:19:32.720 --> 3:19:36.560]  America to blame it on conservative libertarian patriot movement.
[3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:40.360]  And again, even Michael Savage has figured this out and he's talking about this almost
[3:19:40.360 --> 3:19:41.360]  every day.
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:43.000]  People send me the audio clips.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:47.840]  And if we can get the public to wake up to this tried and trusted tool, the Tsars in
[3:19:47.840 --> 3:19:53.440]  Russia 100 years ago would blow up a building, blame it on their enemies, round up thousands.
[3:19:53.440 --> 3:19:55.760]  The communists did it after the Tsars left.
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:19:57.120]  Hitler did it.
[3:19:57.120 --> 3:20:01.520]  The Reichstag to launch the war against Poland at Gliwitz.
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:06.480]  Our government has declassified that they do this and they demonize anybody that ever
[3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:09.160]  brings up government sponsored terror.
[3:20:09.160 --> 3:20:13.040]  Anybody who ever brings up the fact that this is possible, that governments have done this
[3:20:13.040 --> 3:20:20.960]  in the past and that they have a motive to stage crises to scare populations into submission.
[3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:26.440]  But people better wake up to false flag terror and realize it's part of history.
[3:20:26.440 --> 3:20:29.440]  It's real and it goes on.
[3:20:29.440 --> 3:20:33.480]  And if we have a full awakening to this, they won't be able to do this anymore.
[3:20:33.480 --> 3:20:39.000]  That's why they hate 9-11 Truths so much because it's damaged this program of control
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:41.400]  that they are engaging in.
[3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:43.680]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:20:43.680 --> 3:20:45.800]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[3:20:45.800 --> 3:20:53.040]  I'm going to get into this key news and break down the possible political futures that
[3:20:53.040 --> 3:20:57.320]  the different paths that we're on, many of these lines intersect.
[3:20:57.320 --> 3:21:25.520]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:48.680]  We'll be right back in FullWars.
[3:21:48.680 --> 3:21:53.680]  We'll be right back in FullWars.
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:59.280]  And again, that's 877-748-2709 at yourHCG.com.
[3:21:59.280 --> 3:22:02.880]  We love you.
[3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:06.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:09.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:22:09.760 --> 3:22:14.080]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:22:14.080 --> 3:22:15.080]  at home.
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:19.760]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:22:19.760 --> 3:22:20.760]  calling the shots.
[3:22:20.760 --> 3:22:26.120]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:31.600]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:36.280]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:22:36.280 --> 3:22:38.680]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:42.640]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:22:42.640 --> 3:22:48.200]  Today, it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:50.000]  a fall of the Republic.
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:54.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:22:54.480 --> 3:22:59.680]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:22:59.680 --> 3:23:03.240]  Good day, Peter Cranche, Numble from Midas Resources.
[3:23:03.240 --> 3:23:05.440]  Today is March 3rd, 2010.
[3:23:05.440 --> 3:23:07.720]  Gold opened this morning at 11.42.30.
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:15.400]  A 1-ounce gold coin can be purchased for 11.73.31, 5.86.65 for a half ounce, and 2.93.33 for
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:16.400]  a quarter ounce.
[3:23:16.400 --> 3:23:26.000]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:29.720]  the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a
[3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:33.880]  privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:35.000]  to service the debt?
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:39.640]  Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when he said, the central bank issuing a public
[3:23:39.640 --> 3:23:43.600]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:48.080]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary
[3:23:48.080 --> 3:23:49.080]  system works.

[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:18.520]  So the American people are angry.
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:24.360]  They know private offshore banks engineered the housing collapse, stole tens of trillions
[3:25:24.360 --> 3:25:28.640]  of bailout money, it's not 700 billion.
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:33.440]  They're discovering that they're being robbed by design, this is a global move, world government
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:38.000]  is being openly announced, the head of the IMF calls for a new global currency that the
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:44.640]  banks run and control, giving them even more power.
[3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:48.080]  And what is the system going to do when we got the internal homeland security documents,
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:52.240]  when we got army documents, they're spying on Ron Paul, the tea parties, they've got
[3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:56.840]  police with sound cannons and microwave guns out at the events.
[3:25:56.840 --> 3:26:02.040]  Anybody tries to peacefully protest the G20, police dogs are used on old women.
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:07.720]  That's coming up in our film police state for the rise of FEMA.
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:08.960]  We are the American people.
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:10.360]  It's our right to run our government.
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:12.360]  It's our right to kick the foreign bankers out.
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:16.920]  It's all right like Iceland to say we're not paying back this money, we don't owe it.
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:21.880]  Will we go like Iceland who's starting to say no or like Greece openly run by Goldman
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:28.880]  Sachs that set them up in the financial derivatives that have now destroyed them.
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:32.880]  And so the Republican and Democratic parties are all putting out public statements that
[3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:38.320]  we've got to keep extremist out of our parties, these anti banker people, these anti fellow
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:39.960]  reserve people.
[3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:43.240]  And we've got to do something about them and they're evil and the oath keepers are bad
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:47.160]  and Sheriff Mack is bad, why he's going around to sheriffs explaining to them they don't
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:52.200]  have to go under federal control and we've got FEMA and Northcom and Homeland Security
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:57.720]  and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act in PDD 51 that states the federal government
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:02.600]  is going to come in and suppress the states because they know the number one move against
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:07.880]  the new world order is by the 50 states one by one and they're starting to do it to say
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:12.440]  no to the federal government, no to their high taxes, no to their carbon taxes, no
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:16.760]  to their unconstitutional regulations.
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:22.040]  And so people are waking up, people are getting angry.
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:24.400]  So they're doing a double game here.
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:27.880]  You've got, I've heard Pelosi now saying she likes the Tea Party and some of the people
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:28.880]  in it.
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:29.880]  She knows why you're mad.
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:35.280]  You're no longer Astro turf.
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:39.200]  You've got, and she said what I meant by that was it's not real grass.
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:43.040]  It's not real grass roots, not that I'm walking on you.
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:46.800]  And we've got Rick Perry saying, let's secede, which isn't 10th amendment.
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:48.680]  I mean, you could under the 10th.
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:53.000]  We're just saying have the states say no to tyranny, but he's saying secession, fight
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:57.120]  the new world order, fight the Bilderberg group, fight the trans Texas corridor, which
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:27:59.880]  he's the author of.
[3:27:59.880 --> 3:28:05.320]  So simultaneously he got the Republican nomination yesterday by posing as a patriot when he's
[3:28:05.320 --> 3:28:06.920]  a consummate insider.
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:11.880]  Separately, I heard K belly Hutchinson's capitulations a speech last night.
[3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:15.640]  She thanked George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush.
[3:28:15.640 --> 3:28:19.520]  She thanked Henry Kissinger for all endorsing her.
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:22.520]  That does say something for Perry actually, but he's bad news.
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:28.280]  The point is he ran with an anti Washington bent knowing it was the only way he could
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:29.280]  win.
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:31.400]  Okay.
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:38.960]  And so Republicans are kind of this double game, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, uh, Governor
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:44.960]  Perry and you watch Perry and Palin are both running for president guaranteed in 2012.
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:48.720]  They'll announce it in the next year and a half to two years.
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:52.080]  They're being positioned right now out of one side of their mouth.
[3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:56.360]  They say they leave the tea party so they can demonize the birthers and other people.
[3:28:56.360 --> 3:28:59.760]  They don't like when that's the majority of the Republican party's been polled.
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:01.600]  They're saying the majority of their party's bad.
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:07.440]  They're there as the gatekeepers and evidenced, uh, the evidence of this is here.
[3:29:07.440 --> 3:29:12.880]  Here's a headline, London Guardian, Republican right wing activists help secure Texas for
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:19.040]  Rick Perry moderate Republicans face being displaced by candidates backed by tea party
[3:29:19.040 --> 3:29:23.360]  and other grass roots, right wingers.
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:28.560]  What we really are as constitutional is so the establishment, the New York times, London
[3:29:28.560 --> 3:29:33.840]  Guardian everywhere is freaking out saying, Oh my gosh, these right wingers, that's a
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:38.080]  label to make it left, right and divide and conquer people know we're patriots who were
[3:29:38.080 --> 3:29:43.600]  against the foreign corporate takeover known as the new world order against our country.
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:48.080]  Here's a Politico article, give me a document cam for prison planet dot TV viewers, conservatives
[3:29:48.080 --> 3:29:50.640]  target their own fringe.
[3:29:50.640 --> 3:29:57.880]  And this goes on to demonize mainline people like Tom Tancredo, former Republican congressman
[3:29:57.880 --> 3:30:03.120]  and they're demonizing Ron Paul in these reports.
[3:30:03.120 --> 3:30:04.120]  But here's the deal.
[3:30:04.120 --> 3:30:12.160]  Ron Paul got a record for Texas Republicans, 80% of the vote in the primary with three
[3:30:12.160 --> 3:30:18.520]  Republican party funded neocons posing as tea partiers, showing the public can differentiate
[3:30:18.520 --> 3:30:22.360]  a real constitutionalist versus a phony one.
[3:30:22.360 --> 3:30:29.400]  Okay, when we get back, I want to go over the setup here.
[3:30:29.400 --> 3:30:36.040]  See the Republicans know that their grass roots is constitutionalist and wants to really
[3:30:36.040 --> 3:30:38.240]  take the party over and fix America.
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:43.640]  There they're acting enough like us to keep control so they can also demonize through
[3:30:43.640 --> 3:30:44.640]  constitutionalists.
[3:30:44.640 --> 3:30:48.640]  Now, they want to set us up and that'll be with the stage terror attack blamed on the
[3:30:48.640 --> 3:30:51.320]  tea parties.
[3:30:51.320 --> 3:30:55.080]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:30:55.080 --> 3:31:00.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:31:00.760 --> 3:31:06.000]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[3:31:06.000 --> 3:31:08.800]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[3:31:08.800 --> 3:31:14.120]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[3:32:00.600 --> 3:32:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:32:05.240 --> 3:32:09.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:32:09.600 --> 3:32:13.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:32:13.920 --> 3:32:15.200]  allows you to have.
[3:32:15.200 --> 3:32:16.200]  It's true.
[3:32:16.200 --> 3:32:20.920]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:25.240]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:32:25.240 --> 3:32:29.240]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:32:29.240 --> 3:32:32.760]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:32:32.760 --> 3:32:36.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[3:32:36.440 --> 3:32:41.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:32:41.240 --> 3:32:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science.
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:46.360]  One of my oldest sponsors.

[3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:11.200]  So they've had Republican Party spokesman Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, everybody else demonize
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:15.880]  the Berthers because they're really worried about more than half Republicans in polls
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:21.200]  questioning his birth certificate.
[3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:27.800]  At the same time, they're not having success demonizing the American people and folks that
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:29.680]  are identifying the new world order.
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:33.960]  They're openly announcing world government, but then calling it a conspiracy theory if
[3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:39.920]  we don't like it and don't want an unelected tyrannical world government ruling our lives.
[3:34:39.920 --> 3:34:45.760]  And so if you go back to Oklahoma City and other events, the government clearly orchestrated
[3:34:45.760 --> 3:34:47.280]  and provocateur that event.
[3:34:47.280 --> 3:34:58.360]  Paul Watson has an article that breaks all of this down, that is up on prisonplanet.com.
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:04.640]  It's titled Southern Poverty Law Center Report, Heavy on Smear, Thin on Facts.
[3:35:04.640 --> 3:35:08.000]  And it goes into the government documents and mainstream news articles about the FBI
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:12.520]  being in Oklahoma City, a sworn federal affidavits that they were running, McVeigh, that he was
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:14.280]  a federal officer.
[3:35:14.280 --> 3:35:15.280]  It's all in here.
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:20.880]  So I can tell you politically that I am seeing the media put out the talking point through
[3:35:20.880 --> 3:35:27.320]  right wing and left wing establishment news channels, predominantly cable news.
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:32.120]  And we have Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are saying we can provocateur
[3:35:32.120 --> 3:35:37.840]  events, criminal events and blame it on our political opposition.
[3:35:37.840 --> 3:35:42.080]  And there's no way they're going to be able to make everybody feel sorry for the government
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:46.840]  and have the pretext for the police state and to openly roll out Homeland Security
[3:35:46.840 --> 3:35:50.560]  against conservatives and libertarians and gun owners that their internal reports say
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:51.920]  they're really set up for.
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:54.120]  That's their main mission.
[3:35:54.120 --> 3:36:00.320]  There's no way they're going to get away with this without staging events in this country
[3:36:00.320 --> 3:36:06.080]  against IRS buildings, against government buildings, against capitals, state capitals,
[3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:09.720]  federal capitals in D.C. against the military.
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:13.560]  So the government can feel sorry for itself and believe there's a real threat out there
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:16.440]  and then demonize the Patriot movement.
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:20.040]  Because the Patriot movement that's been around for decades has been right about the
[3:36:20.040 --> 3:36:24.920]  world government, did their research, understand the threat we're facing.
[3:36:24.920 --> 3:36:31.880]  And folks, there's all these neocon publications that are attacking me.
[3:36:31.880 --> 3:36:35.880]  I mean, the big GOP news site did it.
[3:36:35.880 --> 3:36:40.920]  Cliff Kincaid, who by the way, I want to get on and debate this guy, demonizing oath keepers
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:42.760]  as extremists when they're milk toast.
[3:36:42.760 --> 3:36:48.560]  I mean, they just call for following their oath.
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:51.280]  It's incredible and you see top Republican strategist.
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:55.280]  In fact, here's the political headline, conservatives target their own fringe.
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:37:00.600]  So you've got Glenn Beck and Chris Matthews on some shows we've played clips of here mirroring
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:06.800]  the exact talking points because the Republicans and Democrats work for the same big establishment.
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:10.480]  And it's their job to create the illusion of choice and to manage the public.
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:16.120]  Now, I want to play a few minutes of this MSNBC report with POTOC of the Southern Slime
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:22.320]  Center demonizing people and in the report, again, mainline Republican congressmen are
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:26.200]  demonized mainline Americans just mainline.
[3:37:26.200 --> 3:37:28.600]  You criticize anything the government's doing.
[3:37:28.600 --> 3:37:31.040]  You may be a dangerous terrorist.
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:32.840]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[3:37:32.840 --> 3:37:37.440]  It says right wing extremist groups have gained even more support in the USA over the last
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:42.560]  year, fueled in part by anger over the troubled economy, the nation's first black president
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:44.000]  and immigration issues.
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:49.400]  The reason concerns over a potential rise in anti-government violence like that deadly
[3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:55.240]  attack on an IRS building in Texas last week, I'm joined by Mark POTOC of the Southern Poverty
[3:37:55.240 --> 3:37:59.400]  Law Center, the author of the annual report, Rage on the Right.
[3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:05.200]  What stands out to you this year in terms of these groups who are truly angry at the
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:09.240]  way they see the government acting?
[3:38:09.240 --> 3:38:12.280]  Really what stands out the most is just the scope of the thing.
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:17.240]  I mean, there has been an enormous growth in groups on the radical right of all kinds
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:18.920]  in the last year.
[3:38:18.920 --> 3:38:22.600]  You know, when we look at the whole picture, though, the most astounding growth has come
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:28.800]  in the so-called patriot groups, the militias that all of us remember from the 1990s.
[3:38:28.800 --> 3:38:34.160]  These groups had very largely, if not disappeared, at least gone quiescent, but what was found
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:37.760]  was 363 new groups in the last year.
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:41.720]  That's a 244% increase in a single year.
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:46.240]  And at the same time, we saw a lot of growth in other types.
[3:38:46.240 --> 3:38:47.240]  Americans are getting upset.
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:48.240]  How dare them?
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:49.240]  What are you talking about?
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:50.240]  Patriot groups.
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:51.240]  I mean, are these just...
[3:38:51.240 --> 3:38:52.240]  As they show, a smoking IRS building.
[3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:55.960]  What is it about them that concerns you in terms of the threat they represent?
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:38:59.120]  Because he's high up on the mountain and he tells us what to do.
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:05.000]  Well, the self-named patriot movement is really the movement of which the paramilitary wing
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:06.720]  was the militias.
[3:39:06.720 --> 3:39:13.040]  So basically, the patriot movement is a movement that sees the federal government as its primary
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:14.040]  enemy.
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:17.680]  By the way, our whole country is going bankrupt, there's 30 million illegal aliens.
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:21.880]  He says you're able if you don't want open borders, but Mexico will arrest you for no
[3:39:21.880 --> 3:39:22.880]  reason.
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:24.720]  It may sound like a benign set of beliefs.
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:29.560]  The reality is that the patriot movement back in the 1990s produced an enormous amount of
[3:39:29.560 --> 3:39:32.160]  criminal violence, all kinds of plots and so on.
[3:39:32.160 --> 3:39:33.160]  Oh, really?
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:39.080]  Yeah, based on these conspiracy theories about what the government was up to, Joseph Stack,
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:44.440]  the man who flew the plane into the IRS building in Austin, is an example of those kinds of
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:45.440]  beliefs.
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:50.440]  Many so-called patriots believe that the federal income tax is completely unconstitutional
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:52.240]  and illegal.
[3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:53.760]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:55.640]  We built our whole country without it.
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:39:59.160]  Most Americans didn't pay it until the 1950s.
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:04.960]  It goes to offshore banks on interest on imaginary debt, for our country to create money, debt
[3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:08.080]  is created to private banks.
[3:40:08.080 --> 3:40:09.080]  And that's all this guy is.
[3:40:09.080 --> 3:40:10.880]  Oh, you don't want foreign banks ruling you?
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:12.400]  You're an extremist.
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:13.400]  Continue.
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:16.960]  Investigators produced a lot of havoc.
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:22.360]  You know, the investigators in that case mark characterized that as criminal activity.
[3:40:22.360 --> 3:40:28.040]  But what we saw in the 1990s with Timothy McVeigh and what happened in Oklahoma City at the
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:33.360]  time, or a federal building, was very similar, a vehicle being used to attack a government
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:36.960]  building because of anti-government extremism.
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:39.680]  Are you concerned about domestic terrorism?
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:44.260]  And are you concerned at the reluctance on the part of investigators to label these kinds
[3:40:44.260 --> 3:40:46.840]  of incidents terrorism?
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:52.000]  Well, look, in the Joseph Stack case, one could argue about it because there's certainly
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:54.440]  evidence in both directions.
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:59.080]  Joseph Stack was a man, according to his kind of suicide note, who was angry at a lot of
[3:40:59.080 --> 3:41:03.480]  things, the Catholic Church, unions, corporations, and so on.
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:09.520]  But he kept circling back to the idea of it was the IRS and the government was the enemy.
[3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:10.520]  So am I concerned?
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:11.600]  Yes, I am concerned.
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:16.880]  We've seen a great deal of at least attempted domestic terrorism, I think an obvious rise
[3:41:16.880 --> 3:41:18.680]  over the last 12 to 18 months.
[3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:25.120]  A lot of that has been connected to essentially the rise to the White House of a black man.
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:30.400]  Many people who are angry about that, and also angry about the demographic change that
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:33.520]  definitely is occurring in this country.
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:34.520]  Yeah, immigration.
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:35.520]  So yes, I worry about that.
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:37.360]  Okay, so there you go.
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:41.640]  You don't like paying for 30 million illegal aliens, basically all on welfare, all the
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:44.580]  study shows, sucking more money than they put in.
[3:41:44.580 --> 3:41:48.080]  You don't like the police state, you don't like banks stealing trillions, you don't
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:49.240]  like losing your job.
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:50.680]  It's all because Obama's black.
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:51.680]  You're a racist.
[3:41:51.680 --> 3:41:56.120]  Meanwhile, the left never tells you that they fund the abortions of more than half of the
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:00.100]  black people, less than half the blacks that are conceived or born.
[3:42:00.100 --> 3:42:02.960]  But let's not talk about 16 million black people killed.
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:05.440]  Let's just say, oh, you don't like the banks raping you.
[3:42:05.440 --> 3:42:06.660]  You don't like black people.
[3:42:06.660 --> 3:42:08.200]  This is a poverty pimp.
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:09.560]  This is a race baiter.
[3:42:09.560 --> 3:42:11.220]  This is what they do.
[3:42:11.220 --> 3:42:12.360]  This is how they operate.
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:16.120]  These people are sickening.
[3:42:16.120 --> 3:42:19.840]  And they're going to stage events, the establishment is going to stage events so they can play
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:21.960]  the part of the good guys and demonize everybody.
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:25.520]  So that's why we need to be nonviolent, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:29.120]  But if the CPS is dragging your kids away for no reason or their rape rooms, you defend
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:31.160]  yourself, it's called terrorism.
[3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:35.320]  You tell a census worker, you're not going to answer all their questions about it.
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:37.360]  Your fifth amendment, you're a terrorist.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:40.660]  You don't like the fellow reserve raping you, you're a terrorist.
[3:42:40.660 --> 3:42:43.600]  You don't like being a slave, you're a terrorist.
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:46.800]  You don't like the government ignoring the constitution and warrantless wiretaps in the
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:47.880]  Patriot Act.
[3:42:47.880 --> 3:42:49.680]  You're an able terrorist.
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:52.240]  You don't like the IRS taking your property without due process.
[3:42:52.240 --> 3:42:53.320]  You're a terrorist.
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:55.040]  You don't submit everything they're saying and doing.
[3:42:55.040 --> 3:42:56.040]  You're a terrorist.
[3:42:56.040 --> 3:42:59.200]  And, you know, this ties together.
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:06.480]  I've seen a few mainstream news articles misquoting me saying, Jones says the Haiti earthquake
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:08.520]  was a government weather weapon.
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:11.640]  I mean, that's the type of stuff they're throwing at me.
[3:43:11.640 --> 3:43:15.720]  So I thought that I would talk a little bit about this today.
[3:43:15.720 --> 3:43:21.600]  In fact, I'm going to play one of the caller questions that we had come in.
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:24.080]  The first one was from Cheryl.
[3:43:24.080 --> 3:43:30.280]  The caller asked if Alex believes the sudden onset of earthquakes may be related to heart.
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:33.960]  Now it was Hugo Chavez reportedly said he thought that could be a weather weapon.
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:38.080]  And the reason I talk about this sometimes is Secretary of Defense Cohen told Army Times
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:40.160]  in 97 they have these weapons.
[3:43:40.160 --> 3:43:41.520]  I don't know.
[3:43:41.520 --> 3:43:45.280]  Other people have been pointing out that you keep seeing lights in the skies over places
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:48.320]  that are hit, but you've got giant tectonic plates.
[3:43:48.320 --> 3:43:51.600]  When you walk across the floor and there's static electricity, you can shock yourself.
[3:43:51.600 --> 3:43:54.320]  Well, imagine giant plates are moving.
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:43:59.320]  The Aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere is caused by the magnetic field from the mass
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:00.400]  of the earth.
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:03.480]  So of course you're going to see an aurora and this has been reported for more than
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:04.480]  a hundred years.
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:10.960]  So just because they're seeing lights in the sky over Haiti or over Chile doesn't mean
[3:44:10.960 --> 3:44:11.960]  that these are weather weapons.
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:13.520]  And there, I've said it again.
[3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:16.000]  The news will say that I'm saying it was a weather weapon.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.400]  But let's go ahead and play this lady's question.
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:19.400]  Here it is.
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:26.720]  Hi, my name is Cheryl, and after this flurry of earthquakes, I became very concerned because
[3:44:26.720 --> 3:44:33.920]  I find it very unusual, the size and the frequency, and so I looked it up on the Internet about
[3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:48.520]  any possible cause man-made, and I came across the HARPS project and read about some of the
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:50.360]  Jesse Ventura comments on it.
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:56.080]  Anywhere I wanted to find out if you believe in HARPS is contributing to the recent earthquakes.
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:44:57.080]  Thank you.
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:44:58.080]  Okay.
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:01.000]  We know that the government says they have this power.
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:02.760]  That's on record over and over again.
[3:45:02.760 --> 3:45:06.120]  We know they now admit they're chemtrailing, geoengineering the planet.
[3:45:06.120 --> 3:45:09.760]  Just go to YouTube, type in geoengineering, John P. Holdren.
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:12.000]  You'll see White House press conferences.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:15.200]  But no, we don't know if this is man-made or not.
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:17.440]  It's probably natural.
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:21.120]  The bigger issue is, notice the government can't and won't protect you, whether it's
[3:45:21.120 --> 3:45:23.120]  Katrina or any of these events.
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:25.480]  You've got to be ready to take care of yourself.
[3:45:25.480 --> 3:45:30.280]  But I do want to play this MSNBC clip where one of the witnesses did see these bizarre
[3:45:30.280 --> 3:45:37.080]  lights in the sky, and a lot of people reported this before the Chilean Mega 8.0-plus earthquake.
[3:45:37.080 --> 3:45:38.080]  Here it is.
[3:45:38.080 --> 3:45:43.280]  Joining us now live from Santiago, Chile via Skype is freelance journalist Cecilia Lago.
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:44.840]  Cecilia, good morning to you.
[3:45:44.840 --> 3:45:46.440]  Let's get the very latest from your vantage point.
[3:45:46.440 --> 3:45:49.160]  What are you seeing and what did you feel earlier today?
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:45:51.960]  Well, good afternoon here.
[3:45:51.960 --> 3:46:00.200]  It's 1.10 p.m. here in Chile, and this whole thing happened at our time was 3.30 a.m.
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:06.640]  In the morning, I was sleeping as most of us, of course, here in the country.
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:09.240]  And all of a sudden, I started feeling this tremor.
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:15.440]  And since we are really used to tremors, because this is a land of earthquakes, just as the
[3:46:15.440 --> 3:46:20.840]  Central America is a land of hurricanes and tornadoes and sample, this is a land of earthquakes
[3:46:20.840 --> 3:46:21.840]  and tremors.
[3:46:21.840 --> 3:46:26.440]  So I just said to myself, okay, I'm not going to do anything until it gets really serious.
[3:46:26.440 --> 3:46:30.400]  And well, it did get serious, but I still was laying in bed.
[3:46:30.400 --> 3:46:34.360]  I was just so shocked because I was totally paralyzed.
[3:46:34.360 --> 3:46:40.120]  I didn't really know what to do because I was expecting all of a sudden, you know, you're
[3:46:40.120 --> 3:46:46.320]  seeing my neighbor maybe getting through from the roof to my floor or whatever.
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:47.920]  It was so, so intense.
[3:46:47.920 --> 3:46:55.440]  And I was seeing the sky changing colors and it was really sort of an apocalypse now thing.
[3:46:55.440 --> 3:47:01.280]  So Cecilia, that sounds pretty frightening, but was it a sharp jolt or did it just sort
[3:47:01.280 --> 3:47:02.280]  of build?
[3:47:02.280 --> 3:47:04.280]  And how long did this last?
[3:47:04.280 --> 3:47:11.960]  Well, I've been discussing the duration, the lasting of the earthquake because for me,
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:19.600]  it was sort of for short, maybe no more than 40 seconds or so, especially the intense,
[3:47:19.600 --> 3:47:26.880]  the more intense part, probably half a minute, as I said, no more than 40 seconds.
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:29.640]  But the whole thing, which is starts really.
[3:47:29.640 --> 3:47:33.520]  You can watch the whole clip where she talks about lights in the sky.
[3:47:33.520 --> 3:47:37.280]  The point is we don't know if that's the case.
[3:47:37.280 --> 3:47:41.160]  Let's go ahead and play another clip from a caller from Quebec, Canada.
[3:47:41.160 --> 3:47:47.320]  Caller ask if the Copenhagen tax is passing in a form of gas tax in Quebec.
[3:47:47.320 --> 3:47:48.520]  Let's go ahead and play that question.
[3:47:48.520 --> 3:47:49.520]  Here it is.
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:50.520]  Greetings Mr. Jones.
[3:47:50.520 --> 3:47:55.200]  I just want to inform you on the globalist agenda here in Quebec.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  Quebec just passed.
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:58.120]  Quebec is a Eastern part of Canada.
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:02.840]  They just passed regulation, even though the rest of Canada and Quebec on a local level
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:07.200]  passed regulation that's going to increase gas prices by 12 cents.
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:09.000]  That's the Copenhagen tax.
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:11.720]  So thank you for your time.
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:12.720]  Absolutely.
[3:48:12.720 --> 3:48:16.840]  Hundreds of taxes, cities, county, states here are doing it outside the law.
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:20.720]  Obama's using the EPA without any law to just do it.
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:24.240]  Incidentally, I'm going to have Bermansen for about 20 minutes on the cybersecurity bill
[3:48:24.240 --> 3:48:25.240]  tomorrow.
[3:48:25.240 --> 3:48:28.080]  I want to be able to go to some actual phone callers here in a minute.
[3:48:28.080 --> 3:48:36.400]  But we do from time to time play calls from the comment line, which is 512-646-4444.
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:40.760]  Now let's go ahead and play one final comment or question from Robert.
[3:48:40.760 --> 3:48:43.600]  He asked if governments can call the National Guard troops home.
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:44.600]  Here it is.
[3:48:44.600 --> 3:48:47.480]  Thanks, Jones, this is Robert from Utah.
[3:48:47.480 --> 3:48:53.880]  I have one major request, hopefully it can be done by somebody that might listen.
[3:48:53.880 --> 3:48:56.320]  Can the governors call our troops home?
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:48:58.320]  Can the governor call our National Guard troops home?
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:01.960]  I mean, I believe we're on the verge of a civil war.
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:06.360]  Can we get our Utah troops home?
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:11.320]  Now to answer that question, yes, until they put in the John Warner Defense Authorization
[3:49:11.320 --> 3:49:18.200]  Act in 2007 that they've reauthorized since then saying that the president and the Congress
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:23.080]  can remove governors and appoint governors and controls the National Guard.
[3:49:23.080 --> 3:49:26.460]  This is the total illegal federalization of everything.
[3:49:26.460 --> 3:49:28.440]  Now let's go to live phone calls.
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:30.640]  Let's talk to Ray in Texas.
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:31.880]  Ray, you're on the air.
[3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:32.880]  Thanks for holding.
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:34.920]  Thank you very much, sir.
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:41.000]  I voted for Deborah Medina yesterday and liked it like a lot of the other employers out there.
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:43.440]  I was pretty discouraged.
[3:49:43.440 --> 3:49:47.040]  We understand the hit piece that was played on there by Glenn Beck.
[3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:52.840]  But that being said, I want to know, can we be sure that Glenn Beck is an actual, I guess,
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:57.480]  a conscious tool for the globalist, or is it possible that he sincerely believes the
[3:49:57.480 --> 3:50:00.360]  things he's saying, however disillusioned it may be?
[3:50:00.360 --> 3:50:03.840]  Well, your phone is really bad, Ray.
[3:50:03.840 --> 3:50:07.080]  Specifically, what are you saying?
[3:50:07.080 --> 3:50:13.600]  I want to know if Glenn Beck is actually a tool for the globalist or if not, I appreciate
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:14.600]  your call.
[3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:18.280]  It's nice to get a prank call.
[3:50:18.280 --> 3:50:28.120]  Whatever that does, sir, look, Glenn Beck is positioning himself, just like Rick Perry
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:33.680]  or Sarah Palin, to act like they're the opposition to the New World Order when in all their real
[3:50:33.680 --> 3:50:35.520]  actions they support it.
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:38.920]  The New Taxes, Glenn Beck says he supports the bailout.
[3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:42.560]  He says he's worried about Ron Paul supporters demonizing us.
[3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:45.720]  They're following the same script, just with different tweaks.
[3:50:45.720 --> 3:50:47.400]  Kevin in Nebraska, you're on the air.
[3:50:47.400 --> 3:50:48.400]  Go ahead.
[3:50:48.400 --> 3:50:49.400]  Hi, Alex.
[3:50:49.400 --> 3:50:56.280]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that we need to really, like you've said, be pretty wary
[3:50:56.280 --> 3:51:02.560]  when they start to really push the Iran thing and start to really, you know, make a lot
[3:51:02.560 --> 3:51:07.080]  of mentions of Iran and stirring up that whole pot.
[3:51:07.080 --> 3:51:12.280]  Yeah, seven years ago, we heard all about the WMDs, and here we are again hearing about
[3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:13.280]  WMDs.
[3:51:13.280 --> 3:51:14.280]  Right.
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:17.360]  Yeah, and somehow people just don't get it.
[3:51:17.360 --> 3:51:22.360]  Oh, that thing again, well, maybe this time it's true.
[3:51:22.360 --> 3:51:29.400]  But yeah, I think they'll probably, you know, my guess is they're going to try to push some
[3:51:29.400 --> 3:51:35.200]  sort of staged event that ultimately they're going to be able to try and blame on Iran
[3:51:35.200 --> 3:51:42.400]  and somehow tie in with the mythical domestic terrorists so that they can get more enforcement
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:48.160]  here at home on top of whatever they would normally do and then push their illegal war
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:49.160]  with Iran.
[3:51:49.160 --> 3:51:50.160]  I agree.
[3:51:50.160 --> 3:51:54.040]  The U.S. is a captured vessel used for tyranny worldwide.
[3:51:54.040 --> 3:51:55.400]  We've got to take our country back.
[3:51:55.400 --> 3:51:56.400]  Thank you, Kevin.
[3:51:56.400 --> 3:51:57.400]  Very well said.
[3:51:57.400 --> 3:52:01.640]  WMDs, spirit of 1776, stay with us, final segment.
[3:52:01.640 --> 3:52:07.520]  Attention, an important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life

[3:53:06.440 --> 3:53:09.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:53:09.600 --> 3:53:13.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:14.960]  at home.
[3:53:14.960 --> 3:53:20.120]  We have a tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[3:53:20.120 --> 3:53:21.120]  shots.
[3:53:21.120 --> 3:53:26.120]  It makes it incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:53:26.120 --> 3:53:29.240]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:53:29.240 --> 3:53:35.080]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[3:53:35.080 --> 3:53:36.080]  world government.
[3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:38.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:53:38.520 --> 3:53:42.640]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:53:42.640 --> 3:53:48.520]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[3:53:48.520 --> 3:53:49.840]  of the Republic.

[3:54:30.440 --> 3:54:34.640]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[3:54:34.640 --> 3:54:38.880]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[3:54:38.880 --> 3:54:39.880]  to serve as debt.
[3:54:39.880 --> 3:54:43.400]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[3:54:43.400 --> 3:54:46.680]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:54:46.680 --> 3:54:51.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary system.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:54.240]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.

[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:08.200]  Look at who the Southern Poverty Law Center demonizes as if they're terrorists as they
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:09.960]  may go after people.
[3:55:09.960 --> 3:55:13.080]  The Constitution Party, they list each state.
[3:55:13.080 --> 3:55:15.760]  The John Birch Society, Oathkeepers.
[3:55:15.760 --> 3:55:18.000]  We the people.
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  I mean, most of these are just completely, I mean, I wish they were more radical.
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:26.800]  I mean, all they're doing is exposing the private IRS, the private fellow reserve.
[3:55:26.800 --> 3:55:32.120]  They list we are change, which is an anti-globalist group, completely peaceful alternative media.
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:36.880]  I mean, look, they want you to sit down and shut up or they're going to call you names.
[3:55:36.880 --> 3:55:40.720]  But the good news is nobody listens to POTOC and all these people anymore.
[3:55:40.720 --> 3:55:41.720]  They're discredited.
[3:55:41.720 --> 3:55:44.400]  The American people are learning who their real enemies are.
[3:55:44.400 --> 3:55:47.560]  So go ahead and stage terror attacks, feds on yourselves.
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:51.520]  And of course, you'll always get the warning to be out of the building and other feds will
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:55.000]  notice that or the husbands and wives of people you kill.
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:58.760]  We wish you wouldn't do it, but we just know how you are and what you're going to do.
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:01.320]  And the words out on you scum.
[3:56:01.320 --> 3:56:03.840]  All right, let's go to Nick and Mass.
[3:56:03.840 --> 3:56:04.840]  Nick, you're on the air.
[3:56:04.840 --> 3:56:05.840]  Welcome.
[3:56:05.840 --> 3:56:06.840]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[3:56:06.840 --> 3:56:09.840]  I just want to cover two things quickly.
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:15.120]  One about the terrorist event that you're speaking of and also about the earthquakes.
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:17.200]  This is Nick from lookupandwakeup.org.
[3:56:17.200 --> 3:56:21.000]  It's about the terrorist attack.
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:24.680]  I know they like the numerology, like the Illuminati and the elites.
[3:56:24.680 --> 3:56:27.400]  I just want to give you a date.
[3:56:27.400 --> 3:56:29.400]  3-8-2010.
[3:56:29.400 --> 3:56:30.400]  3-8 is 11.
[3:56:30.400 --> 3:56:32.920]  3-8-2010 is 23.
[3:56:32.920 --> 3:56:40.160]  And about the earthquakes, I've been looking at the earthquake.usgs.gov government site
[3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:45.800]  and reading about earthquakes, Japan, Chile, Philippines, yada, yada.
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:50.280]  But I've been seeing a lot of recent activity in California and the Haiti earthquakes, the
[3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:55.640]  epicenter, the death of the epicenter was about 10 kilometers a list and the one in
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:56:58.560]  Chile was 30 kilometers deep.
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:00.800]  Now obviously there were 8.8 and 7.
[3:57:00.800 --> 3:57:02.040]  Whatever it was.
[3:57:02.040 --> 3:57:09.200]  But the California epicenter is the death of their earthquakes are 1.9 kilometers deep,
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:15.360]  2.5, 2.2, 2.5, even though their earthquakes are pretty small.
[3:57:15.360 --> 3:57:21.320]  If there is a chance of a large earthquake in California, the epicenter doesn't look
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:22.320]  like it's going to be too deep.
[3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:23.320]  So I think that's pretty good.
[3:57:23.320 --> 3:57:24.320]  All right.
[3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:25.320]  I've got to tell you about it.
[3:57:25.320 --> 3:57:26.320]  I've got to get to other callers, but I appreciate your call.
[3:57:26.320 --> 3:57:28.800]  Look, the earth has natural earthquakes, is all I'm saying.
[3:57:28.800 --> 3:57:30.600]  Everything doesn't have to be a conspiracy.
[3:57:30.600 --> 3:57:32.880]  But it is true the government admits they have these weapons.
[3:57:32.880 --> 3:57:33.880]  So it could be.
[3:57:33.880 --> 3:57:34.880]  I don't know.
[3:57:34.880 --> 3:57:35.880]  We're watching it.
[3:57:35.880 --> 3:57:36.880]  Thank you, Nick.
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:37.880]  Tim in California.
[3:57:37.880 --> 3:57:38.880]  Go ahead.
[3:57:38.880 --> 3:57:39.880]  You're on the air.
[3:57:39.880 --> 3:57:40.880]  Hey, Alex.
[3:57:40.880 --> 3:57:41.880]  How are you doing today?
[3:57:41.880 --> 3:57:42.880]  Good.
[3:57:42.880 --> 3:57:43.880]  Good.
[3:57:43.880 --> 3:57:47.000]  Well, my question is, I've been listening to your show a lot lately and I noticed
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:50.640]  the key point you and along with Bob and Webster and a couple other guys make on the
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:55.880]  air is going through this revolution against these criminals.
[3:57:55.880 --> 3:57:57.760]  We need to go about this in a peaceful manner.
[3:57:57.760 --> 3:58:04.400]  My question is, how far are we going to let these guys go and get away with stuff before
[3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:07.640]  the violence really needs to start taking effect?
[3:58:07.640 --> 3:58:09.720]  I mean, it's just a matter of time.
[3:58:09.720 --> 3:58:10.920]  Well, here's the deal.
[3:58:10.920 --> 3:58:12.720]  We're defeating their Copenhagen Treaty.
[3:58:12.720 --> 3:58:15.000]  We're defeating their swine flu fraud.
[3:58:15.000 --> 3:58:17.720]  We're defeating all their hoaxes, their health care.
[3:58:17.720 --> 3:58:22.400]  So if we're holding them back peacefully and starting to have traction and they're going,
[3:58:22.400 --> 3:58:23.400]  oh, they're going to be violent.
[3:58:23.400 --> 3:58:24.400]  Oh, they're going to be violent.
[3:58:24.400 --> 3:58:26.960]  We know the feds always stage attacks against themselves.
[3:58:26.960 --> 3:58:28.840]  They've been caught over and over again.
[3:58:28.840 --> 3:58:31.240]  It isn't smart strategically to start violence.
[3:58:31.240 --> 3:58:34.160]  And plus, I mean, who do you target?
[3:58:34.160 --> 3:58:36.640]  Most of the people in government are idiots like the general public.
[3:58:36.640 --> 3:58:42.320]  We have to reach out and wake people up peacefully, but also defend ourselves from tyranny and
[3:58:42.320 --> 3:58:45.080]  expose tyranny so people know how to recognize it.
[3:58:45.080 --> 3:58:46.800]  I appreciate your call.
[3:58:46.800 --> 3:58:51.120]  We should have a whole show sometime debating this and opening the phones up about it.
[3:58:51.120 --> 3:58:52.640]  Spirit of 1776.
[3:58:52.640 --> 3:58:53.640]  Last caller we have time for.
[3:58:53.640 --> 3:58:54.640]  Go ahead.
[3:58:54.640 --> 3:58:55.640]  Hey, Alex.
[3:58:55.640 --> 3:59:01.360]  I'm Spirit of 1776 and thank you so much for inspiring us and our movement along Island.
[3:59:01.360 --> 3:59:07.640]  I just want to say that it's doing radical peace that you have on prismplanet.com, exposing
[3:59:07.640 --> 3:59:10.720]  another shill who's demonizing the Tea Party movement.
[3:59:10.720 --> 3:59:15.240]  I just want to thank you for all your efforts and may the spirit of liberty and freedom
[3:59:15.240 --> 3:59:16.240]  live on forever.
[3:59:16.240 --> 3:59:17.240]  All right.
[3:59:17.240 --> 3:59:18.240]  God bless you, my friend.
[3:59:18.240 --> 3:59:21.800]  We'll be back tomorrow live 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.

[3:59:32.680 --> 3:59:33.680]  for one hour.
