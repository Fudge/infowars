[00:00.000 --> 00:13.360]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the
[00:13.360 --> 00:24.000]  resistance rallying patriots worldwide you're listening to the alex jones
[00:24.000 --> 00:33.680]  show
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.840]  i think senator mike rogers said it best when the clip's coming up
[00:37.840 --> 00:43.040]  latimer putin or pooty poot as george w bush used to call him is playing chess
[00:43.840 --> 00:51.440]  and the people running the united states are playing marbles schoolyard gangster chicago thug
[00:51.440 --> 00:57.440]  types i'm not romanticizing as i say latimer putin the point is is that we've had a lot of
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.800]  guests on who don't think this is a very big crisis in the ukraine bordering russia i do
[01:02.800 --> 01:07.760]  think it's a big crisis but there's a lot of weird stuff going on in the background we reported
[01:07.760 --> 01:12.480]  four days ago russian troops were coming into Crimea people said oh that's fair mongering
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.000]  it's in reuters it's in ap russia confirms military action has been authorized they've
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.160]  marched in the orthodox priest they're ready for war now they're just trying to have a buffer zone
[01:24.160 --> 01:30.960]  in case the west takes 95 basically of ukraine they want that border zone like in georgia like
[01:30.960 --> 01:37.920]  south ossetia or abkhazia that's the interest and to keep some of those ports uh that are in that
[01:37.920 --> 01:45.280]  area and that is 75 russian in that area so that's what's going on but nato's threatening military
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.240]  action this is a big big deal we're gonna be breaking that down coming up obviously here's
[01:50.240 --> 01:57.440]  the headline of the reuters uh so you know the the fake media out there uh like raw story and people
[01:57.440 --> 02:02.640]  you know don't put out an article saying that we made this up ukraine mobilizes after putin's
[02:02.640 --> 02:07.680]  declaration of war by the way i don't attack sites like raw story that were much bigger than
[02:08.560 --> 02:14.880]  out of hand i just saw an article this morning saying internet only radio host and tucker carlson
[02:14.880 --> 02:21.440]  say democrats connected to cook lux clan and i mean it's well known on one over 160 stations
[02:22.480 --> 02:28.320]  in the top 25 talkers magazine trade publications three million listeners a day one of the biggest
[02:28.320 --> 02:37.680]  news sites out there 500 600 million views on youtube but i am proud though i am proud and
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.920]  that's what the white house media matter says basically internet only as well that we did
[02:43.920 --> 02:50.240]  dominate first internet and then i did come from nowhere on my own druthers with the help of our
[02:50.240 --> 02:57.200]  great listeners and supporters that were organic i mean i'm more proud i wasn't installed at fox
[02:57.200 --> 03:03.440]  news or cnn or msnbc i didn't come from the mainstream media into the alternative media
[03:03.440 --> 03:11.280]  to then dominate media i came from nowhere access television to dominate media but who else can you
[03:11.280 --> 03:17.600]  say that about uh there's only one name i could think of just one name matt drudge
[03:19.920 --> 03:21.200]  who else is there in news
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.640]  and and that paradigm shifting where the hot movies come from youtube now and people get big
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.000]  you know shows on netflix out of his directors and uh now the tables are turned where it really
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.240]  is more of a level playing field to a certain extent it's still stilted but more and more level
[03:38.240 --> 03:45.840]  and then they sit there from their dying dinosaur position and go internet only radio host oh my god
[03:46.480 --> 03:54.160]  he's not like pierce morgan with 380 000 viewers he has three million a day three million listeners
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.360]  and there's i don't know 600 000 podcasts and millions of youtube views and all the rest of
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.840]  everything i don't know how many view i mean conservative three million that's in
[04:03.840 --> 04:11.760]  arbatron stuff that's come out years ago off of you know just the stations that that by the ratings
[04:11.760 --> 04:17.680]  by that you have to subscribe to be able to have access to them and you've got a just off the stations
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.800]  we have that get arbatron it was like 400 and something thousand for 15 minutes last time we
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.720]  checked with an ad agency it's over three million over the show i mean you know and you people sit
[04:28.720 --> 04:35.600]  there saying we're not legitimate because we came from nowhere that makes me more legitimate dumb ass
[04:37.760 --> 04:43.280]  let me tell you if it didn't global freeze my ass off i don't know what it is and the answer is
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.800]  pay more taxes to al gore i know i mean people don't control reality global warming about humans is
[04:48.800 --> 04:56.080]  pure bs your bs and you're in freefall all of you and so thank god thanks for the lie actually
[04:56.080 --> 05:01.760]  saying i'm not associated with mainstream media the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other
[05:01.760 --> 05:07.280]  toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american
[05:07.280 --> 05:14.000]  people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.120]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the

[07:16.480 --> 07:20.480]  now
[07:23.120 --> 07:30.960]  ladies and gentlemen it is already sunday can you believe it the second day
[07:33.440 --> 07:40.560]  second day of march 2014 this year is just blasting past us so fast even more than last
[07:40.560 --> 07:49.120]  year like we're in a lamborghini going down the autobahn at 250 miles per hour and the world
[07:49.120 --> 07:57.760]  is racing towards a new cold war with russia like never before ladies and gentlemen here are the
[07:57.760 --> 08:08.240]  headlines right now from reuters ukraine mobilizes after putin's declaration of war that is the quote
[08:08.240 --> 08:15.680]  and that is what the ukrainian installed nato western backed eu technocrat bankster prime minister
[08:16.480 --> 08:22.320]  is saying the russians have sent tens of thousands of special forces troops tanks helicopters
[08:22.320 --> 08:29.680]  into Crimea that's 75 russia and a questionable ethnic zone it's questionable whether it's really
[08:29.680 --> 08:33.920]  part of ukraine that's how world war two started of course hitler going into danzig and other areas
[08:33.920 --> 08:38.480]  that were questionable whether they were german or part of neighboring countries the same thing into
[08:38.480 --> 08:45.600]  poland and so russia has sent troops in to protect their ports and facilities in that area i want
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.320]  to be clear i am not taking sides in this whole thing russia has a lot of corruption a lot of
[08:50.320 --> 08:55.680]  problems nato incredibly corrupt is a lot of problems the united states hijacked by foreign banks
[08:55.680 --> 09:01.520]  being looted and extracted as dylan radigan properly said before he left msnbc the issue is
[09:01.520 --> 09:09.280]  george soros hillary clinton the state department john carrey all the usual suspects in the last few
[09:09.280 --> 09:17.280]  years have pumped five billion dollars the u.s. ambassador to ukraine admits this last week there's
[09:17.280 --> 09:24.720]  video clips we've played them last week five billion dollars into ukraine for this destabilization
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.240]  and they're working with leftist groups they're working with immigrant groups they're working
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.600]  with white supremacist groups on record that are the main government now to install them
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.120]  in control and i'm not saying that people didn't have beefs with the russian influence government
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.680]  that was there i'm not saying they don't have beefs from pre-world war two when stalin killed
[09:43.680 --> 09:48.320]  close to 10 million ukrainian starving them to death there's a reason the ukrainians ran into
[09:48.320 --> 09:52.880]  the arms of hitler thinking he'd be a liberator and of course wasn't it's kind of like hitler's
[09:52.880 --> 10:01.680]  bad so stalin well the west is bad so is putin i mean this is the way history works but the west
[10:01.680 --> 10:13.280]  is lighting the fuse in this situation that is the issue that we're talking about here today so
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.920]  so for for tv viewers will have a document cam and go over some of these articles but for radio

[11:13.680 --> 11:22.160]  uh our compass is common sense god and history now let's get in to the situation uh on the
[11:22.160 --> 11:30.800]  border of russia in central eastern europe ukraine mobilizes after putin's declaration of war
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.640]  roiders ukraine mobilized for war on sunday and washington threatened to isolate russia economically
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.520]  with sanctions after president valimir putin declared he had the right to invade
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.720]  his neighbor in moscow's biggest confrontation with the west since the cold war this is not a
[11:46.720 --> 11:50.800]  threat this is actually the declaration of war to my country said ukraine's prime minister
[11:51.360 --> 11:58.720]  arzini yakonus cook if i pronounce that correctly head of the pro-western government also a super
[11:58.720 --> 12:06.560]  right-wing white supremacist uh that took power when russia's ally victor you shinkoff fled last
[12:06.560 --> 12:14.720]  week i'm butchering all these names yama kovic said in english putin secured permission from
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.680]  the parliament on saturday to use military force to protect russian citizens in ukraine
[12:19.680 --> 12:24.400]  and told us president barack obama he had the right to defend russian interests and national
[12:24.400 --> 12:32.240]  spurring western pleas not to intervene now what's wrong with this article so far it says russia has
[12:32.240 --> 12:41.200]  invaded basically all of ukraine russia invaded an area 75 percent controlled by russia in many
[12:41.200 --> 12:47.120]  cases going back and forth for 500 years known as the Crimea they've had the Crimean wars not war
[12:47.120 --> 12:53.360]  this is a heavily disputed area and it's 75 russia and that's where they've got their military bases
[12:53.360 --> 12:59.600]  and their ports already so it's kind of like the u.s still has guantanamo bay in cuba because they
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.400]  always had it even though the communists took over the marine stayed there and said you're not getting
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.080]  it that's what's going on here and i'm not defending the u.s keeping guantanamo bay it's
[13:10.080 --> 13:16.560]  gigantic by the way i'm not defending russia coming in and grabbing the Crimea but it's a very small
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.000]  area and it's russian basically and they've had wars for hundreds of years over let's just get
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.800]  that straight so they're not they're telling you they've invaded ukraine that's not the case
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.440]  but russia i guarantee you once and is inviting just like happened in georgia in 2008 in a south
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.160]  liceady in eucasia same kind of zones on the russian border with georgia the military eyes
[13:38.160 --> 13:44.800]  un zones with russian bases in them they're inviting the paramilitaries and the mobilizing
[13:44.800 --> 13:50.240]  ukrainian military that says they're mobilizing for quote war with russia and admitting they can't
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.840]  win begging for NATO to come in russia's waiting for them to attack and then russia will pour in
[13:55.840 --> 14:01.680]  and take half of ukraine which is already pro russia right up to the river and the border with
[14:01.680 --> 14:10.720]  capital Kiev and that's what's going to happen that that's where everything is pointing so there
[14:10.720 --> 14:17.120]  you go that's the facts and they say later in the article russian forces have already bloodlessly
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.840]  seized Crimea an isolated black sea peninsula where Moscow is an able base that's it that's
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.840]  where they are that's where they went so so they later admit that but but say they basically
[14:27.840 --> 14:35.200]  invaded all of uh of ukraine it's just not true okay there you go they took guantanamo
[14:35.200 --> 14:40.080]  babe basically like the marines did uh let's move to the next article prime minister russia
[14:40.080 --> 14:46.800]  has declared war on ukraine and that's an info wars dot com article we're on the brink of disaster

[20:28.080 --> 20:38.320]  waging war on corruption monday through friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central back sundays live
[20:38.320 --> 20:44.160]  four to six p.m. central weeknight seven o'clock info wars nightly news hosted by myself and the
[20:44.160 --> 20:50.880]  rest of the great info wars team we are not just the new media dominating the old dinosaur media
[20:50.880 --> 20:59.840]  we are the hardest working team in media because we're fueled by the love of liberty all right
[20:59.840 --> 21:04.480]  continuing here and then i'm gonna shift gears and all the other news this is a big deal what's
[21:04.480 --> 21:09.600]  happening the kickoff of a new cold war that's even what the new york times is calling it it's a
[21:09.600 --> 21:17.040]  serious situation and the west is so much more immoral than it was in the 50s 60s 70s and 80s
[21:17.040 --> 21:22.960]  by every metric by every legal maxim by every university study press freedoms are out the
[21:22.960 --> 21:29.040]  window financial freedoms are out the window surveillance is out of control we are becoming
[21:29.040 --> 21:35.360]  like the old soviet union as russia is becoming more unfree as well in many ways and it is a
[21:35.360 --> 21:40.480]  race to the bottom so we don't have the moral high ground here and the average america doesn't
[21:40.480 --> 21:44.480]  even know what's going on over there it's kind of like they have these events now and it's
[21:44.480 --> 21:49.360]  yeah it's kind of in the news but a background thing hey the oscars are on you know and
[21:51.440 --> 21:56.560]  did you hear what was going on with justin beaver today meanwhile russian troops are not
[21:56.560 --> 22:03.920]  going to blank folks they didn't with napoleon or hitler or the united states and comparing the
[22:03.920 --> 22:07.520]  united states to hitler and napoleon i'm just saying they didn't over and over again it was it
[22:07.520 --> 22:12.720]  was internal corruption that brought them down and they've built back up to a certain extent
[22:12.720 --> 22:17.840]  and this is not a good situation and you notice right as the dollar is in trouble right as those
[22:17.840 --> 22:25.280]  world economic problems every forecasters told you from gerald salante to jim rogers to mark
[22:25.280 --> 22:31.600]  faber to myself to countless others it's a historical fact the card is to go to war it was
[22:31.600 --> 22:37.040]  that way five thousand years ago was that way 300 years ago it's a good political diversion
[22:37.040 --> 22:41.200]  the iranians like war don't want to be peaceful their government because it lets them take their
[22:41.200 --> 22:46.240]  people's liberties the israelis like a state of war because it lets them control their people
[22:46.240 --> 22:50.080]  the american government likes a state of war or crisis because it lets them control the people
[22:50.080 --> 22:57.440]  the germans are the same pretty much everybody is historically and the fact that we can't even
[22:57.440 --> 23:03.440]  recognize that is why we're in so much trouble and the russians have a little bit of the moral
[23:03.440 --> 23:07.040]  high ground they've got a lot of problems they've been trying to influence ukraine there's a lot of
[23:07.040 --> 23:12.640]  issues but it's in their backyard and our government run by offshore banks is starting this so
[23:13.760 --> 23:16.880]  i don't side with the russians in it it's just we don't have the moral high ground
[23:17.760 --> 23:23.360]  and i don't support anything if i don't have the moral high ground because it's your report
[23:23.360 --> 23:30.480]  yourself and i've looked at all the angles of this it's a bad situation now continuing obama
[23:30.480 --> 23:38.160]  got asked a few days ago at a democratic party event stories up on info wars dot com hey are you
[23:38.160 --> 23:41.920]  worried about nuclear war with russia you know we don't want to sit here and hear about how great
[23:41.920 --> 23:47.440]  obama care is the great screw job in the sky and you know or or how we're all you know believe in
[23:47.440 --> 23:51.760]  global freeze our butts off we don't pay all gore carbon taxes you know now it's global cooling
[23:51.760 --> 23:57.520]  they want you to pay them taxes for when you breathe president obama was well into a speech
[23:57.520 --> 24:03.440]  a democratic national committee summit on friday when someone in the crowd said mr obama tell us
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.760]  about your plans for nuclear war with russia the man shouted according to a transcript released
[24:07.760 --> 24:12.480]  for the white house and they are moving nuclear weapons into the area they are moving missiles to
[24:12.480 --> 24:17.440]  shoot down the russian response the russians are freaking out getting encircled let me tell you
[24:17.440 --> 24:22.080]  if the russians were moving missiles into mexico i'd be upset if russians were moving missiles
[24:22.080 --> 24:26.560]  into cuba i'd say take it out of there we're going to blow your butt off just like what happened
[24:26.560 --> 24:33.280]  during the cuba missile crisis this is very provocative of course the u.s moved missiles
[24:33.280 --> 24:38.720]  into turkey is why the russians moved them into cuba we came within inches of nuclear war folks
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.320]  and most of us wouldn't be here today be a whole different future if that would happen
[24:42.320 --> 24:46.640]  and the rand corporation was ready for that's what dr strange loves all about real rand corporation
[24:46.640 --> 24:51.440]  plans from two years before the stanley kubernetes god where they wanted to survive a nuclear war
[24:51.440 --> 24:56.400]  and have the elite go in the bunkers for a few years and then regroup and take down the whole
[24:56.400 --> 25:02.720]  world and set up a world government the elite is ready to have a nuclear war i'm not even if i had
[25:02.720 --> 25:08.160]  passcodes to the underground bunkers with nuclear power and swimming pools and you know a pleasure
[25:08.160 --> 25:13.600]  servants for the elite i would not want to be part of that because i'm not a mass murderer
[25:14.800 --> 25:20.960]  i'm not insane and in dr strange love the the president plays the part of a kennedy character
[25:20.960 --> 25:24.240]  played by peter cellars and the generals are explaining we need to go ahead and have this
[25:24.240 --> 25:28.480]  nuclear war you know that kurtis lemay wants to have they call him jack t ripper in the film
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.000]  all later came out this is actually what went on the cia actually came to cuba and said how
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.400]  do you know all this that came out on record and i've talked to the family and confirmed it and
[25:38.960 --> 25:43.280]  all of this type stuff goes on well he just had sources it was well known and later came out
[25:43.920 --> 25:49.520]  they were they were the joint chiefs headed up by l l limnitzer kurtis lemay and others
[25:49.520 --> 25:56.320]  wanted to have nuclear war with russia so they could have a planetary government run by pax americana
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.480]  that wouldn't be an american system a fascist system and so all i'm telling you is don't think
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.960]  that obama and the people controlling him won't pull something like this this is in the cards i'm
[26:06.960 --> 26:11.840]  not saying it's gonna happen so let's go to obama acting like he doesn't know what the heckler's
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.760]  talking about asking a real question you know we don't want to hear about the austers or how you're
[26:15.760 --> 26:19.920]  gonna be on jimmy fallon or how you're a big movie star how beautiful your wife it looks like a
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.480]  snapping turtle is we don't want you to be a celebrity in our face force fed every day
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.440]  everyone rejects you we hate you we don't like you con artist let's go to the clip i'm sorry
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.600]  i'm sorry who who's that back let me get confident in front of all my idiot phones what the heck are
[26:35.600 --> 26:46.960]  you talking about and again you can barely hear the guys nuclear war we're worried about nuclear war
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.440]  he laughs at it that's funny russian troops are pouring in if anybody crosses and they're gonna
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.200]  they've said like in 2008 in george they're gonna watch nuclear attacks on europe don't worry about
[26:59.200 --> 27:05.840]  that we're we're okay we're having a seat yeah don't worry about him the uh by the way you notice
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.760]  it was bad enough about that plan it was bad enough when they would chant usa when he went
[27:09.760 --> 27:17.360]  question bush that was cult like enough but obama obama obama did you hear that obama
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.600]  obama he's like it's okay don't even listen to that guy yeah don't listen the austers are coming
[27:21.600 --> 27:25.520]  up in a couple days you know we're about to have nuclear war there's a good chance it could happen
[27:25.520 --> 27:30.320]  it almost happened in syria but the joint chief said this could cause nuclear war with russia
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.520]  and obama back down at a midnight meeting but just don't even worry about that cooks you know we
[27:35.520 --> 27:42.640]  don't worry about that here is us prepares to recall diplomats impose sanctions and representative
[27:42.640 --> 27:47.040]  mike rogers i was calling him a senator i promoted him chairman of the select intelligence committee
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.640]  came out and had this to say about the situation in the ukraine president obama has been handling
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.320]  relations with russia versus how vladimir putin has been handling relations with the united states
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.920]  well i think putin is playing chess and i think we're playing marbles and i don't think it's even
[28:05.920 --> 28:11.040]  close so if you look at the nuclear negotiations we got our fannies handed to us they took tactical
[28:11.040 --> 28:17.680]  nukes out of the equation huge mistake especially for our allies in the in the baltics uh when you
[28:17.680 --> 28:24.400]  move down the list uh in in syria the russian's got everything that they needed they believe
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.360]  they needed in syria and so we've they've we've been right let's stop right there and i think it's
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.120]  the you know other russians are running circles around us when they can barely keep their lights on
[28:34.320 --> 28:40.800]  because our government funded 200 000 al-qaeda jihadis to come out of iraq and out of turkey
[28:40.800 --> 28:46.240]  and out of jordan to blow up hundreds of churches and kill people in syria and it made a sod a bad
[28:46.240 --> 28:53.280]  guy look like jesus compared to that because he basically is that's why representative rogers we
[28:53.280 --> 29:01.040]  are look like fools because we have an evil policy and the world sees it the facts are in the studies
[29:01.040 --> 29:06.960]  are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[29:06.960 --> 29:13.120]  and cognitive ability of the american people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[29:13.120 --> 29:19.120]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not
[29:19.120 --> 29:23.600]  have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our

[35:06.160 --> 35:11.200]  film they got attacked by some neocons being anti-corporate it wasn't anti-corporate it was anti
[35:11.200 --> 35:18.560]  agenda 21 non-liberty i think it had a very positive message let me just recap the big top
[35:18.560 --> 35:23.360]  story and then seguand everything else here as the dam breaks out of the top story 35 minutes in
[35:23.360 --> 35:30.800]  the worldwide transmission on this live sunday edition ukraine mobilizes after putin's declaration
[35:30.800 --> 35:38.880]  of war that's writers and they're calling it a declaration of war that they took a tiny peninsula
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.840]  area and a military base that they already had so there you go and i'm not defending russia i'm just
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.800]  saying the media is totally spending this and i'm about sanctions on russia and nato troops
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.240]  going in yeah that's a wonderful idea when the last just fomented an overthrow of a government over
[35:54.240 --> 35:59.920]  there i mean it's just it's not good i mean to be one thing if they overthrew it to replace it
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.880]  with a republic and people being able to own guns and liberty you could at least argue it was moral
[36:04.880 --> 36:10.640]  they're putting in a eu george soros kleptocracy where the eu sucks the country dry you know that
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.080]  a choice between george soros and putin i might take putin i mean i've just about had enough of
[36:16.080 --> 36:22.400]  george soros who runs media organizations sworn to shut me down who write lies about me every week
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.440]  i'm not under attack by latimer putin i'm under attack by george soros who finances
[36:27.440 --> 36:32.080]  anti-free speech stuff in congress i mean he's a guy over here squatting on america
[36:32.080 --> 36:36.880]  with cloward and piven and get you on welfare and he's a huge recipient along with warren

[36:53.600 --> 37:01.760]  an american and i got george soros on my back not latimer putin understand i see a russian around
[37:01.760 --> 37:06.640]  here telling me what to do i'll kick their ass but i'm here to tell you folks i haven't seen
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.280]  one russian going around telling me what to do you understand that and i mean that figuratively
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.640]  politically in the info war i will stomp them into the ground russia attacks any interest i'll
[37:16.640 --> 37:22.000]  call for war with them i'll call for limited war to push them out of that area not nuclear
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.880]  and we'd have the moral high ground and russia might have a war with us that was just conventional
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.400]  but you move into their homeland their border you move into the Crimea that's generally been with
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.880]  russia throughout history you are opening the door for them to launch nuclear attacks folks

[37:54.560 --> 38:01.280]  any side of this this is a serious situation meanwhile the neocon trotskyites here in the
[38:01.280 --> 38:06.240]  us that's we funded and founded the neocons they had neocons last week claiming i'm some kind of
[38:06.240 --> 38:13.600]  communist when i'm a total libertarian on record von mies institute type person and then meanwhile
[38:13.600 --> 38:19.840]  the neocons were founded by the trotskyites by trotsky you ran to the us and then mexico
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.360]  and got killed in mexico by a Stalinist so they created the fake conservative movement to take
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.760]  over conservatism and kill opposition i love them criticizing me when they've got their

[39:47.280 --> 39:51.120]  budgets are getting as big as the establishment because the establishment bankers won't even
[39:51.120 --> 39:55.440]  put money behind msnbc and cnn anymore because they don't even have the audiences of a local radio

[40:14.800 --> 40:20.880]  got into that article ukraine putin's Crimea aim is to make the west look weak the real purpose of
[40:20.880 --> 40:26.880]  russian troops in ukraine is to undermine the credibility of nato no london telegraph that's
[40:26.880 --> 40:32.240]  anti russian historically the nato is running up against the russian border and the russians actually
[40:32.240 --> 40:36.960]  look weak so they basically just secured their military bases on their border that they already
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.680]  had in ukraine and i hope they're restrained and and this doesn't turn into nuclear war
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.160]  to which the neocons respond i'm a russian sympathizer i'm not a sympathizer with um
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.680]  a side over and over in syria i just don't want to fund al qaeda to go in there and

[51:36.960 --> 51:41.040]  they were the anti-slavery party folks and so the democrats flipped into race politics with

[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:14.800]  enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.040]  mainstream news is even reporting what we told you years ago massive drone operations are being
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:31.120]  launched all over the united states police departments are spying on everything you're
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:38.080]  doing without warrants beyond the nsa we're gonna get into that at a la weekly uh we've got uh just
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:45.520]  just just all sorts of insanely important news that is coming up guys i'm i'm it's all my fault
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.440]  but i'm having trouble finding my stack of it was like an ap article and a couple others
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.760]  admitting drone operations watching the american people i had that in my stack i wanted to show
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.840]  that in the next segment but you guys i'll try to find it during the break but if not just just
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:04.400]  reprint it for me the reason got sacramental b2 yeah yeah print me that not from info wars print
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:12.240]  me the actual sacramental b there guys now uh continuing folks the reason i wanted that rant
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.640]  is they get up there on the news two years ago and i had to keep bringing up drudge report
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.360]  that just it's what happened curtain emma wrote an article about all these articles about how they
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.040]  were using drones to spy on farmers and arrest poachers and people they thought were wrestling
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.920]  cattle in north dakota and places so he wrote an article about it and drudge report dot com
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.080]  picked it up and then they had literally in the associated press and a bunch of other
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.640]  newspapers not just ap wire they said it's not true there's no drones no one's watching
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.080]  but our article had all these links to local newspapers and the f a a and the f b i and
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.200]  border patrol and the defense department and wired magazine i mean we weren't even breaking this
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.600]  it was just an article a boil down article that's why they don't like our articles because
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.640]  if wired or somebody does an article they just report on one thing we at info wars dot com at
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.720]  least most of the time that's what i try to do is we try to show you that what's happening now
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.840]  but then connect it to how we see what's going on like hey see all this back story what do you
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.680]  think of that there's a bunch of this going on connect the dots and they came out and they said
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.880]  hey there are no drones and this curtain emma story of yeah 2012 about two years ago
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:30.160]  does not exist and i mean i had stacks of mainstream news admitting it was going on in
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.840]  government documents and so that's why i get upset and start yelling and screaming
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.520]  is because these people are a hoax and a fraud they didn't want opposition forming to it before
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.800]  they pr didn't rolled it out so that you would accept it just like the nsa spying i told you
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.280]  about 16 17 years ago just like the torture camps i told you about five years before it was in the
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.360]  news just like everything we told you about beforehand it's all in congressional hearings
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.600]  government documents it's all more i'd hardly break anything it's already in the record we
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.640]  just go tell you about it you know it's like i remember a couple years ago police department's
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.800]  got grants for light bulbs that get data down the power line and spy on everybody and can even
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.160]  create an optic eye effect and watch you that's how high tech stuff is now they like one little
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.320]  chip in the light bulb they also have data light bulbs and they made national news stories saying
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.080]  i was a liar but it's back on the news now saying isn't it great the light bulbs are going to
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.280]  communicate everything in your house this is what's frustrating is it's like the guy in the pizza
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:35.200]  place 11 12 years ago remember because my wife was first pregnant 12 years ago and the guy walks
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.280]  on the pizza place it shoves me in the back conan's pizza and i turned around and i went
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.440]  hey what's you got a problem in you said hey i saw your show but i went i got a ut degree in
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.800]  biology they don't have goats that are part spiders i'm appreciate you lying when did you get a
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:57.440]  degree well 1976 university of texas i went man just search engine spider goats it's like cbs news
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.920]  ap you name it and i said he's sort of getting in my face i said listen man get out of my face
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.040]  and i said some other stuff and i'm not gonna act tough because the guy was kind of bowing up
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.560]  guess he had a problem but you know it sounded buck rogers he wanted to confront me now everybody
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:21.120]  knows about spider goats now imagine the raw story run by the democratic party who's threatened me
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:27.120]  repeatedly when we post a blurb of their stories you name it raw story comes out and says i'm internet
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.480]  only which i'd be more proud of the fact if i would have started pure internet and dominated the way
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.960]  matt drudge did i started am and fm on my own off access but still i didn't start purely internet
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.280]  and dominate from internet only in fact there's really no one out there that's done that news wise
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.320]  except from the beginning there's been some more modern examples but drudge was the first the point
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.280]  is i am successful uphill in am and fm radio and to lie to their audience like that when they have
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:01.200]  a long history with us shows how they prey on you they're predators the facts are in the studies
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.200]  are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.360]  and cognitive ability of the american people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:19.360]  symbol dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.760]  have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:30.000]  bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars life fluoride shield formulation
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.080]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.680]  just toxic fluoride residues from the body but a whole host of toxic substances let's take a stand
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.880]  against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield i use fluoride shield every
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.920]  day secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at info wars life
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:06:09.920]  dot com today let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the info war at the same time that's info wars life
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.840]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:22.240]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial commonwealth in dallas texas three
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.240]  shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade and downtown dallas the first report to say that
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:36.480]  president kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big idea a new order
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:44.480]  it was almost as if it were a plan to inflate it just pancake
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:52.480]  either you were with us or you were with the terrorists
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:07:02.480]  so
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.800]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.680]  the hands of criminals
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.800]  guns will be taken no one will be able to be all we can take all of that for many of the police and
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:24.080]  guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an american city global governance at last
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.360]  is it one of the central bankers in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for what the
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:38.960]  central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death live from the info wars dot com
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:46.000]  studios it's alex jones that's right now seven minutes into the second hour of the sunday worldwide
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.480]  transmission i want to open the phones up on the subject of ukraine today for military veterans
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.560]  and active duty what is your view i know active duty overwhelmingly were against aiding al-qaeda
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:04.400]  openly uh or even covertly to attack syria because these were groups that us military had fought
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.840]  and some of these al-qaeda people in the bbc and others bragged that they killed americans and would
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.440]  continue to kill americans but thank you for the weapons very arrogant scum and our government
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.760]  didn't really control them they were just arming them and turning them loose i'm not saying there
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.400]  aren't radical muslim extremists that's a fact the point is they're just arming them and like
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.000]  turning them loose like a group of piranhas or a hornet's nest you've beaten with a baseball bat
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.040]  to go infest some country that's done nothing like syria and then to kill everybody and then to
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.280]  use the threat of the hornets flying around to take liberties domestically i want to hear
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.040]  from military about ukraine where do you stand on this because it's a very complex issue and i don't
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.320]  again sit there and romanticize it's only word to describe it what's going on with putin and the
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:56.240]  russians but they're being pushed by nato in my view and that is a fact they're being pushed by
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.560]  soros in the state department john carrey and there's a destabilization program and they're
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:07.280]  trying to do it inside russia and i don't think poking up a grizzly bear is a good idea especially
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:14.160]  when we have a giant 800 pound maggot a maggot whale defecating all over just like george soros
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.640]  with all of his political dethritis gun control you know destroy the family push marijuana i'm
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.000]  for decriminalization but not marijuana culture bombed out of your brain drug culture just because
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.920]  i don't want to fill the prisons with uh nonviolent offenders doesn't mean i endorse
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.880]  the monstrosity that is denver now in this culture of not working and staying so stoned out of your
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.520]  melon that you don't even know how to tie your shoelaces again you all of this in moderation
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:48.560]  ladies and gentlemen so i want military personnel's take on that police your take on it but most
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.840]  importantly because we got 20 phone lines on sunday we run our own system on sunday not weekdays
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.040]  because i still do it through genesis and it's good backup and they're up minnesota and they're
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.640]  good guys well they only have six phone lines we have 20 phone lines we actually have a hundred we
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.120]  dial it down to 20 and when we open it up for a few minutes and then we turn it back off
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.760]  that's the calls that come in a little national shows we're getting 10 calls are excited about
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.000]  we could take 100 phone calls in five minutes we would come in more than 100 the maybe a minute
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.400]  but the point is please folks don't call if you're not military active duty or recently got out
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.120]  or served in eastern europe and have a real view on this i'll try to go to you quickly in the next

[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.480]  military police folks in europe i could usually give the number out in australia or in egypt and
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:09.680]  get some calls on an issue i don't see anybody from ukraine i got canada illinois which is kind
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.560]  of like the soviet union this i guess that is from kind of like 1982 from the soviet union
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.240]  illinois is a great state but it's kind of run by the soviet union uh from another dimension we
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.280]  got virginia texas arkansas texas again we got an international line folks or you can call the
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:30.560]  regular number 877-789-2539 i want to hear from ukraine or russia uh you name it anybody over

[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:46.240]  now let's go to baba in virginia he served 10 years in germany and we got active military
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.680]  paul and texas wants to comment on ukraine what's your take on this baba
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.600]  yeah i see i was over in germany for quite some time um starting background 2000s 2001
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.520]  back to start having different meetings for uh how are we going to put bases over in in different
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.240]  parts of what would used to be former eastern europe your former eastern soviet union there
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:14.400]  which is provocative like exactly so we're putting places we got asg's actually looking at putting
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.960]  area support groups equivalent to uh over in poland uh i know some guys have gone over there
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:26.560]  and some stuff uh coast of oh yugoslavia places like that so yeah we're basically you know
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.040]  we're we're fringing right on the borders in circling russia yes that's the the public plan
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.520]  is to bring russia down by the white house yes exactly and then the whole thing going on
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.920]  ukraine um just from things i've seen in red in history books and everything to me this
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.200]  seems somewhat similar to when when uh karmic rose if that was over in iran you know these
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.240]  we got provocateurs in there they go in there with a bunch of money you know uh but basically
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.800]  you use backtell and other corporations like that and then george soros corporations they go in there
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:03.680]  and they pay a bunch of hooligans to start rides and carry on and they don't want to join the
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.240]  year i can guarantee you that because i can tell you when i went to play spectacles of hockey and
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:13.840]  stuff they would rather take my dollars or they'd take throne over euros they do not want euros
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.600]  they don't want anything to do with the euros because you know it's bad news it's gonna crash
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.360]  and you know it's gonna bring down the economy so those people in ukraine that are wanting to
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.040]  deal with the e you and be part of something become part of the e you i'm telling you do
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.680]  better look out because and they're they're tying their own hanglessness well very sophisticated
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.800]  points you make that the majority of ukranians they voted it down in elections do not want to
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:40.640]  join the e you and be saddled with debt enslaved i mean that's like wanting to join with leukemia or
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:45.360]  wanting to join with syphilis i mean it's it's it's not a good deal and so they just activate a
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.720]  bunch of thugs to blow stuff up the government stands down they take over that gives the russians
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.520]  a vacuum to come in the word is they stood down to the western powers by some of our sources
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.720]  the government did who's pro russia so russia would have an excuse to come in and that may
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.960]  actually be the double triple cross in all this and that's why it's such a mess the problem is
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:14.960]  historically the russians will not back down and so people like nuclear war get ready for it i
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.360]  appreciate your call it's not like we're led by like eisenhower or something or ronald reagan
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:25.280]  folks it's barack obama who's busy raising old ladies insurance prices i mean it's just
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:32.560]  a sickening situation paul in texas active duty military what is your take on all this paul
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.360]  hey alexa a lot of things going on uh basically a couple of points and just something to think
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.560]  about uh last week our president said that he was going to shrink the military to the smallest
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:51.120]  size there's been since world war two um next thing you know russia has decided that they would
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:57.360]  make a an end run down through the uh to the Crimea to their deep water port at sabastopol
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:01.200]  that's where they keep their all their carrier operations are out of that base they don't have
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.080]  a choice i mean isn't it like when when the commies took over kuba the usc's wantonimo because
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.680]  their ships were there oh absolutely uh the interesting part of this is that entire corridor
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.320]  that they came down through to sabastopol all those folks speak russian they're they're pro russian
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.520]  anyway so that's i mean it's not even a big deal to those guys the ukrainians are in the uh on the
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.000]  western part of the country where they actually speak ukrainian and that's where all the uh
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.840]  sure in ap and reuters is saying russia invaded ukraine no they didn't they secured their military
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:39.760]  bases and i'm not saying that's that's i'm not judging that it's just a fact they secured the
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:47.360]  russian held area and their military bases on the economic side most of the natural gas that
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.560]  europe uses runs through the pipelines that run through the Crimea that's right and the the next
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:57.440]  place they need to be very careful of is maldova because the remainder of the pipelines run through
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:05.280]  there very well said where do you think this is all going uh well i think uh putin takes a lot of
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.280]  pleasure in punking a president and uh he's doing a real good job at that well they just keep thinking

[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.320]  population's aging which it is but because it's so much fun and trendy to poop on yourself in

[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:20.480]  russia sent a uh a military veffle down to cuba and i wonder if they're listening into uh tapping

[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.400]  i'm not again saying they're a bunch of angels it's just that it's all i don't try to be mean to

[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.880]  upsetting if i kept this for a few days the lines will be loaded with it i want calls from ukraine
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.560]  i know most the phones aren't working there i've been told some areas or russia or poland or germany

[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:06.080]  seventeen seventy six i want your take over there on this john and michigan former military with
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.680]  ukraine experience go ahead john alex hey go ahead all i know a lot about the history of ukraine
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.880]  and uh i personally think this is an imperial policy going back 200 years by the british empire
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:23.360]  you know they have this constant encroachment upon russia and um it's telling because i mean uh the
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.240]  economic situation in in the transatlantic region right now it's i personally think it's going to
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:32.960]  blow out and uh it's going to make like wemen brothers look like a joke you know and uh
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.040]  the the uh it's potential disintegration of incomplete europe financial system u.s financial
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.120]  system uh then you're confronted with a completely different dynamic in the asian world
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.400]  where china korea india russia they're all are progressing you know um so what comes into play
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:54.560]  is uh the old geopolitical impulse of the british empire to say you know we can't tolerate asian
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.320]  countries basically advancing and developing they'd rather risk total destruction you know uh
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.760]  and by the way what you're saying is brisinski's own policy and it doesn't mean we progress either
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.880]  the it is not even the british they're doing it the british empire model of balkanization royal
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:18.800]  commission 1949 bankrupt everyone but the elite to control us is agenda 21 is the neo fascist
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.880]  fake liberal agenda that is being carried out in the name of liberalism absolutely right
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.920]  they want to stop everyone's progress you have hit the nail on the head go ahead you know it really
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:35.520]  makes a dangerous situation here is the geographical position of ukraine it reaches deep into the
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.040]  former soviet territory you know and uh various uh points in history ukraine has a you know been
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.280]  part of russia you know akia was actually the capital of russia at one time that's right not
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:51.920]  not until their independence in the early 90s um and ukraine's border is only 480 kilometers
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.880]  from moscow i mean that's like the the distance between san francisco and la you know the russians
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:02.480]  in the last 400 years have had countless wars in that area with everybody trying to take them over
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.320]  so this is like a football field they've been on constantly and they know they're letting them get
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.600]  up to their one yard line nato and george soros who wants to you know sterilize every russian
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.080]  child there is basically that's the agenda so they're right up to their border i'm not romanticizing

[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:44.080]  mentioned this not that it's important or not that it matters that's why the mainstream media is dying
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:52.800]  but white house connected george soros connected media matters connected uh raw story it came out
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.960]  with an article saying tucker carlsson alex jones when he was on friday with me in studio
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.480]  democratic party now the kkk but with minorities and that's just a historical fact we break it
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:09.760]  down the full interview that's on info wars dot com they go on to say fox news host tucker carlsson
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:16.000]  appear on right wing conspiracy enthuses alex jones internet only radio show friday the two
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.480]  men shared their paranoia about latino immigrants well no i mean they're gonna vote to take the
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.960]  guns i mean that's the democratic party says that dubbing them the new kukul x klan we didn't say
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:30.480]  that we said that the democratic party couldn't get stopped the republicans with the voting rights
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.800]  act and the civil rights act so they flipped from being the racist to then race politics
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.040]  with minorities but making it about race not issues we should all be unified around bill
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:45.600]  rights constitution so it's this whole article is a deception on what we really said and then they say
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.720]  i'm on no m or fm's when this show last time i checked was on 90 something it varies back and
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:56.080]  forth the weekday show over 160 it's in talkers magazine the filiates are all listed you're
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.640]  listening to us all over the country on amon fm stations we've dominated on the internet as well
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:06.560]  it's just freaky to see how they say obama care doesn't raise your premiums and you can keep your
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.840]  doctor and it doesn't have death panels when it does it's freaky to see obama say the nsa
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:15.840]  doesn't listen to americans when it does it's freaky to see them say we didn't ship guns to
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.960]  mexico when they did it's freaky to say they didn't stand out at ben gauzy when they did
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.480]  it's freaky when al gore says the north pole melted this year when it didn't it got bigger
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:35.760]  i mean it's scary it's scary how they lie it's scary i try to tell the truth and make mistakes
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.640]  and get upset and come back and correct it i try to tell the truth i couldn't imagine telling my
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:47.760]  listeners you know the washington monument doesn't exist and the sun doesn't but obama our god our
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:58.720]  lord and savior as jamie fox says barack obama he exists nothing exists but obama the sun comes up
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:05.680]  because of him he is everything kim jung yield is everything i mean hitler is everything mao is
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.960]  everything i mean i'm just sick of it i'm sick of the ignorance of the public i'm a liberal
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:17.520]  thomas jefferson guns family property freedom do what you want the democrats are a bunch of
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:21.920]  criminal scum and the republican leadership is as well the average democrat the streets a well-meaning
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:27.680]  person part of their group they are loyal to the group i don't blame you but all i'm saying is look
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.960]  at your leadership they're they're taking over if the republicans were taking over i'd be against them
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:40.240]  they're dangerous i want separation of powers but this mind control is like you know when
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:45.120]  luke skywalkers talking to job of the hud or hillary clinton he says he goes don't try that
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:49.520]  genie jedi i'm not weak minded well i'm not weak minded either but this stuff works on the public

[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.760]  people that are trying to find the truth and who think they're liberals who are literally the heart of

[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:04.240]  only fours right now i'm looking at first off the ball unbelievable let's jam in a few calls
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:10.560]  brad nabrasco retired military cramia russian language uh linguist go ahead yeah actually your
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.720]  call screener got that wrong i said there was a language component to the whole cramia okay well
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:20.240]  they wrote that on the screen go ahead oh my russian's as good as fps russia it doesn't matter
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:25.680]  go ahead and make your point brother hey uh they passed a referendum into ukraine a couple months
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.880]  ago saying that minority languages could be used for business and daily use russian being included
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:36.080]  in those minority languages as soon as the new government took over they excluded that and they
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.040]  told everybody don't we got to go back to all ukrainian which instantly ticked off most of the
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.400]  cramia and the other point i wanted to make is i was looking at the mass bin that have been
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:52.160]  surrounding the uh the parliament building there in the cramia and they're definitely i don't think
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.720]  the russian military i think they're just local cramian because the weapons handouts are a lot
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.320]  different from picture to picture so i think it's the cramians that are have started this
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:10.800]  and to separate themselves from the ukrainian and one of the parliament members of the cramia has
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:16.400]  the autonomous state of cramia i might add said that we invited russia to come in and kind of
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:22.480]  safeguard stuff until now that's right on record great points i'm out of time hey crew excellent
