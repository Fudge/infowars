[00:00.000 --> 00:12.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.880 --> 00:17.840]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:17.840 --> 00:25.680]  Slavery has never been so chic and so cool in the age of COVID.
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.640]  Should this be how a restaurant table for one looks in the near future, French designer
[00:30.640 --> 00:37.360]  Christophe Gagnon says his oversized lampshade of transparent plastic will keep diners safe
[00:37.360 --> 00:45.020]  and unlike some other designs on the market, he reckons they look pretty chic too.
[00:45.020 --> 00:50.920]  That is the world we live in, it's all psychological warfare and as I said six months ago when
[00:50.920 --> 01:00.880]  this fraud all started, they are creating neurotic neuroses and illegitimate phobias
[01:00.880 --> 01:08.880]  about the natural practices of life playing on the true ignorance now of the population
[01:08.880 --> 01:15.320]  of the planet that's been so dumbed down to believe that all regular flu death or pneumonia
[01:15.320 --> 01:21.600]  is a pandemic and so we can never leave our houses again and that's what Bill Gates has
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.600]  come out and announced.
[01:22.600 --> 01:26.920]  We've got that video coming up later, Bill Gates says this is only the beginning, many
[01:26.920 --> 01:33.040]  more pandemics are coming and oh my goodness media pushing pig virus as potential next
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.040]  pandemic.
[01:34.040 --> 01:41.960]  Now a lot of listeners sent me links and articles and clips since we broke that big
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.600]  news out of Texas where the state and counties are confirming they've been ordered to say
[01:46.600 --> 01:52.440]  that anybody that's been in contact with people is counted as a COVID case, anybody that they
[01:52.440 --> 01:58.440]  were in contact with is counted as a COVID case, total fraud and listeners sent me all
[01:58.440 --> 02:09.560]  sorts of links saying Alex it's in the Hill newspaper months ago that probable coronavirus
[02:09.560 --> 02:17.680]  deaths now included in CDC totals yeah they're not even denying the fraud and okay we have
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.520]  our own video platform it's got 350,000 views or something that's great good job spreading
[02:22.520 --> 02:29.080]  it but man we need 300 million views people need to know the fraud.
[02:29.080 --> 02:39.560]  The criminal fraud of the CDC says the bare minimum is one person has COVID that's usually
[02:39.560 --> 02:46.080]  a fraudulent test 15 people around them are counted as COVID cases and they changed that
[02:46.080 --> 02:52.840]  definition on May 14th it was implemented by the 20th or so and then here we are a month
[02:52.840 --> 03:03.160]  later and that's how they're showing skyrocketing cases but not skyrocketing death and I've
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.280]  got hundreds of stories to cover and incredibly important things but this is just such big
[03:08.280 --> 03:11.960]  news and I've talked to some big national talk show host about this and they're like
[03:11.960 --> 03:18.600]  yeah everybody knows this Alex just more proof of it so when you see Fauci up there he even
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.940]  gives a speech with his mask on and Congress gets up and takes it off I mean it's all
[03:24.940 --> 03:32.240]  kabuki theater and so they're introducing the idea that nobody ever dies and nobody ever
[03:32.240 --> 03:41.080]  gets sick and we've all got to live in pods or we can never have a life again and then
[03:41.080 --> 03:46.400]  doctors and scientists and virologists go public prestigious ones and say it's part
[03:46.400 --> 03:53.320]  of life that you get exposed to things it's not being exposed to them that makes you sickly
[03:53.320 --> 04:01.120]  and YouTube CEO says we ban even medical doctors or scientists they don't care if it's the Rockefeller
[04:01.120 --> 04:06.840]  University Hospital virologist head they don't care if it's a hospital owner a clinic owner
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.920]  they don't care but if it's Cedar sign I agree with the president the UN didn't say so so
[04:12.920 --> 04:19.240]  your medical degree and what you have to say is zero we only accept UN directives that's
[04:19.240 --> 04:23.680]  what the head of YouTube said on TV we played the clip probably five times I ran back into
[04:23.680 --> 04:32.640]  it last night it's just so stunning she went on MSNBC CNN and gave speeches and she says
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.920]  we follow one directive the UN we are inside the United Nations that's really what this
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.680]  is is world government meanwhile major universities are announcing they are officially reeducation
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.880]  camps and you've got to go to reeducation of your white or you will not be admitted

[06:14.800 --> 06:19.880]  the Alex Jones show I am your host Alex Jones honored and blessed to be here with you in
[06:19.880 --> 06:27.880]  defense of all of our common future a pro human future thank you for joining us again
[06:27.880 --> 06:37.520]  okay we knew it was coming we knew the debilitation of the nation the moral decline the dumbing
[06:37.520 --> 06:44.440]  down the new world order Hollywood termites chewing into our very fiber it had a big effect
[06:44.440 --> 06:51.400]  and we knew they were going to externalize the reeducation brainwashing centers that
[06:51.400 --> 06:59.560]  the colleges had become and expand those like metastasizing cancer cells spreading out of
[06:59.560 --> 07:14.520]  a infected gland but to actually see it spreading out of an infected lymph node was the word I
[07:14.520 --> 07:20.520]  was looking for actually watch it though and to see how many people bow to it and how many
[07:20.520 --> 07:27.040]  people submit to it and then each demand gets more bizarre more insane more crazy and we
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.200]  sit back and go these people are nuts no they're not nuts the psych warfare experts doing this
[07:32.200 --> 07:41.880]  have people doing Jim Jones Kool-aid drinking drills this is 101 cult program and major
[07:41.880 --> 07:47.840]  universities are announcing that they are open air reeducation camps and I'm going to
[07:47.840 --> 07:54.160]  get to that in a moment but all over the news and all over the force feed on the apple and
[07:54.160 --> 07:58.840]  the android phones and everywhere I mean you're seeing it yourself don't need me to tell you
[07:58.840 --> 08:06.080]  about it the 4th of July should not be celebrated America is inherently bad and evil the American
[08:06.080 --> 08:14.600]  flag should be removed not just George Washington not just Abraham Lincoln but everything and
[08:14.600 --> 08:22.680]  then I sit back and I watch this unified corporate press owned by the communist Chinese and the
[08:22.680 --> 08:28.520]  EU and these mega banks that are in the admitted job of undermining and demoralizing this country
[08:28.520 --> 08:35.920]  and I watch how many Americans actually bow to it and actually prostrate themselves including
[08:35.920 --> 08:47.160]  Republicans because they just think oh let it pass over you bow to it and it'll it'll
[08:47.160 --> 08:54.160]  move on no this this is joining the cult and accepting it and giving up your very humanity
[08:54.160 --> 09:01.000]  and who you are and it only leads to more danger and more insanity as the dumbed down
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.720]  drug addict meth head fentanyl mob of every race color and creed believes they're part
[09:07.720 --> 09:12.480]  of something finally and believes they're with the media and believes are with the big corporations
[09:12.480 --> 09:20.000]  that are all ganged up on the country and local governments and the police and then
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.640]  they all say they're the revolutionaries that are involved in some grassroots uprising when
[09:27.640 --> 09:35.640]  they are financed by the communist Chinese JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs Hollywood the
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.320]  EU the whole nine yards you know communist China about three years ago gave reddit fifty
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.200]  million dollars and they gave another hundred million dollars then they bought them out
[09:45.200 --> 09:49.600]  for 300 million and the media didn't call it a buyout even though it was bought out
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.080]  and is run by the Chinese military I'm gonna break that next hour I know they're under
[09:55.080 --> 10:00.920]  criminal investigation but that's just one example almost all the Hollywood zone by the
[10:00.920 --> 10:11.200]  Chinese government and that's why reddit when people attack me and my family at a dinner
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.080]  table at its video and says I attack them that's why when our vehicle gets attacked
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.600]  with people with hammers they turn around and say we faked it or they turn around and
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.200]  they say we burned down a homeless camp because reddit is the Chinese government and you know
[10:26.200 --> 10:32.600]  what I'm honored that the Chinese government and their anti-American lackeys attacking
[10:32.600 --> 10:37.680]  me as much as they attack Trump but I'll ask President Trump everybody else this why do
[10:37.680 --> 10:43.120]  we put up with foreign activity the Australians and the Indians have ended Chinese control
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.880]  over their media they are arresting Chinese spies everywhere they are banning them from
[10:47.880 --> 10:53.240]  buying further companies because China tried to overthrow India and Australia in the last
[10:53.240 --> 10:58.480]  two years and that's all over the Australian Indian news the Indians are ready for war
[10:58.480 --> 11:03.720]  the average slack jaw American doesn't even know their countries under attack I admire
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.280]  the Indians for being nationalist and caring about their country and they are basically
[11:08.280 --> 11:13.960]  at war with China and they've given their military fire at will orders when the chai
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.440]  comms try to intimidate them and the chai comms who've been attacking their military in disputed
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.180]  areas and trying to steal land and trying to bring Muslims in to take over areas of
[11:22.180 --> 11:31.800]  the cashmere have backed off because the Indians stood up but the average weird leftist literally
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.800]  hates the country they hate America they hate anybody that's strong and they get off on
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.160]  the power of the mainstream media and the Chinese owned Hollywood and the Chinese finance
[11:42.160 --> 11:55.560]  CNN and Reddit can sit there and pass in the face of Americans all day long and what's
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.880]  crazy is none of these leftist even know you just type in China invest 300 million in Reddit
[11:59.880 --> 12:06.440]  it'll pull up pull it up for us Reddit makes jokes about that and says it isn't true and
[12:06.440 --> 12:11.880]  the people posting it know it's true but they know to post a lie so they can keep posting
[12:11.880 --> 12:20.140]  they're not even paid by the chai comms most of them they're useful idiots I got so much
[12:20.140 --> 12:25.740]  to talk about here it's just to think that there are so many traders and so much scum
[12:25.740 --> 12:32.420]  and so much trash because it's fashionable to hate America it's fashionable to say we
[12:32.420 --> 12:41.700]  can't have a July 4th but I love how governor Newsom said no fourth of July in California
[12:41.700 --> 12:45.700]  and in Illinois the Democrats announced no fourth of July and in Austin Texas they said
[12:45.700 --> 12:50.180]  one for fourth of July I talked to a fellow two days ago that owns fireworks stands he
[12:50.180 --> 12:56.180]  said they've never sold anything close to this and everyone black white Hispanic old
[12:56.180 --> 13:02.100]  young is buying up fireworks saying at the system I'm gonna go crazy with these fireworks
[13:02.100 --> 13:07.020]  because they just see it as a symbol of you're not supposed to have for the July it sucks
[13:07.020 --> 13:12.460]  you're not gonna have it wipe your ass with the American flag and people now are finally
[13:12.460 --> 13:21.500]  starting to get how sick this is we are under globalist propaganda military attack I told
[13:21.500 --> 13:28.100]  you two years ago that there was a CIA FBI investigations University of Texas the good
[13:28.100 --> 13:33.420]  guys in the FBI CIA not the bad camp into the Confucius Institute and the office of personnel
[13:33.420 --> 13:38.300]  management hack and the Chinese in control of who could get hired at every major university
[13:38.300 --> 13:42.600]  that's public basically and they were pumping hundreds of millions in a UT alone the Chinese
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.740]  government that was one year before it broke in the news and they outlawed it and those
[13:47.740 --> 13:53.580]  professors are lucky they're not indicted for treason and they still may be I'm telling
[13:53.580 --> 13:58.780]  you Reddit is under criminal investigation as a child that they are it is run by the Chinese
[13:58.780 --> 14:04.380]  military and the weirdos that post on there and write their little fake articles they
[14:04.380 --> 14:11.660]  they all know it they think it's cool China has human animal clones China has three billion
[14:11.660 --> 14:15.940]  Muslims and death camps China has millions of Christians and death camps China does stuff
[14:15.940 --> 14:21.380]  that would make Hitler blush and the left likes it because they're not liberal they're
[14:21.380 --> 14:28.220]  satanic they like power they like evil and they're cozying up to whatever evil they could
[14:28.220 --> 14:34.260]  find wanting a paycheck but more importantly spiritually wanting to dominate and control
[14:34.260 --> 14:39.180]  the West and mount on the wall like a trophy look at this this is all over the news you
[14:39.180 --> 14:42.460]  got to wear a space suit to go to a bar you got to put bubbles up they've already put
[14:42.460 --> 14:47.700]  these up in some shops because people are shaking in fear of a virus that they admit
[14:47.700 --> 14:53.300]  is a total fraud but it is man-made so Bill Gates can own new variants that come out that
[14:53.300 --> 15:00.380]  are more deadly which he's now announcing are coming they want to separate us they want
[15:00.380 --> 15:04.820]  to cult member us they want to totally run our lives and that was two ridiculous things
[15:04.820 --> 15:11.940]  ahead of forced inoculations you wear a mask you're going to accept a forced inoculation
[15:11.940 --> 15:15.260]  you're going to accept the tracking systems on your phone that are already there this
[15:15.260 --> 15:20.820]  is their rollout and they admit it this is a criminal premeditated takeover tested in
[15:20.820 --> 15:26.580]  China all of it brought here and now they're telling you you can't have before the July
[15:26.580 --> 15:32.460]  now they're telling you how much you suck now they're telling you how bad America is
[15:32.460 --> 15:39.700]  and they found absolutely massive numbers of little pathetic quizzling jellyfish that
[15:39.700 --> 15:46.740]  are going to work with the end and big guess what India and Australia and 98 other countries
[15:46.740 --> 15:51.500]  have woken up China and basically declared war on them America hasn't done it yet so
[15:51.500 --> 15:57.180]  guess what we're winning even if Americans won't stand up other people are the 4th of
[15:57.180 --> 16:05.300]  July 2020 we are here and despite all the globalist attacks you the viewers and listeners of this

[17:42.620 --> 17:47.300]  preparation for it and tackle it and take it head on but let me just tell the minions
[17:47.300 --> 17:49.740]  of the new world order that are kind of in the management class but really think they're
[17:49.740 --> 17:54.820]  going to win you've already lost and everything you're doing is a rear guard action and you
[17:54.820 --> 18:01.020]  that have served the evil are going to be hung out to dry now understand spiritually
[18:01.020 --> 18:06.100]  you hate God and you hate freedom so you joined evil because you like it but I just want you
[18:06.100 --> 18:13.460]  and you're useful idiot followers to know you've already lost the entire world is waking
[18:13.460 --> 18:19.060]  up to the fact that China treats people like worse than garbage and that China is the most
[18:19.060 --> 18:25.900]  evil country with the most evil regime the planets ever seen by light years I mean it
[18:25.900 --> 18:32.220]  it makes Hitler and Stalin and linen look like amateurs okay over a hundred million
[18:32.220 --> 18:38.540]  of their own people killed experimentation genetic engineering no Hollywood movie could
[18:38.540 --> 18:50.700]  even imagine it it is absolutely godless complete evil and their tentacles are in everything
[18:50.700 --> 18:59.220]  total globalist funding the globalist set them up so it's mega banks the Hollywood trash
[18:59.220 --> 19:04.140]  allied with the radical Muslims who then deploy Islam against Europe but do not allow any
[19:04.140 --> 19:12.900]  Muslims in China Muslims live in death camps by the way you teach homosexuality in school
[19:12.900 --> 19:18.420]  they execute you in China because they've already captured China the globalist have is
[19:18.420 --> 19:22.300]  an engine they want it healthy and big and evil and powerful they don't have any of that
[19:22.300 --> 19:26.020]  drag queen story time they don't have any of that they catch you pedophilia they kill
[19:26.020 --> 19:31.260]  your ass because people are robots that are meant to carry out the takeover of the planet
[19:31.260 --> 19:36.340]  they don't want malfunctioning robots their social credit scores are to work 18 hours
[19:36.340 --> 19:41.260]  a day and do as you're told our social credit score is to teach your five-year-old to suck
[19:41.260 --> 19:45.380]  cock and I'm sorry to use French like that but that's what you're teaching your five-year-olds
[19:45.380 --> 19:54.260]  right now everything China finances through Hollywood that they almost completely own
[19:54.260 --> 20:00.300]  now on record is race war sexualization of children everything immoral everything that
[20:00.300 --> 20:10.860]  destroys traditionalism war on Christianity because over there they blow up churches
[20:10.860 --> 20:14.900]  almost every movie you watch is funded by the Chinese government even says it in the
[20:14.900 --> 20:24.820]  credits I've seen five films the last few years about
[20:24.820 --> 20:30.060]  NASA in the future and NASA and all five films can't get a rocket to Mars or the moon so
[20:30.060 --> 20:35.100]  China gives us the rocket when they stole our rocket technology and can't even get their
[20:35.100 --> 20:42.540]  ICBMs to work and again that's just an example of every movie China has missiles we don't
[20:42.540 --> 20:46.720]  we had to go to the Russians for their heavy lifters because they destroyed the Saturn
[20:46.720 --> 20:53.580]  rocket designs that were superior to the Russians now we have the Falcon heavy that's better
[20:53.580 --> 20:59.740]  than any of them the point is is that they're undermining us they're demoralizing us and
[20:59.740 --> 21:06.220]  that's just one example that in five movies I had to hear how China teaches us how to
[21:06.220 --> 21:14.380]  have running water and wipe our asses it's disgusting and you know I didn't know how
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.900]  to start the show today I was gonna come in here and try to be calm coming up I'm gonna
[21:17.900 --> 21:28.620]  get to this I saw three videos yesterday in Illinois New York and Utah and now it's
[21:28.620 --> 21:35.340]  so commonplace I even forgot to send the clips of the crew we'll see if they can find them
[21:35.340 --> 21:40.580]  of people driving down roads and just 50 people run out and start jumping in front of your
[21:40.580 --> 21:45.700]  car and then they start shooting into your car and people died now and people are in
[21:45.700 --> 21:52.380]  comas now and it doesn't even make national news and you know what it is if you're a
[21:52.380 --> 21:57.860]  white man driving a big truck that's what they said on reddit and everywhere you go
[21:57.860 --> 22:03.980]  after go read it that's why yesterday morning I'm in a red light and I hear the guy's got
[22:03.980 --> 22:10.500]  his window down and I look over and he's a Hispanic guy with two white women describing
[22:10.500 --> 22:15.060]  who's in the car two middle-aged Karen's and one lady in the back's flipping me off he's
[22:15.060 --> 22:18.980]  flipping me off and I go do you know who I am do you hate me he goes no I was asking
[22:18.980 --> 22:24.180]  about would you hate these amount of shows he goes no get your effing mask on and I went
[22:24.180 --> 22:28.980]  COVID-19's a hoax it's come out with their count counting all the regular deaths you
[22:28.980 --> 22:33.940]  in there by the e-rolls this window up and the woman driving panics and puts it in reverse
[22:33.940 --> 22:38.860]  and backs it into the car behind her so the light turns green I drive off and there's
[22:38.860 --> 22:45.700]  a still back there acting like complete maniacs 30 seconds later when I get on the highway
[22:45.700 --> 22:52.660]  there's just crazy people but I was a white guy in a big truck I'm lucky he didn't shoot
[22:52.660 --> 22:58.420]  me in the head but it's mainly weird white crazy people that are out there to show everybody
[22:58.420 --> 23:02.900]  how good they are and then they're shooting up white people's cars imagine you're driving
[23:02.900 --> 23:08.900]  on the road 20 miles an hour this latest footage in Utah is amazing and just all of a sudden
[23:08.900 --> 23:19.700]  50 people just run out in front of you and start shooting at you largely peaceful protests
[23:19.700 --> 23:25.580]  so this is the premeditated total assault on reality total assault on our country and
[23:25.580 --> 23:31.980]  this this is modern warfare and we have to stop bowing to the left we have to stop groveling
[23:31.980 --> 23:36.580]  to them because here's the deal if you go look at the numbers and the statistics of
[23:36.580 --> 23:43.220]  even Obama's YouTube channel or Eric Swalwell's YouTube channel no one visits them now no one
[23:43.220 --> 23:51.580]  likes them no one reads their books everyone is sick of them that's why they're trying
[23:51.580 --> 23:55.020]  to shut the economy down that's why they're power grabbing now that's why they're doing
[23:55.020 --> 23:59.140]  all this now because they know they've lost and so they're just hoping to get all their
[23:59.140 --> 24:09.380]  minions to go crazy and terrorize everyone into capitulating here's the most important
[24:09.380 --> 24:15.660]  point they've got all the big corporations up there no matter how ridiculous the demands
[24:15.660 --> 24:20.560]  are doing it because they're the ones running it and that's why you get Republican senators
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.180]  that go oh I agree we need to defund the police and we need we need Black Lives Matter is
[24:25.180 --> 24:31.900]  good when it's a communist organization run by Planned Parenthood to literally target
[24:31.900 --> 24:36.380]  black people it's it's keep your friends close enemies closer and all these people think
[24:36.380 --> 24:40.660]  if you capitulate and fall down before the big corporations and fall down before the
[24:40.660 --> 24:44.780]  left and just do whatever they say that you'll be liked or you'll be taken care of and it's
[24:44.780 --> 24:52.420]  the opposite all this groveling and all this bowing down to these people has gotten us
[24:52.420 --> 24:58.060]  here now where I have a stack of articles we're going to go over you see it all to the news
[24:58.060 --> 25:03.420]  where they're canceled for this July in Austin canceled for this July in Chicago canceled
[25:03.420 --> 25:07.660]  it in California Governor Newsom says if you're out of the beach you're being arrested Miami
[25:07.660 --> 25:13.580]  you're out of the beach there's no fireworks well guess what I just had my assistant go
[25:13.580 --> 25:19.500]  out and buy $500 worth $500 worth maybe I'm gonna go buy $1000 worth hell I don't use
[25:19.500 --> 25:22.900]  even shoot them off the city I go out in the county I'm gonna shoot them off the city go
[25:22.900 --> 25:29.260]  to hell I might go downtown and shoot some off because it's a symbol of these leftists
[25:29.260 --> 25:35.260]  trying to dominate us and they can piss up a rope I'm sick of their crap I've got American
[25:35.260 --> 25:40.980]  flags all over everything now because they don't like it unbelievable here's the good
[25:40.980 --> 25:45.140]  news though the world's waking up to him the world's standing up to the chai comms the
[25:45.140 --> 25:49.980]  globalist and so even if America's soft and weak and wants to take it up the ass the rest
[25:49.980 --> 25:53.540]  of the world doesn't want to take chai con globalism so we're gonna make it through this
[25:53.540 --> 25:59.620]  one way or the other sisters are saying what I was privately saying the crew last night
[25:59.620 --> 26:03.940]  we may have just broken not just the biggest story in info wars history one of the biggest
[26:03.940 --> 26:12.100]  stories period the state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created a system
[26:12.100 --> 26:18.060]  where anyone that has the sore throat or a runny nose or who has been in contact with
[26:18.060 --> 26:24.220]  someone COVID-19 is then added into the database as having a case that is counted as a case
[26:24.220 --> 26:29.100]  of COVID-19 it's in the NIH documents it's at the state level we confirm it in Texas
[26:29.100 --> 26:34.180]  we're not confirming it's in other states this is beyond the other smoking guns of them
[26:34.180 --> 26:38.500]  putting people with a die gun shot wounds and stuff in the COVID column and the false
[26:38.500 --> 26:45.420]  positive test that's all huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got

[29:15.660 --> 29:40.420]  from Azeroth he came with red tag band to bring a revolution some would make him change others
[29:40.420 --> 29:54.580]  he rose again wise men follow him wise men follow him we already had our revolution against
[29:54.580 --> 30:01.620]  satan we've already won this is all a failed counter revolution by satan and his pathetic
[30:01.620 --> 30:15.620]  slaves without the renegades lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes renegades

[30:24.980 --> 30:39.100]  another part of the song listen to this another rag tag band they had skills they had leadership
[30:39.100 --> 30:50.420]  they weren't zombies in a bloody war for liberty for their descendants almost run that gas tank
[30:50.420 --> 30:57.100]  cap what they did they beat the king of england they beat the old slave masters were they
[30:57.100 --> 31:02.260]  themselves what they just beaten yes but they recognized it and turned the tide against
[31:02.260 --> 31:11.300]  it china has slaves right now and they finance all day telling us how we suck when it's the
[31:11.300 --> 31:19.180]  west that turned the tide when it was christianity that freed the world and now the satanists
[31:19.180 --> 31:25.020]  and their armies are launching their attack against our republic when it comes to heroes
[31:25.020 --> 31:30.420]  americans are mine have we been fallen have we been decadent with our great wealth have
[31:30.420 --> 31:36.300]  we betrayed the birthright we were given yes like the prodigal son we're coming back and
[31:36.300 --> 31:42.980]  it's the idea of that flag forge the beginning of the war designed at the literal hands of
[31:42.980 --> 31:52.260]  george washington they are now attacking because it's powerful and they know it where are the
[31:52.260 --> 32:01.140]  renegades in the world today we're gonna rediscover america stronger than ever we're gonna face
[32:01.140 --> 32:07.340]  the ai wars and billions are gonna die in the future but in the end christ wins and america's
[32:07.340 --> 32:20.900]  destiny is strong far ahead of their time without the renegades lord knows where we'd be when
[32:20.900 --> 32:30.220]  it comes to heroes renegades are mine not the hollywood trash not the globlest renegades
[32:30.220 --> 32:35.460]  they come in every shape color and size we all got red blood they all got a spirit that
[32:35.460 --> 32:42.380]  loves god we are the renegades we are not the establishment all the banks all the big corporations
[32:42.380 --> 32:48.540]  all the big powerful corrupt authoritarian regimes waging war on america right now and
[32:48.540 --> 32:56.700]  our president and our families a corporate woke mob of tyrants that think we're weak
[32:56.700 --> 33:00.980]  and use the fact that we want to open society against us to tell us we should bow to them
[33:00.980 --> 33:06.340]  because we're bad this isn't the fourth of july where they cancel the fourth of july
[33:06.340 --> 33:13.060]  this isn't the 2020 portal in which the new lord wins this is the time where they have
[33:13.060 --> 33:19.020]  laid the seeds of their final undoing and destruction bill gates isn't winning he's
[33:19.020 --> 33:25.620]  losing he's universally reviled now and known as a eugenicist bio weapons operator fouchy
[33:25.620 --> 33:33.820]  all of them and all over the world suddenly the whole globalist chai kong future is unraveled
[33:33.820 --> 33:38.780]  completely and they're turning against them and so china has tried to exert control over
[33:38.780 --> 33:42.660]  the indians they tried to exert control of the ossees and countless others the over the
[33:42.660 --> 33:50.940]  vietnamese and there has been an explosive resistance so yeah do we over do the american
[33:50.940 --> 33:56.220]  flag and pride in it well i used to think so and bad things have been done in its image
[33:56.220 --> 34:05.700]  of course what it symbolizes our republic and the blue sky of god's heavens and the
[34:05.700 --> 34:10.100]  blood of those that fought and died for the nation and the white for the bandages that
[34:10.100 --> 34:18.260]  sealed the wounds forged in blood purified by god staring into the heavens of the future
[34:18.260 --> 34:26.900]  and the space force space faring people the vision a pro human future not an anti human
[34:26.900 --> 34:33.340]  future so when you realize they want to take it and they want to replace it with something
[34:33.340 --> 34:41.380]  pure evil designed to enslave that doesn't believe in humanity and it is the paradox
[34:41.380 --> 34:45.540]  with great wealth and great freedom comes great corruption and that's the paradox one
[34:45.540 --> 34:52.020]  element but what it's being replaced with is a trillion times worse so lee greenwald
[34:52.020 --> 34:57.580]  of course has this famous song about proud to be an american and the left demonizes it
[34:57.580 --> 35:03.620]  and they hate it and it can come off as cheesy until you realize that it's a song about unification
[35:03.620 --> 35:09.460]  and freedom and that what we have is so good and so inspired by god when compared to the
[35:09.460 --> 35:15.980]  communist chinese which is purely inspired by satan and so with this fourth of july coming
[35:15.980 --> 35:19.580]  up i know i don't believe that if we take action and speak up and are strong this will
[35:19.580 --> 35:25.060]  be the end of the new world order in the future but these victories in these battles now will
[35:25.060 --> 35:29.420]  cascade and chain reaction into the future and destroy the new world order and instead
[35:29.420 --> 35:35.340]  of us being demoralized this is where we rediscover who we are and why we're under attack so here
[35:35.340 --> 35:39.580]  is proud to be an american with this one that you like coming up in the face of the chai
[35:39.580 --> 35:43.060]  comms and the enemies and the globalist and those that want to break our will you've not
[35:43.060 --> 36:11.380]  broken our will you've only awakened us because there ain't no doubt i love this
[36:11.380 --> 36:31.540]  land and i'm proud to be an american where at least i know i'm free and i won't forget
[36:31.540 --> 36:42.020]  the men who died who gave their fight to me and i gladly stand up next to you and defend
[36:42.020 --> 37:00.020]  her still today because there ain't no doubt i love this land god bless the usa
[37:00.020 --> 37:03.340]  when we come back i'm going to play the full song because it's all about unification here
[37:03.340 --> 37:08.180]  but i just had time to play that shorter clip there please remember the enemy wants to shut
[37:08.180 --> 37:11.260]  us down all i want to do is stay in this fight so we bring you great products that your family
[37:11.260 --> 37:14.700]  already need and with all the uncertainty and all the insanity going on on this planet

[37:18.260 --> 37:24.540]  in high quality containers that's very easily easy to hide very easy to move is essential

[37:48.900 --> 37:54.780]  they take the orders it gets out to you and it funds our operation but it's something
[37:54.780 --> 37:59.340]  you really need and before all the craziness the future comes it's just going to get crazier
[37:59.340 --> 38:02.220]  but that's okay it's going to test us and we're going to wake up and people that have
[38:02.220 --> 38:06.700]  been sloth like and following globalism we're going to realize that it's betrayed them but
[38:06.700 --> 38:15.980]  crazy times are coming insane times are what we face right now and swareable food is something
[38:15.980 --> 38:19.260]  you should check off the box if you don't have firearms don't have ammo don't know how

[43:22.780 --> 43:29.180]  took it in one dose at one time remember that the left hollywood's owned by the chi comms remember
[43:30.220 --> 43:37.180]  that they are the mortal enemies of you and your future and that all these useful idiot morons
[43:37.180 --> 43:44.540]  that go along with it aren't even getting power from it they are complete idiots i want to free
[43:44.540 --> 43:53.100]  the communist chinese population they're good people but the globalists have set them up to
[43:53.100 --> 43:58.140]  bring us down and it's not going the way they want it so don't just think it's all up to trump
[43:58.140 --> 44:06.540]  are all up to us i'm seeing spectacular global alignment against china even the eu now knows
[44:06.540 --> 44:11.020]  which way the wind's blowing and is now going against china because china is authoritarian
[44:11.020 --> 44:15.660]  they break all their deals it's completely out of control even soros has been heavily involved
[44:15.660 --> 44:20.300]  with them is now betting against him because he knows that's why all these billionaires that are
[44:20.300 --> 44:25.980]  globalists are been buying armored redoubts and emergency you know secret runways and all the
[44:25.980 --> 44:31.420]  rest of it and they're already in their bunkers now i told you that years ago now it's confirmed
[44:31.980 --> 44:37.660]  because they're losing someone all the losers that work for the chi comms and the globalists
[44:37.660 --> 44:41.900]  and the big banks to know something you may be trying to maneuver us into debt and bankruptcy
[44:41.900 --> 44:44.860]  and saying the dollar is going to die and you're going to break up the family and you're going to
[44:44.860 --> 44:48.940]  overthrow all the police departments you've given us a good run for our money but in the end you're
[44:48.940 --> 44:54.060]  going to lose i was watching harrison smith yesterday afternoon in my office when he was
[44:54.060 --> 44:57.020]  filling in for elin shroyer who took some time off on his birthday to go see his family in st
[44:57.020 --> 45:05.020]  louis and uh they had jim hoft on from the gateway pundit he was there and they have statues of catholic
[45:05.020 --> 45:12.940]  saints that are just old so st louis there's a statue of st louis they want to pull the
[45:12.940 --> 45:19.100]  st louis down the statue of the st st louis and there's video of just beating up old catholic
[45:19.100 --> 45:29.820]  people and the media is all there and cover it up and harrison made the point that as soon as he
[45:29.820 --> 45:33.980]  saw that couple a few days ago in st louis who it turns out at bottom museum home that was all
[45:33.980 --> 45:37.820]  the lappotage you basically get them for free if you agree with historical societies to fix them all
[45:37.820 --> 45:45.020]  up that couple's mainly democrat they confirmed their curls but they see 500 people break down
[45:45.020 --> 45:49.260]  their gate come into their private yard i mean anybody who have the brain knows they burn stuff
[45:49.260 --> 45:57.740]  down in st louis you get your gun but the media is like white people on their porch on a public
[45:57.740 --> 46:05.260]  street wasn't a public street it's a museum home and then now the videos are out of them
[46:05.260 --> 46:08.700]  threatening to kill him when he first came out said hey what are you doing i'm gonna kill you
[46:08.700 --> 46:13.100]  so then he runs in and gets his gun but the media still says look at white supremacist here
[46:13.100 --> 46:25.660]  he's a democrat lawyer so there you go ladies and gentlemen that's where this is that's the
[46:25.660 --> 46:30.140]  level of deception that's also in st louis and so it's harrison was talking about this and i
[46:30.140 --> 46:36.300]  thought the same thing the the day before but never said it on air the minute he saw that
[46:36.300 --> 46:41.420]  happened and he saw the district attorney in st louis say we're going to prosecute these
[46:41.420 --> 46:47.900]  evil white people this is racism he went let me google her name turns out she was 90 funded by
[46:47.900 --> 46:56.700]  george soros and only takes 23 of prosecutions that police refer and that then it's all
[46:57.900 --> 47:03.180]  white on black crime she will not prosecute a black person who commits a crime against anybody
[47:03.180 --> 47:09.020]  a black person a white person that's communism and he's gotten 500 plus district attorneys
[47:09.020 --> 47:13.820]  and county attorneys elected the last two years bloomberg's doing it too and it's a criminal take
[47:13.820 --> 47:19.900]  on and it's a revolution then when you go hey attack the whites we're not going to prosecute you
[47:19.900 --> 47:26.620]  what the hell is this and now they're at democrat lawyers house is trying to burn it down saying
[47:26.620 --> 47:34.780]  we're going to kill you and your wife so he runs in and gets a gun and they're going to prosecute
[47:34.780 --> 47:44.140]  this guy so think about where we are ladies and gentlemen because major universities are now saying
[47:45.100 --> 47:52.300]  you must accept black lives matter sign a pledge and go to training reeducation training if you're
[47:52.300 --> 47:57.820]  white to go to the school this is cult absolute cult we're gonna live in bubbles we're gonna take
[47:57.820 --> 48:02.940]  force inoculations they're just getting you used to total freakishness because that's what this is
[48:02.940 --> 48:09.980]  folks and it's all financed by the chinese communists who are the most racist people the planet ever
[48:09.980 --> 48:21.660]  saw and who have three million people in death camps so let that sink into your brain real good
[48:23.980 --> 48:28.140]  you don't do what you're told over there you're dead we got a bunch of spoiled rotten brats
[48:28.140 --> 48:33.500]  running around here thinking that you know pissing on america's cool because the media told them
[48:33.500 --> 48:40.140]  when the media is far and owned they have a name for it it's called suckers smucks useful idiots
[48:40.140 --> 48:53.340]  morons quizlings dumbasses they're fools but they've been taught that's how you get ahead
[48:53.340 --> 48:57.340]  and katie bar the door they ever get control of police like they've done in cities like st
[48:57.340 --> 49:02.780]  louis they don't have to call the police but they got control the prosecutor and it's open season
[49:02.780 --> 49:07.340]  to kill cops you name it and that's meant to run the good cops off so they put their politicos in
[49:07.340 --> 49:13.180]  and that's where this is going thank god we got a second amendment thank god we've been preparing
[49:13.180 --> 49:17.900]  for decades to repulse this because we're gonna win but it's gonna be rough remember they're telling
[49:17.900 --> 49:21.980]  you can't have four that you lie well here's proud to be an american because it's like nails
[49:21.980 --> 49:35.100]  and chalkboard to the left here it is
[49:35.100 --> 49:45.500]  if tomorrow all the things were gone i'd work for all my life and i had to start again with just
[49:45.500 --> 49:56.540]  my children and my wife i thank my lucky stars to be living here today because the flag still
[49:56.540 --> 50:09.900]  stands for freedom and they can't take that away and i'm proud to be an american where at least
[50:09.900 --> 50:20.620]  i know i'm free and i won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me and i gladly stand
[50:20.620 --> 50:32.620]  up next to you and defend her still today because there ain't no doubt i love this land god bless
[50:32.620 --> 50:44.060]  the usa
[50:46.780 --> 50:55.900]  from the lakes of minnesota to the hills of tennessee across the plains of texas
[50:55.900 --> 51:06.220]  from sea to shining sea from detroit down to houston and new york to la
[51:07.020 --> 51:13.340]  well there's pride in every american heart and it's time we stand and say
[51:13.340 --> 51:25.820]  that i'm proud to be an american where at least i know i'm free and i won't forget
[51:25.820 --> 51:35.420]  the men who died who gave that right to me and i gladly stand up next to you and defend her
[51:35.420 --> 51:51.340]  still today because there ain't no doubt i love this land god bless the usa
[51:51.340 --> 52:02.300]  and i'm proud to be an american where at least i know i'm free and i won't forget the men who died
[52:02.300 --> 52:12.540]  who gave that right to me and i gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
[52:13.660 --> 52:25.580]  because there ain't no doubt i love this land god bless the usa
[52:25.580 --> 52:32.140]  the americans got its problems but the american system is the opposite of the globalist anti god
[52:32.140 --> 52:36.860]  anti human system and if they're able to remove the american system there's nothing to compete
[52:36.860 --> 52:42.220]  against evil it's going to take over and so think about that long and hard think about the
[52:42.220 --> 52:47.820]  communist chinese and what they're doing what they've done to their people now they've organized
[52:47.820 --> 52:52.460]  total enslavement total conformity the opposite of freedom and we're being told by the washington
[52:52.460 --> 53:01.340]  post of new york times that they quote hope china can crush trump to save america they have just put
[53:01.340 --> 53:07.500]  trees and out in the open like it's cute like it's funny and i can tell you we're in a lot greater
[53:07.500 --> 53:12.460]  peril than we were in world war two against hitler hitler was manipulated by british intelligence
[53:12.460 --> 53:16.380]  he could have been taken out pretty much anytime they wanted to it was very sophisticated he was a
[53:16.380 --> 53:22.140]  bad dude but ggp the globalist aren't in control of communist china like they were in control of
[53:22.140 --> 53:28.140]  hitler that's much more sophisticated and they've double crossed everybody and now the war is on
[53:28.140 --> 53:32.780]  and all these fools aren't siding with the republic they have no idea how much danger they're in
[53:33.580 --> 53:38.860]  our number two is straight ahead if you believe in the future you don't want to be a slave tell

[54:51.020 --> 54:57.020]  article by kellen mcbreen the father of a 19-year-old boy who was shot and killed in
[54:57.020 --> 55:03.420]  seattle's chop last week is speaking out against the lawless no-cop zone at about three o'clock
[55:03.420 --> 55:09.340]  this monday morning shots were fired at a jeep cherokee killing a 16-year-old male badly injuring
[55:09.340 --> 55:15.260]  a 14-year-old two other teens have been shot this week and many citizens are saying it's time to
[55:15.260 --> 55:23.020]  shut down the experimental occupied area horris lorenzo anderson spoke with k i ro seattle
[55:23.020 --> 55:27.820]  in an emotional interview following his son's death i ain't been sleeping you see my eyes i've
[55:27.820 --> 55:33.100]  been crying i'm trying not to cry on tv this doesn't look like a protest to me no more that looks
[55:33.100 --> 55:37.660]  like they just took over and said we can take over whenever we want to anderson also said the
[55:37.660 --> 55:43.900]  national guard should be deployed to break up the violent autonomous zone i'm millie weaver reporting
[55:47.900 --> 56:01.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:01.900 --> 56:14.140]  how many times
[56:24.300 --> 56:29.180]  you know this morning i got up at about 4 30 a.m and i i went down and had some coffee and i
[56:29.180 --> 56:35.500]  prayed soundly for about 30 minutes i just asked god i said please just take the weight off i'll
[56:35.500 --> 56:39.340]  fight this is hard but just i'm constantly mad at myself we're not doing enough thinking the
[56:39.340 --> 56:50.620]  enemy's winning and then i went for a hike and really felt god's presence as strong as i've ever
[56:50.620 --> 56:57.900]  felt it incredible determination and and in that mind space my brain worked so much better i was i
[56:57.900 --> 57:03.820]  had peace and i was strong i wasn't getting angry i wasn't getting nauseated with disgust to the
[57:03.820 --> 57:07.820]  globalist my brain wasn't racing it was clear by the time i got on here and read a bunch of
[57:07.820 --> 57:11.820]  articles and had stress and stuff i lost a lot of that but that's okay it's why we're not god we're
[57:11.820 --> 57:15.820]  not perfect we've got to like try to get back to that quiet place the most high king david talked
[57:15.820 --> 57:20.780]  about and i just really want to impress by everybody today but the biggest thing you can do
[57:22.780 --> 57:26.620]  is just turn it over to god and that doesn't mean like these fake churches go oh praise god we're
[57:26.620 --> 57:32.060]  all getting microchips that means jesus is coming back doesn't have to worry about you need to go
[57:32.060 --> 57:37.180]  out and fight the tyrants but you cannot sit there and beat your brains out thinking that you've
[57:37.180 --> 57:40.940]  got to have the strength to do it you ask god for the strength and all of a sudden you'll have the
[57:40.940 --> 57:44.940]  strength but god does act through us and i know the listeners know that understand it my biggest
[57:44.940 --> 57:51.820]  problem really is the fact that i know why people tune out of this stuff because you're either totally
[57:51.820 --> 57:56.140]  obsessed with it or i want to just never look at it again here's the deal though they're not letting
[57:56.140 --> 57:59.180]  you leave your house they're not letting you take a mask off they're trying to put you in pods they
[57:59.180 --> 58:04.860]  want to come teach your kids all this evil perverted pedophile crap they're not gonna leave you alone
[58:04.860 --> 58:14.540]  okay and instead of fantasizing about bashing people's brains in let's just take focused measured
[58:15.900 --> 58:20.460]  godly action against them and and look i'm the first person to be a hypocrite
[58:20.460 --> 58:26.700]  because i don't control what i say i tried to when i talk about what they teach our children in
[58:26.700 --> 58:30.940]  school i shouldn't even have said that on air but there's the paradox that that's what they teach
[58:30.940 --> 58:36.460]  our children so if you're pissed at what i said on air i'm pissed at me too how did you used to be
[58:36.460 --> 58:48.300]  like that i'm telling you what they teach kids and so if adult radio shows shouldn't say something
[58:48.300 --> 58:53.340]  why the hell should five-year-olds be taught that we have two extremely important reports coming up
[58:53.340 --> 58:59.500]  next segment darryl mcgreen is a great researcher and video editor and he always knocks it out of the
[58:59.500 --> 59:05.020]  park but this is really a disgusting grand slam and he could have made it longer but but he made it
[59:05.020 --> 59:09.660]  four minutes long so it could fit during the ad breaks but we're going to air it to the full radio
[59:09.660 --> 59:13.980]  and tv audience because law stations don't don't don't care the video feed and it's got a really
[59:13.980 --> 59:19.420]  nice headline it's on the front page of bandot video needs to get out to people black lives matter
[59:19.420 --> 59:26.540]  exposes white privilege and of course it's really the opposite and it ties into all the shootings
[59:26.540 --> 59:30.540]  now where people just run out and try to stop your car and then shoot you in the head and then
[59:30.540 --> 59:36.380]  it's not even a news item because whether it was george floyd dying wrongly or an old black guy dying
[59:36.380 --> 59:41.740]  or an old white guy or whoever it's still all wrong but the media cherry picks and and they
[59:41.740 --> 59:46.220]  really are the enemy of the people because they're owned by foreign banks and and authoritarian
[59:46.220 --> 59:52.140]  governments so of course they're they're cold-blooded and they operate and attack this country with
[59:52.140 --> 59:58.300]  impunity show it's had 120 something thousand views which is great for independent video
[59:58.300 --> 1:00:03.100]  site but man does it need a couple million so it's the other big report that's up on the site
[1:00:04.060 --> 1:00:09.900]  where said texas confirms the feds are inflating covet 19 numbers at least 16 times what they are
[1:00:09.900 --> 1:00:15.260]  are and then i got some articles by listeners where it's admitted it's actually in news articles
[1:00:15.260 --> 1:00:22.300]  oh by the way they're counting probable cases and then you look at probable they call it covet if
[1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:27.500]  someone has a runny nose without a test and then without even testing people or even having runny
[1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:33.020]  noses 15 or at it that's 16 i mean and they're just like yeah it's a fraud we're gonna do it and
[1:00:33.020 --> 1:00:39.100]  that's the way it is the only way we lose is getting used to this tyranny and just accepting it
[1:00:39.100 --> 1:00:42.940]  that's what i'm trying to overwhelm us right now don't get used to it don't adapt by submitting
[1:00:43.500 --> 1:00:48.380]  overcoming and shout it out and go to your county commissary city council in your state houses and
[1:00:48.380 --> 1:00:54.380]  call congress and just the letters of the editor just expose the fraud listeners are saying what i
[1:00:54.380 --> 1:00:59.900]  was privately saying the crew last night we may have just broken not just the biggest story in
[1:00:59.900 --> 1:01:06.780]  info wars history but one of the biggest stories period the state of texas confirms that the cdc
[1:01:06.780 --> 1:01:15.180]  and nih have created a system where anyone that has the sore throat or a runny nose or who has been
[1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:21.500]  in contact with someone covet 19 is then added into the database as having a case that is counted
[1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:27.020]  as a case of covet 19 it's in the NIH documents it's at the state level with confirming texas we're
[1:01:27.020 --> 1:01:32.460]  now confirming it's in other states this is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people
[1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:37.500]  that died got shot wounds and stuff in the covet column and the false positive test that's all
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:44.940]  huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got these ever county commission videos
[1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:49.420]  where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the world is this the full video is posted
[1:01:49.420 --> 1:02:01.820]  at band on video get it out expose the hoax waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you
[1:02:01.820 --> 1:02:15.100]  live from the front lines of the info war i have a dream today little black boys and black girls
[1:02:15.100 --> 1:02:20.620]  will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers i have a
[1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:33.420]  dream today
[1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:46.220]  they're beating her up
[1:02:46.220 --> 1:02:55.020]  why don't we
[1:02:55.580 --> 1:03:05.020]  we all know that people are the same wherever you go there is goodbye
[1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:17.820]  you learn to live you learn to give each other what we need to survive
[1:03:17.820 --> 1:03:30.620]  together
[1:03:35.660 --> 1:03:41.100]  foreign governments oh look at that terrible this is a tempted murder
[1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:46.940]  are openly financing and greenlighting attacks on white people because they're white
[1:03:47.660 --> 1:03:52.300]  academics at harvard yale the new york times they're all saying whiteness is inherently
[1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:59.820]  evil and whites are bad because the color of their skin absolute total inversion of reality
[1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:06.220]  this is gang warfare and just like you had crips and bloods killing each other over red or blue
[1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:11.900]  well this is saying kill each other over white or black and they're just hoping more people get
[1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:23.020]  shot and killed it's a questionable circumstance so that the real race war kicks off
[1:04:23.020 --> 1:04:32.860]  we can have hours and hours of black people
[1:04:38.780 --> 1:04:42.860]  and then a white person fights back in real national news saying it's wrong this is truly
[1:04:42.860 --> 1:04:52.060]  evil they know exactly what they're doing and it's very bad for not just white people but black
[1:04:52.060 --> 1:05:07.100]  people as well because most black people are not like this by the way newspaper reporters that
[1:05:07.100 --> 1:05:13.180]  report that it's ten to one black online crime that's a fact get fired same thing in europe you
[1:05:13.180 --> 1:05:22.940]  talk about muslim crime toilet he's also seen being kicked choked cut and cursed all of it streamed
[1:05:22.940 --> 1:05:31.740]  live on facebook so you had nothing to do with slavery that's still going on in africa because
[1:05:31.740 --> 1:05:48.780]  you're white you get beat up you kill one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by
[1:05:48.780 --> 1:05:53.980]  the color of our skin but by the content of that character i have a dream today
[1:05:53.980 --> 1:06:03.420]  and now the average liberal leftist conservative doesn't want to be called racist so they sign
[1:06:03.420 --> 1:06:08.380]  on to the opposite of what martin Luther king talked about and the whole christian system
[1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:15.020]  so whites are under attack and it's intended to make whites become racial and begin going to the
[1:06:15.020 --> 1:06:20.700]  racial group at one level other whites will then join and do whatever they're told and
[1:06:20.700 --> 1:06:26.060]  flagellate themselves with bull lips they'll go to reeducation centers they will give money to random
[1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:30.620]  black people because they're bad and that's just giving them this lie this idea that because some
[1:06:30.620 --> 1:06:36.380]  white people sometime in history did something wrong to somebody else that now you're all guilty
[1:06:36.940 --> 1:06:41.660]  because your grandpa robbed a bank you're going to jail because your mother didn't pay her taxes
[1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:48.300]  you're gonna lose your house what does that even mean and crazy brainwashed black people going out
[1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:53.100]  and having whites bow down to them yeah back this up let's play the audio with us and there's hours
[1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:59.340]  of this folks this is not isolate stuff so now the first thing you got to do to show your deed

[1:09:13.660 --> 1:09:19.980]  back that up again he stops and the guy right there starts shooting at him so he drives off
[1:09:19.980 --> 1:09:24.620]  that's how desperate they are to get another Charlottesville and i said about Charlottesville
[1:09:24.620 --> 1:09:28.700]  they said a bunch of Hillary operatives and liberals and leftists there had the police
[1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:34.300]  kettle the crowds together including media just covering it hoping somebody got hurt and one lady

[1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:14.860]  trouble which is what you're seeing right there is people running out trying to block cars trying
[1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:21.100]  to get somebody run over and in almost every case the media says oh they tried to run over innocent
[1:10:21.100 --> 1:10:26.060]  people just like oh it was a public street and these evil white people the Washington Post said
[1:10:26.060 --> 1:10:30.380]  came out of their house with a gun for no reason because they saw black people
[1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.140]  yeah here's this video they shot this guy in the head
[1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:41.100]  is this the one in Colorado he died by the way another fellow is on live support

[1:10:58.620 --> 1:11:02.460]  another one in Virginia where it's gang warfare at these parks that have been taken over
[1:11:02.460 --> 1:11:06.780]  it turns out it was hispanic on hispanic black on black but the media all said white supremacists
[1:11:06.780 --> 1:11:12.700]  are not just shooting people in the head and the public hears that and believes that i've been on
[1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:17.100]  major hip-hop podcasts and stuff they'll tell me well alex there is an epidemic of whites killing
[1:11:17.100 --> 1:11:22.140]  blacks and i'm like actually that's not true although well that's that racism there alex

[1:15:58.460 --> 1:16:04.460]  they write an article and it says jones showed up his son gave a fake canned speech jones is fake
[1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:10.620]  and he had fake bullet holes in his armored vehicle well two weeks before the vehicle was attacked
[1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:16.780]  by idiots with hammers and the rest of it trying to block us and trying to take the vehicle over
[1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:21.340]  even though inside were a bunch of highly trained you know silver star winners and

[1:17:55.980 --> 1:18:03.020]  well reddit has come out with an article accusing yours truly of faking bullet holes in our armored
[1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:09.180]  vehicle the truth is it was all caught on video it was another giant reddit post and was all over
[1:18:09.180 --> 1:18:14.380]  the internet and made national news a few weeks ago when black lives matter slash antifa brutally
[1:18:14.380 --> 1:18:21.020]  attacked our vehicle with a hammer and with a whole bunch of other objects it's all on video
[1:18:21.020 --> 1:18:27.020]  we're gonna show it to you right now they know that these aren't bullet holes these are hammer
[1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:32.460]  attack points but they put it in a story claiming that i'm a fraud when in truth they are the ones
[1:18:32.460 --> 1:18:35.500]  that are frauds and are actually owned by the communist chinese
[1:18:40.700 --> 1:18:47.580]  what i'm about to break down is a very important case of communist chinese espionage right here
[1:18:47.580 --> 1:18:54.380]  in the united states and it deals with reddit that has been quietly bought out in a series of payments
[1:18:54.380 --> 1:18:59.660]  totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in the last year and a half now the justice department
[1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:05.100]  is looking at reddit i can exclusively tell you and at other media companies that are heavily
[1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:11.420]  invested in or covertly owned by communist china so that's the most important part of the story
[1:19:11.420 --> 1:19:17.500]  i'll get to that in a moment but first let's zoom in to the propaganda at reddit it's banned the
[1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:23.820]  donald's site one of trump's biggest fan sites expanded thousands of other subreddits that were
[1:19:23.820 --> 1:19:29.740]  some of the most popular areas that got our populist president elected and every story now
[1:19:29.740 --> 1:19:35.900]  that is in reddit is tailored by a propagandist to be anti-american and incredibly receptive so
[1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:41.260]  let me just give you one example of what happened to info wars this weekend the post has had hundreds
[1:19:41.260 --> 1:19:45.580]  of thousands of views hundreds and hundreds of posters it links the austrian american statesman
[1:19:45.580 --> 1:19:53.100]  story about how i went down this last sunday and protested the mandatory mass garbage at the state
[1:19:53.100 --> 1:20:00.380]  capital and it says out of the gates jones is a fraud jones is a fake he has fake bullet holes
[1:20:01.100 --> 1:20:07.820]  in the armored glass of his armored truck his son had a canned speech and it's fake and it was all a
[1:20:07.820 --> 1:20:13.500]  photo opt for jones and that's the message they put out alex jones is fake trump is fake america's
[1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:18.860]  fake and if you look at the reddit post about nationalist conservatives populist it's all
[1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:23.900]  demonizing people saying they're frauds saying the president is a fraud and since the chinese
[1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:28.940]  covertly bought reddit a year ago all of these characteristics are there in every story they're
[1:20:28.940 --> 1:20:34.140]  given talking points about how they're supposed to attack loyal americans and it's truly disgusting
[1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:42.060]  when you read the so-called article it is a tissue of lies and fraud that is just a microcosm
[1:20:42.060 --> 1:20:48.220]  Australia has now passed a law to not let communist chinese companies buy up their media and their
[1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:54.140]  industry because they were trying to take control of the country same thing just happened in india
[1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:58.460]  they've now passed laws where the chinese can't come in and buy up their media or other critical
[1:20:58.460 --> 1:21:02.540]  infrastructure and i can tell you the justice department is looking at this right now i told you
[1:21:02.540 --> 1:21:07.820]  a year before it happened that the confucius institutes billions a year funded by the communist
[1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:13.820]  chinese were buying off the university faculty now they've been outlawed and i'm telling you next
[1:21:13.820 --> 1:21:21.660]  reddit could very easily see the fbi raid them and get into their files because the evidence is
[1:21:21.660 --> 1:21:27.180]  already known that communist chinese government itself through a sub company is directing reddit
[1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:32.700]  so this is an example of the espionage against the american people and the propaganda against our
[1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:39.740]  agenda against our nation of the big six hollywood production companies four are totally controlled
[1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:44.140]  and owned by the communist chinese the other two are partially and even subgroups like american
[1:21:44.140 --> 1:21:49.340]  bandstand they tried to buy but trump blocked that so they've bought up thousands of media
[1:21:49.340 --> 1:21:54.380]  companies ladies and gentlemen and they are pushing the race war narrative in this country now a lot
[1:21:54.380 --> 1:22:00.380]  of the people that hosted reddit they're not even paid to do it but they are allowed to promote
[1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:05.500]  their own agenda if they go along with the anti-american agenda and so this is where
[1:22:06.060 --> 1:22:11.100]  they are basically engaging in benedict arnold type activity but we already know the democrats
[1:22:11.100 --> 1:22:16.940]  have openly said no borders no walls no usa at all all right we just finished this report there's
[1:22:16.940 --> 1:22:20.380]  a little more of it i'm gonna get it posted to band dot video i'm not sure the headline i'm gonna
[1:22:20.380 --> 1:22:26.620]  give it yet basically um communist china buys reddit um reportedly under criminal investigation
[1:22:26.620 --> 1:22:31.980]  for espionage but you know reddit caught framing americans for communist chinese i mean it's it's
[1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:35.180]  i'm gonna get it up there at band dot video soon you see the rest of it and hopefully share but
[1:22:35.180 --> 1:22:39.260]  that's just an example no i didn't burn down a homeless camp no i didn't shoot fake bullet holes
[1:22:39.260 --> 1:22:44.860]  in my thing just this is the scum but they're directed by a foreign government remember that
[1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:51.180]  that's who these people are stay with us when i thank the listeners of this broadcast i'm not

[1:25:03.180 --> 1:25:09.660]  brand connecticut and i just want to plug in i'm a truck driver and two before i have changed the
[1:25:09.660 --> 1:25:15.500]  way i drive me and me and my my brothers that drive there's a couple of us we are hispanics
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:23.340]  cubans Puerto Ricans we used to be on monster and and red bull and i have lost weight because i
[1:25:23.340 --> 1:25:27.740]  stopped drinking all that sugar and i just want to thank you for that man well brother we put more
[1:25:27.740 --> 1:25:33.100]  in this than any other long-term high quality energy powder there is so this this was designed
[1:25:33.100 --> 1:25:36.460]  on one of the top guys in the country he didn't want his name on it because obviously the political
[1:25:36.460 --> 1:25:40.220]  issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe
[1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:45.020]  it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life
[1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:47.820]  better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you
[1:25:51.260 --> 1:25:53.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:11.820]  welcome back folks i'm your host alex jones not taking calls today i got a big guest coming up
[1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:16.380]  next hour he's the pastor that you know said we're gonna open our church back up and it
[1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:21.900]  turned out a chain reaction well he's got a book out he's got a lot to say so that's coming up
[1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:28.780]  i want to just hit a whole bunch of news articles here but i i want to talk about something really
[1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:42.300]  important here we're facing a criminal conspiracy and it is the fantasticness of it that gives it
[1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:49.020]  strength and that gives it weakness because you don't cook up conspiracies you don't cook up plots
[1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:59.420]  i know i don't i just straight shoot i don't even look at recipe books i just start grabbing food out
[1:26:59.420 --> 1:27:04.780]  of the refrigerator whatever i want just chopping all up the dinner is great but see with the globalist
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:10.460]  they think everything out because they get off on it that's how criminal brains operate
[1:27:11.260 --> 1:27:16.060]  a lot of highly intelligent people operate that way too but it turns into ocd and is very destructive
[1:27:16.060 --> 1:27:20.940]  so not everybody that thinks stuff out is bad but criminals it's known especially high functioning
[1:27:20.940 --> 1:27:28.620]  ones they they they think get out at least they think they do and so because you're not scheming
[1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:32.620]  up all this stuff and because you're not doing all these horrible things you just keep thinking well
[1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:40.220]  this can't be true well now it's all out in the open when i sit back and i look at how the rockefeller
[1:27:40.220 --> 1:27:46.060]  foundation and the un and bill mullin the gates foundation on record schemed out every angle of
[1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:53.100]  this covet nineteen and the fraud and the forced inoculations but first lock us down for a couple
[1:27:53.100 --> 1:28:01.340]  years of mask and uh on and off again lockdowns i mean they set it all 10 years ago in the rockefeller
[1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:07.020]  lockstep program that got adopted and war game and implemented in november last year and of course
[1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:10.860]  it's not come out the covet nineteen is being found in samples from three years ago not just
[1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:21.980]  last year it's all a giant scam folks but by the time it comes out we've just moved on
[1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:28.860]  because we muddle through things it's a defense mechanism it's fine we can put up a tragedy and
[1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:38.060]  you know dad got eaten by a sabertooth catlet yesterday we got to move on but
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:45.020]  to watch gates now because i could totally predict everything because i wasn't predicting any of
[1:28:46.460 --> 1:28:50.060]  i was reading lockstep and i was reading all their other statements about this for years before
[1:28:50.060 --> 1:28:57.100]  they even pulled it and they said the first event we should just use something and create fear
[1:28:57.100 --> 1:29:01.660]  to make sure during a real lockdown or a real pandemic everyone behaves and then once that's
[1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:06.860]  happened we can move forward with big pandemics they don't even hide they're doing it
[1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:16.860]  because at that level of academics they have to have it all in white papers that are public
[1:29:16.860 --> 1:29:22.940]  because that makes all the minions that are in on it feel confident because it's been publicly
[1:29:22.940 --> 1:29:29.020]  shown to everyone but again the average person's watching monday night football they're not reading
[1:29:29.020 --> 1:29:35.100]  lockstep they're not reading event 201 so that's what's so sick about this and that's what drives me
[1:29:35.100 --> 1:29:42.460]  crazy is i told you six months ago i said they'll claim there's other more deadly mutations later
[1:29:42.460 --> 1:29:47.020]  then they're going to habitualize fear over the common flu they're gonna it's it's it's never
[1:29:47.020 --> 1:29:53.260]  gonna end gates will now say this is event 201 and that event 202 will be much deadlier and then a
[1:29:53.260 --> 1:29:59.900]  month later he came out on tv and said exactly that because when you read the drills they're not
[1:29:59.900 --> 1:30:06.300]  drills they're action plants like in football the new england patriots or the pittsburgh
[1:30:06.300 --> 1:30:11.340]  stealers or the washington redskins i'm doing east coast with the dallas cowboys seattle seahawks
[1:30:11.340 --> 1:30:15.740]  you know they call it drills when they go out and they have a practice they go let's run drills
[1:30:15.740 --> 1:30:18.060]  but the drills are what they're going to run during the game
[1:30:20.620 --> 1:30:24.540]  i'm sitting here reading the damn game plan i got the playbook
[1:30:28.700 --> 1:30:30.220]  and it doesn't mean a damn thing
[1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:36.780]  but i want foul cheating gates and all you guys know something i know you want to depopulate
[1:30:36.780 --> 1:30:41.740]  the earth and you're the saviors all rest that i've done the math and i've looked at it it doesn't
[1:30:41.740 --> 1:30:46.940]  matter if you've dumbed out even 90 percent of people if if one percent know you did this you
[1:30:46.940 --> 1:30:52.860]  won't be safe anywhere so i'm telling you don't release the next stuff stop attacking us stop
[1:30:52.860 --> 1:31:02.620]  pulling this crap you evil scientist man they know how to do it you know i've discovered recently
[1:31:02.620 --> 1:31:10.620]  i'm not even saying on here
[1:31:15.980 --> 1:31:21.260]  folks you have to understand we're not up here trying to be shocking okay this is what's going on
[1:31:22.700 --> 1:31:29.020]  psycho mad scientist want the precedent that already got most countries to put in your body
[1:31:29.020 --> 1:31:33.500]  whatever they want and they're on record saying they want to depopulate you
[1:31:37.740 --> 1:31:43.180]  they want to kill you but they wanted to take a few years so you never knew what hit you
[1:31:44.460 --> 1:31:49.900]  so they fetishize oh anybody fighting back that's the ultimate crime anybody fights back right away
[1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:55.100]  because they don't kill you in fast motion they kill you in slow motion
[1:31:55.100 --> 1:32:00.060]  see slowness is the speed
[1:32:03.900 --> 1:32:09.340]  that's their superhero power imagine a superhero or super villain who's able to
[1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:14.460]  slowly over a year be invisible and stab you five or six times
[1:32:16.620 --> 1:32:22.140]  and you don't know what hit you sure you get sick sure you throw up sure you bleed out your rear
[1:32:22.140 --> 1:32:27.020]  end whatever but then finally when you die you go into a system they own and control the doctors
[1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:33.100]  trained to not know what happened to you that's a sophisticated way to kill somebody you've dropped
[1:32:33.100 --> 1:32:39.260]  nuclear bombs on somebody or whatever they're gonna get pissed and fight back but see if you kill
[1:32:39.260 --> 1:32:45.500]  them softly they'll never know what hit them well here's the deal i'm smart enough to read what you
[1:32:45.500 --> 1:32:50.620]  guys have said and i'm smart enough to see that you've done it and i'm smart enough to know you
[1:32:50.620 --> 1:32:55.180]  tried to recruit members of my family and which is nothing especially try to recruit everybody
[1:32:55.180 --> 1:32:59.900]  that's high IQ and i know you did recruit members of my family for other projects and i know who you
[1:32:59.900 --> 1:33:08.460]  are and i know how you operate and i'm here to tell you that you're not going to get away
[1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:13.020]  with your long-term plans and let me tell you Bill Gates is real freaked out right now he knows that
[1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:22.060]  and and and the rest of these ghouls know it too but if you think they're just stopping now seeing
[1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:27.740]  we can't before this July that's nothing and think about how outrageous that is we're suddenly told
[1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:31.820]  we can't go outside unless we're in a bubble and we've got to take force inoculations next year
[1:33:31.820 --> 1:33:36.380]  and they're going to track everything and oh the clintons run the contact tracing company with apple
[1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:42.780]  and google on the app that's on your phone whether you like it or not it's outrageous they're raping
[1:33:42.780 --> 1:33:50.780]  you because Fauci and Gates are mad scientists that are on power trips and love their control
[1:33:50.780 --> 1:33:54.700]  over everybody and it's an excuse for them to do horrible evil stuff
[1:33:57.020 --> 1:34:00.300]  Charlie Manson waved his arms around an act of tough he was a wimp
[1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:06.060]  George Soros is a mega killer Anthony Fauci is a mega killer
[1:34:06.060 --> 1:34:13.420]  Bill Gates is a mega killer and a lot of you are walking around that got vaccines in you that
[1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:17.340]  the globalist engineered that are going to kill you dead in a hammer already so a lot of you
[1:34:17.340 --> 1:34:24.300]  listening have already been killed by these people so I just want you to know that and I want you to
[1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:32.380]  think about that because I'm betting on you I don't let me tell you something people think I
[1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:38.460]  got a lot of courage doing this I don't have courage at all we're all dead already including
[1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:46.940]  our children if we let these pieces of crap win our only hope is to square up with the nightmare
[1:34:46.940 --> 1:34:52.540]  and just go my god this is all real I can't believe it do your research warn others and then
[1:34:55.180 --> 1:34:59.980]  let these new world order people know that you understand their plan you know they can't get
[1:34:59.980 --> 1:35:04.300]  it where restaurants only have robots and they can't get it where there's a post human world
[1:35:04.300 --> 1:35:08.460]  unless they train us that we can't go outside our house unless they say and that's why they want
[1:35:08.460 --> 1:35:14.540]  virtual reality our homes that's why they want us to commute telecommute it's why their country garden
[1:35:14.540 --> 1:35:20.620]  opens restaurant operated completely by robots so you can quote be covid safe they had all this ready
[1:35:20.620 --> 1:35:30.780]  before and all you gotta do is say no and they won't win and let me tell you bill gates them
[1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:33.900]  knowing they're in game when they're killing almost everybody on earth down the road 10 years
[1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:37.900]  from now 20 years spent on the time table because they're gonna keep trying no matter we hold them

[1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:13.180]  going to get to the sucker carlson reporter a piece of it here in a moment because he just can't
[1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:18.860]  not air something this this this is totally true and you know i did use to be a big fan of
[1:40:18.860 --> 1:40:23.500]  took carlson back with a bow tie and he was more of a libertarian mainline guy at cnn but getting
[1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:27.580]  to know him in the last decade and then seeing him is developed into a thoroughbred there's
[1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:34.540]  nothing this strong on tv he's for surpassed anything i can do when it comes to laying it out
[1:40:34.540 --> 1:40:47.420]  with just splendid bounce so we're going to be airing part of this report right now that just
[1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:54.620]  says it all it's up to us not trump and when you talk about the members of congress they're a bunch
[1:40:54.620 --> 1:41:01.740]  of cowards we have to lead your sucker carlson as the mob burns cities and shot police officers
[1:41:01.740 --> 1:41:07.500]  mike brawn used his power in the u.s senate to punish local police cops for the real problem
[1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:12.300]  brawn decided so he sponsored legislation to make it easier for left-wing activist groups
[1:41:12.300 --> 1:41:18.460]  to sue and bankrupt individual police officers and then mike brawn endorsed black lives matter
[1:41:20.460 --> 1:41:22.860]  you support the the black lives matter movement
[1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:32.140]  i support that movement because it's addressing an equity that has not been solved
[1:41:33.260 --> 1:41:38.780]  no you're overthrowing local police the sorrows can control them it's hard to imagine that many
[1:41:38.780 --> 1:41:43.900]  of mike brawn's voters agree with any of that black lives matter has said it wants to eliminate
[1:41:43.900 --> 1:41:49.740]  police departments dismantle the nuclear family and install socialism in the united states even
[1:41:49.740 --> 1:41:54.860]  in the highly revolutionary year of 2020 those don't seem like winning positions in the state of
[1:41:54.860 --> 1:42:00.540]  indiana so we asked mike brawn to explain how that works exactly and it didn't go well we're not
[1:42:00.540 --> 1:42:04.940]  going to play you the tape it feels like piling on to do that we'll just sum it up this way at
[1:42:04.940 --> 1:42:09.660]  one point in the interview mike brawn explained that he was pushing left-wing legislation because
[1:42:09.660 --> 1:42:15.580]  he was afraid of being criticized by chuck schumer if he didn't the whole thing went like that it
[1:42:15.580 --> 1:42:20.300]  was remarkable almost beyond belief really again we're not trying to be mean here cruelty is easy
[1:42:20.300 --> 1:42:25.260]  too easy especially with politicians the closer you get to them the easier you realize it is
[1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:28.780]  and by the way mike brawn doesn't seem like a bad person if you live next door to him you'd
[1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:33.980]  probably like him brawn's just weak and he doesn't really believe in anything he's definitely not
[1:42:33.980 --> 1:42:40.060]  alone in that an awful lot of republican office holders look very much like mike brawn right now
[1:42:40.060 --> 1:42:46.300]  probably most of them that's a problem in a moment like this it is a severe and dangerous problem
[1:42:46.300 --> 1:42:53.420]  here's why republicans at all levels could lose this fall if they do there will be profound
[1:42:53.420 --> 1:42:59.100]  consequences for you people who supported donald trump will be punished there's absolutely no
[1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:04.380]  question about that there's never been an american political party as radical and as angry as the
[1:43:04.380 --> 1:43:10.300]  democrats are now imagine them with unlimited power and that's what they plan to get in their
[1:43:10.300 --> 1:43:14.780]  first year democrats will give voting rights to every illegal alien in this country and then
[1:43:14.780 --> 1:43:20.300]  encourage many others to join them from abroad at a minimum that means more than 20 million new
[1:43:20.300 --> 1:43:26.940]  democratic voters overnight no republican will win nationally again we will have one party rule
[1:43:27.580 --> 1:43:32.220]  but democrats don't plan to stop there in congress they will abolish the filibuster that
[1:43:32.220 --> 1:43:36.780]  means they'll be able to do whatever they want to do with just a simple majority which they will
[1:43:36.780 --> 1:43:42.220]  have they plan to pack the senate by making the district of columbia a state giving statehood
[1:43:42.220 --> 1:43:47.660]  to dc is unconstitutional clearly but they're not worried about that they plan to pack the supreme
[1:43:47.660 --> 1:43:54.060]  court too they've said so so what will democrats do with all of this untrammeled power it's pretty
[1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:59.500]  easy to imagine we won't go into details right now we don't want to wreck your night but look around
[1:43:59.500 --> 1:44:06.780]  you've got a pretty good idea of what's coming the point is and it could not be clearer non democrats
[1:44:06.780 --> 1:44:12.060]  in america are in peril we're going to need someone with power willing to come to our defense
[1:44:12.700 --> 1:44:17.340]  and that's where people like mike brawn come in that was the point of last night's interview
[1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:25.340]  not to humiliate a specific senator but to remind the republican party that it is our only shield
[1:44:25.340 --> 1:44:31.340]  yes the republican party flawed and infuriating though it often is the fact remains the gop is
[1:44:31.340 --> 1:44:37.260]  the only institution still open to the rest of us to americans who want to live as they did just
[1:44:37.260 --> 1:44:44.140]  15 years ago quietly productively without being harassed and harangued by self-righteous lunatics
[1:44:44.140 --> 1:44:51.260]  who mean them harm and they do if you want to be left alone to do your job and raise your family
[1:44:51.260 --> 1:44:57.900]  in this country you will need a protector that protector must be the republican party there are
[1:44:57.900 --> 1:45:04.060]  no other options but it must be a very different kind of republican party keep in mind we're getting
[1:45:04.060 --> 1:45:09.900]  a new republican party no matter what happens even now vultures wait just offstage to swoop in and
[1:45:09.900 --> 1:45:15.740]  claim the gop for themselves once donald trump is gone former governor nicky hailey tops that list
[1:45:15.740 --> 1:45:21.740]  but there are many others on it the moment trump leaves they will attack him they'll tell you that
[1:45:21.740 --> 1:45:26.700]  republicans lost power because they were mean and intolerant just like donald trump and if you
[1:45:26.700 --> 1:45:34.220]  listen carefully you can hear them say that even now it's a lie republicans are failing for a much
[1:45:34.220 --> 1:45:39.580]  more obvious reason a more fundamental reason they're failing because they haven't done much that
[1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:46.620]  is worth doing they haven't tried very hard to improve your life when the crisis came they fled
[1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:51.340]  they did nothing to defend you they did nothing to defend the country they were paralyzed their so
[1:45:51.340 --> 1:45:55.900]  called principles turned out to be bumper stickers they wrote 40 years ago they had no clue what to
[1:45:55.900 --> 1:46:02.700]  do so from this day forward it's very simple we're going to have to tell them what to do and that
[1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:08.780]  will work no matter what they may believe privately politicians respond to organized groups of voters
[1:46:08.780 --> 1:46:14.940]  they want to win above all so they head to where the votes are going forward republican voters
[1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:21.100]  should demand three things from their candidates and if they don't provide them don't vote for them
[1:46:21.100 --> 1:46:28.460]  here they are first is vigorous defense of total equality under the law we are equal because we
[1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:36.060]  are citizens every american has precisely the same rights as every other american period that is
[1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:41.980]  the promise of america it's why millions of people move here for a long time we knew that no one
[1:46:41.980 --> 1:46:47.020]  questioned it it was obvious but it no longer is obvious and there are many who are working in the
[1:46:47.020 --> 1:46:53.180]  opposite direction republicans must counterbalance this they must work as hard as they can to make
[1:46:53.180 --> 1:47:02.220]  america fair again wealth appearance ancestry can play no role whatsoever in the eyes of the law
[1:47:02.220 --> 1:47:07.100]  that means that criminals like jeffrey ebbstein must go to jail the first time they're caught
[1:47:07.100 --> 1:47:12.540]  molesting children it means your children must have precisely the same chances of getting into
[1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:19.260]  college or getting a job as anyone else's children it means fighting to make this a colorblind
[1:47:19.260 --> 1:47:26.940]  meritocracy a colorblind meritocracy say it again the alternative to that is disaster
[1:47:26.940 --> 1:47:32.780]  slavery and jim crow were immoral precisely because they punished people for how they
[1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:39.740]  were born any system that punishes people for how they were born is immoral always republicans
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:46.860]  must say that loudly can you believe in 2020 someone has to state absolute known truths
[1:47:47.660 --> 1:47:51.660]  and they're battling to take him off the air right now they've taken most of sponsors and he
[1:47:51.660 --> 1:47:57.020]  i'm not going to even tell you it's it's it's just unbelievable you can imagine it goes on
[1:47:57.020 --> 1:48:03.740]  behind the scenes with tucker carlson's life that's where we are folks and it's all communist
[1:48:03.740 --> 1:48:11.500]  chinese funded the most evil regime the planet's ever seen by leaps and bounds and a good portion
[1:48:11.500 --> 1:48:17.900]  of americans don't want it they reject it they think communist china and the hollywood trash
[1:48:17.900 --> 1:48:23.340]  that exempt themselves from all the stuff we live under care about them
[1:48:24.380 --> 1:48:30.380]  but you know it's not up to all those lazy drug addicts to fix this up to us isn't it so i tell

[1:53:08.780 --> 1:53:13.340]  the pastor please stay with us everyone in the liberal media is excited about former national
[1:53:13.340 --> 1:53:19.660]  security advisor john bolton's new book which comes out tomorrow which is basically a 592
[1:53:19.660 --> 1:53:25.180]  page grocery store tabloid of fake news and fabricated quotes that i couldn't care less about but
[1:53:25.180 --> 1:53:30.060]  there's another book that just came out that i am very interested in covering but nobody else
[1:53:30.060 --> 1:53:37.100]  seems to have noticed our old friend eric swalwell he pinned this promotional video on the top of his
[1:53:37.100 --> 1:53:43.420]  twitter feed announcing the exciting news this is the story of how the 45th president of the united
[1:53:43.420 --> 1:53:48.780]  states was finally held accountable look at that it looks like his mom must have endorsed it how
[1:53:48.780 --> 1:53:54.620]  courageous public servants stood up and spoke truth to power and his sister
[1:53:54.620 --> 1:54:02.700]  her end game inside the impeachment of dotl j trump well this must be a real page turner i'm
[1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:07.980]  sure it's gonna land on the top of the charts oh wait what's this it's current sales rank is at
[1:54:07.980 --> 1:54:17.420]  number 3648 couldn't even break into the top 1000 whose idea was it to write a book about the inside
[1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:22.620]  story of the impeachment i'm pretty sure democrats are trying to forget about that incredibly embarrassing
[1:54:22.620 --> 1:54:28.700]  waste of time in our nation's history that only served to energize republicans you may recall
[1:54:28.700 --> 1:54:34.700]  that mr fartwell ran for president for a few months and somehow got a guest spot on steven
[1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:41.820]  colbert where he made the big announcement so i'm sure he's expecting a huge media blitz to promote
[1:54:41.820 --> 1:54:49.820]  his new book here he is on the capital news forum youtube channel which has 196 subscribers
[1:54:49.820 --> 1:54:56.860]  where he was able to reach 31 people he does have his own youtube channel however where he's
[1:54:56.860 --> 1:55:04.540]  racked up a grand total of 538 subscribers where he's been posting videos of his virtual book tour
[1:55:04.540 --> 1:55:10.620]  like this powerful interview that he scored with tmz but you've written a book about the impeachment
[1:55:10.620 --> 1:55:14.860]  of president trump that's about to come out end game inside the impeachment of donald trump
[1:55:14.860 --> 1:55:19.820]  interesting tell us about the book and and what readers will get from this you know the book is
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:26.300]  a book is the biggest waste of time since the impeachment hearings msnbc decided to throw him
[1:55:26.300 --> 1:55:32.860]  a bone and have him on to talk about his book and he did the interview on his laptop in his kitchen
[1:55:32.860 --> 1:55:38.860]  and while i'm flattered that he's copying my style i figured that such a powerful member of congress
[1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:46.220]  would have had a home office or something tell me about the book you've written about impeachment
[1:55:46.540 --> 1:55:52.380]  well nicole uh it chronicles you know what we did uh the call to action of standing up to this
[1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:57.260]  president it's a tribute to speaker polosi chairmanship who had the courage to move forward on it
[1:55:59.340 --> 1:56:06.620]  this poor man needs a hobby the last big interview that swallwell had was with seth meyers on nbc's
[1:56:06.620 --> 1:56:14.140]  late night where he was invited to discuss fart gate how do you find out that it happened
[1:56:14.140 --> 1:56:20.620]  christy teegan tweets about it my wife who follows everything she says text me and she says did you
[1:56:20.620 --> 1:56:29.340]  just fart on national tv so imagine being a member of congress and coming on a late night talk show
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:35.820]  to defend yourself against allegedly farting during an msnbc interview recently i remembered
[1:56:35.820 --> 1:56:41.020]  that mr fartwell thought that he could be the next president and i asked others on twitter if they
[1:56:41.020 --> 1:56:46.700]  remembered his historic campaign every day we're getting closer and closer to that goal but i need
[1:56:46.700 --> 1:56:51.900]  you remember he said one dollar one dollar one dollar one dollar we get there join our movement
[1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:56.860]  go bold with me and let's do this together let's go and then none other than mr swallwell himself
[1:56:56.860 --> 1:57:05.580]  replied yep no regrets adding a thumbs up i thanked him for the laughs that we all had at his expense
[1:57:05.580 --> 1:57:13.420]  and he responded no sweat you seem easily amused well congressman i will admit that i do have fun
[1:57:13.420 --> 1:57:19.020]  adding farting sounds to clips from cable news and posting them on youtube but in your case
[1:57:19.020 --> 1:57:25.340]  i just had to play the original clip as it aired the evidence is uncontradicted that the president
[1:57:25.340 --> 1:57:30.300]  used taxpayer dollars to ask the ukranians to help him cheat an election and the complaint that i've
[1:57:30.300 --> 1:57:35.020]  heard from i extended an invitation to him to be a guest on my youtube channel since you may have
[1:57:35.020 --> 1:57:40.140]  noticed i've been doing interviews lately and i look forward to hearing from him come on eric
[1:57:40.140 --> 1:57:51.100]  you remember your campaign slogan we'll be back stay with us the fourth of july 2020 we are here
[1:57:51.100 --> 1:57:56.060]  and despite all the globalist attacks you the viewers and listeners of this transmission have
[1:57:56.060 --> 1:58:02.300]  supported us by prayer by word of mouth and by buying the products and you have done all of this
[1:58:02.300 --> 1:58:08.700]  so when you look at the huge effect info wars has had i want you to understand that it's because
[1:58:08.700 --> 1:58:17.180]  of what you have done and myself and the whole crew salute you on this july fourth 2020 we've
[1:58:17.180 --> 1:58:22.780]  got a lot of our best-selling products that were sold out dna force plus bodies ultra 12 and others

[1:58:39.260 --> 1:58:43.900]  war the only way we fail is when you don't take action i don't need to tell you that you already
[1:58:43.900 --> 1:59:02.540]  took action and i salute and thank you well remember pastor stacey shiflett
[1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:09.180]  up in maryland the calvary baptist church a few months ago was one of the first openest church
[1:59:09.180 --> 1:59:15.420]  uh and that caused a domino effect but now they're closing them back down they're trying to demand
[1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:19.500]  that well black lives matter and the training parades and everything else can happen but
[1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:23.580]  they're telling us we can't have four that you lie either but we can have again an anti-foot
[1:59:23.580 --> 1:59:27.420]  parade if we want here's what he had to say back then we'll talk to him here live in a moment
[1:59:29.420 --> 1:59:35.740]  so newsflash pharaoh doesn't get to dictate to god's people how they worship their god
[1:59:35.740 --> 1:59:41.580]  god's the one that defines the parameters god's the one that communicates his will
[1:59:41.580 --> 1:59:46.780]  and his plan for his church not egypt and i'm telling you right now with this cease and desist
[1:59:46.780 --> 1:59:52.620]  letter in my hand the bible says to the new testament church not forsaking the assembling
[1:59:52.620 --> 1:59:58.620]  of yourselves together as the manner of some is but so much the more as you see the day approaching
[1:59:58.620 --> 2:00:04.300]  and the closer we get to jesus coming back the more church we ought to be having not less church
[2:00:04.300 --> 2:00:06.460]  now that's god's parameters
[2:00:09.660 --> 2:00:15.100]  so i'm tearing up this cease and desist order right here and i'm telling you right now we're
[2:00:15.100 --> 2:00:23.820]  going to do it god's way we're going to do it god's way god tells us how to worship him nobody
[2:00:23.820 --> 2:00:29.900]  else gets to do that now remember i've studied how the un works that's who runs all this they admit
[2:00:29.900 --> 2:00:35.820]  it cnn youtube all of them say we follow you in orders now medical doctors criticizing cover
[2:00:35.820 --> 2:00:40.060]  19 they're kicked off you name it hospitals say it's a hoax exaggerated they're kicked off
[2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:46.700]  i said back at the time they'll allow these people are resisting they'll they'll release some of the
[2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:51.580]  pressure and then they'll squeeze again the left always when you push back they give up
[2:00:51.580 --> 2:00:57.580]  till you go away then they squeeze again but the pastor stacey shiflet was fined for reopening
[2:00:57.580 --> 2:01:03.260]  his church but no black lives matter was fined in maryland and the same thing in new york new
[2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:09.900]  jersey jewish centers still shut down jewish parks or even private shutdown christian parks
[2:01:11.420 --> 2:01:16.060]  what's funny is congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:20.780]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the freedom of the press there is first amendment
[2:01:20.780 --> 2:01:24.780]  guarantees freedoms concerning religion expression assembly in the right to petition
[2:01:24.780 --> 2:01:30.140]  religion and it forbids congress from having any involvement that's a definition of it there it
[2:01:30.140 --> 2:01:33.580]  is congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the
[2:01:33.580 --> 2:01:38.140]  free exercise thereof or abressing the freedom of speech or the press or the rather people
[2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:43.580]  to peacefully assemble and to petition the government for redress and grievances so that
[2:01:43.580 --> 2:01:49.980]  county does not even have a jurisdiction over the what the church or its property or what it's
[2:01:49.980 --> 2:01:54.460]  doing if somebody commits a murder in the church that's not the church that that that's the county
[2:01:54.460 --> 2:01:59.100]  that's the city that's the state but they have no jurisdiction this is the bedrock of america
[2:01:59.740 --> 2:02:04.060]  and something the left claims they love all day long but now no they don't so here we are during
[2:02:04.060 --> 2:02:07.260]  lockdown too when it was coming the lockdown will be over as soon as you take all your
[2:02:07.260 --> 2:02:14.620]  inoculations and so this trump has gone from office uh but uh pastor uh stacey shiflet no more
[2:02:14.620 --> 2:02:24.220]  coverups dot com twitter stacey shiflet calvary baptist church cbc d u n d a l k dot or g we'll
[2:02:24.220 --> 2:02:28.620]  put it all up on screen thank you so much for joining us i can ask a lot of questions but just
[2:02:28.620 --> 2:02:33.100]  talk about this saga fill us in on what's happening and your new book that's out as well
[2:02:34.140 --> 2:02:37.980]  thank you alex for having me on appreciate the opportunity to be able to give you an update
[2:02:37.980 --> 2:02:43.420]  as well as mention the book um so as you know our church received a cease and desist letter
[2:02:43.420 --> 2:02:50.700]  uh when they found out that we were planning to have services on the 17th of of may and of course
[2:02:50.700 --> 2:02:56.060]  we had church anyway on that sunday and then on that monday i received a cease and desist letter
[2:02:56.060 --> 2:03:01.180]  got up in the pulpit on that wednesday night for a midweek service and uh in the course of the
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:07.100]  message uh just uh i didn't plan on doing it but i just toured the cease and desist letter up in
[2:03:07.100 --> 2:03:11.980]  an act of protest and i really want to emphasize the word protest because that's exactly what i was
[2:03:11.980 --> 2:03:16.300]  doing what we're finding out is it depends on what you're protesting as to whether or not that's
[2:03:16.300 --> 2:03:20.460]  protected well that's right the synagogues are putting up their george floyd protest now so they
[2:03:20.460 --> 2:03:25.820]  can open yeah so our protest of the cease and desist letter i toured up in the middle of that
[2:03:25.820 --> 2:03:31.660]  message well the county was embarrassed because uh if that video clip went viral and you know as well
[2:03:31.660 --> 2:03:35.500]  as i do that's not something that you can make happen it either happens or it doesn't but it went
[2:03:35.500 --> 2:03:41.420]  viral and uh i got a lot of attention and it made the county executive of baltimore county looked
[2:03:41.420 --> 2:03:48.780]  really bad so this turned into a pissing contest it turned into a a make an example out of us deal
[2:03:48.780 --> 2:03:52.300]  so they they begin to play hot potato with us because they didn't know what to do they didn't
[2:03:52.300 --> 2:03:57.340]  anticipate anybody disobeying the cease and desist letter by the way our church wasn't the only one
[2:03:57.340 --> 2:04:02.380]  they got one but the only one they got to find so anyway the county executive put pressure on the
[2:04:02.380 --> 2:04:07.020]  baltimore county health department the health department put pressure on the department of
[2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:12.380]  inspections and it was actually the department of inspections that came out on that next sunday to
[2:04:12.380 --> 2:04:17.020]  24th they sent across the street from our church took pictures of people going in and out of the
[2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:21.820]  services and taking pictures of people's cars and whatnot so that's christians being surveilled by
[2:04:21.820 --> 2:04:27.980]  the state this isn't china it's not the soviet union it's america absolutely without a doubt and so
[2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:34.060]  that was on a sunday by by wednesday the department of inspection still had not issued a citation so
[2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:39.580]  the health department under pressure from baltimore county executive john josecki pressured the
[2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:44.700]  inspectors to write us a ticket they wrote us a ticket a citation on that thursday
[2:04:45.420 --> 2:04:50.940]  may the 28th at three o'clock in the afternoon and alex this fine right here is for five hundred
[2:04:50.940 --> 2:04:58.380]  dollars for unsafe structures that's what the citation is for now two hours after this fine
[2:04:58.380 --> 2:05:04.460]  was written the uh the the the county executive had a press conference and opened up the county and
[2:05:04.460 --> 2:05:09.820]  opened up churches to 50 capacity but they still would not take the citation off the table so we
[2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:15.260]  went to a hearing two weeks ago we had a hearing with a judge baltimore county attorneys they brought
[2:05:15.260 --> 2:05:21.580]  their inspectors in they brought an engineer in to try and validate this nonsense right here and
[2:05:21.580 --> 2:05:28.780]  then we brought in a professional hygienist a professional industrial hygienist who had been
[2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:33.500]  to our one of our services and documented our our cleaning policies and whatnot and they would not
[2:05:33.500 --> 2:05:39.100]  even allow him to testify because they said he wasn't an expert on viruses and yet the two
[2:05:39.100 --> 2:05:43.740]  building inspectors and the engineer that never stepped foot on the property that took pictures
[2:05:43.740 --> 2:05:47.420]  from across the street they were allowed to testify on behalf of the county sure so they're
[2:05:47.420 --> 2:05:52.300]  trying to legitimize that you're the bad guy but instead they've shown themselves to be incredible
[2:05:52.300 --> 2:05:58.860]  tyrants the the the county executive has weaponized the the local departments against our church
[2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:03.180]  because that video clip going viral of me protesting that's here they want to punish you but let me
[2:06:03.180 --> 2:06:09.660]  guess i bet your church is more energized than ever you have no idea alex you have no idea we're
[2:06:09.660 --> 2:06:14.620]  having visitors i mean we've had more visitors first time guests our people are fired up
[2:06:14.620 --> 2:06:19.900]  and so um they i guess they thought by just giving us a five hundred dollar fine that we would pay
[2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:24.940]  don't they know that when you persecute the church it grows i don't think they know that
[2:06:27.180 --> 2:06:31.900]  i don't think they know that but our church is our church is unified and we're not going to pay
[2:06:31.900 --> 2:06:37.660]  this fine listen to me very carefully we're not paying this fine the judge is still hasn't uh
[2:06:37.660 --> 2:06:42.140]  ruled on this case if he if he rules and they're supposed to rule sometime this week hopefully
[2:06:42.140 --> 2:06:46.300]  if he rules uh that we have to pay this fine instead of throwing it out then we're going to
[2:06:46.300 --> 2:06:50.060]  take it to the appeals court and we may just sue everybody up there because i'm telling you right
[2:06:50.060 --> 2:06:54.620]  now this isn't the last time they're going to try to shut down churches and i want to go on the
[2:06:54.620 --> 2:06:58.780]  let's talk about that at the break they're obsessed with the power over the church but everything else
[2:06:58.780 --> 2:07:03.340]  can stay open this is so devilish so i'm not trying to put stuff i'm not telling you what to do but
[2:07:03.340 --> 2:07:06.940]  if you wanted to give a little speech for a minute we're breaking tear up that fine that'd be good
[2:07:06.940 --> 2:07:12.860]  let me tell you something the governor opened up the state of maryland and he opened up churches
[2:07:12.860 --> 2:07:19.740]  to 50 capacity then the county executive shut the county and shut churches again when he opened
[2:07:19.740 --> 2:07:26.620]  it up finally the baltimore city mayor shut the churches down again there was churches in baltimore
[2:07:26.620 --> 2:07:32.140]  city that did not have services for weeks after the governor opened up and for those that don't know
[2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:38.380]  the way it works is the state passes the laws of the counties and then cities that that's backwards
[2:07:38.380 --> 2:07:44.220]  to have cities telling the state what to do it's it's illegal well there was no laws passed the
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:49.820]  legislative branch was not able to weigh in on this at all this was done strictly by executive
[2:07:49.820 --> 2:07:56.140]  order there were no laws passed okay mayors don't make laws and county executives don't pass laws
[2:07:56.140 --> 2:08:02.780]  okay exactly so here we are sitting here now coming up on fourth of july weekend we still
[2:08:02.780 --> 2:08:07.260]  have this stupid fine hanging over our head they don't know what to do with us they kept playing
[2:08:07.260 --> 2:08:11.820]  hot potato with us because they know they went way outside and by the way pastor obviously what
[2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:15.180]  happened to you is important you spoke of it's great but the larger issue when we come back is
[2:08:16.060 --> 2:08:21.500]  why is all over the country they're just want those churches and synagogues shut down but then
[2:08:21.500 --> 2:08:27.660]  that the lgbtp events and the black lives matter and the antifuts like oh it's all great but before
[2:08:27.660 --> 2:08:33.580]  the july shut down too i mean it makes it so obvious that the left hates the country and
[2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:37.900]  hates christians no matter what color they are talk about villains we'll be right back with
[2:08:37.900 --> 2:08:46.460]  pastor shivelett i'm elwin shones with news wars dot com we need to get back to the land
[2:08:46.460 --> 2:08:51.180]  back to self sufficiency and back to being prepared and the way to start ladies and gentlemen
[2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:56.140]  is having friends and family with a bug out plan if there is a total collapse and water filtration
[2:08:56.140 --> 2:09:01.900]  and food to last you at least a few months and the food we have is very high quality it's in great
[2:09:01.900 --> 2:09:06.780]  containers that are great to be mobile they have wide selection special diets you name it it's the
[2:09:06.780 --> 2:09:11.900]  best price you're going to find but you need to get the orders in now in the lull before the storm
[2:09:11.900 --> 2:09:16.700]  i told you lockdown two was coming the new world order is making its move whether trump loses or
[2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:22.860]  wins things are just going to get more crazy and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers
[2:09:22.860 --> 2:09:27.900]  so it's something you can hide something you can bury something you know is an ace in the hole for
[2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:33.020]  you and your family in the future and the little bit of profit that comes in funds the info war to
[2:09:33.020 --> 2:09:39.180]  continue to warn the people so you're also funding info wars the most powerful paul revere organization
[2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:47.820]  the world is powered by you one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold
[2:09:47.820 --> 2:09:52.060]  out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've
[2:09:52.060 --> 2:09:55.820]  got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and i want those of you that haven't
[2:09:55.820 --> 2:10:00.780]  experienced living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial i look in january
[2:10:00.780 --> 2:10:05.980]  2016 i went in a hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was in there until june
[2:10:05.980 --> 2:10:11.340]  and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a
[2:10:11.340 --> 2:10:15.980]  day and i kept hearing dr group and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something
[2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:21.340]  man i had an internal digestive problem and i stumbled with it for about five or six years and
[2:10:21.340 --> 2:10:25.580]  the doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i
[2:10:25.580 --> 2:10:29.740]  kept hearing you and dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that
[2:10:29.740 --> 2:10:33.260]  freaking living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:37.900]  to have a stuff but i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started
[2:10:37.900 --> 2:10:44.220]  taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[2:10:44.220 --> 2:11:01.180]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:01.180 --> 2:11:12.140]  so
[2:11:12.300 --> 2:11:18.140]  leadership simple it's doing what you know is right following god's providence and guidance
[2:11:18.140 --> 2:11:23.100]  pastor stacey shiflett made national news back before the breachers weren't challenging it saying
[2:11:23.100 --> 2:11:27.180]  i'm challenging this and he felt led by the holy spirit to tear that up and he did it as an act of
[2:11:27.180 --> 2:11:31.260]  defiance so now they've got their little their little fine to say oh you're bad and of course
[2:11:31.260 --> 2:11:34.940]  he could pay the fine it's no big deal except it's admitting he's wrong so he's got to fight it
[2:11:36.780 --> 2:11:41.180]  but but pastor let's look big picture here about the spiritual war against america right now
[2:11:41.180 --> 2:11:46.700]  trying to cancel the fourth of july i'm pulling down statues of george washington um abraham
[2:11:46.700 --> 2:11:52.380]  lincoln uh the i know you've got a new book out we'll cover next segment with the pedophile rings
[2:11:52.380 --> 2:11:57.900]  and that's all coming out 30 000 government officials and others under investigation in germany
[2:11:57.900 --> 2:12:02.620]  the government admits they officially ran pedophile rings i mean the stuff that's coming out it's just
[2:12:02.620 --> 2:12:09.500]  mind blowing praise jesus for that but but just big picture the transparency of evil we always read
[2:12:09.500 --> 2:12:14.780]  in history books or told by pastors about when evil finally comes out it comes for your kids and it
[2:12:14.780 --> 2:12:20.060]  openly wants to ban churches and it openly kills old people it's all happening now everything we were
[2:12:20.060 --> 2:12:25.660]  told evil does we're now witnessing it why is evil so obvious once it finally emerges because
[2:12:25.660 --> 2:12:30.860]  before it creeps around and hides but right now they're like ban churches but let the pedophile
[2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:37.260]  rings have their marches i mean it's getting crazy well the very first thing that you find out about
[2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:42.940]  satan alex when you read your bible when you get to the beginning of the book of genesis the bible
[2:12:42.940 --> 2:12:48.940]  tells us um the serpent this is chapter three of the book of genesis now the serpent was more subtle
[2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:54.940]  than any beast of the field which the lord god had made from day one satan has never been
[2:12:54.940 --> 2:13:01.340]  straight out up front this is who i am and this is what i'm trying to do from day one satan has
[2:13:01.340 --> 2:13:08.540]  always been deceptive he's always come in the back door he's always tricked and deceived people
[2:13:08.540 --> 2:13:14.540]  he did it in genesis chapter number three he does it now okay and and the problem is most people
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:20.300]  today that do not know the lord do not know jesus christ is their personal savior are easily deceived
[2:13:20.300 --> 2:13:25.980]  they do have no navigation i know i agree with you but now there's a grand illusion that god
[2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:30.540]  talks about in revelation but but now it's becoming more out in the open though compared to what it
[2:13:30.540 --> 2:13:34.380]  used to be because i agree all throughout history it's very secretive why is it now becoming a
[2:13:34.380 --> 2:13:39.740]  little bit more out in the open well because it can be i mean so you know the old analogy about
[2:13:39.740 --> 2:13:44.620]  the way the boil of frog you just put him in cold water and turn the heat on and and that's exactly
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:51.020]  what's happened over the last 50 years through the through the uh the propaganda of hollywood
[2:13:51.020 --> 2:13:57.100]  through the the infiltration of the media and uh and just entertainment people's minds have been
[2:13:57.100 --> 2:14:03.100]  doled and numbed and and then you've got your public school system that's dumbed down curriculum
[2:14:03.100 --> 2:14:07.500]  and young people today these are millennials that are marching in the street uh i guarantee
[2:14:07.500 --> 2:14:12.140]  i guarantee they hadn't read a book in years if ever uh and so what's happened is they've been
[2:14:12.140 --> 2:14:18.940]  programmed and and and the more the least resistant people get to what satan's doing the more
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:24.780]  obvious it can become and that's been one of my biggest concerns is seeing our country just get
[2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:32.860]  to the place to where they accept outright lies as fact without questioning it at all it's because
[2:14:32.860 --> 2:14:39.020]  they've been conditioned and programmed for years they've been programmed by the world and by the
[2:14:39.020 --> 2:14:44.220]  world system and by satan and their minds and you're right that that bible verses says that in the
[2:14:44.220 --> 2:14:48.860]  last days but when the antichrist comes on the scene after the church has been raptured out the
[2:14:48.860 --> 2:14:53.180]  bible says people will be turned over to strong delusion and believe a lie they're already being
[2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:58.540]  turned over to strong delusion and they're already believing lies now it's really amazing though
[2:14:58.540 --> 2:15:04.540]  because we're going to cover this next segment but look at this mainline dw.com that's the biggest
[2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:11.100]  tv station in germany germany investigating 30 000 potential suspects in pedophile ranks and you
[2:15:11.100 --> 2:15:20.140]  read its giant government rings pastors uh professors government officials and it says right here
[2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:26.700]  the government placed children they took from christians knowingly with pedophiles i mean this
[2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:35.260]  is just insane yeah it's uh and you're going to see a whole lot more of that being exposed
[2:15:35.260 --> 2:15:40.700]  as we get as we get closer to jesus coming back i believe in the rapture of the church i believe
[2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:45.660]  jesus is going to return and catch the the church of the living god out of here and this whole world
[2:15:45.660 --> 2:15:51.580]  is going to be turned over to the antichrist and all that but closer we get to that day you're going
[2:15:51.580 --> 2:15:56.700]  to see more and more of this stuff coming out and what's amazing to me is how few of the
[2:15:56.700 --> 2:16:02.300]  so-called mainstream media covers this stuff because you and i both know uh that they're
[2:16:02.300 --> 2:16:08.060]  probably unfortunately uh heavily even involved in it at least i think so well that's what's crazy
[2:16:08.060 --> 2:16:14.700]  about it is god's going to show it to everybody and then people are still going to choose it
[2:16:14.700 --> 2:16:21.820]  to become very clear i think right down the line yeah and god god does give people a choice
[2:16:21.820 --> 2:16:28.460]  and i'm grateful for that and um the the truth of the matter is right now more than ever a
[2:16:28.460 --> 2:16:34.860]  man of god and christians across this land need to stand up and be strong and uh you know i i wasn't
[2:16:34.860 --> 2:16:39.580]  the only pastor by the way that no i know but you were the big one that prominently hit the news
[2:16:39.580 --> 2:16:42.860]  but you were kind of that you know there's a bunch of shooting stars coming in but the big one
[2:16:42.860 --> 2:16:47.020]  blew up it you know i mean you got a lot of attention yeah but there was a lot of churches
[2:16:47.020 --> 2:16:50.300]  that didn't even shut down they were able to fly into the radar because of where their church is
[2:16:50.300 --> 2:16:54.380]  located they were able to never even shut down and i tip my head oh yeah what about all the
[2:16:54.380 --> 2:17:00.940]  churches that got burned down because they met wow that's the the animosity towards the people of
[2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:04.860]  god and toward the church is just going to continue to get stronger and stronger that's why
[2:17:04.860 --> 2:17:10.620]  jesus said to his disciples when i return will i find faith on the earth there's always been
[2:17:10.620 --> 2:17:15.580]  a remnant there's never has been an overwhelming majority of god's people there's always been
[2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:20.060]  a remnant but as we get closer to jesus coming back you're going to find out the difference
[2:17:20.060 --> 2:17:24.780]  between the wheat and the tares and you're going to be able to find out who's real and who's not
[2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:30.860]  and um that's it's going to be obvious more and more as days go on because satan through his
[2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:35.980]  global social credit score to buy or sell the market the beast is going to force you to do it
[2:17:35.980 --> 2:17:42.300]  well the the bible is very clear that those that do not take the mark of the beast will not be able
[2:17:42.300 --> 2:17:48.060]  to buy or sell and we are living in a day and age right now where in most stores at least here in
[2:17:48.060 --> 2:17:53.660]  baltimore you can't go in and buy anything if you don't have that stupid face mask on and so they're
[2:17:53.660 --> 2:17:59.100]  conditioning people and preparing people i just got off the phone with the organizers for the
[2:17:59.100 --> 2:18:03.980]  fourth of july parade that's going to be here in our town on saturday and they were apologizing to me
[2:18:03.980 --> 2:18:08.220]  because we're not even going to be able to have a parade nobody can walk down the street and wave
[2:18:08.220 --> 2:18:13.740]  american flags on the fourth of july so they're organizing us just riding along in cars and they
[2:18:13.740 --> 2:18:18.460]  asked me they said if i said can i just have a church van and we just ride down through there
[2:18:18.460 --> 2:18:22.140]  with our church van it's got the name of our church down the side and they said well would you have
[2:18:22.140 --> 2:18:28.300]  everybody inside the van wear face masks i said are you kidding me are you seriously as this is a
[2:18:28.300 --> 2:18:33.820]  total cult joke it's absolutely a joke and i don't know if you saw this it's confirmed they count
[2:18:33.820 --> 2:18:39.100]  one person with covid they count 15 is having it as probable that's counted as a case that's why
[2:18:39.100 --> 2:18:45.660]  there's the spike the deaths aren't up but that's a total fraud oh i i had a funny feeling from day
[2:18:45.660 --> 2:18:51.260]  one this thing was nothing like what they reported it uh obviously it was uh it was a serious uh
[2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:56.380]  sickness i know people that were impacted i just preached the funeral yesterday in one of my uh
[2:18:56.380 --> 2:19:02.380]  oh yeah there's a real pneumonia there's a lot of demonias they're serious well i i mean i've i've
[2:19:02.380 --> 2:19:07.420]  seen people i know that it's real but it's not like at all what they're saying it is and i knew
[2:19:07.420 --> 2:19:11.660]  that when they shut the churches down i told my family i told my church i said they will try to
[2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:15.980]  do this again and if we do not push back now we won't be able to push back let's talk about that
[2:19:15.980 --> 2:19:21.340]  because we just said an article where they sent SWAT teams and churches in chicago but the lbgt
[2:19:21.340 --> 2:19:26.300]  rally the black lives matter burn stuff down that's allowed to go that is so discriminatory
[2:19:26.860 --> 2:19:31.900]  let's talk about that let's talk about your new book on the other side with pastor stacey shiflett

[2:23:14.940 --> 2:23:19.900]  declares war on fake republicans they're empty sad people very powerful video we played it earlier
[2:23:19.900 --> 2:23:23.740]  i suggest you share it bill gates predicts this won't be the last pandemic we face of course
[2:23:23.740 --> 2:23:28.300]  khan is behind so much of it chinese style social credits course here gab pounder says he's blocked
[2:23:28.300 --> 2:23:35.500]  from using visa personally over vague hate speech charge um that is just absolutely dangerous that's
[2:23:35.500 --> 2:23:39.340]  the mark of the beast we're talking about i want to get into the book that i haven't gotten a copy
[2:23:39.340 --> 2:23:43.580]  of yet i don't just say this when i'm an author on he's a oh interesting book but i want to read
[2:23:43.580 --> 2:23:50.380]  this one wolves among lambs my story of sexual abuse and cover-ups in the church pastor stacey
[2:23:50.380 --> 2:23:54.620]  shivell is here and i've got a whole stack of news here that ties in with these pedophile rings
[2:23:54.620 --> 2:23:59.340]  where popular pastors get caught doing this because that's what the devil infiltrates
[2:23:59.340 --> 2:24:04.700]  and don't get in trouble or still leading groups so we'll talk to him in a moment about that but
[2:24:04.700 --> 2:24:13.660]  first let me ask you this from a research of the bible because i've been a lot of church read the
[2:24:13.660 --> 2:24:18.940]  bible seen different angles of it i've seen what christ taught manifested in front of me i have a
[2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:24.620]  spiritual relationship with christ uh and through christ you know to you know to god his father and
[2:24:24.620 --> 2:24:31.500]  the holy spirit but if you read the bible and you read revelation it says the devil wages war
[2:24:31.500 --> 2:24:35.740]  against the saints and overcomes them but then later when the devil gets tired of it for armageddon
[2:24:35.740 --> 2:24:39.980]  and everything you know the dead and christ rise and all that and in my experience you have to go
[2:24:39.980 --> 2:24:43.980]  through paying it to go through persecution and then and then and then you know that's how you find
[2:24:43.980 --> 2:24:50.140]  a great relationship with god because it's all a test i would love a pre-trimulation rapture
[2:24:50.140 --> 2:24:54.300]  people get so mad about this and and so i hope that's the case but clearly there's a big revival
[2:24:54.300 --> 2:25:00.060]  after that happens if you believe in that view uh and so the devil does wage war against you know
[2:25:00.060 --> 2:25:04.220]  those new christians you have the two prophets that come back and you know all the rest of it
[2:25:04.220 --> 2:25:08.060]  so you just briefly because i respect you know you're a good guy from your perspective and and
[2:25:08.060 --> 2:25:14.140]  your research and and also your discernment because i'm automatically says there's a post
[2:25:14.140 --> 2:25:18.780]  tribulation rapture a pre one or a mid i think everybody can you have their own research we're
[2:25:18.780 --> 2:25:23.020]  not in the cult here but but clearly world government's here there's a falling creature on
[2:25:23.020 --> 2:25:27.500]  the planet trying to enslave us god's giving us a spiritual transmission hoping we listen to that and
[2:25:27.500 --> 2:25:31.100]  choose the right thing but god loves us to give us free will so so we're living in this real
[2:25:31.100 --> 2:25:34.860]  science fiction movie and got warned two thousand years ago and got given the cheat sheet and how to
[2:25:34.860 --> 2:25:39.500]  get out of it you know this dad loves us but this whole debate with so many christians won't get
[2:25:39.500 --> 2:25:43.740]  involved as they just think the worst stuff gets well the more they're about to get beamed up by
[2:25:43.740 --> 2:25:50.700]  captain kirk so so from your research how does it really work a pre-tribulation rapture alex i know
[2:25:50.700 --> 2:25:55.820]  a lot of people do not most people that i run with do uh some people believe that jesus comes back
[2:25:55.820 --> 2:25:59.980]  halfway through the seven-year tribulation period and then some believe that he didn't come to the
[2:25:59.980 --> 2:26:04.380]  end of it but i believe that we should be according to the book of titus chapter number two looking
[2:26:04.380 --> 2:26:08.540]  for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great god to save your jesus christ so
[2:26:08.540 --> 2:26:12.940]  i'm not looking for the antichrist i'm looking for jesus to come back and i believe that during
[2:26:12.940 --> 2:26:19.900]  the seven-year tribulation period it's also known as the uh the the uh the time when god works with
[2:26:19.900 --> 2:26:25.100]  the nation of israel specifically and those two witnesses that you just referred to along with
[2:26:25.100 --> 2:26:30.380]  144 000 jews will be sent all over the world to preach that jesus was the messiah and i believe
[2:26:30.380 --> 2:26:35.660]  god's going to work predominantly not only but predominantly with the nation of israel many of
[2:26:35.660 --> 2:26:40.860]  them will be saved and will receive him as their messiah and so that's going to be the main emphasis
[2:26:40.860 --> 2:26:45.260]  in my uh understanding of the scriptures is that during the seven-year tribulation period
[2:26:45.260 --> 2:26:49.260]  while the church is in heaven going through the judgment seat of christ and the marriage
[2:26:49.260 --> 2:26:55.580]  supper of the lamb that god will be working down here on earth to reclaim the nation of israel that
[2:26:55.580 --> 2:27:01.740]  rejected him during uh this new testament church age that we're living in now and so that's my
[2:27:01.740 --> 2:27:07.580]  understanding of the scriptures and i am looking for jesus to come back at any time alex well
[2:27:07.580 --> 2:27:14.380]  absolutely i'm not mad at anybody that thinks it's a pre or middle or post all i know is i read the
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:21.980]  bible christians get persecuted a lot and uh i don't i only see a few cases with like moses or
[2:27:21.980 --> 2:27:28.540]  somebody where or i guess who got set the flaming chariot i mean i believe all that i know all that's
[2:27:28.540 --> 2:27:33.660]  true i mean i'm hoping that happens i'm just seeing this thing bearing down on us i think a lot of
[2:27:33.660 --> 2:27:36.860]  churches are going to buy into the mark of the beast because they think well it can't be the mark
[2:27:36.860 --> 2:27:41.420]  of the beast i would have been teleported out of here well there will be a lot of people that will
[2:27:41.420 --> 2:27:45.580]  be saved during the seven-year tribulation period i mean millions of people will be saved
[2:27:45.580 --> 2:27:51.500]  and they will be the ones that will be directly involved in that warfare of the antichrist against
[2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:55.900]  the people of god they'll be the ones that uh won't take the mark of the beast they're the ones that
[2:27:55.900 --> 2:27:59.740]  will be beheaded and martyred during the seven-year tribulation talk about that from your research
[2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:03.260]  and from the bible because we know it's all coming true it's all been proven to be accurate so
[2:28:03.260 --> 2:28:06.220]  and i respect you i'm not here i'm not even debating you pastor i really want to know your
[2:28:06.220 --> 2:28:11.420]  view on it because i agree with you how amazing is that going to be when world government and satanism
[2:28:11.420 --> 2:28:16.940]  and pedophilia and worship of the beast and ai avatar gods the people worship that are in the
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:23.820]  marketplaces 50 feet tall and all these animal human hybrids and hell being opened up i mean
[2:28:23.820 --> 2:28:30.700]  that's gonna really cause a revival isn't it what is satan betting on well he's betting
[2:28:30.700 --> 2:28:35.020]  on people being deceived and i just mentioned this from the pulpit just the other day i keep my
[2:28:35.020 --> 2:28:39.180]  bible handy uh but i would just mention from the pulpit of the day the bible tells us in the book
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:44.140]  of revelation that one angel is going to bind satan hand and foot and cast him into uh the
[2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:49.180]  bottom of spit he'll be there for a thousand years and then he'll be released for a short season
[2:28:49.180 --> 2:28:53.740]  and the bible tells us that after a thousand years of jesus ruling and reigning on this earth
[2:28:53.740 --> 2:28:59.660]  it'll be an absolute utopia it'll be peace prosperity like the world has never seen
[2:28:59.660 --> 2:29:04.460]  once satan is released for a short season in revelation chapter number 20 he will literally
[2:29:04.460 --> 2:29:10.620]  go and gather to himself and another army the bible says the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
[2:29:10.620 --> 2:29:16.380]  satan will be able to deceive multitudes of people to literally turn and fight against god
[2:29:17.180 --> 2:29:22.540]  after a thousand years of peace and prosperity so satan is a master deceiver that's what is it
[2:29:22.540 --> 2:29:28.220]  that the paradox that freedom breeds corruption i mean after a thousand years of total utopia under
[2:29:28.220 --> 2:29:35.100]  god people will still choose satan again exactly exactly and so that's why i'm not so shocked that
[2:29:35.100 --> 2:29:42.220]  today that people are so easily deceived and uh you know once you once you like build a relationship
[2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:47.180]  with jesus christ and you understand the scriptures he said you'll know the truth and truths will make
[2:29:47.180 --> 2:29:51.580]  you free the holy spirit that lives inside of us as believers will lead us and guide us into all
[2:29:51.580 --> 2:29:58.780]  truth and we can hear something news flash on the radio or the television and 99.9 percent of the time
[2:29:58.780 --> 2:30:03.020]  immediately i say to myself or whoever's with me that's not true by the way exactly i don't think
[2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:07.020]  satan is the people that serve the system over power realize this because i used to ignore
[2:30:07.020 --> 2:30:10.940]  my my discernment my inner sense with the protection of god it's never wrong pastor
[2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:16.220]  it's never wrong sometimes i'm misinterpreted by one percent like you said but this is incredible
[2:30:16.220 --> 2:30:23.100]  the more i just go with it it's amazing well this that's the reason why i wrote this book about
[2:30:23.660 --> 2:30:29.100]  sex abuse and cover-ups in the church in the name of the book is wolves among lambs because
[2:30:29.100 --> 2:30:35.180]  the bible tells us that the wolves will infiltrate the flock and there'll be sheep there'll be wolves
[2:30:35.180 --> 2:30:40.860]  in sheep's clothing and and that was the reason why i chose this title there is so much deception
[2:30:41.500 --> 2:30:47.660]  in churches today i i identify as an unaffiliated baptist i'm a fifth generation
[2:30:47.660 --> 2:30:53.100]  Baptist preacher um and i've been and i've been i was saved as a little boy and i've been
[2:30:53.660 --> 2:30:57.420]  privileged to grow up in a christian home i've been in church my whole life but i know it's hard
[2:30:57.420 --> 2:31:00.140]  for you to talk about you don't want to courage put the book you yourself are abused
[2:31:01.340 --> 2:31:05.980]  yes i was a victim at the age of 17 there was a man that spent a night with us that was a bible
[2:31:05.980 --> 2:31:12.220]  college student and uh he uh he abused me in my sleep and we called the sheriff he went to
[2:31:12.220 --> 2:31:16.540]  prison for two years and he's now a stiller registered sex offender that happened to me when
[2:31:16.540 --> 2:31:23.260]  i was 17 um and then as i was a young preacher training for the ministry uh i had a pastor that
[2:31:23.260 --> 2:31:29.420]  i was working for whiteheaded man 53 years old at the time that was grooming me i knew he was weird
[2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:33.340]  i didn't know the word grooming i didn't know the terminology but that's what he was doing i was
[2:31:33.340 --> 2:31:38.380]  single and uh he was trying his best and finally one night in the motel room he just flat out
[2:31:38.380 --> 2:31:44.540]  propositioned me so i tell about uh those two situations in the first part of this book as
[2:31:44.540 --> 2:31:48.780]  well as the scandal that broke here in our church two years ago let's talk about that when we come
[2:31:48.780 --> 2:31:54.940]  back because this isn't just about the sex is it it's about the spiritual stealing of the future
[2:31:54.940 --> 2:31:59.420]  of the innocence how do you quantify that in 30 seconds because it's a religion to the satanist
[2:31:59.420 --> 2:32:06.140]  to to to to to to abuse young people well it's it's it's about power we rest a lot against flesh
[2:32:06.140 --> 2:32:09.740]  and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness
[2:32:09.740 --> 2:32:15.900]  this world there is a spiritual warfare raging right now amongst god's people and satan uses a small
[2:32:15.900 --> 2:32:22.540]  percentage of that targets people through sexual abuse because it's very effective it's very effective
[2:32:22.540 --> 2:32:27.420]  exactly most the real allister crowley stuff all the devil works for stuff is sex rituals folks
[2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:32.460]  and and it's just they're obsessed with it because that's what god gave us man and woman creating
[2:32:32.460 --> 2:32:43.340]  new life that's powerful they want to hijack that power of genesis that god gave us let's go to one

[2:38:13.020 --> 2:38:16.780]  and hundreds of articles and all the lights and everything and i'm just like you better thank god
[2:38:16.780 --> 2:38:21.260]  on air and god doesn't want to be thanked god wants us to recognize where the power comes from
[2:38:22.140 --> 2:38:24.060]  so i just want to say praise jesus
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:31.980]  and and thank the father and the holy ghost that that i've got a stack of news articles i mentioned
[2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:36.380]  these yesterday i mean i should put the whole show on this 30 000 pedophiles under investigation
[2:38:36.380 --> 2:38:41.980]  top government officials huge rings control the german government top newspapers say they control
[2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:47.660]  the government with pedophile rings that's the satanic glue that holds it all together and then
[2:38:47.660 --> 2:38:52.620]  we're just here we already know all this we just gotta move on like okay now we know that no we
[2:38:52.620 --> 2:38:57.340]  know that because we're already informed now it's time to inform others we've been proven right it's
[2:38:57.340 --> 2:39:00.860]  not about shaking our finger and saying we were right you were wrong it's not about that it's like
[2:39:00.860 --> 2:39:07.660]  hey we got to do something about this so pastor i just really feel in my heart my spirit that
[2:39:07.660 --> 2:39:13.020]  thanking god for what's happening right now as negative as things are the enemy is doing all
[2:39:13.020 --> 2:39:18.220]  this because i can feel and see that the enemy is being broken right now do you agree with
[2:39:18.220 --> 2:39:24.460]  that and what can you say to it and get into your book well they're definitely being exposed
[2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:29.100]  there's no question about that things that i've personally i've been preaching now almost 26
[2:39:29.100 --> 2:39:37.260]  years i surrendered to preach in 1993 in july and i i am seeing things right now that i used to preach
[2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:44.140]  would happen now it's happening and it is exciting because we know that the bible's true the bible
[2:39:44.140 --> 2:39:48.460]  said that god be true and every man a liar and so it's exciting times without a doubt alex
[2:39:49.660 --> 2:39:54.540]  i mean mainline news that the government of germany's run by pedophiles i mean that's crazy
[2:39:56.060 --> 2:40:01.980]  that's not the only country it's everywhere no i know but i mean coming out how amazing is that
[2:40:01.980 --> 2:40:07.340]  i mean do it so well it's like as big as it gets well they just get they just get bolder they get
[2:40:07.340 --> 2:40:11.900]  bolder and they get bolder you said it earlier they go as far as they can then we drive them back to
[2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:16.860]  a couple inches and then we go to sleep and they drive us again and that's what's happened to churches
[2:40:16.860 --> 2:40:22.620]  and the reason why the reason why this book has been such a passion it's a 400 page book you expose
[2:40:22.620 --> 2:40:27.260]  how how people think of the church is evil no the devil gets in the church to turn people away
[2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:33.740]  explain that well wherever there are sheep there will be wolves circling the flock trying to find
[2:40:33.740 --> 2:40:38.460]  the weak and the vulnerable and the purpose of this book first of all was to tell my story for
[2:40:38.460 --> 2:40:43.260]  the thousands and thousands of victims out there that feel like it's only it's only happened to them
[2:40:43.260 --> 2:40:48.540]  and be able to be able to relate to what happened to me and how god gave me the strength to be able
[2:40:48.540 --> 2:40:55.340]  to confront it and tell somebody and get help and deal with it has been already super super helpful
[2:40:55.340 --> 2:41:00.060]  then the second half of the book talks about restoring our credibility and my wife and I
[2:41:00.060 --> 2:41:05.100]  launched a website entitled no more coverups.com because so many people were reaching out to me
[2:41:05.100 --> 2:41:09.580]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people Alex were reaching out to me saying what can I do
[2:41:09.580 --> 2:41:15.580]  and so we created this website and on there is a charter that people get people the url get
[2:41:15.580 --> 2:41:19.340]  as most are on it's radio listeners get people the url what where's the pack a couple websites
[2:41:19.340 --> 2:41:25.820]  here what's the best one to go to no more coverups.com yeah no more coverups.com is the website you
[2:41:25.820 --> 2:41:31.420]  can read the the the declaration of what to do to stop these co groups in our churches
[2:41:31.420 --> 2:41:36.460]  of these sexual abuses you can go and you can sign the online charter you can see who else has
[2:41:36.460 --> 2:41:41.260]  signed it it just creates an enormous amount of transparency and notice the left wants to talk
[2:41:41.260 --> 2:41:46.220]  about men that have wronged women and that goes on I say do it but oh when it comes to kids being
[2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:54.380]  abused oh that doesn't exist uh as a sexual abuse of every of every variety people in our church
[2:41:54.380 --> 2:41:59.100]  as many of them never talk about it people get married they have marital problems because they
[2:41:59.100 --> 2:42:05.180]  never confronted it uh it's been a blessing to me to see how many hundreds of people have reached
[2:42:05.180 --> 2:42:09.340]  out to me and said I read your book and I sit down with my husband or I sit down with my wife
[2:42:09.340 --> 2:42:13.820]  and told them about the time I was sexually abused as a teenager people are getting healing
[2:42:13.820 --> 2:42:18.780]  God's doing and you said that you were it was surprising to you to learn how many people were
[2:42:18.780 --> 2:42:23.980]  abused and for you you're saying satan does it because it's effective I've been really researching
[2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:29.660]  this it's surprising how many women's fathers abused them I mean this is like a satanic empire
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:33.820]  like like we see the tip of the iceberg but beneath the surface this is the whole enchilada
[2:42:34.540 --> 2:42:40.220]  listen listen to this right here male offenders who abuse girls had an average of 52 victims each
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:46.620]  men who molested boys had an average of 150 victims each this is all documented statistics
[2:42:46.620 --> 2:42:52.060]  only three percent of these crimes have ever been detected 49 percent of offenders of victims
[2:42:52.060 --> 2:42:57.980]  under age six were family members by the way I don't just believe the FBI statistics I know
[2:42:57.980 --> 2:43:02.300]  they're true the more I research this it's literally everything is obsessed with this
[2:43:03.660 --> 2:43:08.060]  one out of five girls and one out of six boys will be molested before their 18th birthday
[2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:15.180]  it's all this is in this book and so God is using this book right here my my story of sexual
[2:43:15.180 --> 2:43:21.900]  abuse and then the cover-ups and and it's an epidemic it's unbelievable and this is a open
[2:43:21.900 --> 2:43:26.380]  up a lot of people's eyes and you've been empowered by exposing because it would be you know hard for
[2:43:26.380 --> 2:43:31.900]  me to talk about something like that well God helped me with it back when I was 17 I mean I
[2:43:31.900 --> 2:43:38.540]  went straight to my parents I told them what happened the sheriff went and arrested the man
[2:43:38.540 --> 2:43:43.420]  he admitted it we didn't even have to go to trial and he served in prison and God helped
[2:43:43.420 --> 2:43:48.540]  me begin healing literally minutes after it happened and so I wasn't like greatly psychologically
[2:43:48.540 --> 2:43:54.540]  scarred but a lot of people have been abused for years they're psychologically scarred and they
[2:43:54.540 --> 2:43:59.900]  need help finding somebody to talk to open up to this is the real invisible empire though
[2:43:59.900 --> 2:44:05.420]  pedophilia is the big enchilada and in this website that you keep showing the no more cover-ups
[2:44:05.420 --> 2:44:11.420]  dot com website we have partners all over the united states where people can reach out to pastors
[2:44:11.420 --> 2:44:18.780]  and their wives and other uh couples christian couples that are are prepared and equipped to
[2:44:18.780 --> 2:44:24.300]  counsel them and help them get through times of trauma sexual abuse because the devil knows he's
[2:44:24.300 --> 2:44:30.700]  got to get you all your young well it's it's it's unbelievable how much of it's going on and how
[2:44:30.700 --> 2:44:35.420]  few people are talking about it uh but God has opened that door for me because of the scandal
[2:44:35.420 --> 2:44:41.500]  that happened here in our church oh listen I wasn't sexually abused one baby sitter tried and my dad
[2:44:41.500 --> 2:44:47.580]  went and beat the guys his dad's ass and all this but nothing really happened uh but but once I was
[2:44:47.580 --> 2:44:54.060]  12 13 I I was having sex with like 16 17 year old beauty queens and all of a sudden it was like
[2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:58.140]  satanists were trying to recruit me through their daughters so I was actually abused I didn't look
[2:44:58.140 --> 2:45:02.300]  at it from that perspective but that's what it was but that kind of gave me a bird's eye view
[2:45:02.300 --> 2:45:07.500]  and into how it works the other angle of the satanist uh but it's just it's a giant invisible
[2:45:07.500 --> 2:45:13.660]  empire and as soon as I had sex with those women uh what it opened me up to spiritually was uh
[2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:20.940]  uh just the only way to scrap is like Gandalf he runs into Sauron I mean it's basically just like
[2:45:20.940 --> 2:45:26.620]  that you tell whoever made that movie and did that particular scene um it's it's that's when it all
[2:45:26.620 --> 2:45:30.780]  started I was like oh my god what have I got into they were trying to recruit me but luckily I never
[2:45:30.780 --> 2:45:36.780]  got into it but people just don't know how big this is pastor well the bible tells us in the
[2:45:36.780 --> 2:45:42.300]  in the garden of Eden satan told Eve the serpent told Eve in the day that you eat of this fruit your
[2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:48.060]  eyes will be open and you will be as gods and they're exactly and once I was in a sex ritual not
[2:45:48.060 --> 2:45:53.020]  even knowing it it opened me up to that it was the knowledge of evil and satan is targeting
[2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:57.820]  everybody everybody doesn't get targeted the same way but everyone everyone's being targeted
[2:45:57.820 --> 2:46:02.460]  and I'm just very grateful to the lord that he's allowed me through my own personal experiences
[2:46:02.460 --> 2:46:07.180]  and things our church has been through to be an advocate for sex abuse victim absolutely I wasn't
[2:46:07.180 --> 2:46:10.220]  trying to one up you with what happened to you I just since we got into this I might as well just
[2:46:10.220 --> 2:46:14.700]  tell the story uh I should probably get into more detail at some point all right pastor Stacy
[2:46:14.700 --> 2:46:19.100]  chef we love you we appreciate your courage we salute you with this you live forth coming up
[2:46:19.100 --> 2:46:22.780]  and we just appreciate the great work you've done join us again the next couple weeks let's get
[2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:26.540]  into your book of details send me a copy I want to read it and because I know this is the key to
[2:46:26.540 --> 2:46:31.180]  everything I'll do it I'll give you I'll get the copy to mail tomorrow all right thank you sir
[2:46:31.180 --> 2:46:41.100]  yeah um the devil's sophisticated folks absolutely sophisticated but uh it's all about sex
[2:46:41.100 --> 2:46:46.380]  it's it's it's like they're saying team america it's not about sex gary but it is about sex it's
[2:46:46.380 --> 2:46:51.340]  like this power and they want that power because between a man and a woman we create new people
[2:46:51.340 --> 2:46:58.380]  in the whole universe god's given us incredible genesis power and the system is always trying
[2:46:58.380 --> 2:47:05.820]  to get in front of and it's always trying to manipulate that and I mean I pretty much told
[2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:10.140]  all of it on air I mean there's not much more to tell I mean when I was like 12 or 13 I look like
[2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:19.420]  I was 16 and you know and I thought man I'm lucky this is really great until until at least five or
[2:47:19.420 --> 2:47:24.940]  six times it all clicked to the next level and I was like oh my god it's devil worshipers again
[2:47:24.940 --> 2:47:27.980]  it's like lost boys they go man what's up with this county and vampires
[2:47:31.260 --> 2:47:37.580]  father of black teen killed in chop calls for national guard to clear autonomous zone
[2:47:37.580 --> 2:47:43.580]  article by kellen mcbreen the father of a 19-year-old boy who was shot and killed in
[2:47:43.580 --> 2:47:49.980]  seattle's chop last week is speaking out against the lawless no-cop zone at about three o'clock
[2:47:49.980 --> 2:47:55.500]  this monday morning shots were fired at a jeep charity killing a 16-year-old male badly
[2:47:55.500 --> 2:48:01.420]  injuring a 14-year-old two other teens have been shot this week and many citizens are saying it's
[2:48:01.420 --> 2:48:08.860]  time to shut down the experimental occupied area horris lorenzo anderson spoke with k i ro
[2:48:08.860 --> 2:48:14.300]  seattle in an emotional interview following his son's death i ain't been sleeping you see my eyes
[2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:19.340]  i've been crying i'm trying not to cry on tv this doesn't look like a protest to me no more
[2:48:19.340 --> 2:48:22.860]  that looks like they just took over and said we can take over whenever we want to
[2:48:22.860 --> 2:48:29.180]  anderson also said the national guard should be deployed to break up the violent autonomous zone
[2:48:29.180 --> 2:48:36.380]  i'm millie weaver reporting listeners are saying what i was privately saying of the crew last night
[2:48:37.100 --> 2:48:40.780]  we may have just broken not just the biggest story in infor war history
[2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:47.340]  but one of the biggest stories period the state of texas confirms that the cdc and nih
[2:48:47.340 --> 2:48:54.940]  have created a system where anyone that has a sore throat or a runny nose or who has been
[2:48:54.940 --> 2:49:01.260]  in contact with someone covet 19 is then added into the database as having a case that is counted
[2:49:01.260 --> 2:49:06.620]  as a case of covet 19 it's in the NIH documents it's at the state level but confirmed in texas
[2:49:06.620 --> 2:49:11.980]  we're not confirming it's in other states this is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting
[2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:17.020]  people that died gunshot wounds and stuff in the covet column and the false positive test that's
[2:49:17.020 --> 2:49:24.700]  all huge this is beyond that mega criminal activity and we've got these ever county commission videos
[2:49:24.700 --> 2:49:29.180]  where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the world is this the full video is posted
[2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:37.820]  at band on video get it out expose the hoax you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:49:37.820 --> 2:49:52.620]  it seemed like yesterday but it was long ago seems like yesterday
[2:49:55.500 --> 2:49:56.780]  but it was long ago
[2:49:56.780 --> 2:50:05.980]  jane it was love that she was a queen my night there in the darkness with the radio
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:14.460]  and the secrets that we shared mountains that we moved mountains that we moved
[2:50:17.100 --> 2:50:23.340]  called like a wildfire out of control till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to
[2:50:23.340 --> 2:50:26.940]  burn and then you figure out you're gonna die and then all you care about is humanity
[2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:30.860]  that's gotta keep going on and on
[2:50:33.820 --> 2:50:37.260]  all right john raport's coming up with huge news that's incredibly critical
[2:50:39.260 --> 2:50:45.420]  but let me get down to the basic facts here money and word of mouth and psychic prayer is what
[2:50:45.420 --> 2:50:51.420]  makes this info wars thing go around and you can see now as there's massive shutdowns of everybody's
[2:50:51.420 --> 2:50:57.740]  free speech how precious this place is and i've told the story a hundred times i'll tell it again
[2:50:57.740 --> 2:51:02.140]  when i was totally banned everywhere two years ago people said how you taking it what's it like
[2:51:02.140 --> 2:51:06.460]  and i said they're coming for you next i'm the beta test i'm worried about everybody it's a takeover
[2:51:07.580 --> 2:51:12.780]  it wasn't selflessness that i was saying that it was the truth and so now we're here
[2:51:13.340 --> 2:51:18.220]  read its own by the communist chinese uh four of the big six production houses are but they're
[2:51:18.220 --> 2:51:25.900]  just fronts for the globalists as well and then we come out and break yesterday that the state of
[2:51:25.900 --> 2:51:31.500]  texas admits they're ordered to create 15 times the covid cases for every supposed real case that's
[2:51:31.500 --> 2:51:36.140]  a fraud too and they say we don't even need a covid test if you have the sniffles or a sore throat
[2:51:36.140 --> 2:51:42.540]  that's covid and then 15 people around you on average will say have covid and then i put that
[2:51:42.540 --> 2:51:47.260]  article out yesterday that video and i got all these emails and calls well alex here's the hill
[2:51:47.260 --> 2:51:54.220]  months ago you didn't know probable coronavirus deaths now included in cdc totals they say it all
[2:51:54.220 --> 2:52:00.300]  right here you're like well why'd they admit it because they hide it in plain view instead of
[2:52:00.300 --> 2:52:07.420]  hiding it and then it's like well okay that's just what they're doing it's all a fraud that's
[2:52:07.420 --> 2:52:12.700]  killing the economy and now lockdown twos here what does trump do how does he speak out how does
[2:52:12.700 --> 2:52:17.980]  he challenge it how does he because they'll say every death is his fault if he doesn't capitulate
[2:52:17.980 --> 2:52:24.860]  to the terrorism and now now gates says oh it's the flu oh the pig virus out of china there's
[2:52:24.860 --> 2:52:32.540]  always something new they're creating phobias to control us i just want to thank listeners

[2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:26.620]  guest the callers the host we will fail i'm stating the obvious here i just want to thank you on july

[2:55:55.020 --> 2:55:56.300]  done right before here
[2:55:56.300 --> 2:56:08.940]  for our confab yeah so on top of what alex was telling you about what he and rob do uncovered
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:17.100]  about texas and the cdc i've got a lot more and the reason that i want to run this down is because
[2:56:18.620 --> 2:56:22.140]  everybody's got to know how the fakery is being
[2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:29.500]  being committed because it involves death it's not just case numbers we're talking about
[2:56:30.300 --> 2:56:38.220]  death killing murder you know that sort of thing the serious stuff so finally the new
[2:56:38.220 --> 2:56:43.180]  york times steps forward partially june 27th and says
[2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:55.260]  headline 43 percent of all cova deaths in the us are in nursing homes and long-term care facilities
[2:56:55.260 --> 2:57:11.180]  for the elderly 43 percent in at least 24 states a majority of deaths are linked to nursing homes
[2:57:11.180 --> 2:57:19.580]  other long care facilities for the elderly such as minnesota 77 percent pennsylvania 68
[2:57:19.580 --> 2:57:34.620]  north carolina 57 idaho 62 california 48 ohio 57 new hampshire 80 road island 77 are you kidding me
[2:57:34.620 --> 2:57:44.620]  i mean look at the fakery the incredible fakery they're relabeling these deaths of the old people
[2:57:44.620 --> 2:57:52.380]  cova 19 that's on top of all of the fraud of the coding saying that somebody you know fell
[2:57:52.380 --> 2:58:00.220]  downstairs is automatically cova 19 or rewriting on the death certificates cova 19 this is on
[2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:07.180]  top of all of that they're just saying that all these old people are dying because of the virus
[2:58:07.180 --> 2:58:13.340]  which is a total lie that i've been saying since the beginning of all of this they never
[2:58:13.340 --> 2:58:19.100]  approved that they discovered a new virus in the first place in china went through all of this
[2:58:19.100 --> 2:58:26.540]  meticulously in great detail in a number of articles etc but we're entering the weird wacky
[2:58:26.540 --> 2:58:33.820]  insane psychopathic murderous world of the cdc and those statistics and all of that to even show
[2:58:33.820 --> 2:58:43.260]  you from inside the loony bin they're lying and lying and lying so what is the new york times
[2:58:43.260 --> 2:58:51.820]  leaving out they're leaving out all the elderly people who are dying in hospitals at home alone
[2:58:51.820 --> 2:59:02.540]  isolated cut off which is a gigantic number as i said last week cova 19 is old people it's killing
[2:59:02.540 --> 2:59:10.860]  old people all of these old people already already already already before any of this started
[2:59:10.860 --> 2:59:19.740]  were already suffering from long-term debilitating multiple health conditions treated for years
[2:59:19.740 --> 2:59:30.860]  sometimes decades with toxic pharmaceutical drugs and then on top of that to secure their premature
[2:59:30.860 --> 2:59:41.820]  deaths they're terrified by the specter or the reality of a cova 19 diagnosis terrified that's
[2:59:41.820 --> 2:59:49.900]  serious stuff they're isolated from family and friends in these facilities or even in their
[2:59:49.900 --> 2:59:56.540]  apartments no visitors allowed no family and friends they're alone they're isolated they die
[2:59:58.780 --> 3:00:01.660]  that's what's happening has nothing to do with the virus
[3:00:01.660 --> 3:00:15.580]  that's cova all around the world so let me go to other statistics here for example now we're
[3:00:15.580 --> 3:00:23.580]  being told okay 128 000 deaths from cova 19 in the united states i was all baloney but let's
[3:00:23.580 --> 3:00:29.980]  accepting that so if you took the 43 percent of all the cova deaths in the nursing homes and
[3:00:29.980 --> 3:00:36.140]  long-term facilities and you just wiped them off the slate as being cova deaths you would have instead
[3:00:36.140 --> 3:00:45.740]  72 960 and then if you subtracted off of that all of the old people dying prematurely terrified to
[3:00:45.740 --> 3:00:53.500]  death by the diagnosis at home or in the hospitals you would subtract another unknown but gigantic
[3:00:53.500 --> 3:00:59.500]  number from 72 000 and you see how you're cutting it all the way down and down and down even within
[3:01:00.300 --> 3:01:08.620]  the insane cdc world of statistic gathering and so on that's what you would be seeing and none of
[3:01:08.620 --> 3:01:18.380]  this would be even a blip on the radar of an ordinary flu season so let me give you some
[3:01:18.380 --> 3:01:31.500]  statistics you see i'm using a source now which is trying to get worldwide old people dying
[3:01:32.620 --> 3:01:38.780]  of supposed cova 19 what are the absolute numbers not the percentages not the rate all
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:46.060]  of that crap the absolute number and so far they haven't been able to get it but they do have it
[3:01:46.060 --> 3:01:59.660]  for new york city okay in new york city if you took these two age groups 65 to 74 and 75 plus
[3:02:01.180 --> 3:02:11.420]  okay that are claimed to be dying from cova 19 that would be 73 percent of all of the claimed
[3:02:11.420 --> 3:02:20.140]  cova deaths in new york city 73 percent which are not cova deaths of all at all of course just
[3:02:20.140 --> 3:02:26.620]  they're what i described to you just now they are the old people who are already ill for decades
[3:02:27.580 --> 3:02:34.380]  teetering on the edge with the immune systems in a state of collapse treating with toxic drugs
[3:02:34.380 --> 3:02:49.900]  etc etc etc okay and then in new york if that's not enough 73.6 of all the cova deaths are
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:58.700]  in the old people study that i mentioned last week on the show but i'm going to reiterate it
[3:02:58.700 --> 3:03:05.660]  again because it's so important the study done out of the biggest chain of hospitals in new york
[3:03:05.660 --> 3:03:16.780]  state north world what do they find in new york city in the age group of 66 and older in new
[3:03:16.780 --> 3:03:30.540]  york city those people who went to hospitals and were put on ventilators ready 97.2 of them died
[3:03:33.180 --> 3:03:41.900]  66 and older in new york city put on ventilators in hospitals 97.2 died
[3:03:41.900 --> 3:03:50.220]  does i'm going to say well you see because of the virus and they were already sick and
[3:03:50.220 --> 3:03:58.140]  and uh close no no no no no no no i'm sorry nobody in his right mind continues to treat
[3:03:58.140 --> 3:04:06.300]  a well-defined group of patients 66 and older with a procedure that is killing them 97 percent of
[3:04:06.300 --> 3:04:16.780]  the time unless orders are coming down to do it insurers are paying out more money because of it
[3:04:17.420 --> 3:04:23.420]  money is saved because the people are dying prematurely and doctors are willing to follow
[3:04:23.420 --> 3:04:34.140]  orders regardless of the results of the treatment 97 percent 97.2 that comes from the hill
[3:04:34.140 --> 3:04:36.460]  in late april
[3:04:40.140 --> 3:04:46.540]  i mean these are just staggering okay what i'm talking to you about it's just completely staggering
[3:04:48.700 --> 3:04:55.180]  it puts an arrow in the heart of anthony fouchie and all of his insanity the latest of witches oh
[3:04:55.180 --> 3:05:03.500]  we could soon be seeing a hundred thousand new cases of covet a day he's saying the man is an agent
[3:05:03.500 --> 3:05:09.900]  of destruction okay he wants to keep the economy locked down as long as possible level the economy
[3:05:09.900 --> 3:05:16.940]  of the united states record completely and keep people on lockdown until the gates of vaccine
[3:05:16.940 --> 3:05:23.660]  appears and is ready for use that is anthony fouchie that is anthony fouchie
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:33.260]  a hundred thousand new cases a day out of the frigging line after the break i'll have another

[3:08:04.620 --> 3:08:19.580]  jones show and now your host john rapaport okay we're back all right so let me give you another
[3:08:19.580 --> 3:08:26.140]  piece here this is quite fantastic i'm going to try to pronounce his name correctly john
[3:08:26.140 --> 3:08:37.500]  pospa chal pospa chal medium dot com questions for lockdown apologists okay so this man has done
[3:08:37.500 --> 3:08:48.700]  yeoman work studying actually 13 nations in europe and ecuador and new york city and what he's
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:09:00.300]  done is he's looked at the statements about covet deaths rising in each country and what he
[3:09:00.300 --> 3:09:09.180]  discovered was that the covet death statistics were trending down on a downturn until the lockdowns
[3:09:09.180 --> 3:09:19.340]  occurred okay in all dozen countries all dozen countries and ecuador and new york city magic
[3:09:20.540 --> 3:09:27.100]  as soon as the lockdowns were declared the covet death numbers precipitously rose
[3:09:27.100 --> 3:09:38.540]  in all of these countries right immediately immediately so among the many questions that
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:50.700]  he asks the one that is the most pressing is how does the virus wait okay until the lockdowns
[3:09:50.700 --> 3:09:59.420]  are declared in all of these countries and then suddenly boom here comes the covet deaths rising
[3:09:59.420 --> 3:10:08.380]  precipitously how does that work indeed indeed and the answer to that is as i've been saying all
[3:10:08.380 --> 3:10:15.020]  along it has nothing to do with the virus when the lockdowns were declared in all of these places
[3:10:15.020 --> 3:10:27.100]  what happened was the first most vulnerable people most ragged and on the edge with the weakest immune
[3:10:27.100 --> 3:10:38.060]  systems most vulnerable to the terror of a potential covet 19 diagnosis the elderly the old people
[3:10:38.060 --> 3:10:46.220]  were the first to die already on the edge of immune system collapse they died and that accounted for
[3:10:46.220 --> 3:10:55.340]  the precipitous rise of so-called covet death statistics right after the lockdowns nothing
[3:10:55.340 --> 3:11:05.820]  to do with a virus not anything to do with a virus whatsoever because if it were a virus the virus
[3:11:05.820 --> 3:11:12.220]  would wait virus is sitting there thinking okay we're just going to wait until a declare lockdown
[3:11:12.220 --> 3:11:18.860]  you see so easy boys don't attack everybody all at once just cool your heels okay here comes the
[3:11:18.860 --> 3:11:26.860]  lockdown you're ready bang okay now we kill everybody sure sure sure sure sure sure i mean
[3:11:26.860 --> 3:11:36.060]  this is so transparent anybody can see the truth nothing to do with the virus total
[3:11:36.060 --> 3:11:44.700]  fakery from the beginning the whole thing is a fraud it was from Wuhan on it's all about
[3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:53.900]  selling the story about a virus the idea of a virus and on that basis locking down the planet
[3:11:53.900 --> 3:12:00.140]  rigging and fixing and inventing the case numbers and the deaths and attributing them
[3:12:00.780 --> 3:12:07.900]  to covet 19 bringing on the computer predictions and projections that i've talked about here
[3:12:07.900 --> 3:12:19.820]  before by that object failure criminal Neil Ferguson in england and then we had the lockdowns
[3:12:19.820 --> 3:12:25.820]  the economic devastation which is what this is all about ushering in brave new world new world
[3:12:25.820 --> 3:12:33.820]  order globalism technocracy etc etc etc now there's one more study that i want to talk about here
[3:12:34.700 --> 3:12:44.300]  piling it up for you today okay ammo serious ammo this is an article in the atlantic
[3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:53.500]  the atlantic an unbelievable article something titled like how could the cdc make this mistake
[3:12:55.260 --> 3:13:05.420]  this is where the cdc readily admits that they've been mixing cases that test positive
[3:13:05.420 --> 3:13:11.820]  with the antibody test with people who test positive on the so-called viral test which
[3:13:11.820 --> 3:13:21.820]  is a pcr lumping them all together and calling them all covid cases right yeah how could the cdc
[3:13:21.820 --> 3:13:30.060]  make that mistake mistake mistake mistake okay so the article goes through all of this the cdc
[3:13:30.060 --> 3:13:41.180]  admits it major other states are doing it too georgia texas etc etc etc why is this important
[3:13:41.180 --> 3:13:47.500]  because if you read the atlantic article from all that one can gather what the so-called
[3:13:47.500 --> 3:13:53.660]  experts are saying is that case numbers ought to be based on the pcr test the viral test alone
[3:13:54.300 --> 3:14:00.860]  not on the antibody test therefore lumping the two tests together what are you going to get
[3:14:00.860 --> 3:14:09.100]  just use a little common sense some people are going to test for covid on the pcr viral test
[3:14:09.100 --> 3:14:15.180]  and some people are going to test positive on the antibody test and you add those two together
[3:14:15.180 --> 3:14:20.700]  and you get huge numbers of cases and you say look at all the exploding cases of covid in the
[3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:28.060]  country which is a total lie in a fabrication by the cdc which the atlantic is calling a mistake
[3:14:29.420 --> 3:14:35.580]  a mistake just the kind of mistake that the cdc has made in the past which i've detailed on this
[3:14:35.580 --> 3:14:43.740]  show maybe 17 times in the swine flu of 2009 when they stopped counting cases in america
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:50.540]  all together the cdc while continuing to claim there were tens of thousands of cases in america
[3:14:50.540 --> 3:15:00.140]  and they stopped counting cases as charol atkinson of cbs revealed in 2009 because the overwhelming
[3:15:00.140 --> 3:15:05.500]  percentage of test samples from patients were coming back from the labs with no sign of
[3:15:05.500 --> 3:15:14.700]  swine flu or any other kind of flu yes indeed he do but the cdc kept saying tens of thousands of
[3:15:14.700 --> 3:15:23.820]  cases of swine flu and they eventually said and i've documented this 22 million cases of swine
[3:15:23.820 --> 3:15:31.820]  flu in america so the cdc yeah that's right 22 billion oh rapaport couldn't be right about yes
[3:15:31.820 --> 3:15:41.500]  web md i've got the article i've detailed it i've got the quote so the cdc has got a track record
[3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:48.700]  of not making mistakes but of lying concealing covering up fabricating numbers

[3:19:39.660 --> 3:19:42.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:42.380 --> 3:19:55.260]  what i hate is looking up and seeing kim trails in a clear blue sky today
[3:19:56.460 --> 3:20:01.580]  okay back on the show so here's a suggestion
[3:20:04.620 --> 3:20:09.020]  you got to tell me what trump is doing because i don't know but he's certainly
[3:20:09.020 --> 3:20:14.700]  going to hold more rallies between now and the election could be the shortest election campaign
[3:20:14.700 --> 3:20:22.620]  in presidential history why can't the crowds at these rallies just start yelling in unison
[3:20:23.660 --> 3:20:35.100]  open the economy fire Fauci not just once over and over for maybe 10 minutes not letting the man
[3:20:35.100 --> 3:20:45.180]  talk when he starts to talk i'm talking about trump just yelling open the economy fire Fauci
[3:20:45.740 --> 3:20:55.900]  over and over and over at every single rally until it penetrates all the way through to his brain
[3:20:55.900 --> 3:21:07.020]  and his guts and he knows what his base wants more than anything else that base did provide him
[3:21:07.020 --> 3:21:14.540]  enough margin to get elected president 2016 it could do the same now
[3:21:14.540 --> 3:21:26.780]  now but it appears that we're gonna have to rely on the people not the president to make it clear
[3:21:26.780 --> 3:21:37.900]  as to what they want back to work open the economy fire Fauci get rid of this pathetic
[3:21:37.900 --> 3:21:50.940]  balloon as soon as possible he serves at the pleasure of the president there is no pleasure
[3:21:50.940 --> 3:21:59.820]  left he's a minor functionary when you actually look at the federal government he's an employee
[3:21:59.820 --> 3:22:06.860]  of a sub department of an agency that is under a cabinet post called health and human services
[3:22:06.860 --> 3:22:16.140]  which is under the president tomorrow trump could say you're gone out trump could if he wants to
[3:22:17.420 --> 3:22:25.580]  stand up in front of his people at these gigantic rallies he could say
[3:22:28.220 --> 3:22:36.140]  i admit i made a terrible mistake i never should have permitted the economy to be closed down and
[3:22:36.140 --> 3:22:45.900]  locked down i listened to the wrong people they're gone as of right now this will never happen again
[3:22:46.940 --> 3:22:54.300]  he's going to have to convince his people that he means it and it's not just bloviating
[3:22:56.620 --> 3:23:04.940]  but he could say that he could say so it's back to work the door of the economy is open
[3:23:04.940 --> 3:23:11.340]  and nothing is going to close it again a lot of heat
[3:23:13.820 --> 3:23:22.380]  but so what he's supposed to be able to take it but it's going to take the people to remind him
[3:23:22.380 --> 3:23:34.940]  him open the economy fire Fauci if Fauci has his way the economy is going to be
[3:23:35.900 --> 3:23:44.380]  locked down between now and the election the devastation we've seen so far is only going
[3:23:44.380 --> 3:23:51.020]  to be part of the story the economic devastation of what's going to happen between now and the
[3:23:51.020 --> 3:24:01.740]  election this little worm Fauci is running the show on behalf of bill gates on behalf of the
[3:24:01.740 --> 3:24:13.180]  world economic forum on behalf of the world health organization d un etc etc etc he's the mouthpiece
[3:24:13.180 --> 3:24:26.940]  think about all of this data that i've been presenting other people have been presenting
[3:24:26.940 --> 3:24:34.300]  you've heard from rob do and alex the fabrication of this the murder of old people
[3:24:34.300 --> 3:24:43.100]  in order to build up the statistics on covet 19 to convince the nation and the world that
[3:24:43.100 --> 3:24:47.820]  this is a reality when it's a complete fake and a fraud from the beginning
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:25:00.060]  in order to destroy freedom destroy the country destroy the economy destroy everything that can
[3:25:00.060 --> 3:25:08.460]  be destroyed does trump not know that there are dozens of other medical experts out there with
[3:25:08.460 --> 3:25:15.340]  resumes far more impressive than Fauci right now who would be more than willing to step forward
[3:25:15.340 --> 3:25:23.260]  stand next to the president and testify that every single measure that Fauci has recommended and
[3:25:23.260 --> 3:25:29.580]  imposed the distancing the masks the lockdowns etc are completely counterproductive and insane
[3:25:29.580 --> 3:25:37.340]  does trump not know this is he so oblivious these medical experts of a conventional nature
[3:25:37.340 --> 3:25:44.220]  are all around us they would be more than willing to step up to the plate
[3:25:44.220 --> 3:25:52.220]  they're not being called on Fauci is part of a political hierarchy that has nothing to do with
[3:25:52.220 --> 3:26:01.820]  skill and handling outbreaks or epidemics or anything of the sort nothing zero he's managed to
[3:26:01.820 --> 3:26:10.780]  worm his way up through the food chain and he's not going to be able to do anything about it
[3:26:10.780 --> 3:26:19.260]  from his way up through the food chain to the top of the coronavirus task force just as he did within
[3:26:19.260 --> 3:26:24.860]  his own agency in the federal government that's how the game is played that's how it works it's
[3:26:24.860 --> 3:26:32.460]  political who backs you whose money is behind you whose part what partnerships do you have
[3:26:32.460 --> 3:26:41.340]  have with relevant corporations in his case drug companies etc etc etc it's all about juice getting
[3:26:41.340 --> 3:26:49.180]  the juice and moving up in the food chain has nothing to do with reality truth science it has
[3:26:49.180 --> 3:26:55.740]  to do with selling out it has to do with who do I want to sell out to who is the most powerful
[3:26:55.740 --> 3:27:05.900]  person on the food chain I can sell out to well Bill Gates looks pretty good to me sure let's try
[3:27:05.900 --> 3:27:11.980]  him now contrary to what most people think I don't believe that Gates is the top of the food chain
[3:27:11.980 --> 3:27:20.940]  at all I don't care if he can wash what is it 100 maybe 200 billion over and over again through
[3:27:20.940 --> 3:27:26.700]  through funding this funding that making profits off of investments refunding and so on
[3:27:29.260 --> 3:27:35.740]  compared to some governments that's actually jump change so Bill Gates is himself
[3:27:38.460 --> 3:27:44.860]  not the highest player but let's say he's the highest player the fact you could find to sell out
[3:27:44.860 --> 3:27:55.340]  to that's how the game is played I've seen it up close and personal on a minor level in the
[3:27:55.340 --> 3:28:02.380]  state of Nevada and it's not pretty believe me when I testified in front of a legislature there
[3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:11.180]  about childhood toxic med meds and watch people in the committee room and watch them fawning
[3:28:11.180 --> 3:28:15.900]  over certain people simply because they were higher on the food chain and then somebody else
[3:28:15.900 --> 3:28:20.620]  would walk into the room who was even higher and everybody would go flitting over to them
[3:28:23.500 --> 3:28:31.820]  it's pure insanity the closer you get to bureaucracy and political hierarchy the more
[3:28:31.820 --> 3:28:42.460]  insane it looks feels smells and reeks of corruption and the worst instincts social
[3:28:42.460 --> 3:28:51.100]  instincts of humans which is to fawn and to flutter and to gather around
[3:28:51.100 --> 3:29:00.220]  the people who are supposed to be the heroes of the moment who are nothing of the sort
[3:29:02.620 --> 3:29:06.300]  and that's how this whole thing is being sold out of a political hierarchy
[3:29:06.860 --> 3:29:09.100]  and Fauci is doing it and he's got to go
[3:29:11.660 --> 3:29:17.740]  as a first step as a first step and all of the fakery in the statistics has been revealed here
[3:29:17.740 --> 3:29:24.460]  on info wars and in other places has to be put front and center and let's not pussy foot around
[3:29:24.460 --> 3:29:32.700]  anymore COVID-19 is all about killing old people that's what it is when you actually look at it

[3:33:33.660 --> 3:33:45.900]  news today you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:04.620 --> 3:34:05.900]  last segment here
[3:34:08.300 --> 3:34:13.100]  you know what you have to realize is that these public health agencies like ccc
[3:34:15.100 --> 3:34:19.900]  world health organization they can say whatever they want to about a virus
[3:34:22.540 --> 3:34:30.220]  this isn't science we're talking here they can say we found one we didn't find one it came back
[3:34:30.220 --> 3:34:36.620]  it didn't come back in the case of sars for example 2003 some of you might remember that one
[3:34:37.980 --> 3:34:46.300]  that was also said to be a coronavirus caused all kinds of havoc in canada supposedly people
[3:34:46.300 --> 3:34:54.460]  locking themselves down newspapers were running 25 stories a day mainly because the world health
[3:34:54.460 --> 3:35:00.460]  organization said don't fly into toronto because you know you could die because of the virus virus
[3:35:00.460 --> 3:35:09.740]  whatever whatever whatever and all of a sudden magically the virus went away they said it went
[3:35:09.740 --> 3:35:18.140]  away and when the dust cleared on this global catastrophe their own official figures said
[3:35:18.140 --> 3:35:28.060]  that the total deaths all around the world the entire globe 800 800 out of at the time
[3:35:29.020 --> 3:35:37.980]  6.2 billion something they said it disappeared hey the virus just disappeared now if they want to
[3:35:37.980 --> 3:35:43.660]  say it came back they can do that too because they're starting to do that again they got a new
[3:35:43.660 --> 3:35:50.380]  pig virus in china they're talking about or maybe it's the same one from 2009 swine flu
[3:35:51.820 --> 3:35:58.060]  they just make this up this is hollywood we don't like that script we'll take this script
[3:35:58.060 --> 3:36:05.340]  let's change the storyline this time okay we couldn't make the swine flu thing fly in 2009
[3:36:05.340 --> 3:36:10.860]  because it was exposed that nobody actually had the virus they couldn't find it but this time we
[3:36:10.860 --> 3:36:16.380]  can do a better job so let's bring it back again and make a sequel to the movie and we'll call it
[3:36:16.940 --> 3:36:27.020]  uh the fourth wave okay and we'll say that COVID-19 virus disappeared for three months but pig
[3:36:27.020 --> 3:36:33.100]  virus suddenly showed up and just started leveling people left and right and the public will buy it
[3:36:33.100 --> 3:36:43.740]  because we can sell it because they're too stupid and we can sell them anything that's the attitude
[3:36:43.740 --> 3:36:50.460]  of these agencies like the cdc like the world health organization like bill gates like fouchy
[3:36:50.460 --> 3:36:57.420]  like the world economic forum like the un like every globalist Rockefeller type organization in the
[3:36:57.420 --> 3:37:05.660]  world because they've gotten themselves on to a good thing the best thing they've ever got themselves
[3:37:05.660 --> 3:37:13.100]  on to in the history of their existence is the virus as a story to sell because look what you
[3:37:13.100 --> 3:37:19.740]  can do with it you can lock down people they finally figured it out china set the tables china
[3:37:19.740 --> 3:37:24.140]  locked down 50 million people overnight do you think that was an accident do you really think
[3:37:24.140 --> 3:37:31.420]  china just oh spontaneously responded to the threat my goodness we have to lock down 50 million people
[3:37:31.420 --> 3:37:35.820]  and send a signal to the rest of the world that they can do it too for the first time
[3:37:36.540 --> 3:37:42.940]  because after all that was one of the key events in this whole insane episode called COVID which was
[3:37:42.940 --> 3:37:49.180]  china locking down 50 million people overnight in three cities early on they broke the ice they
[3:37:49.180 --> 3:37:55.900]  set the president it was a new model etc etc do you think that was just oh Beijing decided we
[3:37:55.900 --> 3:38:05.900]  got a lockdown 15 no this was planned years in advance this is how these things these covert ops
[3:38:05.900 --> 3:38:17.100]  work they just needed not a virus a story about a virus to sell to justify the lockdowns they already
[3:38:17.100 --> 3:38:24.620]  had lots of sick people dying from pneumonia in china at the rate of about 300 000 a year no COVID
[3:38:24.620 --> 3:38:35.180]  no nothing just air pollution people are old they have lung infections etc etc etc okay okay
[3:38:37.420 --> 3:38:45.100]  chinese sold it they were supposed to sell it that was a story that was the plan that was the whole
[3:38:45.100 --> 3:38:53.740]  thing and then in this movie this insane movie all of a sudden uh cgc and world health organizations
[3:38:53.740 --> 3:39:02.540]  say wow well if china is doing that this virus must really be dangerous oh yes oh my god everybody's
[3:39:02.540 --> 3:39:08.460]  got to wear a mask everybody's got to say we've got a lockdown Italy next and then we got a beach
[3:39:08.460 --> 3:39:15.180]  head in europe some other kind of uk us has to lock down oh indeed how are we gonna lock down the us well
[3:39:15.180 --> 3:39:22.780]  we've got this idiot neil ferguson at the imperial college being funded by bill gates oh neil yeah he's
[3:39:22.780 --> 3:39:29.420]  that failure right wasn't he the guy in 2005 who predicted that 200 billion people could die
[3:39:29.420 --> 3:39:36.220]  because a bird flew and the final statistic was a few hundred people oh yeah that neil ferguson
[3:39:36.220 --> 3:39:43.180]  bring him on put him next to his uh old computer with what is it for trance and let him come up
[3:39:43.180 --> 3:39:48.700]  with a figure of say i don't know half a million people will die in the uk and two million in the
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:57.820]  us handed to fouchy let fouchy sell it to trump and the whole thing now we got a move now we got a
[3:39:57.820 --> 3:40:05.260]  real movie now we got a devastation movie uh about the economy in america and other countries except
[3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:11.900]  it isn't just a movie anymore it's real because real people are out of work and real people are dying
[3:40:11.900 --> 3:40:17.580]  and getting addicted to drugs and committing suicide and killing other people and going crazy
[3:40:17.580 --> 3:40:24.860]  and they can't find work and small business owners are closing down oh yeah the real stuff is
[3:40:24.860 --> 3:40:30.700]  happening they're going bankrupt they can't reopen so they're selling out their small businesses to
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:39.980]  larger investors who are gobbling uh all of this property and business up like predators that they
[3:40:39.980 --> 3:40:51.580]  are all because of this lunatic failure of a computer modeler neil ferguson and because the
[3:40:51.580 --> 3:40:58.780]  chinese regime who locked down 50 million people and because they figured out a great scheme for
[3:40:58.780 --> 3:41:06.700]  inflating statistics not just counting and recounting and double counting and triple counting and
[3:41:06.700 --> 3:41:13.020]  fake counting but actually causing the premature deaths of old people and killing
[3:41:15.580 --> 3:41:17.740]  killing murdering
[3:41:17.740 --> 3:41:34.620]  killing murdering to inflate their numbers to sell the mood to sell the store and this is what
[3:41:34.620 --> 3:41:44.700]  you people who are laundering the streets keeping social distancing terrified of catching the bug
[3:41:44.700 --> 3:41:52.300]  oh i'm going to stay on lockdown until the vaccine arrives yes that's what all you people are
[3:41:52.300 --> 3:42:08.380]  succumbing to the crooked fear of nothing of nothing of nothing there was a time in america
[3:42:08.380 --> 3:42:15.020]  when this whole thing would have been over in five minutes when the people of america would
[3:42:15.020 --> 3:42:21.020]  have shrugged this off like a stupid bad dream and told fowl to you what to do with his numbers and
[3:42:21.020 --> 3:42:25.900]  his statistics and if the president went along they would have told the president what to do too
[3:42:28.060 --> 3:42:32.060]  regardless and they would have gone back to work period
[3:42:32.060 --> 3:42:43.500]  think of the men who managed to unionize the ford automotive plant
[3:42:45.100 --> 3:42:52.620]  against the tyrant and reford how did they do it they eventually went to work and they staged
[3:42:52.620 --> 3:42:58.940]  a sit-down strike at their work benches that's not an easy thing to do you go to work you go into
[3:42:58.940 --> 3:43:06.460]  the factory under the boss and you sit down and you don't work and you refuse to budge no matter
[3:43:06.460 --> 3:43:15.740]  what and that finally wrestled the right to unionize for the auto workers away from henry ford
[3:43:16.860 --> 3:43:23.500]  now what do you think those men would have done in those days if some little worm like a fouchy
[3:43:23.500 --> 3:43:27.580]  stood up and said well you're going to have to stay home and you can't go to work because
[3:43:27.580 --> 3:43:37.500]  of a germ of a germ these guys would have rushed into work run over whoever was standing in their
[3:43:37.500 --> 3:43:44.300]  way went to their work benches and put cars together because that's what they do because
[3:43:44.300 --> 3:43:51.420]  they're not taking any crap from stupid idiots and bureaucrats and there would have been lots of
[3:43:51.420 --> 3:43:58.060]  people like that in the country at one time that would have said are you kidding i'm supposed to
[3:43:58.060 --> 3:44:05.580]  stay home lockdown not go to work because of what some friggin germ that they're talking about that
[3:44:05.580 --> 3:44:11.420]  they can't even prove exists are you kidding me and millions of people would have said that
[3:44:11.420 --> 3:44:23.900]  they better say it again they better say it again see you next time
