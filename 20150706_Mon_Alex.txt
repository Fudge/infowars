[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:29.840]  Texas Alex Jones here are the headlines you're listening to this broadcast you
[00:29.840 --> 00:37.360]  got the breakdown in the upcoming EU meltdown years ago and now it's here
[00:37.360 --> 00:44.000]  Greek banks prepare a plan to raid deposits to avert collapse no raiding
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.280]  people's deposits will cause the collapse to be even worse but that's how
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.640]  the Financial Times of London spins the tyranny of the megabanks sugar flour
[00:54.640 --> 01:04.960]  rice panic Greek stock up on essentials as store shelves go baron AFP and it
[01:04.960 --> 01:12.640]  just gets more insane from there drug companies threaten to not supply drugs
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.880]  to the nation even though they were paying for them but they're still
[01:15.880 --> 01:19.640]  supplying them after no vote but only one day later they're threatening to cut
[01:19.640 --> 01:27.040]  off digital wire transfers embargo goods we're talking about war crimes here
[01:27.040 --> 01:33.960]  Greek no vote hoses Germany's Chancellor's biggest challenge yet the
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.520]  Wall Street Journal reports getting the Germans to bail out the EU yet again
[01:38.520 --> 01:44.160]  when it's designed to implode but not before they've milked the nation states
[01:44.160 --> 01:50.600]  over and over again Bloomberg Business reports 48 hours away from unrest in
[01:50.600 --> 01:56.120]  Greece that will then spread and the EU is announcing unlimited illegals out of
[01:56.120 --> 02:02.680]  Eastern Europe North Africa and the Middle East pouring in and the EU heads
[02:02.680 --> 02:10.120]  have demanded more more pay for everything as Spain and Italy and
[02:10.120 --> 02:17.920]  Portugal and France prepare to go belly up get it as many foreigners as we can
[02:17.920 --> 02:25.120]  before the lifeboat sinks so the leftist can then milk the civil unrest and
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.720]  play the different groups off against each other Greek contagion across
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.960]  markets muted as crisis scene quarantine those stock markets are down
[02:35.960 --> 02:41.440]  around the world right now that is just some of what we have on that front
[02:41.440 --> 02:47.240]  Nigel Farage leader of the UKIP party basically a Ron Paul info or style
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.480]  party frequent guest this broadcast says Greece votes no the European Union is
[02:53.480 --> 03:01.360]  dying before our eyes that's coming up first after the break if you go to
[03:01.360 --> 03:11.320]  info wars.com we break it all down US preparing coup to prevent Greece from
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.960]  falling under Russian influence yeah but if you don't go on to the globalist you
[03:16.960 --> 03:23.200]  must be working for the Ruskies kind of like Egypt now does drills with Russia
[03:23.200 --> 03:26.720]  because the US portrayed them over through their government and put the
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.400]  Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabist in charge to blow up every church they
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.040]  could find shop Christians heads off crucify them upside down and attack
[03:36.040 --> 03:41.040]  military bases with Anderson Cooper cheering them on as freedom fighters
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.920]  just like Libya was liberated by Al Qaeda as well now known as ISIS but
[03:46.920 --> 03:50.960]  Christie the bizarre governor of New Jersey wants Americans to blame
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.120]  Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't happened yet this is the inverted
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.520]  reality and we have this clip coming up he doesn't even say why Rand Paul's to
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.320]  blame Rand Paul tried to stop arming Al Qaeda and ISIS Rand Paul's the one for
[04:06.320 --> 04:12.720]  four years exposing it valiantly along with this broadcast and others I'm just
[04:12.720 --> 04:17.560]  giving the listeners credit here and so he just without any evidence or reason or
[04:17.560 --> 04:23.960]  logic it's like saying you know the house burns down in New York today it's
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.320]  Alex Jones' fault or if your child sprains their ankle sometime this year
[04:29.320 --> 04:35.760]  Rand Paul did it or if your soups cold at a restaurant five years from now Matt
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.360]  drudge did it I mean it's just he just you know Rand Paul's gonna cause a terror
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.320]  attack of course he's really getting at the fact that he doesn't want illegal
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.320]  spying on everybody that hasn't stopped any other attacks because our government
[04:48.320 --> 04:55.720]  is rogue in every sensible turn get ready it's a big broadcast today as we
[04:55.720 --> 05:01.800]  watch the global meltdown accelerate did you know that only six corporations
[05:01.800 --> 05:08.280]  control 90% of what millions of Americans see here and read every single
[05:08.280 --> 05:13.280]  day it's the illusion of choice think about it the mainstream media is owned
[05:13.280 --> 05:18.320]  by only a handful of mega corporations with vested interests but on the other
[05:18.320 --> 05:24.000]  hand the internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources so you
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.480]  can research information for yourself from multiple sources or you can blindly
[05:29.480 --> 05:34.480]  accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media never questioning what
[05:34.480 --> 05:39.200]  you are being told this gives you a false sense of reality I mean do you
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.600]  actually know what you think you know or have you been programmed to accept
[05:43.600 --> 05:48.640]  someone else's version of events think about it this is Darren McBreen and I

[08:10.760 --> 08:30.280]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[08:30.280 --> 08:41.320]  it's an absolute certainty that the biggest bubbles the world has ever seen
[08:41.320 --> 08:49.640]  in bond stocks and currencies will implode at some point the only question is
[08:49.640 --> 08:58.600]  what will cause it and the situation we see unfolding in Greece could be the
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.640]  big one we've got Gerald Salente joining us in the third hour we're getting Lord
[09:02.640 --> 09:09.560]  Moncton on who helped found and create the UKIP party to give us his breakdown
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.400]  on what's happening to the euro the head of UKIP which again is the Ron Paul
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.720]  libertarian party of Europe now fascist growing which shows Europe's waking up
[09:18.720 --> 09:27.440]  super popular now in the UK in France in Italy Greece votes no Saturday the
[09:27.440 --> 09:32.600]  results were in by Sunday the European Union is dying before our eyes it's not
[09:32.600 --> 09:38.840]  just disaffected pensioners young Greeks have worked out that they don't need the
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.560]  bloated EU that's right you can try to blame the Greeks and say they've got
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.560]  too big a pension funds well the general public doesn't have pension funds they
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.040]  have very high taxes in Greece and the EU wanted to raise even more taxes
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.080]  selectively on them to not just bail out Greece's debts but the rest of the EU
[09:57.080 --> 10:03.920]  debts and no one's had to pay for more of the private derivatives fiat
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.440]  counterfeit garbage than the Germans then it's the Americans and then it's
[10:09.440 --> 10:16.320]  the Chinese taxpayer that have pumped tens of trillions of dollars and yins
[10:16.320 --> 10:24.640]  and yawns and euros into propping up with JP Morgan and others have created
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.560]  2.2 quadrillion in fraudulent instruments now when you're birdie made
[10:29.560 --> 10:36.720]  off and you create a couple hundred billion in fraudulent garbage you end
[10:36.720 --> 10:46.120]  up going to prison for the tens of billions of it that was fraud but when
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.400]  you're the head of Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan you run the federal banking
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.600]  commissions and you go and sit in the hearings and tell them how to fix
[10:55.600 --> 11:01.240]  everything and back then Treasury Secretary in 2008 Paulson this came out
[11:01.240 --> 11:05.160]  in mainstream news went into closed session of Congress and said there will
[11:05.160 --> 11:10.160]  be tanks and blood in the streets within 48 hours if you don't give us an
[11:10.160 --> 11:15.520]  limited capital and it wasn't just the 878 billion dollars they wanted it was
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.680]  the unlimited open window at the market committee of the Federal Reserve and it
[11:21.680 --> 11:30.040]  was the green light to be protected and to have the public sign on to the current
[11:30.040 --> 11:37.640]  derivatives and all future derivatives and the Wall Street Journal did carry
[11:37.640 --> 11:42.560]  that back at the time in an article shock forced Paulson's hand oh yes they
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.720]  were so shocked no they orchestrated that whole situation even the head of the
[11:47.720 --> 11:51.280]  Texas Banking Association has written articles exposing that and they've
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.560]  taken over most the brokerage firms most the regional banks most the small
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.480]  banks now they want the credit unions the big six banks globally are taking out
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.520]  their competition and want to move towards getting rid of cash so you're
[12:04.520 --> 12:08.320]  forced to stay in the banks so they can take whatever money they want directly
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.320]  out of your bank accounts and you're saying oh really that'll never happen oh
[12:13.320 --> 12:16.880]  really this is what they're calling for it Davos this is what they're trying to
[12:16.880 --> 12:22.520]  normalize in the media with trial balloons to acclimate the sheeple in the
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.400]  last few months here it is financial times of London Greek banks prepare
[12:28.400 --> 12:37.920]  plan to raid deposits to avert collapse if you raid deposits historically that's
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.560]  what destroys confidence which if you get the documents from 2002 that were
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.840]  leaked from the World Bank and IMF when Joseph Sticklet's left not saying he
[12:46.840 --> 12:52.440]  leaked them they just got released there was a plan to then do this in the next
[12:52.440 --> 12:59.520]  coming decade or so in the West they've done this tactic with third world
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.680]  countries buying off the politicians getting them to sign on to debt getting
[13:03.680 --> 13:10.960]  them to invest pension funds public and private in derivatives once they're
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.600]  infected even one or two percent no one can tell you how much you've got to sign
[13:16.600 --> 13:24.840]  on to the thousands of trillions and growing or it all fails so see they
[13:24.840 --> 13:29.600]  infected get you to then sign on to it and then government can come in with
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.320]  regulatory power to save the too big to fail facade which is actually designed
[13:34.320 --> 13:38.840]  to fail down the road and get bailout after bailout after bailout to the
[13:38.840 --> 13:45.480]  private central banks that's really a open tax directly from taxpayers to the
[13:45.480 --> 13:50.720]  private central banks that's always been their dream but when this system
[13:50.720 --> 13:54.760]  finally fails when they've milked us over and over and over again they will
[13:54.760 --> 14:00.120]  propose the new global currency which they're modeling after the strategic
[14:00.120 --> 14:08.720]  drawing right which is another way of made-up made-off style made-up Ponzi
[14:08.720 --> 14:18.000]  scheme derivatives that are digital zeros and ones in a computer that's it and
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.240]  then every global currency that's faltering signs on to that to be
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.040]  stabilized for a time they will then back off the economy let prosperity
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.320]  flourish for a while after they've already consolidated all the countries
[14:30.320 --> 14:35.160]  they've imploded they'll roll out for a decade or so with prosperity getting as
[14:35.160 --> 14:41.440]  deeper into debt it'll be fake prosperity foe prosperity synthetic
[14:41.440 --> 14:46.840]  prosperity and then the mega hammer will be dropped and they will fully get
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.240]  rid of the previous currencies that were in place rolling them in to the new
[14:52.240 --> 14:57.280]  super global digital cashless currency after a decade of the public being
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.480]  trained to thumbprint and face scan to buy and sell and that cash is the devil
[15:01.480 --> 15:06.040]  and that cash is the enemy and that people running on European and US and
[15:06.040 --> 15:14.960]  North American banks caused the collapse of 2016 or 2017 they always blame the
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.480]  free market they always blame freedom for what they've publicly done and they
[15:20.480 --> 15:27.960]  always signed the public on to their debts so here's what I want to do in
[15:27.960 --> 15:36.560]  this first hour I want to open the phones up to take your phone calls for
[15:36.560 --> 15:41.680]  first-time callers specifically on the Greek situation and where you think it's
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.480]  going and do you think it's going to be this fall this winter that we really see
[15:46.480 --> 15:54.160]  the implosion and how spectacular will it be or will it be next year we see
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.600]  elites hoarding gold notice golds up today we see stock markets plunging until
[15:59.600 --> 16:03.840]  plunge protection teams at the Federal Reserve came in and propped up the
[16:03.840 --> 16:10.240]  market they love with their insider knowledge at the big central banks and
[16:10.240 --> 16:16.520]  brokerage houses to ride these waves up and down but still they need to get us
[16:16.520 --> 16:21.160]  maneuvered into a point of a global meltdown to offer their solution
[16:21.160 --> 16:27.120]  planetary government so we can truly be slaves to the private central banks
[16:27.120 --> 16:38.920]  toll-free number to join us 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 first-time callers and
[16:38.920 --> 16:42.160]  in the second hour we'll have open phones for everybody and in the third hour
[16:42.160 --> 16:47.800]  Gerald Salente joins us and we'll have open phones with him as well because he
[16:47.800 --> 16:51.640]  predicted four years ago that we'd see the crash by two years ago well there's
[16:51.640 --> 16:56.880]  been a crash in most areas of the world they've just used unlimited fiat money
[16:56.880 --> 17:04.040]  to paper over it but that is coming to an end and I think the predictions of
[17:04.040 --> 17:08.680]  Gerald Salente are coming true and you now see the bond market the biggest
[17:08.680 --> 17:17.840]  bloated bubble in world history so I want to hear from you on those fronts then I
[17:17.840 --> 17:25.240]  want to explain something I'm pro-human I really don't care at the end of the day
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.760]  what color you are or where you came from if you support private property and
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.720]  the right to self-defense and you support a level playing field and you're
[17:36.720 --> 17:41.320]  not a want to be social engineer trying to guilt me into feeling like I'm a bad
[17:41.320 --> 17:47.120]  person so I'll submit to whatever your agenda is that I care about you and I
[17:47.120 --> 17:54.600]  want you to succeed there's two issues that this Donald Trump situation gives
[17:54.600 --> 18:02.440]  us a window into I don't trust Donald Trump as far as I could throw an
[18:02.440 --> 18:08.680]  elephant everybody knows that that said most of what he says makes a lot of
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.000]  sense I think he's a really smart guy the problem is he won't deliver on what
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.680]  he says he's going to do in my experience he is an establishment shell
[18:18.680 --> 18:22.240]  that's just what my gut tells me and what I've seen and what a lot of insiders
[18:22.240 --> 18:29.520]  like dr. Corsi and others say like let's get dr. Corsi on he's an expert on
[18:29.520 --> 18:32.280]  financial collapse probably one of the best out there we never get him on
[18:32.280 --> 18:36.760]  about that subject but I want to get him on this week about it and he actually
[18:36.760 --> 18:43.520]  talks to Trump and has a lot of inside baseball on it that said him coming out
[18:43.520 --> 18:49.000]  and saying criminals from all over the world come here not the good people in
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.320]  Mexico but a lot of criminals run here to escape justice well just like
[18:55.320 --> 18:59.600]  criminals from the US run to Mexico to escape justice just not anywhere near
[18:59.600 --> 19:05.160]  the same numbers because Mexico doesn't have extradition and then I saw a raw
[19:05.160 --> 19:09.920]  story and CNN and just all these publications and outfits misrepresenting
[19:09.920 --> 19:16.080]  I saw this raw story headline this morning that was a Hispanic workers
[19:16.080 --> 19:22.680]  respond to Trump's claim that they're lazy Trump never said that Trump never
[19:22.680 --> 19:27.720]  said there weren't immigrants coming here that were hard-working Trump talks

[24:21.640 --> 24:29.400]  world financial crisis is going we've been in a crisis for a long time and the
[24:29.400 --> 24:34.680]  globalist have been making moves and preparations and noises hoarding cash
[24:34.680 --> 24:43.520]  hoarding gold moving to armored redoubts telling really wealthy people across
[24:43.520 --> 24:50.240]  North America and Israel to get out escalating military confrontations with
[24:50.240 --> 24:57.040]  Russia and China and let's be clear Russia and China are not angels but the
[24:57.040 --> 25:04.240]  globalist running Europe in the US are the most competent evil people the
[25:04.240 --> 25:12.800]  world has ever seen I mean they are James Bond villains and I got a news flash
[25:12.800 --> 25:20.280]  for you James Bond books have always been and are still based on real scenarios
[25:20.280 --> 25:27.960]  Ian Fleming high-level OSS high-level MI6 you can go read his magazine
[25:27.960 --> 25:33.840]  interviews read the fiction books he wrote you wonder why the new James Bond
[25:33.840 --> 25:38.120]  movies are about big mega banks that buy up a water reservoir in Latin America
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.640]  and turn it off to bankrupt the city and make everybody riot so they can buy the
[25:42.640 --> 25:47.840]  country up that really came out the IMF World Bank documents in 2002 why do you
[25:47.840 --> 25:52.640]  think Latin America so screwed up why do you think Eastern Europe and Africa is
[25:52.640 --> 26:02.600]  because speculators globalist never let things stabilize and I hear these
[26:02.600 --> 26:06.880]  snide comments on talk radio and other places going all Greeks the you know
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.960]  Greece is just a third-world country they're lazy no they're not I've looked
[26:11.960 --> 26:19.120]  at the anthropology I've interviewed the experts the Greeks work really hard and
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.160]  they've got a top-down economy where there's the rich and the poor and they
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.520]  keep raising taxes on poor people and folks are sick of it and Greece has been
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.920]  signed on to a bunch of debts that aren't theirs just like Iceland did and
[26:32.920 --> 26:39.560]  they said no and it turned out 93% of the Icelandic debt was not the people's
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.040]  Kurt Nemo wrote an excellent article showing different EU commissions and
[26:44.040 --> 26:49.640]  Greek commissions admitting that most of the debt is not theirs the Troika
[26:49.640 --> 26:56.560]  swindle Greeks owe nothing meanwhile there's another excellent article on
[26:56.560 --> 27:05.000]  infowars.com and president planet.com stats mainstream media devotees five
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  times now get this mainstream media devotes five times more time to
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.760]  Confederate flag flap than to ISIS threat and I want to be clear ISIS is not
[27:18.760 --> 27:22.120]  your granddaddy's al-Qaeda that was pretty much totally staged in a very
[27:22.120 --> 27:28.680]  small group and synthetic the West funded and allowed hardcore Islamic
[27:28.680 --> 27:34.000]  brigades out of Saudi Arabia Qatar Afghanistan and other areas to form
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.560]  and to recruit all over the world from Europe to the United States and have
[27:39.560 --> 27:44.040]  allowed them to set up networks so they won't need to manufacture terror attacks
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.000]  next time and I told you they're gonna start hitting soft targets four years
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.480]  ago I said the so-called free Syrian army is al-Qaeda and they're gonna start
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.600]  attacking now they change their name to ISIS and then Chris Christie the
[27:58.600 --> 28:03.800]  anti-gun open border so-called Republican another John Boehner right out of
[28:03.800 --> 28:10.960]  the same porta potty right out of the same latrine two similar droppings
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.280]  excuse me I'm just so sick of these people has the nerve to say when
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.360]  there's a terror attack is they're getting ready for one I don't know when
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.640]  but they're they're gonna let it happen don't blame the FBI director blame
[28:24.640 --> 28:31.680]  Rand Paul Rand Paul didn't stop the NSA spying chump it's still going on and
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.920]  NSA spying didn't stop any of these other attacks and when a mall or another
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.040]  convention center or another school the targets we predicted they'll hit I'm
[28:41.040 --> 28:45.760]  hard it's what they hit it's attacked it's gonna be anti-gunners like you that
[28:45.760 --> 28:52.000]  are to blame you disgusting piece of trash so when we come back I'm gonna
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.720]  play that clip but the NSA has been spying on everything and it's come out
[28:57.720 --> 29:05.120]  it's not looking at ISIS when the FBI agents try to stop al-Qaeda or ISIS
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.320]  they're blocked from doing it I don't even blame the FBI agents themselves but
[29:09.320 --> 29:12.920]  the politicians above them 9-11 the latest attacks the attacks in
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.600]  garland they knew about it they were told to stand down so the local police
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.880]  got a tip from the FBI and we're there and gunned them down because the
[29:22.880 --> 29:26.920]  politicians want to have the attacks they could take more freedoms they know
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.040]  will go like the borders wide open why'd you let them in the media will just
[29:31.040 --> 29:35.840]  ignore that folks so that's what's happening meanwhile while all this is
[29:35.840 --> 29:43.280]  going on we are hearing all about the rebel battle flag whoop-de-doo and boy
[29:43.280 --> 29:48.800]  I tell you this is gonna tie into all of it knockout game is expanding we're on
[29:48.800 --> 29:53.400]  the March the Empire's on the list is divide and conquer Alex Jones and the
[29:53.400 --> 30:00.960]  GCN radio network have you ever come across someone on the internet
[30:00.960 --> 30:04.920]  that you suspected was a paid government troll well there's a very good
[30:04.920 --> 30:09.080]  chance that you are not imagining things thanks to Edward Snowden we now have
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.800]  solid proof that paid government trolls are using psychology based influence
[30:13.800 --> 30:18.640]  techniques on social media websites such as YouTube Facebook and Twitter some of
[30:18.640 --> 30:22.360]  these techniques include uploading YouTube videos to discredit and promote
[30:22.360 --> 30:26.800]  distrust fake online resources such as magazines and books to provide
[30:26.800 --> 30:31.440]  inaccurate information they also set up Facebook groups that encourage and
[30:31.440 --> 30:35.680]  monitor discussion on a topic they can also set up fake trade sites that can
[30:35.680 --> 30:39.760]  take a person's money and personal information as well as send those
[30:39.760 --> 30:43.880]  customers degraded or spoof products like sending computers overseas that are
[30:43.880 --> 30:48.240]  already equipped with a backdoor for the NSA all of this is just more proof that
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.480]  it's actually the government engaging in cybercrime of course it's all an effort
[30:52.480 --> 30:57.000]  to ramp up a non-existent threat to take our freedoms Leanne McAdder reporting

[34:53.600 --> 34:59.320]  example is a racial microaggression some cultures did not grow up eating peanut
[34:59.320 --> 35:03.800]  butter and jelly sandwiches so that makes them racist racial it's micro
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.760]  aggressive micro aggressive okay I guess different levels to the racism that's
[35:08.760 --> 35:15.840]  ridiculous because I mean I really feel like people have redefined racism you

[36:06.960 --> 36:10.760]  these people don't even know the meaning behind that Confederate flag I mean the
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.560]  flag represent I agree it represents slavery I think it shouldn't really be
[36:15.560 --> 36:20.640]  a symbol of in an everyday life I'm sorry but the stars and bars was never
[36:20.640 --> 36:25.720]  flown as the national flag of the Confederacy it was the flag of the
[36:25.720 --> 36:33.160]  army of northern Virginia and it it was the battle flag correct it was the
[36:33.160 --> 36:38.360]  battle flag of the Confederate army like I said before who most of the people
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.600]  who fought for that army never owned a slave granted the aristocrats did but
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.280]  like I said it was on the way out slavery was an outdated institution you
[36:48.280 --> 36:56.080]  know sound like a terrorist I just might be I obviously him little John has the
[36:56.080 --> 37:00.120]  same idea of this is the South that's what they were for it I understood that
[37:00.120 --> 37:10.640]  when I saw it so a paper bag brown bag brown paper bag no how could this be
[37:10.640 --> 37:16.520]  racist well it's a racial slur according to the city of Seattle as in for not
[37:16.520 --> 37:22.000]  allowed to brown bag your lunch brown bag your lunch that is not racist I mean I
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.080]  ever heard that term I did I have I have to know if you were if you're darker
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.320]  than the brown paper bag then you're too dark but but white people didn't start
[37:30.320 --> 37:35.440]  that that was something that black people did so that be racist you're
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.280]  educating me right now guess I had nothing to do with white people when
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.600]  we were kids you know black kids are taught that being dark is bad and that
[37:43.600 --> 37:47.400]  is I've never heard that from a white person I heard that from other black
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.200]  people if I saw you walking down the street and you had it on your Caucasian
[37:52.200 --> 37:57.640]  person either you're saying unless you approach me hey how you doing I'll shake
[37:57.640 --> 38:01.840]  your hand I can care less it doesn't matter now if you're not trying to you
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.240]  know be around me avoid me or you cross the street and you have this on I know
[38:06.240 --> 38:08.920]  to stand clear of you I see you that's what you're wearing that's what you
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.920]  represent I understand it now do you think this is more like a divide and
[38:12.920 --> 38:15.520]  conquer sort of diversion thing do you think there are more important things
[38:15.520 --> 38:19.520]  people should be worried about way more important things you announced now my
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.560]  best friend is gay you announced the gay like it's legal everywhere on the same
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.920]  day that the guy was being buried the preacher was being buried so to me I
[38:28.920 --> 38:33.440]  just think it's a way yeah it's a diversion this flag been up for years
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.160]  maybe just as long as American flag has been waving or whatever and nobody
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.000]  never brought this into context KKK been around things like that and now you
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.720]  bring it up when you have the bigger issue is a young man or literally a
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.680]  racial act happen he said it happened he went in there with intention on killing
[38:52.680 --> 38:56.520]  people but now you bring this just to get everybody conversing that's all it is
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.560]  this is our version Americans don't want to be informed they want to be
[38:59.560 --> 39:10.120]  entertained so this is entertainment I'd rather live poor and be free and live
[39:10.120 --> 39:17.240]  in some cage in the lap of the tree rather live poor and be free
[39:17.240 --> 39:25.280]  I said I'd wanna be
[39:47.240 --> 39:56.840]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[39:56.840 --> 40:07.880]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war you know
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.120]  I wanted to play that Lee and McAdoo piece from fours nightly news last week
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.200]  because there were some good points made by Austinites on the streets about
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.480]  brown paper bags being distractions and rebel flags but the whole race obsession
[40:22.480 --> 40:30.800]  itself is a distraction and has been engineered into a leftist based race
[40:30.800 --> 40:39.560]  war that is becoming America's new culture every day we have new knockout
[40:39.560 --> 40:47.040]  game video of white people being attacked and the folks that are doing it
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.000]  really think that the whites deserve it because they're bad people they've
[40:51.000 --> 40:58.080]  oppressed and this is how the media has dumbed it down whereas in the past of
[40:58.080 --> 41:02.640]  the Klan went out and beat people or killed them Christians and groups
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.240]  across the board with decry it it would get criminally prosecuted so it stopped
[41:08.240 --> 41:16.960]  for all intents and purposes but now when a minority of black people go out
[41:16.960 --> 41:25.120]  this has been going on for a decade and is intensifying and attack whites or
[41:25.120 --> 41:34.800]  attack the police the media either covers it up or makes excuses for it and
[41:34.800 --> 41:41.320]  calls it a game when the Klan goes out and beats somebody up or burns across in
[41:41.320 --> 41:47.240]  the yard or kills someone that's not a game when the feds burned down Waco full
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.720]  of every race color and creed that wasn't a game World War two wasn't a game
[41:52.720 --> 42:02.240]  so it shows how they semantically turn very serious things into a joke and we
[42:02.240 --> 42:12.480]  have new clips today of knockout game activity going on shock report police
[42:12.480 --> 42:18.800]  attacked by mob in Cincinnati rescue white man from black beatdown that was
[42:18.800 --> 42:26.000]  ongoing and we see these videos every single day now and the difference is
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.760]  when we see a video of white people doing this it becomes an international
[42:30.760 --> 42:38.560]  sensation and whites are told that they are all collectively to blame or if a
[42:38.560 --> 42:44.000]  group of black guys beat up a gay person then it's wrong or of a group of white
[42:44.000 --> 42:50.120]  guys beat up a gay person or Hispanics beat up a homosexual it's then called a
[42:50.120 --> 42:56.320]  hate crime so the literacy of our country for reading writing arithmetic
[42:56.320 --> 43:04.640]  history our basic common rights as humans is null and void but we are
[43:04.640 --> 43:10.440]  completely educated on how to obsess over race and then selectively if you're a
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.640]  quote minority group it's okay for you if you're from Latin America to come up
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.840]  and commit crimes the San Francisco Sheriff's Department will release you
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.240]  saying even if even if you're a multi-time felon it violates your rights
[43:24.240 --> 43:29.200]  to hand you back over to ICE so you can then go out just shoot an innocent woman
[43:29.200 --> 43:35.080]  at the boardwalk because you feel like it that story is on info wars.com so
[43:35.080 --> 43:42.440]  there's this apologist idea or any crime coming out of anybody who isn't white is
[43:42.440 --> 43:48.000]  basically acceptable you got to ask yourself what is that agenda really all
[43:48.000 --> 44:00.800]  about well it's about race-based politics and it's about creating an
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.920]  atmosphere where we all fight with each other and that scene is reasonable and
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.080]  we go back to the same old story divide and conquer and I know I'm saying things
[44:10.080 --> 44:20.480]  that are known I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now it's just to see our
[44:20.480 --> 44:27.360]  country conquered going into world government and to see gun restrictions
[44:27.360 --> 44:35.560]  and Obamacare and open borders all pushed as litmus tests to prove we're
[44:35.560 --> 44:45.400]  not racist is a joke and then even when all of this is unpopular and unconstitutional
[44:45.400 --> 44:49.680]  still it's ramrodded through
[44:55.280 --> 45:02.440]  and then finally the Greeks after three separate robberies by the EU say no
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.000]  we're not going deeper into debt to pay what's impossible to pay most this
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.320]  isn't even our debt we're not going along with it and the very central bankers
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.160]  that fund all this propaganda about being loving and being liberal are saying
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.480]  cut off their food cut off their medicine cut off any money going into the
[45:21.480 --> 45:23.800]  country
[45:24.640 --> 45:31.040]  don't let tourists book hotel stays there hold them hostage as the outgoing
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.680]  Greek finance minister called it that's terrorism so let's go to your phone
[45:36.680 --> 45:43.120]  calls and get your view on where you think all this is going after I play the
[45:43.120 --> 45:46.360]  clip I mentioned earlier of Chris Christie the governor of New Jersey
[45:46.360 --> 45:52.440]  saying if there's a terror attack Rand Paul is to blame don't blame the FBI
[45:52.440 --> 46:00.840]  director I thought we'd blame the ISIS that attacks who just executed a bunch
[46:00.840 --> 46:07.600]  of people Islamic State suicide bombers strike Iraq and refinery town execute
[46:07.600 --> 46:16.960]  more than 30 Syrian military members I mean I thought they were to blame and I
[46:16.960 --> 46:21.640]  thought the government that allowed ISIS and al Qaeda to form new
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.160]  organizations I thought they were to blame oh that's the bipartisan John
[46:26.160 --> 46:32.400]  McCain John Boehner and Barack Obama and NATO that did that but see the public
[46:32.400 --> 46:38.400]  is illiterate about all this they only know about the general Lee and brown
[46:38.400 --> 46:45.000]  paper bags and I guess if I were to fried chicken I'm racist I mean just
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.840]  everything is like these phantoms of racism and phantoms of code words that
[46:49.840 --> 46:56.400]  don't even exist now they were reporting a 25 men now they're saying it's 30s
[46:56.400 --> 47:02.400]  plus in the ruins of a Syrian ample theater let's go ahead and go to your
[47:02.400 --> 47:08.680]  phone calls let's go ahead and talk to Tommy in Tennessee Tommy you're on the
[47:08.680 --> 47:24.600]  air my opinion on the Greek situation is basically it's the first domino to fall
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.440]  I agree with what you're saying in terms of the economy but I think what they're
[47:28.440 --> 47:32.280]  gonna do is just stand back and let it collapse and watch how bad it gets and
[47:32.280 --> 47:36.320]  then try to use that as a model you know for what's to come in other areas
[47:36.320 --> 47:41.960]  absolutely you have to know in the head brother so I agree with that just quickly
[47:41.960 --> 47:48.640]  the second thing is 1963 Brandy's University Bob Dylan in concert the
[47:48.640 --> 47:55.120]  song is Masters of War this song is your soul my friend I swear to God to it
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.720]  it'll be your new theme song you must have missed it my friend that I'm honored
[47:58.720 --> 48:05.080]  to have you call in we do play Masters of War is bumper for about 13 years my
[48:05.080 --> 48:11.320]  uncle came up one time to the office with a CD of it and said hey I wish you'd
[48:11.320 --> 48:16.120]  play this song and I was actually aware of that song you're the Masters of War
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.960]  that we should try to play that coming out of the break and these university
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.080]  version it's much more powerful and there's a gigantic applause at the end
[48:25.080 --> 48:29.800]  but it is your soul my friend and I respect you I would quit my job right
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.600]  now and come work for you if you needed me well God bless you sir you know but
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.800]  it's just again it's why brush one boss says just ditto because can you imagine
[48:38.800 --> 48:42.600]  taking calls over the years just everybody thanking you it's very
[48:42.600 --> 48:47.720]  humbling and it just also gets like Chinese water torture because I
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.440]  understand look I love you too I appreciate you I'm honored to talk to
[48:53.440 --> 48:57.280]  such a wonderful audience as you guys and I'm trying to do the best job I can
[48:57.280 --> 49:02.800]  so I just say thanks for putting up with me thank you Tommy Joe in Wisconsin
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.280]  thanks for calling thanks for holding her on the air hey what's up Alex um I
[49:08.280 --> 49:11.440]  just wanted to throw it out there I don't know it's just you know kind of a
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.880]  thought right now but I see us heading down that path agrees a little bit more
[49:16.880 --> 49:23.240]  long-term you know because you see how everybody's getting behind Bernie and
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.600]  if you look at Bernie's policies they're all you know everything's pro-socialist
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.880]  yeah senator Bernie Sanders why don't you fill folks in for those that aren't
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.480]  aware of what you're talking about you're saying that the globalists bring
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.920]  in their financial fascist model but they want socialism at the national
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.480]  level and they're gonna let all the systems fail and then bring in total
[49:44.480 --> 49:49.880]  wealth redistribution and socialism to stagnate society and sell slavery as
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.920]  freedom because the globalists are going to be offshore and exempt from it all
[49:53.920 --> 49:59.000]  yeah and becomes that much easier it makes it look like the people wanted it
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.480]  that way you know and then you have everybody on internet oh this is a
[50:02.480 --> 50:06.880]  good thing no it's not we just we all just got to witness it's not a good
[50:06.880 --> 50:12.200]  thing you know we're living in an era that you can show them in their face
[50:12.200 --> 50:17.320]  you can just hand them the evidence and it's like oh no big deal you know and
[50:17.320 --> 50:23.920]  you can see it plain it plain is simple you know so I don't I don't see I don't
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.200]  see it's heading anywhere positive that's it's it is just we're all we're
[50:28.200 --> 50:32.760]  strong you know this is a sinking ship you know everybody knows it you know
[50:32.760 --> 50:36.640]  I'm not trying to be negative but you're right the current trajectory we're on
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.600]  Joe is a sinking ship God bless you but I think admitting the ship is sinking
[50:40.600 --> 50:45.440]  allows us to build lifeboats and to move to them before the general public does
[50:45.440 --> 50:51.680]  and stampede but also as Ron Paul and others have said when things crash there's
[50:51.680 --> 50:57.560]  a good chance to try to get folks to buy into freedom again you know legalized
[50:57.560 --> 51:02.720]  freedom so Mark and his wife came over to see my wife and me and he began
[51:02.720 --> 51:05.960]  talking about the 4th of July independence day you know and he said

[53:35.760 --> 53:39.280]  forcing taxes to serve us debt this capitalism or was Jefferson correct
[53:39.280 --> 53:42.560]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[53:42.560 --> 53:44.440]  the liberties of the people than a standing army
[53:44.440 --> 53:47.240]  Ted Anderson I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[54:15.200 --> 54:26.840]  bill all the bombs is it hide behind walls is it hide behind discs think how
[54:26.840 --> 54:37.160]  arrogant the neo-cons democratic war hawks are use it never done nothing they
[54:37.160 --> 54:47.800]  set up there but they say when a terror attack comes it's Rand Paul's fault did
[54:47.800 --> 54:54.360]  did we even ever play that clip the christmas key clip it's up on info wars
[54:54.360 --> 55:01.600]  dot com I keep talking about it we'll play it in a moment it's just at a
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.000]  certain point I'm speechless when the Republican and Democratic leadership
[55:06.000 --> 55:14.880]  with NATO have been openly arming al-qaeda arming ISIS turning them
[55:14.880 --> 55:25.280]  loose destroying countries like Egypt and Libya and when those states fail they
[55:25.280 --> 55:33.680]  just come out and say oh we messed up no big deal and then no one points out
[55:33.680 --> 55:37.640]  they're the ones that helped reconstitute al-qaeda as ISIS 50 times
[55:37.640 --> 55:42.200]  bigger than it ever was 14 years of the fake war on terror the enemies bigger
[55:42.200 --> 55:46.240]  and stronger than ever our government's funding it that's so over the top
[55:46.240 --> 55:51.400]  sensational that I'm having a Robbie the robot moment where he just can't
[55:51.400 --> 56:01.920]  compute it and smoke starts coming out of his ears but this is because we have
[56:01.920 --> 56:05.800]  a public where eight out of ten people in California don't know what
[56:05.800 --> 56:10.480]  independence day is and six out of ten in Austin Texas on the street don't know
[56:10.480 --> 56:18.200]  either these people are being preyed on by gangster thugs like Chris Christie
[56:18.800 --> 56:25.600]  imagine how bold they are to publicly armed terrorists and to turn them loose
[56:25.600 --> 56:31.040]  to take over countries that have nothing to us and then to allow them to
[56:31.040 --> 56:37.240]  infiltrate the country and the one senator that was opposing it and saying
[56:37.240 --> 56:40.960]  it was going to happen the one guy that tried to protect us the one guy to the
[56:40.960 --> 56:47.960]  right thing Ted Cruz did it too but Rand was the strongest so one of the two
[56:47.960 --> 56:53.880]  guys and you blame him I guess because they know an attack's coming and
[56:53.880 --> 56:57.280]  remember what Rand Paul said in his speech he said there are those in this
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.960]  chamber that want there to be a terror attack so they can blame me and now
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.960]  they're doing it ahead of time they're going when there's an attack it's Rand
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.120]  Paul's fault well you know what Rand Paul's going to do when they do attack
[57:11.120 --> 57:14.520]  he's going to point out we had open borders he's going to point out our
[57:14.520 --> 57:19.440]  government help fund Al Qaeda in Isis and he's going to play the clips of where
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.280]  he warned about it four years ago three years ago two years ago a year ago six
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.760]  months ago so he's walking right into your trap we're gonna go to break and
[57:26.760 --> 57:32.960]  come back with Dave and Austin and Corey and John and Darrell and others open
[57:32.960 --> 57:41.240]  phones throughout the entire next hour but this can only be done because of
[57:41.240 --> 57:47.640]  mass ignorance very briefly when I was reading this I was just ashamed of my
[57:47.640 --> 57:54.120]  management because it's not a tactic if I could keep the products that do sell
[57:54.120 --> 57:58.880]  that are popular in stock they're just such high quality so organic hard to
[57:58.880 --> 58:02.400]  source that we're sold out of most products when they sell out for six
[58:02.400 --> 58:06.840]  weeks or longer rain force sold out in only five days liver shield sold out in
[58:06.840 --> 58:11.560]  one week I miscalculated in order to little prostigards sold out Caldee
[58:11.560 --> 58:17.800]  sold out occupiers sold out so prostigard is in the truck on its way here but

[58:21.720 --> 58:26.880]  out supermail vitality will sell out I don't know how we're gonna fund ourselves
[58:26.880 --> 58:29.400]  because I just mismanaged things and you don't even know how to calculate all
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.560]  this but info wars life calm if you want to get these high-quality

[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:40.360]  Salente joining us talk about the Greek crisis Greek banks prepare plan to raid
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.360]  deposits to avert collapse and they're openly talking about doing the same
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.240]  model here it's the very same banks doing this in Greece are planning to do
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:54.240]  this here sugar flour rice panic Greek stock up on essentials could this be the
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:03.040]  end of the euro you know globalism could fail God does predestined some
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.080]  things but free will plays into that we don't have to just give into the
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.400]  cashless society given to world government but watching these globalist
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.480]  banks can you imagine what they're going to do when they have a global
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.160]  government with all cash band and everybody buying and selling biometrically
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.560]  I mean they're saying right now they're gonna start just grabbing people's
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:30.480]  private after-tax money not the government the banks because they hold
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:37.320]  the individual responsible our land is collateral on the national debt we are
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:43.600]  pledged as collateral our children oh but I forgot Obama said when you raise the
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.960]  debt limit it doesn't raise the debt so see that's just me being racist you know
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.800]  I think I kind of got depressed this morning I was up I was like 6 a.m. I
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.960]  was reading news articles and I was on info wars and I go look at the comments
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.300]  for tips or anything that's kind of scan some of the comments that I was on
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:08.280]  YouTube in a video about an illegal alien who had seven felonies have been
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:13.920]  deported five times and how they letting go San Francisco did saying they
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.400]  think it's racist to turn a felon out of jail for all sorts of crimes over to
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.520]  the feds who don't even deport him anyway so it wouldn't matter Obama's
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:31.360]  basically stop deportations I mean a citizen isn't treated like that and the
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.280]  guy went out and shot a lady and I saw Democratic operatives I went and clicked
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.960]  on their handles they were real websites with people with their dogs and their
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.200]  cats and everything and you know trendies and by their dogs and their cats
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:50.480]  mean they were real people saying how dare me be racist and and basically not
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.720]  just want to have people joy riding around shooting people and then how dare
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.600]  I defend Donald Trump because I just stick with the white people and it was
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.080]  mainly white people saying this I mean their whole ideology is just mental
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.360]  illness it's like mentally ill I mean Mexico would deport you or imprison you
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.280]  if you've been in jail and deported five times I mean this idea of if anybody's
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.520]  from somewhere else we've got to let women come here from China they're now
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.760]  the biggest one group bigger than Mexicans used to be Mexico was the big
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:33.360]  immigrant group it's now Chinese women thousands a week that we know of that
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.920]  come in to have their babies for free they can stay their kids a citizen free
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:46.000]  everything and it's like oh what do you got against Chinese women I nothing
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.480]  except I can't go to their country get everything free I mean it's a joke we're
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:58.640]  a joke we're a joke I mean I just I can't even believe it anymore I'm living
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.200]  in a tw- I mean I really it's almost like claustrophobia I never used to have
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.760]  this feeling about politics but now I just want to hide from everybody and
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:13.840]  just let everybody kill each other and just be idiots because I mean I'm not
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.120]  putting on an actor I almost left earlier okay I couldn't even go on air
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.800]  earlier and they had to basically air a tape but I may just leave I just God
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.840]  watching the videos and I go out the street it's not Mark Dice doing this
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.960]  the average Austinite folks cannot find their fat ass with both hands and I
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.520]  want to slap them upside their head but let me tell you they are the most
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:42.800]  politically correct full of it arrogant scum and I'm sick of them and let me
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:49.280]  tell you they mainly are they're a bunch of pasty stupid white people as dumb as
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.960]  the so-called minorities are on average they're more awake when I talk to them
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.960]  in these dumb-ass white people everywhere I mean this country's a sick
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.600]  joke do you want to know why the Greeks voted no in an overwhelming majority to
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.360]  get out of the European Union well it goes back to the Troika swindle as
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.360]  Kurt Nemo writes in June the truth committee on public debt established by
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.200]  the speaker of the Greek Parliament came to the conclusion that Greece should
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.840]  not pay this debt because it is illegal illegitimate and odious the
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.400]  establishment media has hidden from view the facts behind the debt and it sided
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.480]  with the banks in declaring the population of Greece deserves austerity
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.520]  and its attendant poverty and misery because of the Greek government's
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.200]  refusal to accept the harsh conditions of the Troika consisting of the IMF
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.040]  European Commission and European Central Bank left unsaid is the fact that a
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.560]  large portion of the debt totaling 245 billion euros was fraudulently dumped
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.120]  on the country in the course of huge bailouts in 2010 and 2012 the current
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.800]  Greek debt swindle is being compared to tarp the scam foisted on the American
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.280]  people following the subprime fiasco and a move by the Federal Reserve to print
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.600]  four trillion in new money to cover the gambling debt of the financial class

[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:22.680]  lot better now because I've been holding my anger in the last few weeks and
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:31.440]  during the break I had a controlled rage just walking around back in the storage
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.360]  area of the facility and I feel better I was not gonna be able to continue doing
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:45.400]  the radio show because my revulsion of the globalists and their house sickening
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:51.600]  they are and how evil they are and how bad they are just gets to me and then I
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.240]  just wonder what is wrong with other people why do we put up with this
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:04.640]  inversion of reality and common sense being trampled the vast majority of
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:11.280]  Greeks debt of the Greeks people's debt is not their debt Kurt Nemo has an
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:15.600]  article breaking it down from mainline commissions Ireland's debt is not
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.720]  Ireland's debt Iceland's debt is not Iceland's debt the UK's debt is not UK's
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:28.160]  debt Germany's debt is not Germany's debt our real debt in the United States is
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:34.160]  currently almost 19 trillion we've signed on to over a hundred trillion
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:44.320]  dollars in unfunded mandates we owe 100 trillion dollars roughly and that is
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:55.240]  horrible we have signed on to 2.2 quadrillion globally that is not our
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:08.320]  debt that debt is 20 plus times bigger than what we really owe and to watch
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.720]  these big mega banks maneuver the planet every country the same thing into
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.040]  socialism into investing your pension funds in their Ponzi schemes into
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.160]  domestication who promotes open borders the big six banks who promotes taking
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.520]  our guns the big six banks who promotes breaking up the family the big six
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:34.520]  banks who sponsors in Mexico forced Gardasil shots on all 12-year-old girls
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:42.040]  three years running look it up the filthy banks because they're not banks
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.480]  they're organized crime syndicates they are the ones lobbying for forced
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.120]  inoculations they are the ones lobbying for war with Russia they are the ones
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.400]  lobbying for NSA spying they are the ones openly involved working with ISIS
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.840]  and funding them the big banks are on record caught shipping in narcotics
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:08.080]  laundering the money owning and leasing of the aircraft not just for the drugs
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:15.280]  and the money but they're even into white slavery the sex trade shipping sex
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:26.160]  slaves around but don't worry if they catch your neighbor with a hooker
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.000]  they're gonna take his car and put him in jail because that didn't hurt anybody
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.840]  and that was consensual so we're gonna throw the book at you have a big
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.440]  prosecution and if you're an illegal alien that's raped and robbed and
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.160]  arson we're gonna let you out and not deport you because it's all part of the
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:51.920]  globalism if you're a serial killer like the railway killer we're gonna deport
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.080]  you four or five times and put you in jail more than 15 times and just let you
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.240]  use aliases and kill every one because you're a horrible murdering criminal but
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.080]  if you're a 12-year-old Mexican girl we're gonna give you a shot of something
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.080]  known to attack your ovaries and sterilize you in many cases or at least
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:14.280]  destroy your fertility long term and cause you all sorts of ovarian and
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:26.480]  uterine problems so we're gonna soft kill all the little girls because that's
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.760]  not racist because it is they're being targeted see it just massive genetic
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.760]  firing squad but don't worry you won't hear a word out of Mecca and La Raza
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:44.200]  about that but you will if you try to deport a guy that had been in jail
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:50.280]  over and over again seven felonies convictions and deported five times I
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:13:00.120]  covered it all yesterday all the details it's a war on reality oh Dinecore can
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:06.080]  load up a plain load of little kids whistleblowers can go public it can
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.320]  turn out they shipped tens of thousands of child sex slaves and I'm talking five
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:19.480]  years old took points all over the world it comes out the Chicago Tribune it
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.440]  comes out in Congress and bipartisanly they line up and put money in to go
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:29.080]  after the Congresswoman to the exposed it
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:40.840]  that's who runs the government we have a government that oversees it UN bases in
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:51.720]  the Balkans loading Serb and other children up oh there's no made for TV
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:59.120]  movies about that the UN whistleblowers that talk about it they end up losing
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.520]  their job getting indicted getting killed and don't worry the Texas attorney
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.560]  general has been put before a grand jury they're trying to indict him right
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:21.000]  now for not filing a thousand dollar fee listing himself as a stockbroker how
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.360]  many of you in the real world forget to file something or forget to fill out a
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.400]  license I mean anybody in business knows it's constantly changing and let me
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.880]  tell you something there's no way to trade securities and not break the law
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.240]  the laws are written in this sewage of a country
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:53.960]  this this this sestank of a nation to now go after the attorney general of the
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.920]  state of Texas to the Democratic Party controlled office of public integrity
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.000]  in Austin Texas the same group that went after Tom delaying everybody else
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.680]  and I'm not defending Tom delay but he was innocent I don't think he was
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.960]  politically a good guy this attorney general was suing getting our power
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.120]  plants turned back on was suing trying to stop Obamacare and was the one
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.440]  recommending to the governor to ship our gold back I remember seeing when they
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.800]  were going to ship our gold back out of New York two weeks ago I said man get
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.320]  ready for the globalists to come out for Texas and they are I think they'll
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.040]  probably indict the governor next they're probably just gonna indict
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:39.240]  everybody because see that's how they do it they don't march in here with federal
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.680]  troops anymore they just indict you while they're busy running C-130s of
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.280]  little kids on them little kids go out cocaine comes back in but you get a
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.720]  Christian attorney general and a Christian governor who actually know
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:59.280]  what's going on you imagine how much the globalist hate them and you heard it
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.400]  here first I bet you they indict Abbott soon for something they'll find
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:12.560]  something and then they're gonna try to indict everybody unless you join with
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.280]  the dark side I'm not joining with Jack crap you know I think that's why I'm
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:23.680]  being so negative and so mean today and I apologize I just I feel like stomping
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.800]  somebody in the ground right now I don't feel like sitting up here talking
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:35.120]  about this that's cuz I'm fed up with criminals running wild I'm fed up we're
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.680]  going six miles over the speed limit and the state police pulled me over two
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:49.920]  weeks ago and kept me on the side of the road for like 30 minutes while he sat
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.680]  there and ran through my record which there is none and came back with big
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.400]  saucer eyes I know he was going through his intelligence database he thought it
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.000]  was so interesting who he pulled over I was just it's just like my time means
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.400]  nothing I am nothing I'm a citizen which means I'm the lowest form of crap but
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:17.200]  if I was a seven-time felony legal alien I'd just be released and I said I'd go
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:24.120]  to your phone calls and I haven't done it yet and I apologize for that then
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.560]  maybe I shouldn't be on air today because I'm about to get really nasty you
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.920]  know what it is I really love this country and to see it turned into a big
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:49.560]  stinking joke it's painful and then I sit here and I imagine what are all these
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:58.960]  soft stupid people going to do when the real hell comes because there's never
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.240]  been a softer more dumb down world in many areas and let me tell you we're
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.720]  like lambs of the slaughter a buffet of wolves and it's going to get crazy I
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.680]  look at the 20th century and what happened then and it makes me just
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.560]  absolutely cringe
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:26.680]  you know it comes down to this
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:37.080]  it's just all so real I mean the hellish stuff I know like I get up here on
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.760]  air and I say the Chicago Tribune reported on thousands and thousands of
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:46.040]  children over a five-year term period flown out by Western contractors with
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:51.400]  the UN children to be used in sex slavery sex industry and snuff films and
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:56.640]  then that sounds completely insane and made up even though it's true and then
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.680]  almost no one even knows about it but they know about the rebel flat I mean
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:06.080]  it just it's an example of what brainwashing can do I'm gonna skip this
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.560]  network break so we have time to go to the calls here and I'm gonna go to the
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.560]  calls right now and just just listen don't thank me please don't do it and I'm
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.760]  just gonna go to the next person I want to hear what you have to say about
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.240]  Greece about the state of the world when do you think the collapse is coming can
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.040]  it be averted what do you think it's gonna look like I want to take your calls
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:30.560]  I really appreciate Dave and Corey everybody else holding Dave in
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.840]  California you're on the air go ahead all right Alex yeah I'm feeling your
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.440]  pain you know it's the post-4th of July depression we want to be in a great
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.840]  country we want to do great things they're holding us back and it's pissing
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:47.640]  us off and I'm hearing it and you know I much rather have you angry than depressed
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.680]  no I hear you I mean I rarely get depressed but I mean I'm just genuinely
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.840]  it's sinking in I mean I got three children and it's really sinking in
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:02.240]  that we're we're we're in the hands of very wicked people it's just at a
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:08.320]  fundamental level I'm freaked out that's all these masters of war they are the
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.640]  masters of debt these are the same guys and that's their plan put us into debt
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.680]  and then get us into the big war and we're all feeling it everybody's getting
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.040]  a little freaked out now even if they don't listen to your show and if they
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.320]  listen to your show they're getting even more freaked out by the way I've talked
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.960]  about that in the last you know three months everybody I know says something
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.920]  begs coming George Norrie talked to everybody he knows that and I talked
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  to congressman off air they say it's the same thing you say folks that don't
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.840]  even listen or freaked out what are people freaked out about well it's a
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.920]  conglomeration you I called originally because of what you said about the
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.200]  bubbles and you know I love Peter Schiff he's the bubble master the guy talks
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.120]  more about bubbles than anybody and I'm really excited to see that you're
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.360]  bringing Peter into your show I think that's a great addition and I got to
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.200]  say I love the way you bring these authorities in there Paul Craig Roberts
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.280]  Gerald Solanti Peter Schiff you got the who's the guy with the debt bubble
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.880]  what's his name we work for the CIA you know with the currency wars
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.720]  James Rickard James Rickards you know you've got these authorities that come
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.840]  in it's like at a university you're holding over there so don't give up
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.880]  the fight now I called in because of the bubbles and you know I listened to
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.040]  Peter Schiff a lot and he talks about the bubbles but nobody's really talking
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.760]  about the conglomeration of all the different bubbles that are blown up
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.400]  financially in the world today and this grease thing is just the beginning of
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:33.520]  what's going to be revealed here shortly what's happening is we've isolated
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.400]  seven major bubbles in the world today most people don't talk about it but do
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.640]  you want to hear about them go ahead okay well the personal debt bubble we're
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.000]  all feeling that everybody's all stressed out over money no wonder people
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.880]  aren't smiling on the streets they're deeply in debt but again that's all part
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:53.840]  of the plan and we know about the bond bubble the bond thing is what most of
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.880]  the experts are focusing on look the government is borrowed what is it 18.7
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.480]  trillion right now and all the governments around the country world
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:06.320]  have the same kind of bond bubble so the bond bubble is going to pop I just saw
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.680]  a thing on BBC today the US government just printed more cash and it ever has
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.960]  printed before so I'd say we're definitely in a cash bubble they've
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.080]  created more cash whether it's euros or dollars or drachmas I don't care what
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.080]  they are we're in a situation with more cash in the world than ever real estate
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.960]  well it's in another bubble again and that's the original thing that Peter
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:29.280]  Schiff was warning everybody about the real estate bubble well it's at new high
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.000]  levels now it's even higher than it was in 2008 it's something like 45%
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.440]  better than it was then it's just totally insane you know in that fact
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.520]  everybody right where they live that's most people's equity if they aren't
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.320]  that they got at least a little bit of equity in their home and they've seen
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.280]  that equity come back again but hey that's just another bubble too and of
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.760]  course you got the stock market bubble they call it the equity got the
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:55.880]  education bubble okay well there's eight you've got the future
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:03.600]  health care cost bubble Obamacare is the health care yeah so you know right now
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.720]  you were you've been reporting every you know you talk about a lot Illinois what
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:12.640]  are they 180 billion in debt California 100 no what is 108 in Illinois 180 in
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:21.080]  California that's current debt by the way not what is future commitments yeah
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.680]  and then the last one is the derivative bubble now you've got all this stuff
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:30.000]  paper written off of stuff like you know you're into the precious metals and you
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.680]  look at what's going on with the manipulation of the silver prices
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:37.560]  through the naked shorts on the comics market that you've got a huge bubble
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.600]  going on with the derivatives I mean this is you know we decided you know
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.960]  to pick out eight different bubbles all about to pop and that's just gonna set
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.200]  them up for the big war so you know what you're doing is a good thing warning
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.400]  people if you're not angry or even a little depressed you're not being
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.880]  attention God bless you brother and again thanks for putting up with me sorry I
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:07.240]  was getting angry earlier I just legitimately here's an allegory we're
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.960]  a ship the captain says he's taking the ship on this course you can look at this
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:17.920]  chart the map and you can see that in a thousand miles we're gonna run into a
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:23.200]  major continent and the captain's arguing saying no that's more ocean out
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.840]  beyond there it's totally safe you're like no it's well known you're going
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.400]  down the road of tyranny it's well known this is gonna happen well I've been on
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:36.600]  the year since we were a thousand miles out now we're two miles out you can see
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:42.960]  the mountains you can see coral reefs coming into view and I'm up on the deck
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.360]  of the ship and you are and all of us going hey to the other folks we're
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.400]  headed towards land we're about to run into it it's gonna be devastating and
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.960]  they look at you and they go what's land what's ship what's water you're like
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.520]  look we're on a ship the water we're coming towards the reef and they just
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:08.880]  go and you're just like I mean our government created Al Qaeda created
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.680]  ISIS is funding them killed everybody at Benghazi to give them weapons I told
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.440]  you they're gonna start attacking Rand Paul exposes it so the media says he's
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:26.960]  behind the next attack that's inverted reality
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.280]  that's crazy
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:43.240]  it is the dishonorableness of people like John Boehner and Chris Christie and
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.360]  Morocco mama I was watching Obama's video address where he didn't thank God
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.600]  he's always said God bless the end which is kind of a folksy friend now he
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.080]  says you know have a great weekend or have a nice day you know the trendy
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.320]  thing and in his fourth of July address he didn't say it but I looked at how
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:05.760]  charismatic he was how fake he was what a good liar he is I mean he can project
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.440]  that he really cares about you and he's legitimate he's for real he makes Bill
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.560]  Clinton look like a sorry liar in Barat but then I know what he's done he knows
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.920]  the policies they put in place double black unemployment he knows they're
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.640]  building more federally funded prisons in black areas he knows Planned
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.440]  Parenthood's targeting blacks he knows in his first year in office he got
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:33.320]  funding doubled for basically forced abortions in Africa
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:42.680]  he knows vaccines are deadly he knows non-organics really bad he's just so
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.040]  evil
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.640]  and they could have had the first black president and use it to bring people
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.240]  together as poll numbers show when he was first elected but as soon as he got
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.160]  in you saw the design he it was another cold-blooded globalist move to create
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.000]  absolute racial strife
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:15.080]  I mean I can't even watch MSNBC anymore they are so premeditatedly abusive and
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:24.440]  evil they're so horrible they know what they're doing
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.600]  and can you imagine what they're gonna do during a meltdown in this country
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.360]  they're gonna take bank accounts pension funds stock market stuff and if you get
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:41.120]  upset and go out and try to you know get justice back at your state level
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.680]  they're just gonna have federal troops invade the state blow up stuff and say
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.320]  you did it or I did it and that we're you know rebel flag waivers or something
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.080]  I mean you could see what they've geared up and gotten ready and it's horrible
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:28:00.280]  and this is why I'm so upset in my gut the feeling I have is those times that I
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.760]  got mugged a couple times or the big bully cornered me and I was gonna have
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:10.280]  to fight them that it's not fear it's the sickening feeling that I'm gonna have
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:17.960]  to fight but it's sitting here in my whole life the experience having to
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.160]  fight physically was right then I could just do it and get it over with now I
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.800]  got to sit here in slow motion watching the asleep public drool collectively
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:34.040]  while I watch the criminals come in and steal everything nailed down and just
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:39.240]  level this country I'm gonna go to break and come back and then I'm gonna race
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:45.160]  through your calls I promise Corey and Darrell and John and Jeff and Joe great
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.920]  call last caller was an excellent call and we'll get your take on this whole
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:57.160]  situation but I physically have empathy for the Greeks reduced to $22 a day I
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.920]  didn't get out of the bank that's not the government doing that that's the real
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.720]  government the global government the casual society grid that's JP Morgan
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:12.800]  Goldman Sachs and to see food shipments being stopped into the country they're
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.400]  talking about stopping medicine coming in even if you're a company owner and have
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:20.040]  the money and paid your taxes and you want to contract outside to bring food
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:26.200]  in the EU has a grid around the country and isn't letting them leave I mean this
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:33.320]  is hardcore and you watch CNN or something they're reporting on it like
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:39.600]  it's no big deal because I know this is gonna be visited upon us it's why they
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.920]  don't want yet being self-sufficient it's why they demonize preppers I don't
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.680]  want to say it but I got to we told you so we're on the March the Empire's on
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:30:00.080]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network presidential candidate Chris
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.560]  Christie wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.880]  even happened yet here is what he told Morning Joe viewers what Rand Paul has
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.560]  done to make the country weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing as the
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.080]  only guy who used the Patriot Act in this race as a former prosecutor we're
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.280]  going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings and in front of
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.720]  Congress if there's another attack not the director of the FBI or the director
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.880]  of the CIA that's right Governor Christie we shouldn't look at the FBI
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.280]  even though almost every terror attack on this country has happened with the
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.600]  help of an FBI informant or what about the statements made by agent Thomas
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.040]  Fuentes who said we have to keep the fear alive in order to justify budget
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.240]  increases and then back in 2009 former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:46.960]  claimed that he was pressured by members of George Bush's cabinet to raise the
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.360]  national terror alert level just before the 2004 presidential election no we
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.360]  shouldn't look at those guys that's right Christie you really have your

[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:01.280]  Chris Christie clip of him talking about an analysis that Rob Dude did of it but
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.240]  right now we're gonna go to your calls and then the story that's up on info
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:12.080]  wars.com again I read this story when it went up about 30 minutes ago by Paul
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:17.360]  Joseph Watson and it made me disgusted and it reminded me of what I'd already
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:22.760]  read about the Trilateral Commission plan and you wonder why they're flooding
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:31.040]  Europe, Western and Eastern with illegal aliens from Africa and from the
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:37.400]  Middle East at record levels. The plan is to make them a new voting block that
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:43.680]  will trump any individual EU country ever getting out and then have them
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:48.360]  basically call for merging with Africa and the Middle East. Oh that's a great
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:56.760]  idea and so now the EU security head has called political Islam the future of
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:04.880]  Europe. Sharia law for the West. As the threat from ISIS extremists grows the
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:12.080]  European Union's head of foreign affairs and security policy Fred Rika Mog
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:17.160]  Hernini I believe you pronounce it right has caused consternation by asserting
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:24.160]  that political Islam is a firm part of Europe's future. Responding to last month's
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:28.840]  brutal Islamist terror attack in Tunisia, Kuwait and France she dismissed the idea
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.680]  of a class of civilizations and shot back at critics of mass immigration.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.400]  Islam belongs in Europe it holds a place in Europe's history I guess invading a
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.080]  few times and taking over areas I guess that's true and killing Christians and
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:47.840]  mass I mean I'm not attacking Islam per se but give me a break I mean Europe can't
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:52.560]  even be for Europeans now I guess or Christians because there's this
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.480]  socialist and globalist hatred of Christians folks period. Islam belongs
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.760]  in Europe it holds a place in Europe's history in our culture in our food and
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:05.720]  what matters most in Europe's present and future before adding I'm not afraid
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.600]  to say that political Islam should be part of the picture. Religion plays a
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:15.280]  role in politics yeah ban all Christian stuff again get rid of Christian
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.320]  culture bring in another not always good not always bad religion can be part of
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.720]  the process what makes the difference is whether the process is democratic or
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:29.280]  not really well what if 51% of Muslims vote to put bags over women's heads or
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.800]  sexually mutilate them does my daughter have to go get her genitals cut off or
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.440]  wear a bag overhead you're gonna have to come through my guns first I'm sick of
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.000]  being overwrote I'm sick of being told to stand down by all you fascist boot
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.840]  lickers ally with any criminal organization you can telling me you're
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:53.560]  the liberal you're a bunch of scum what you are mentally ill Jacobins from the
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:58.000]  French Revolution who wanted to invert reality have 10-day work weeks
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.240]  abolish the family you're a bunch of crazy people I'm gonna do the Christie
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.240]  piece on your calls I promise let's let's play Chris Christie go ahead and
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:16.120]  roll this this disgusting maggot when our government is rogue our government's
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.760]  funding the terrorist our government is clearly out of control and illegitimate
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.560]  and then now Rand Paul trying to stop it trying to stop funding al-Qaeda and
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.040]  ISIS and exposing Benghazi he's now the enemy and when there's a terror attack
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.360]  it's his fault that's how stupid he thinks you are and you know what I'm
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:35.800]  afraid not this audience but the general public I think he knows what he's
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:45.240]  talking about what a slug he thinks he'll get brownie points doing stuff like
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.400]  this let's go ahead go to the club yeah and in in town hall meetings people are
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.440]  really worried about ISIS they're really worried about the threat of terrorism
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.200]  and that's why what Rand Paul has done to make this country weaker and more
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.840]  vulnerable is a terrible thing and for him to raise money off of it is
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:04.280]  disgraceful it's disgraceful as the only guy who's used the Patriot Act in
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:09.240]  this race as a former prosecutor you know what he's done is we're gonna look
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.600]  back on this I what listen this morning we're gonna look back on this and he
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.600]  should be in front of hearings in front of Congress there's another attack not
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:22.080]  the director of the FBI or the director of the CIA so it's not Rand Paul trying
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.480]  to stop ISIS no no he's behind it now here in upside down world now let's
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.680]  reverse upside down world and come back to the real world with a one minute
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.440]  vignette that we air on local radio stations across the country that Rob do
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.800]  put together here it is yeah and in in town presidential candidate Chris
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.280]  Christie wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.600]  even happened yet here is what he told Morning Joe viewers what Rand Paul has
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.280]  done to make the country weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing as the
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.800]  only guy who used the Patriot Act in this race as a former prosecutor we're
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.000]  going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings and in front of
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.440]  Congress if there's another attack not the director of the FBI or the director
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.600]  of the CIA that's right Governor Christie we shouldn't look at the FBI
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.000]  even though almost every terror attack on this country has happened with the
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.240]  help of an FBI informant or what about the statements made by Agent Thomas
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:18.720]  Fuentes who said we have to keep the fear alive in order to justify budget
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.960]  increases and then back in 2009 former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.680]  claimed that he was pressured by members of George Bush's cabinet to raise the
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:31.040]  national terror alert level just before the 2004 presidential election no we
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.040]  shouldn't look at those guys that's right Christie you really have your
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.720]  priorities straight Rob do reporting for info wars comm and info wars nightly
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:42.400]  news by the way Drudge had a Hill article out yesterday that the majority of
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.160]  the money being given by Republicans and Democratic leadership is to try to
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.680]  knock Rand Paul out of the race not worried about Trump not worried about
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:58.320]  Bush they're worried about Paul because they know he's for real folks they know
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.960]  Governor Abbott's for real they know the Attorney General down here's for real
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.680]  they just indicted the Texas Attorney General or there the indictment is
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:12.360]  pending in the grand jury for securities fraud he faces life in prison
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:19.360]  over not filing a thousand dollar filing fee he forgot to do maybe I heard he
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:26.440]  even had a crooked fingernail once okay we're on your phone calls let's talk to
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.040]  Corey in Washington thanks for holding you're a trooper welcome sir hey Alex
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.840]  thanks for having me thank you um about four months ago you had a guy on named
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.480]  Richie Allen out of the UK and you were discussing how people are waking up but
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.720]  there's no one really to lead or guide them and I had a recommendation piggy
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:52.320]  backing on Dave your last caller of more excellent guests in the Paul Craig
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.040]  Roberts Joel Scowzenbold and they're four of them I think you've had Dr. Allen
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.520]  keys on before it's always good to hear from him if you could get him back on
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.840]  again that would be awesome I don't know if you're aware of Chris Ann Hall she's
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:10.080]  a constitutional attorney setting brush fires of liberty all over the land
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.800]  trying to restore the public get Patriots to tear down the walls of
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:20.560]  indoctrination if you could get her on she is fantastic and then two that would
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.240]  be relevant to this week that are always harping on the fake money and the fake
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:32.080]  currencies would be Ann Barnhart and Ernest Huber and as a she's out of
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:39.080]  Denver Colorado and she was she went she shut her brokerage house down after
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:43.840]  the MF global thing because she knew at that point when the honorable John
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.360]  Corzine stole those people's money that she could no longer do it she knew as a
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.440]  rig she knew as a game and she got out she she basically will take those into
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  consideration thank you I'm aware some of those folks in their work
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.840]  specifically though what do you think about the Greek economy is this the
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.720]  beginning of the big one or what do you think it's about to happen you know who
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.760]  know the good you know all smoke and mirrors you know it's all it's all a
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.760]  game it's all to get everybody excited you never know you know what kind of
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:22.040]  shadow puppets they're putting up but but you know yeah who knows it's fun
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:25.480]  to think about and go into scenarios but it's just like what it is I mean
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.480]  people obviously people are waking up because you know maybe five years ago
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:33.040]  I said oh okay they would have you know just voted they wouldn't have voted no
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:36.080]  they just would have said okay just do what you've been doing well the Greeks
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.520]  have already had to have massive tax increases to pay off a lot of debt that's
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:45.440]  not theirs some of the debt is theirs and and so they know that they raise taxes
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.520]  again it'll only stall their economy more but now the globalists are gonna cut
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.120]  off their food their medicine you name it and I just wonder if the world's gonna
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:59.880]  stand by and let the private banks this world government that's growing engage
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:05.360]  in human rights violations against Greece well that's up to you know we the
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.720]  people in other people's countries that they're gonna sit around and be slayed
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:13.340]  so they can get up and fight well I think folks should book trips to Greece to
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:18.320]  support them and I'm strongly considering going to Spain Italy and
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.680]  Greece the main epicenters of what we're about to see unfold and I believe
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:28.520]  there's a very good chance it's gonna be this winter or early next year it may
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.120]  even be this fall but I think we're gonna see a new global spectacular meltdown
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:40.360]  and out of that a call for a global body headed up by the IMF World Bank and
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:45.560]  International Bank of Settlements to stabilize global currencies and now
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.880]  whether a country likes it or not they've got to go under the control of
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:55.280]  this institution to fix a global crisis with a global body and now there's an
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:01.040]  article that US preparing coup to prevent Greece from falling under Russian
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.280]  influence oh yes the Russians are to blame for everything no the mega banks
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.480]  are the ones that have conquered this country thank you so much for the call
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.520]  the United States and Germany are preparing to engineer a coup in Greece
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:19.600]  to keep the country operating as a strategic asset of NATO's vulnerable
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:26.120]  southeast European flank a push in Athens to save the allied Greece from the
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.520]  enemy Russia is in preparation by the US and Germany with backing from non
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:35.640]  taxpayers of Greece the Greek oligarchs Anglo-Greek ship owners and the Greek
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:40.240]  Church writes John Helmer the longest continually serving foreign correspondent
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:44.720]  in Russia not connected to the corporate media the primary tip-off
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.800]  something is brewing can be detected by the presence of Victorian Newland
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:53.000]  Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in Athens in March
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  Newton the Guardian reported on March 17th flew into the capital amid mounting
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.760]  US concerns that the great Euro debt crisis have begun to pose a geopolitical
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:06.640]  threat allowed to veer out of control Greece could end up in the habit of
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:12.880]  Russia financially bereft and without EU links to keep it bound to the west
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.280]  NATO's southeastern flank would be immeasurably weakened at a time of
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.360]  mounting global security woes over Islamic fundamentalists the Middle East
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:29.560]  the Guardian reports oh the radical army the jihadis there'll be a new invasion
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:35.720]  of Europe by the Muslims if we don't give in the global government it's the
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:40.080]  globalist running the clash of civilizations bringing in not the
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.200]  scientists not the technicians not the patriots of the Middle East there are
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:49.400]  a lot of good folks over there but the scum of the earth who then promptly
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:55.560]  sign up for welfare and put on gangster outfits and merge jihadi culture with
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:07.280]  gangster gangbanger hip-hop culture a horrid mutation in the midst of Europe
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.440]  bitching and complaining that their welfare checks aren't big enough I
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:21.400]  mean what a disaster but the socialists controlled by the globalist instinctively
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.840]  hate wealth hate independence so they want to wreck it and pull it all down so
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.120]  they can squat on top of it and then have armored security all around them to
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.480]  protect them from the public when they themselves are the ones that
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:40.960]  destabilized the entire world Daryl in California thanks for holding yeah
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.880]  there Alex yes I am brother good to hear from you okay oh yeah so good to hear
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.480]  from you I my wife and I were in Germany just a few weeks ago during
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:55.280]  Bilderberg and we traveled through northern Europe or just the lower two
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:00.960]  thirds of Germany and from Frankfurt down and that the news there you know
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.320]  their their news bubble is a little different from ours they have their own
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.320]  propaganda that they they push on their people but in traveling through there and
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.160]  then visiting with her family and you know turning them on to the Second
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.880]  Amendment which they were afraid of and until I left and discussing with them
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:24.720]  how about the gold that Germany wants their gold back and he said that her
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:28.440]  uncle says flat out they want their gold back and they need to get their gold
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:37.160]  back we would support them as best we could on the lower levels but the
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:40.280]  people of that country I think it'd be very resilient now I didn't go to
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.120]  Greece but I think the people of Greece you know we're looking at ancient
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.520]  cultures a culture that America you know we're only go back a few hundred years
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.720]  I was you know I was staying in buildings you know in hotels that were
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:57.760]  300 400 years old and and going to these different things and into visiting
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:04.280]  these people the barns on those farms there are you know they have a 16,000
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:09.280]  square foot footprint and they're three stories tall and the countryside you
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.360]  fly over the country it's totally green it's all farms and they even farm their
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.240]  trees they have sections that are forest that they cut down and replant and
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:22.720]  they farm trees and they do something else now they're photon farmers I call
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:27.680]  them they have all of those giant barns have thousands of solar panels on them
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:32.840]  if something breaks down in Europe if it comes apart in Europe and these people
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.400]  don't like the euro these communities will fall together in small little cells
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:42.360]  I'm glad you mentioned that because Europe is much more self-sufficient
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:48.040]  Greece and other areas of Germany as well than the United States we used to be
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.640]  very self-sufficient they never basically gave up their agrarian lifestyle
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:55.400]  even though they live in the city a lot of folks go out and have a farm in the
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.680]  country even if you're not wealthy that's just part of the culture even you
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:02.840]  know lower-middle-class Dutch people will have a little farm or a little
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.840]  little cottage out at the lake and there's a culture of liking to do this
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.680]  and so you're absolutely right people can pull out of the euro how can you have
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:16.000]  such industrious hard-working people and then be told they're all in debt
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.960]  because we've been maneuvered to this point God bless you good to hear from
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:25.600]  you great points when I was talking about gold being racist I'm not joking
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.760]  Africa has more minerals than any other continent in the world per square mile
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.720]  it's joke level how they've got basically every trace element every precious
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:46.920]  metal resources out the wazoo but whenever African countries try to ship
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.880]  out any of their own goods they're called blood diamonds or they're called
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.640]  conflict minerals what that means is Western combines don't let them sell
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.040]  their goods unless they go through them and then they warehouse the goods to
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.880]  artificially drive up the price and won't let African countries or
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:11.880]  individuals have any profit from that if you do buy a diamond you should
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:16.560]  basically from my research buy one they call a blood diamond that means it
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.040]  actually might have come from somebody good or bad you don't know it didn't
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.760]  come through the Oppenheimer's the beers and that monopoly but see all the
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.280]  trendies in the Hollywood movies and the ads don't buy a conflict diamond go to
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:33.720]  the store and buy a $20,000 ring for your wife you know that actually cost
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:41.280]  them $10 and you know don't don't actually see how it's all inverted and
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:46.560]  that's how they use a cause celeb or political correctness it's like the
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.600]  World Wildlife Fund with Prince Bernhardt that found that it got caught
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:55.200]  running secret operations poaching to make money of course it's like whatever
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.760]  they say they do they're the opposite you understand we'll be back communist
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:03.400]  China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.000]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor does that

[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.280]  that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing I didn't
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:15.640]  realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what is that
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:19.200]  well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:23.840]  radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.800]  card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:31.320]  readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit card
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:35.640]  numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds scary

[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.640]  I want to be clear Alex Jones here back live I'm not just here complaining and
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:36.680]  getting angry because I like to get mad there's so much good stuff in the world
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:43.400]  so much productivity so many smart cool people and to just see a bunch of
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:50.360]  criminal elites use propaganda flim flam financial fraud to take over and to
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:55.280]  know they've got it out for us I just want to beat these people doesn't mean
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.560]  we're gonna have some utopia but I want to reverse all of that I want to try to
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:06.160]  build a better world doesn't mean I have all the answers but during the break I
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.240]  was reading these articles they're up on drudge and info wars murderer of this
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:17.120]  young woman just shot her for no reason he now admits to it I chose San Francisco
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:24.680]  because it was a sanctuary city and that was just wonderful virtue to just let
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.360]  anybody in and then let them commit crimes and let them stay here because
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:34.520]  they're an immigrant well we've got to let women fly in from Europe and China
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.080]  and Africa and have their babies and be paid for because they're immigrants I
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:49.040]  mean okay well intellectually how is that fair just they're an immigrant it's
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:54.680]  like we post videos of the knockout game intensifying and I see racist whites in
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:58.200]  there a lot of them are just trolls making mindless comments they only make
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.560]  it worse and I see other liberal commenters doing more racism for men fall

[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:38.400]  Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:44.800]  there's a reason 19 years ago I got that music as intro music about a year
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:50.120]  into my radio career is because I always image the globalist as the Imperial
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:55.040]  Battle March we're under attack you don't think the government doesn't know
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.200]  that having more guns means less crime they want our guns to dominate and
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:06.720]  control us I know I'm stating obvious things here but again they know we're
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.800]  awake for the fact the government's illegitimate rogue so they want to
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:15.600]  direct our revolution at local government we need to take local
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.360]  government over and really this broadcast even though it's supported by
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.560]  the listeners and by people that are awake and who are the best people out
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:30.800]  there bar none it's not even for you it's not for me it's to reach out to
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.520]  people that aren't awake and aren't involved that caller earlier was in
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:37.920]  Germany talking to folks he said he ended up waking him up after hanging out
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.000]  with him with for a week about how the second amendment is key and they were
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:46.200]  first scared of it then they understood I can deprogram people in a matter of
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:53.120]  in a matter of hours and that's what I'm so frustrated about is that I'll be at
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.240]  home at night and want to shoot videos I want to be on air or all weekend I
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:01.400]  wanted to do some productions but everybody was off which is fine and
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:06.000]  then I actually get in here on Monday morning and I have been worried about
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.360]  this all weekend I was in her on Sunday and I'm not even trying to whine it's
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:18.240]  just I just feel so nasty I don't even want to look at Chris Christie anymore
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:25.440]  and Hillary Clinton I mean this woman needs to be in prison and I'll tell you
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:31.200]  what else I'm mad about a fundamental level I genetically at a cellular level
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.720]  know that what I'm doing is dangerous and I don't say that for effect it's
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.120]  dangerous just the fact that nut could walk up on the street and blow me away
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.680]  whatever not to mention the government and all the rest of it that if I told
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:51.200]  you all about it you wouldn't believe it it's weird to be in the matrix and be
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:54.440]  away can be around a bunch of zombies that's all I'm trying to get at John and
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:57.240]  Montana thanks for holding you're a trooper I'm gonna go to Joe and others
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:04.360]  go ahead welcome yeah hi I think I think Reese while it's sad is a kind of a
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.880]  distraction I think we know that they want world government I think they we
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.720]  know they want agenda 21 and we can see that they're trying to say that the US
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:18.360]  is a has a pro-sharia law constitution I think that that's where they're going
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:22.360]  with it is to try to bring everybody underneath the caliphate that they
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:29.200]  publicly deny exists in Iraq right now but I think that as of right now they're
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:36.680]  just trying to slowly edge the Muslims in and give as to land back to Mexico to
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.480]  continue the infighting so that they can still have a back and forth oh we have
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:44.440]  the head of EU security saying they're gonna turn Europe Muslim and it's just
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:48.680]  weird to like be told we're not just gonna take your guns and your kids and
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:52.720]  forcefully inoculate you we're gonna bring in groups who historically don't
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.440]  promote freedom I'm talking about I'm talking about radical Muslims because
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:00.360]  radical Islam has taken over the Middle East I mean I went to high school
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:04.960]  college with Muslim folks Muslim friends I like a lot of Muslims I'm not I'm
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:10.400]  not an Islamophobe but I am just like I'm not I'm not a quote homophobe but
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.920]  at the same time I'm told we're gonna teach your kids how to have oral sex
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.480]  with this you know it's like no you're not you know it's this boldness of the
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.960]  politically correct to tear down everything that was existing when I mean
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:28.720]  where is there a place for free market and family where is their room for
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:34.480]  anything and the answer is there is no room they are every exit they give you
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:39.000]  have a cliff attached to it so there's there's nothing we can really do as far
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:45.800]  as voting we have to fire and arrest these people and I'll go
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:52.680]  you're gonna say something else brother yeah I think he thought we'd hung up on
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:55.600]  him no I mean it's coming down to the point when they come to force be an
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:00.120]  ocular you know what do you do I mean you know you want to know why the Greeks
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:04.560]  voted no in an overwhelming majority to get out of the European Union well it
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:08.760]  goes back to the Troika swindle as Kurt Nemo writes in June the truth committee
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:12.000]  on public debt established by the speaker of the Greek Parliament came to
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.160]  the conclusion that Greece should not pay this debt because it is illegal
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:19.080]  illegitimate and odious the establishment media has hidden from view the facts
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:22.160]  behind the debt and it sided with the banks and declaring the population of
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:25.640]  Greece deserves austerity and it's attended poverty and misery because of
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:28.920]  the Greek government's refusal to accept the harsh conditions of the Troika
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.640]  consisting of the IMF European Commission and European Central Bank left
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:37.200]  unsaid is the fact that a large portion of the debt totaling 245 billion euros
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:41.560]  was fraudulently dumped on the country in the course of huge bailouts in 2010 and
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:45.680]  2012 the current Greek debt swindle is being compared to tarp the scam
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.240]  hoisted on the American people following the subprime fiasco and a move by the
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:52.720]  Federal Reserve to print 4 trillion in new money to cover the gambling debt of

[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:31.520]  radio network. Gerald Salente's riding shotgun with us taking your calls and
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:36.480]  covering the waterfront in this hour Jeff wants to talk about the economy Joe
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.920]  wants to talk about game over on the economy rich Joshua Wildman we'll get
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.840]  to all of you with Gerald Salente Gerald's been predicting a basically bomb
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:51.520]  bond market bust and chain reaction the last few years and of course been
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:57.600]  focusing on Greece but we see what I guess you could call direct democracy
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:04.680]  something Gerald Salente talks a lot about in Greece happening my problem is
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:09.680]  with such a dumb down public over here they could have 51% vote to take the
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:14.800]  middle classes money and redistributed to Goldman Sachs but Gerald Salente will
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:19.720]  say well we already have that with the banker bailouts of 2008 and they're
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:24.560]  clearly gearing up to start doing that in other Western countries that has now
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:31.680]  happened in Greece with them only letting them have 22 euros a day out of
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:36.960]  their accounts and the Financial Times of London reporting Greek banks prepare
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:41.680]  plan to raid deposits to avert collapse Greek banks preparing contingency
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:47.120]  plans for a possible bail in of depositors amid fears the country is
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:51.280]  heading for financial collapse well you should have enough money to let folks
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.960]  have it oh but you don't bankers and business people with knowledge the
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:59.760]  measures said this weekend the plans was called for a haircut that's a nice
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:07.600]  little euphemism of at least 30% of deposits above 8,000 euros sketch out
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:15.760]  an increasingly likely scenario for at least one bank the sources say AFP

[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.800]  increased financial uncertainty after Greece rejected the terms of the rescue
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:02.280]  package the rescue package I love how they spin it taking money out of your
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.280]  bank accounts a haircut putting you under austerity for debts that aren't yours
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.240]  is a rescue package
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:14.280]  latin america celebrates greek austerity no vote
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.960]  bonus sari's countries across latin america congratulated greece
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.480]  on its sunday referendum in which voters rejected creditors austerity demands
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:26.040]  and that's because just like africa you'll have billion dollar loans three
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:28.760]  billion dollar loans ten billion dollar loans
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:32.440]  where over time you pay ten times or more
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:37.480]  what the amount was and never get out from under it
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.840]  and then you find out the imf and world bank or just private bank fronts
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:48.440]  that loaned out digital money backed up by western credit taxpayers
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.160]  and then when the country's finally go belly up the big banks come in and just
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.840]  take over the infrastructure they'll finance a coup d'etat the government
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:00.280]  doesn't play ball and have them at gunpoint take control
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:04.280]  and that's the new word out that's on info wars dot com
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.360]  curtain i wrote a story about it u.s preparing coup to prevent greece
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:13.480]  from falling under russian influence well gerald salentes a best-selling
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.520]  author researcher political analyst frequent
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.880]  guest here doesn't need really in uh doesn't need any
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:25.480]  introduction trends research dot com uh is his website
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:28.840]  and he joins us to talk about this situation
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:32.520]  do you think this is finally the big one that ron paul and others have been
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.480]  warning of i mean we had john just two weeks ago
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.800]  talking about the ratcheting up of hysteria
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.800]  the elites headed for the exits governments and institutions hoarding
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:46.600]  gold while telling the public don't own it
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:51.400]  gerald salentes what do you make of the situation on the greek islands
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:57.560]  it's a big one even though greece's gdp is a fraction of the euro groups gdp
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:01.000]  it still means a lot because there's a lot of discontent
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.200]  i just got back from europe last wednesday
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:08.360]  and uh there there's a lot of discontent going around
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:11.080]  about what their governments are doing to the people
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:15.800]  and the so-called austerity measures which actually come down to
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:22.840]  robbing of your pensions raising taxes selling off valuable public assets to
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:29.320]  your buddies at discount rates and increasing the retirement age till
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:34.200]  after you die so what this is really bringing about
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.760]  it's empowering other nations such as italy
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:43.960]  and spain and portugal that have been put under the yoke of
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:50.920]  repression financial repression by the european monetary union
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:55.880]  so this is really big and you know alex i was going back over some information
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.080]  that we wrote in the past and this is from a trends journal
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:06.280]  oh this was the winter of 2012 so it's actually
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:13.480]  the um the december 2011 and what they were doing back then
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:16.840]  is the greek prime minister pop indreo
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:24.920]  had called for you ready for this a referendum on the austerity measures
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:29.080]  people forgot that i forgot that and you know what happened
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.720]  they got pressure from the european union to call it off
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:37.400]  so they did because the guy was obviously a coward
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.280]  so this is very big what happened and whether or not they voted
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.760]  yes or no really makes no difference the difference is that the people of
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:49.160]  taken the future into their own hands
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:52.520]  whereby they weren't going to be dictated to
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:59.400]  be robbed more from the international mafia federation better known as the imf
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:04.840]  and the world bank and the hedge funds who made this baloney up that if banks
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:10.360]  and hedge funds and private equity groups and what they love to call investors
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.360]  as adults called gamblers made bad bets
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.520]  and we the people have to pay them off they lost their money
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.520]  this is bankers money that was lost why are they putting
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:26.360]  the onus on the people to pay him off i'll tell you why
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  because it's called fascism the merger of state and corporate powers
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:37.480]  nothing has changed alex since the days of jesus christ
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.160]  chasing the money changers out of the temple
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:46.840]  they just have official names now they're gullman sacks jp morgans
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:51.720]  chase their bank of royal bank of scotland their
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:57.160]  their society general the money changers have names
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:00.280]  and then when you look at the scam going on
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:04.600]  who's the guy that runs the european central bank
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:09.080]  couldn't be mario dragy one of vice chairman of the gullman sacks gang of
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.920]  european division who's the guy they put up as a so-called
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:17.640]  technocrat in greece that was going to straighten us all out two years ago
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:22.120]  oh yeah another guy a papa damos hey wasn't he with the
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:26.280]  wasn't he with the gullman sacks gang too and the rest of the group
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:32.120]  of course he was so this all this is it's a banking takeover and they want to
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:38.200]  paint it in another color to make it seem what it isn't
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:43.400]  well i can't say it any better jerald than what you just broke down
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:47.400]  i would expect now to see the global mafia
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:54.600]  tear greece to pieces and blame their economic collapse
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:58.440]  further into degradation on the greek people
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:03.000]  uh i know that uh areas of latin america like argentina
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.920]  that were pegged of the dollar and bought into globalism
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.720]  went from one of the wealthiest countries in the hemisphere
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:14.440]  to one of the poorest in just a decade i know you've traveled down there
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.520]  to see it for yourself uh but it's a total transformation
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:24.120]  these globalist will suck countries dry they will create squalor they will
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:28.760]  consolidate control uh and they'll call it free market and scapegoat
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:34.360]  capitalism while they're at it so i think it's key that greece
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:39.240]  not pay the taxes and grow their own food as they're starting to do
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:42.520]  and just totally break with the system i think that
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:46.040]  the establishment is going to push so far that whether it's greece
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:50.840]  or some other country they're going to force people to go back to nationalism
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:55.480]  and back to sovereignty and back to the interests of the people
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:18:00.280]  you summed it up perfectly and and that's by the way i read that article
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:05.080]  on info wars about the u.s preparing uh for a coup
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.080]  you know it to to really destabilize this area
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:12.520]  because they've made the people we the people over there
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.680]  you know decided what they wanted and that you can't have any of that
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:21.320]  so you're exactly right what this is doing it's showing the people that they
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:24.680]  don't need the european central bank
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:30.440]  brussels as the mafia controlling them their destiny is in their own hands
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:38.760]  look they have about 350 billion dollars in debt you saw the gdp of greece
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:43.720]  decline some 30 percent since this whole austerity
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:48.280]  measure thing began and as you point out who do they blame
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:51.800]  let's blame the people because they got social benefits
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:55.400]  and they're living off the you know government they're not talking about the
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:59.320]  dirty deals that are made hey you know what they're having cut alex
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.720]  the defense budget oh yeah that's right the same thing
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:07.800]  like that guy what's his name over there did over in wisconsin that guy with
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:11.240]  the big mouth and the and the little mind let's see he's running for president
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:15.640]  walker that's it scott walker yeah we're gonna get rid of all those
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:20.520]  unions those public unions but we're not gonna touch the police
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:24.760]  same deal man you know it's one big group
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:29.080]  and they want the military in control to put
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:32.840]  down the people when they get out of line
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:38.840]  and that's what they're doing there stay there gerald salente is our guest
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:44.200]  one thing is clear there are big problems inside the world government

[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:50.360]  the port of rico governor coming out last week and saying they're insolvent
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.000]  well pretty much most counties and cities are insolvent
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.720]  but we're told by the leader of the free world
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.480]  that raising our debt doesn't raise our debt we don't know when all this is
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:04.280]  going to unravel but it looks like we're getting closer to it
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:08.520]  what's going to happen when it unravels oh what is going to happen is you're
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:12.520]  going to start seeing panic in the streets take what's going on in greece
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:16.840]  how could any thinking human being that's living in that country
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:21.560]  have left money in the bank knowing that this was going to happen
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.400]  so what you mentioned port of rico they're doing the same thing
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:30.440]  how about this people have lost their jobs they have a huge unemployment what
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.920]  about 40 percent of the people are you know on some form of welfare
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:41.480]  i got it let's raise taxes on the people that's what they just did
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:46.120]  they all do these stupid things and then you start putting all the pieces
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.160]  together what's going on around the world
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:52.680]  and one of the you just asked me what else is on our radar
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:26:00.120]  how about china that's basically out of the news the markets there
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:04.600]  are down some 30 percent after having gone up
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:08.200]  what about over a hundred percent in 12 months
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:13.400]  down 30 percent since the middle of june so now
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:17.400]  here's what's going on when people say are the markets rig
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:21.800]  of course they are but they love to use that proper language
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.480]  to make it seem as though we're all so stupid
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:30.280]  because it's white shoe boy talk this is the headline
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.320]  of today's financial times here it is
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:39.720]  china pumps liquidity into markets in fresh attempt
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:44.600]  to halt share selloff remember this is the big story
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.520]  public liquidity how about rigging the markets
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:54.520]  could anybody say that are it markets supposed to take their natural course
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:59.480]  of course not not when you have to keep the Ponzi scheme going
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:03.720]  Gerald i remember 10 years ago we we'd have ron paul on talking about the
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:06.600]  plunge protection team and markets being rigged people didn't
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.640]  believe us now they admit the currencies are rigged every day
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.160]  the interest rates are rigged the stock markets rigged
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:19.400]  and i love how they just hide it in plain view like it's a good thing now
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:22.200]  and they say we're going to take money out of your private bank account
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.800]  and give it to shadowy groups that's a haircut again white shoe boy language
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.880]  yeah and and you know you mentioned you know what ron paul said
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:38.600]  and it's it this is in conspiracy theory these guys get convicted convicted
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:43.400]  not charge convicted of felonies for rigging the
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:47.000]  LIBOR rate the interest rates and the forex market
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:54.760]  the currency markets get convicted and not one person goes to jail
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:59.240]  so that's what it is they're rigging the markets it's in front of everybody's
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:04.760]  eyes the chinese are proudly announcing it if you go to global times
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:08.680]  one of their their biggest news outlets
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:13.000]  you're saying that how they're going to you know
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.680]  create stability in the markets you're rigging the markets
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:21.960]  and by the way the chinese market is very important because
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:25.960]  a lot of this money are the so-called retail investors
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.000]  these are people at a gambling that don't know what they're doing
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.040]  and they have a huge amount of margin calls now you add up what's going on
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:37.480]  the i mentioned to you how much the market has gone up
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.680]  in in china over the last year over a hundred percent
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:49.000]  that was also equivalent to about 1.3 percent of add-on to their GDP
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.240]  so they're actually in looking at declines way beyond what they're
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:57.400]  reporting so when you put all this together what's going on in europe
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:02.200]  what's going on in china what's going on in brazil's in a recession
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.480]  you're looking at destabilization in places like now
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:10.360]  that's not making the news in america the globe is on fire and the collapse
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:14.280]  clearly has been ongoing and is speeding up right now
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:18.600]  if china stock market starts tanking which headlines say
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:22.200]  it's begun you can guarantee that's going to hit our markets
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:25.480]  i want to get your take on what you think's next gerald salente
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:29.640]  the trends forecaster and your phone calls i promise when we come back we're

[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:02.280]  presidential candidate christ christie wants americans to blame ran paul for
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:05.240]  terror attacks that haven't even happened yet here is what he told
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:08.920]  morning joe viewers what ran paul has done to make the country
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:12.040]  weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.760]  as the only guy who used a patriot act in this race as a former prosecutor
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.440]  we're going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:23.080]  and in front of congress if there's another attack
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:26.520]  not the director of the fbi or the director of the cia
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:29.000]  that's right governor christie we shouldn't look at the fbi
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.120]  even though almost every terror attack on this country has happened with the
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:34.840]  help of an fbi informant or what about the statements made by
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:38.520]  agent tomas fuentes who said we have to keep the fear alive in order to justify
[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:41.720]  budget increases and then back in 2009 former homeland
[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:45.000]  security secretary tom ridge claimed that he was pressured by members of
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.440]  george bush's cabinet to raise the national terror alert level just
[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:52.680]  before the 2004 presidential election no we shouldn't look at those guys
[02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:55.800]  that's right christie you really have your priority straight rob do reporting

[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:07.720]  or the nightly news or the news website info wars dot com because
[02:32:07.720 --> 02:32:11.960]  the companies i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they
[02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:16.360]  weren't as affordable as they should be so i refused probably 30 40
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:19.160]  firearms manufacturers over the years will then

[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:34.840]  it's alex jones
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:38.200]  friendsresearch.com's website just want to start guests we're gonna take your
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:42.200]  phone calls here in just a moment
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:45.400]  when i get up on air and start apologizing for being in a bad mood it's
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:49.560]  because i'm in such a bad mood i feel like you can feel it
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:52.120]  and in truth i talked to the crew notice they go everything's fine you don't
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.000]  need to stop apologizing but i just am physically panicking almost
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.080]  because i know history and i know where this is going
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:06.440]  and i've also seen things in my own personal life that i
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:10.280]  really don't want to see repeated and then i realize
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:15.240]  we don't just have bad management we have really evil management
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:19.960]  that could cause a nuclear war or anything else for that matter
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:24.040]  and yes the world's waking up to a certain extent but at the same time
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:27.640]  a lot of people are so dumb down they can't even tell you what the declaration
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:31.320]  of independence is or what july 4th stands for
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:36.520]  and that fundamentally gets me down i believe the people are the answer
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:39.400]  but also the population tuning into mainstream media
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:43.800]  is not the answer but we know with austerity
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:48.520]  people tend to start really waking up humanity is amazing we have unlimited
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:53.000]  potential but if we continue to follow
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.560]  the modern systems of globalism we have no future
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:00.280]  i'm going to ask gerald salante what he thinks the next shoot a drop is
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:04.360]  and we're going right to your phone calls uh briefly this broadcast is
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.240]  listeners supported when you buy the high quality

[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.760]  or any of the it's over 500 items now at info wars
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:23.880]  store.com you are making this transmission possible
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:29.800]  and you know speaking of management i personally need to spend more time
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:35.400]  on trying to figure out how to fund this news operation
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:39.240]  so that i can expand and do a lot of the big things
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:43.080]  that i want to be able to do we have free shipping
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:47.080]  throughout the month of july we have 25 off on the
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:51.400]  made in america molon lobby come and take it belt buckles
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:54.520]  we have a bunch of specials on the nutraceuticals
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.360]  for anybody that really is in business of manufacturing and producing
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.320]  especially high quality uh nutraceuticals
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:07.320]  high quality supplements you'll know that sourcing the ingredients and getting
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:11.160]  it manufactured at one of the top three labs we use three of them
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:16.440]  in the united states is a problem because it can take up to
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:21.560]  four months sometimes to get your product manufactured and then i've
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:24.840]  done things like stockpile it and then suddenly nobody wants to buy it and
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:28.600]  then we don't have money to operate so i've never gotten to that point in the
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:32.360]  black where we're comfortable to stockpile
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:36.520]  everything i'm tempted to do some type of mega sale
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:40.760]  or a money bomb or something to get positioned
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:45.000]  to stockpile all the products so that we can then meet demand which nobody can
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.200]  guess or judge so that we can go to the next level
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.200]  that's why i say it's critical that folks support info wars dot com right now
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:57.720]  because we're in a catch 22 i only ordered a test amount of
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:06.520]  brain force liver shield prostagard child ease and occupy power they're all sold out
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:09.800]  the best news we have is one of them's in a month some of them won't be in for
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:12.920]  two months well there's our best sellers right there
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:16.840]  brain force liver shield prostagard child ease occupy power
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.600]  so that's not a sales tactic to get it while you can folks because we're
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:25.000]  selling out step right up it's the truth that we're sold out of it
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  we have the dna force we have the oxy powder we have the colloidal silver high
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.800]  quality of low price we have the secret 12 medical
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:36.360]  boleman uh the oil of oregano is back in
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:41.560]  we have the lung cleanse we're selling out of both super male and super female
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.200]  vitality in the next two weeks and we are selling out of survival
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:49.400]  shield x2 and that is our best seller that's the bad news that
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.960]  we had a limited amount that they had they manufactured more now they're
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:55.800]  trying to get more of the crystals and will still at least have
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:02.200]  survival shield original if we're not able to continue to manufacture that
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:05.640]  so that's just how this works this is not a bunch of filler
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:09.640]  then a bunch of advertising attached to it
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:15.320]  these are super high quality products
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:20.760]  i mean quite frankly we change the formulation of super male
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:23.880]  because one of the ingredients was so rare that we were
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:28.440]  extincting in production you know uh where you could get
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:32.280]  organic shilligy so we just went ahead went with two
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:36.760]  other ingredients and souped it up i mean it's it's it's a real juggling act
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:39.560]  and one of my frustrations is i've got to spend a lot of my time trying to
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:43.480]  fund this operation but hey that's what proves the american way
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:48.440]  we're self-funded i'm not controlled by sponsors or by some outside network i
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:51.800]  can say what i want and do what i want
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:55.800]  because you have believed in us and supported us and put up with me quite
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:38:58.920]  frankly and bought the books the videos the t-shirts the
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:03.000]  supplements the water filtration systems all of it
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.080]  so i want to thank you for your support if you want to get survival shield
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:11.800]  x2 now is the time to secure it infowarslife.com
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:15.080]  if you want to get any of the other products that are still available like
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:22.120]  supermail or female uh again we have three manufacturers for
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:26.760]  something like 14 products and you get the cue of these people and the problem
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:30.200]  is they say well which product you want us to do within four weeks we can only
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:34.120]  do one then we gotta do the next one so that's eight weeks
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:38.120]  and so again you have a bunch of products sold out only three manufacturers
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:43.880]  that's how you run into it so i'm just explaining why we're in this situation
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:47.480]  we'd be in a great situation if i had a crystal ball and had bought
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:52.280]  more of say brain force or liver shield but this stuff knocks your socks off it
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:57.400]  really works great but then i can't judge the listeners
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:00.920]  what they're into i mean i'm into all of this but
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:05.000]  people will pick this to be a hot item when i think this is really hot
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.280]  and that's just the way it works so as you notice the fact that things are
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:17.320]  selling out is not hype info warslife.com or 888-253-3139
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:20.680]  but i know that god will always provide and again info wars is doing good
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:23.880]  overall we have the subscriptions for the nightly news
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:28.440]  and we have some sponsors uh i just refuse most sponsors because i have to
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:31.880]  test it and check it and i have to get great reviews from listeners because i
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:35.480]  just can't have booze
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:38.360]  one time willy nelson told me that we're sitting around at his house he goes
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.760]  there's you know a few things in life i don't really like alexa one of them's
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:50.760]  one of them's booze you know that song by who is it
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:58.600]  is it hank williams junior i like happy and i'm not into sad
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:05.160]  and the song goes on and i like to have women i've never had
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:08.760]  that's a racy song that hank williams junior
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:12.600]  i'm glad they've taken him off the super bowl and monday night football i'm
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.480]  being sarcastic
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:20.360]  willy nelson did say that to me he didn't say the part about it i like to have
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:24.360]  women i've never had and i'm not name dropping my whole
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.160]  life is an absolute twilight zone event and you know what reality is a twilight
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:32.120]  zone event okay i apologize to geruel solente for ranting
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:35.960]  but we're doing some mid-air refueling to fund the operation and speaking of that
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:39.400]  you should go and subscribe to his quarterly trends research dot com
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:42.840]  gerald solente is our guest and gerald wrote me a very nice letter i need to
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.480]  talk to him soon he's got a big event coming up
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:49.640]  in new york so i want to tell folks about that conference
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:52.520]  and of course have you on when that conference comes up gerald
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:56.040]  i'm not sure if i can attend yet but we're going to work on that
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:00.520]  but gerald solente joins us from kingston colonial kingston
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:05.800]  gerald i've been ranting there um what do you think the next big shoot a drop
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:09.480]  is well first of all you weren't ranting at all
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:14.360]  you're selling natural healing products and whole health healing is one of the
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.960]  biggest trends that we see and you have an
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:20.760]  audience of people that are enlightened looking for new
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:25.080]  directions and are not prescription drug addicted
[02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:29.080]  and want to find other ways of staying healthy physically
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:33.480]  emotionally and spiritually so the list of products that you read
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.760]  and what you're offering and how people can keep
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:43.000]  this truth and freedom going is really another service that you're providing
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.240]  and as you said it's not a sales pitch because when you go down the line of
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:50.440]  products who doesn't want the best water filter
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:55.160]  unless of course you like drinking you know fluoride chemically induced and
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:43:00.920]  toxic water or all those other products and if the people don't support us
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:05.880]  you know keep supporting the people that are robbing us of our rights
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:11.080]  and robbing us not of the only of our rights but of our livelihood as well
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.520]  so no you weren't ranting and you said you were depressed because of the masses
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:21.240]  that are so out of touch so i have this little quote here
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:26.360]  that really says it all it's by Samuel Adams and he said it doesn't take a
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:31.560]  majority but rather an irate tireless
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:36.600]  minority keen on setting brushfriars of freedom
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:41.800]  in the minds of men it does not take a majority to prevail
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:48.280]  but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfriars of freedom
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:52.760]  in the minds of men and that's what you're doing that's what i'm doing
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:56.840]  that's what dr paul craig robbins does that's what ron paul does
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:01.240]  there are a number of us that are doing it it's bringing it all together to make
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.080]  it happen because when you look at the clowns that are telling
[02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:09.160]  telling us what to do how to think hey what a wonderful fourth of july
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.600]  alex did you hunt down any terrorists did you keep an eye out open there
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:19.480]  you know if if you see something say something how many times have they done
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.480]  this since 9 11 what is this about the 30th
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:28.280]  time of an alert and they roll out little clowns like that guy king
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:31.560]  king how about dwarf because that's who he is that
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:37.720]  representative over here in new york fear and hysteria that's all they know
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.000]  how to sell matter of fact i spent the whole weekend up
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.480]  here in the cat skill mountains going through brush looking for terrorists
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:51.480]  when were they gonna pop out of the woods and they keep doing it
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:56.040]  i want to go to some phone calls but what do you make of
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:00.520]  the governor of new jersey saying there's a terror attack ran paul is to blame
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.760]  when he tried to stop our government funding the radical islamists that have
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:09.000]  now turned into isis what would i what would i make of
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.600]  laurel or hardy what would i make with a stupid clown of a man
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:21.400]  shooting off his fat mouth about nothing this is not i can't stand these guys
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.960]  that talk tough and can't fight their way out of a paper bag
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:32.120]  and they've made bags a lot thinner now this guy is such a brave guy with all
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:36.840]  his flunkies around him putting down nothing
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:43.400]  he's a total loser why would anybody look at the whole clown show
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:46.760]  as we call it the presidential reality show
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:52.040]  that's all it is he has a chance of winning from nothing
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:54.920]  and you know what they're doing they want either
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:58.920]  maybe a game show for christie he'd be great
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:04.040]  oh yeah i could see him dressed up as bozo he could work at sea world
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:07.960]  he could work at sea world as a train seal
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:13.080]  so that's all it is of course what they're trying to do is rob us of our
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:17.640]  rights why would anybody listen to any of them
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:23.880]  so again what a loser this clown is and he's doing it for his own ego as i said
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:30.120]  maybe a book deal maybe a tv show but i i think sea world would be great
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:34.680]  because he could also you know they could feed the whale or feed him it's
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:38.120]  going to look the same
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:43.400]  oh man when i say i get depressed actually a lot of good things are
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:48.920]  happening it's just crazy how they turn
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:52.680]  around that greece deserves all this and the media
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.760]  acts like it's no big deal as they prepare to grab private money out of
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:01.080]  bank accounts that's after taxes to give it to foreign banks i mean this is
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:05.320]  global government under the banksters and you know it's all
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:09.320]  coming here in their war on cash jerald they're getting it already and i think
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:13.400]  that's it that i want to expose them faster
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:16.280]  because you can clearly see they're about to drop the hammer i mean
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.680]  they're getting ready for something big jerald you know people ask me you know
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:24.600]  what about gold and silver and i always make it very clear i do not give
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:28.680]  financial advice why would you not want to have gold and
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:33.480]  silver now suppose you lived in Greece and by the way from the reports i'm
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:38.120]  reading gold sales are going up very strongly over there
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:42.040]  so when they go to this as you mentioned a
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:45.720]  a paperless currency of you know just digital money
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:49.400]  backed by nothing and printed you know in thin air
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:55.080]  i believe that the next spike in gold prices and silver prices are going to
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:58.440]  be exactly that you're going to start seeing them
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:01.640]  run up when the next cry the crisis has happened
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:05.640]  the panic is on again how could anybody in their right mind
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:10.760]  living in Greece have money in the bank and you've heard me say many times the
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.280]  stories that have happened to me and of course you well know the mf
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:18.280]  global story and mf is the perfect initials
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:21.960]  of the guy corezine who stole my money out of
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:26.200]  my segregated account when i used to buy gold
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:31.800]  through mf global so what i'm saying is why wouldn't people prepare for the
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:35.000]  worst because if you prepare for the worst
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.520]  and the worst doesn't happen you've lost nothing
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:41.960]  but if you don't prepare you lose everything the worst the cars
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:45.240]  you lose everything we're going to go to joe and then we're going to go to jeff
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:48.840]  everybody there's such troopers uh for holding i'm going to get their address

[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:00.440]  with greece when that when they defaulted last week

[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:12.040]  we are all you know whether it's a big guy or a little guy
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:15.000]  we're all trying to wake people up we're depressed but we're trying to wake
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.840]  people up um but this is what you were all
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.280]  that crazy um there was a i don't know if you guys

[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:41.160]  and it was two parts from 1988 one was in 1999
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:45.960]  and they laid out everything that was going to happen from 1969
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:51.000]  uh the audio came out in 1991 and you said something that sent chills down my
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.720]  spine because you said something big is going to happen
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:57.320]  you just recently said that i just now in a while back you said you think it's
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:01.400]  going to happen in winter and they said everything 98% of what
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:04.280]  they said was going to happen or that's going on today
[02:51:04.280 --> 02:51:07.560]  they said you know it's already happening but anyway
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:12.440]  um the thing that really freaked me out was when you said
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:16.920]  you're expecting something to happen in winter and what the guy said was
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:19.720]  probably what's going to happen is the big dissenters
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:23.640]  they're going to do something during the winter probably on a friday
[02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:28.840]  get everybody out take them out and uh become monday everybody would be accustomed
[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:32.760]  to the new world order and they get them all accustomed to it over the weekend
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:36.600]  and basically a big puzzle has been thrown out
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:40.360]  uh over the past you know 60 hundred years
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:44.280]  the pieces have been put together we're getting a picture we see the picture
[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:48.040]  and unfortunately i hope it doesn't get down to the last piece being put
[02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:52.120]  together and finally people go there it is but in my opinion
[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:56.440]  grease is just a little tiny thing like mr slaney said it's not you know it's
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:59.720]  not the gdp is not that big but it's it's small
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:03.080]  it's going to start small it's going to escalate it's a domino
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:06.920]  and the domino effect is sure it's going to tumble well thank you joe
[02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:11.000]  uh then go on hold or get your address and i'll and i'll sit in and your size
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:15.240]  and we'll send you a free uh second amendment t-shirt from info wars.com
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:20.280]  or a 1776 shirt or something um
[02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:24.680]  what you're getting at is everybody feels it you can intellectually
[02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:29.240]  politically see it and it's just a feeling of not wanting to see these
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:32.680]  countries collapse the reason grease is so important
[02:52:32.680 --> 02:52:38.200]  is that other countries in the euro or even in worse shape
[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:43.080]  and how far will this go so that's why grease is a big deal
[02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:46.840]  the whole house of cards is untenable and you want to respond anything joe
[02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:51.320]  said uh gerol solente no he really summed it up it's a domino effect
[02:52:51.320 --> 02:52:56.280]  and it starts small and again it's it's what samuel adam said you know it takes
[02:52:56.280 --> 02:53:01.400]  a doesn't take a majority to prevail a small
[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:05.000]  set of of instances are the ones that make it all happen
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:08.120]  and again what they did with direct democracy
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:12.840]  by letting the people vote you know that's the way i believe it should be you
[02:53:12.840 --> 02:53:16.440]  pointed out you know we have a lot of people that would vote the other way
[02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:20.520]  but again putting it all into context as we have it now
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:24.200]  you know we don't have a representative form of government
[02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:27.800]  we have a gang of 535 senators and congressmen
[02:53:27.800 --> 02:53:31.960]  that are brought off by the multinationals that's who they represent
[02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:37.080]  so put democracy in the hands of the people and this coming from grease
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:41.080]  i mean the cradle of democracy to me says a lot
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:46.440]  because the people spoke rather than having a bunch of sellouts
[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:52.760]  liars crooks and thieves speaking for us better known as congressmen and
[02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:56.920]  senators i think direct democracy is the way to go
[02:53:56.920 --> 02:54:00.280]  on big issues well one thing's for sure
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:03.560]  right now we have the globalists running without however they want and as you
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:06.200]  said if you look at iceland other countries
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:11.160]  they've signed these nations on to the derivatives debt
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:15.320]  almost all the debt is not the nation states and and they knew years ago when
[02:54:15.320 --> 02:54:19.240]  they passed austerity and raised all these taxes it would reduce gdp
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:23.720]  that was the point dr roberts you ron paul countless others made here on the
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:27.480]  air was that it was meant to depress it so they couldn't pay it back
[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:31.480]  and the last straw was when they called for a huge new
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:37.320]  increase in value added tax on altruism well that's all that country's got now
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:40.680]  they're not stupid they've seen their gdp shrink
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:44.840]  and they understand what's going on they understand they're being imploded
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:49.400]  and being maneuvered towards total bankruptcy so why pay something back that
[02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:52.600]  isn't your debt and that's impossible to pay back
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:56.040]  i think greece has had a moment of its of sanity
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:59.720]  uh jeff in california thanks for holding you're on the air with gerald solente
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:05.160]  from trendsresearch.com hey guys uh you know solente
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:10.760]  jones 2016 that would be great um you know the white shoe boys as gerald
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:13.880]  calls them uh running the wrecking ball
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:17.880]  and you know they they wrecking everything you know i talked to this
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:22.200]  about people that you know i live in southern california i'm surrounded by
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:26.760]  people that like you say alex can't wipe their own hind ends
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:30.680]  um people say well you know it's not that bad and everything
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:35.080]  um it is bad but they're they're wrecking and destroying
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:39.320]  everything and by the way we're not joking the average trendy
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:43.080]  my dog is smarter than them i mean and gerald's right it takes a
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:47.320]  minority either evil or good to fix things or to take over vice versa
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:51.240]  but how do you deal with a massive people
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:56.280]  juxtaposed by super hardworking great men and women of every race color and creed
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:59.800]  and i hate to give into this cliche that immigrants want to work harder and
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:02.840]  are better the the smart ones do know about the
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:06.840]  federal reserve and the new world order and do want to work
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:10.760]  the problem is our government advertises for lazy immigrants to come in
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:15.000]  and go on welfare i'm sorry i'm ranting it's just gerald what do we do then i
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.600]  want the color to finish about the mass of just have you seen the mark dice
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:21.240]  videos in ours who are eight out of ten people
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:27.160]  don't know what the fourth of july is yeah i mean who are these people
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:34.200]  again it they they will go anywhere they'll follow whatever the trend is of
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.440]  the time so what it takes is for more of us
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:42.440]  to be out in the forefront they'll gladly join in
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:45.960]  they because they're only getting one message
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:50.600]  because the the change though again it's underway
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.400]  and as the first caller said you know the dominoes are falling
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:58.760]  they don't count in a lot of ways in the sense that
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:04.200]  they're not going to be activists in any way they'll go wherever the flow goes
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:07.400]  you're right you're right if that's what i was told by a big hollywood producer
[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:10.520]  he goes alex quit getting sad that people are so dumb on average
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:13.800]  he goes that just means good people can lead them even easier
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:17.400]  you just have to get out there and lead them and be a leader and stop
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:20.680]  worrying about how dumb they are you know that's just sadly the way they were
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:25.240]  brought up and they'll get smarter in the process once they get hurt
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:32.680]  precisely i'm sorry jeff go ahead you know uh years ago i i was part of an
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:36.040]  organization i sent about over 350 letters to the white house and
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:39.080]  congress and so on and you know regarding immigration
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:43.320]  and then i i realized that they don't want to fix it they didn't want to fix it
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:47.720]  i mean this is all by design to to destroy the old america
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:51.000]  any way they possibly can destroy the family destroy a culture you know
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.880]  everywhere you know in every different way and um you know they do have a plan
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:00.440]  you talk about it alex it's it's global governance and and so they need to wreck
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:04.600]  everything and it's frustrating because you know i'm surrounded by people that
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:08.680]  are being fed from you know they're these people on
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:11.320]  television and their favorite you know i mean right now it's
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.000]  women's soccer and you know everybody's going going crazy
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.680]  meanwhile they're completely wrecking the world and wrecking the country
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:22.840]  and uh nobody seems to care i i mean a lot of people do but i you know i'd
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:26.120]  wear my bumper stickers i refuse to
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:29.640]  no no i hear you brother we're gonna do five minutes overdrive if gerald can do it

[02:59:50.120 --> 03:00:01.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:05.480]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[03:00:05.480 --> 03:00:09.240]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[03:00:09.240 --> 03:00:18.600]  and the gcn radio network
[03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:22.280]  our frustration is we've been partially conquered by special interests
[03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:25.960]  offshore banks and those of us that are informed
[03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:29.640]  it's just so obvious and we're frustrated with the mass of dumb down
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:34.280]  people but that's probably only 30 40 of the public
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:37.400]  that i guess we're raised in front of a television set
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:41.400]  there's a large segment that's starting to wake up all the numbers show that
[03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:45.160]  and so i don't want to be too negative today just sometimes i get upset
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:49.000]  and i'm probably not good for the cause overall and i'm not
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:53.160]  when i get in that mode and i'm not trying to
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:57.080]  cheerlead either uh and be over positive i think gerald salantes
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:02.680]  absolutely right uh we have never had a better time to wake people up
[03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:05.800]  gerald before we go to rich and a few other callers
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:11.480]  can you speak briefly uh to why you think things are optimistic
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:14.600]  yeah because the vacuum is so large i mean there was a
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:18.440]  study that just came out it's like 70 percent of the people
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:22.600]  don't trust the made the major media anymore you look at the numbers on
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:25.960]  how people are so disillusioned with the with the
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:30.200]  presidential reality show and you pointed out you could fill the
[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:34.200]  vacuum with anything it could be a minority can make it worse
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:37.880]  or a minority can make it better you know i'd like to pick up on
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:42.520]  what jeff just said about and what you were talking about with immigration
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:47.960]  this is from my book trends 2000 that i wrote back in 1996
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:52.120]  a university of california studies show that roughly one-fifth of the growth
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:55.640]  in the wage gap between the skilled and unskilled
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:03.000]  since the mid 1970s was linked to the growing supply of unskilled immigration
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.560]  labor immigration was costing the chiefly affected states
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:12.440]  new york florida texas illinois california an estimated eight billion
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:18.040]  dollars a year in services so there you go
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:21.880]  this whole immigration thing it began with the national association of
[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:25.240]  manufacturers try now we don't have any of that
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:28.440]  much of it anymore bringing in cheap labor
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:32.040]  then it was pushed with these h1b visas by
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:36.360]  the silicon con men over there that wanted cheap labor coming in
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:40.840]  and now you're seeing it across the board it's doctors it's everything that you
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:44.200]  could find they're bringing in more and more cheap labor
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:47.400]  i told you i just came back from europe the greatest
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:51.720]  trend that everybody should be watching here we call it immigration
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:56.520]  there they're calling it migration you take a hundred thousand years ago to
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:01.960]  now to 1900 rather it took that time to put 1.6 billion
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:06.920]  people on the planet from 1900 to now we've added essentially
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:11.240]  six billion people they're flooding into europe
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:15.640]  and no one's talking about the cause why are they flooding out of libya
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:18.360]  hey couldn't be because of hitlery clinton obama
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:24.120]  what a house susan rice well that's the in a sick way we are to blame
