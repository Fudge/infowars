[00:00.000 --> 00:08.880]  It's Thursday, the third day already of November 2016.
[00:08.880 --> 00:13.760]  We're only four days out from the most important election in modern times, perhaps ever.
[00:13.760 --> 00:15.840]  It's such an incredible town to be alive.
[00:15.840 --> 00:20.400]  We now even have Brett Baer at Fox News saying their FBI sources say that Hillary and others
[00:20.400 --> 00:22.280]  could be indicted very soon.
[00:22.280 --> 00:24.840]  That's what my sources told me last Friday.
[00:24.840 --> 00:25.840]  We broke that first.
[00:25.840 --> 00:26.840]  Here's John Bowne reporting.
[00:26.840 --> 00:31.320]  America is showing Hillary Clinton and her accomplices the door.
[00:31.320 --> 00:37.200]  The FBI is underway on not one, but five, criminal investigations into the iniquitous
[00:37.200 --> 00:39.240]  tentacles of Hillary Clinton.
[00:39.240 --> 00:44.960]  They include the reopened email case, an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation,
[00:44.960 --> 00:49.600]  the investigation of Anthony Wiener sexting of a 15-year-old girl which involved Hillary
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.200]  aide Huma Abadi, an investigation into the Podesta Group, and its ties to alleged corruption
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.240]  involving the former Ukrainian president and the investigation of the Clinton's ties
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.600]  into the illegality of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's foreign donation contributions
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.520]  from Chinese billionaire Wang Wenling.
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.960]  The Democrats are reaching claustrophobic levels of panic, blaming everyone under the
[01:13.960 --> 01:15.460]  sun but themselves.
[01:15.460 --> 01:19.880]  We do know that our democracy is under assault by the KGB.
[01:19.880 --> 01:39.400]  Sorry, Mr. Carvel, failing left-leaning outposts, the New York Times reported, law enforcement
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.560]  officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.800]  link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government, and even hacking into Democratic emails,
[01:49.800 --> 01:55.080]  FBI and intelligence officials now believe was aimed at disrupting the presidential
[01:55.080 --> 01:58.120]  election rather than electing Mr. Trump.
[01:58.120 --> 02:26.920]  But Hillary keeps on swinging for the fences as she attacks her accusers.
[02:26.920 --> 02:31.680]  But even the former DNC committee chairman Ed Rendell cautions Hillary against attacking
[02:31.680 --> 02:32.960]  the FBI.
[02:32.960 --> 02:55.920]  Even the White House doesn't want to condemn the FBI, they are hedging their bets.
[02:55.920 --> 03:07.760]  Meanwhile, Hillary can't even accept the election process.
[03:07.760 --> 03:12.680]  Reuters reports Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald
[03:12.680 --> 03:15.680]  Trump in four battleground states on Monday.
[03:15.680 --> 03:20.280]  Seeking to shut down a poll watching effort, they said was designed to harass minority
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.040]  voters in the November 8th election.
[03:23.040 --> 03:29.120]  In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.760]  that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a campaign of vigilant voter
[03:33.760 --> 03:41.200]  intimidation that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux
[03:41.200 --> 04:02.480]  Klan.
[04:02.480 --> 04:07.040]  Senator Ron Johnson is already preparing Congress for the impeachment hearings should
[04:07.040 --> 04:08.040]  Hillary win.
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.200]  Meanwhile, Trump's numbers keep increasing.
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.960]  Investor Business Daily shows Trump and Clinton tied after Hillary's lead disappeared.
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.400]  The stock market, a bellwether that is called 19 out of 22 elections, has been sliding in
[04:21.400 --> 04:22.400]  the recent weeks.
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.840]  Spelling out the country's dissatisfaction of the incumbent Democratic Party's economic
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.720]  nightmare and heralding a win for Donald Trump, Hillary will one way or another have
[04:31.720 --> 05:01.560]  to face the will of the American people as deplorable as she perceives it to be.
[05:01.560 --> 05:07.240]  New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors are working on an alleged underage
[05:07.240 --> 05:13.240]  sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner and they have turned over a newly found
[05:13.240 --> 05:18.000]  laptop that he shared with his wife Uma Abedine to the FBI.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.120]  True pundit is reporting that there is enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew
[05:23.120 --> 05:24.760]  away for life.
[05:24.760 --> 05:30.000]  The NYPD seized the computer from Anthony Weiner during a search warrant and sources
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.280]  now say that emails from the laptop link Hillary Clinton herself to a host of crimes
[05:36.280 --> 05:43.440]  that include money laundering, burgery, obstruction of justice, child exploitation, sex crimes
[05:43.440 --> 05:49.200]  with children, pay to play through the Clinton Foundation and of course more classified top
[05:49.200 --> 05:50.200]  secret breaches.
[05:50.200 --> 06:00.920]  Well it sounds like bad news for Cricket Hillary and you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[06:00.920 --> 06:02.760]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[06:02.760 --> 06:07.080]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown like
[06:07.080 --> 06:08.080]  many experts?
[06:08.080 --> 06:10.480]  I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[06:10.480 --> 06:12.800]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[06:12.800 --> 06:15.520]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard earned money.
[06:15.520 --> 06:21.080]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALAX.
[06:21.080 --> 06:22.480]  It's a company I trust.
[06:22.480 --> 06:27.120]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money
[06:27.120 --> 06:28.360]  in an economic meltdown.
[06:28.360 --> 06:31.680]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[06:31.680 --> 06:35.120]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is
[06:35.120 --> 06:36.440]  on the move.
[06:36.440 --> 06:41.280]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting
[06:41.280 --> 06:42.280]  finances.
[06:42.280 --> 06:48.000]  In LA, call 844-541-ALAXNOW and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.800]  coins absolutely free.
[06:49.800 --> 06:54.400]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[06:54.400 --> 06:57.200]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[06:57.200 --> 07:01.360]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALAXNOW.
[07:01.360 --> 07:05.600]  Infowars is proud to announce the official Infowars Live app available now for iPhone
[07:05.600 --> 07:06.600]  and Android.

[07:11.320 --> 07:15.040]  7 and get the latest breaking Infowars reports straight to your phone.

[07:28.440 --> 07:29.880]  The app is brand new.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.440]  This is the first release and it was completely built from the ground up.
[07:33.440 --> 07:37.080]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[07:37.080 --> 07:41.000]  In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.280]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[07:45.280 --> 07:46.280]  agendas.
[07:46.280 --> 07:51.160]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[07:51.160 --> 07:56.400]  So download Infowars Live today at Infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead
[07:56.400 --> 08:24.800]  of being spoon fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:24.800 --> 08:29.600]  You'll be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[08:29.600 --> 08:33.720]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[08:33.720 --> 08:36.480]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.520]  We came, we saw, we died.
[08:41.520 --> 08:43.720]  With her you'll end up in World War 3.
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.560]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president we will attack Iran.
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.760]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.320]  go to war against Syria and Russia.
[08:57.320 --> 09:01.600]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.560]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed
[09:07.560 --> 09:09.800]  reports of further hacking.
[09:09.800 --> 09:12.440]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[09:12.440 --> 09:14.560]  Of course not, because she's...
[09:14.560 --> 09:20.920]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[09:20.920 --> 09:27.040]  We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[09:27.040 --> 09:40.440]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[09:40.440 --> 09:46.480]  Thursday, November 3rd, 2016, we're now just four days out.
[09:46.480 --> 09:51.280]  And one more day, and we'll supposedly know who the new El President is.
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.560]  Yeah, it's important to vote and to keep the election honest, because November 8th is a
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.560]  very important date.
[09:57.560 --> 09:59.920]  Vote like the world depends on it.
[09:59.920 --> 10:01.200]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.400]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, and we have the Info Wars Nightly
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.960]  News coming up tonight at 7 o'clock central.
[10:06.960 --> 10:10.000]  Normally that is just for subscribers and TV stations that pick it up.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.800]  But starting tonight, right through the election, we're going to have that Nightly News feed
[10:13.800 --> 10:20.360]  obviously every night posted to the front page of infowars.com, as well as emailed out
[10:20.360 --> 10:23.520]  to folks that are part of the free newsletter at infowars.com.
[10:23.520 --> 10:31.400]  And of course, we will have a 52-hour live broadcast that kicks off at 11 a.m.
[10:31.400 --> 10:36.480]  Monday, runs right through 24 hours the next day, solid, and then into the next day at
[10:36.480 --> 10:37.480]  3 o'clock.
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.360]  Then we take a break for a few hours, and the Nightly News comes back with any new developments
[10:41.360 --> 10:43.240]  Wednesday night.
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.440]  Undoubtedly all the stops have been pulled out when it comes to fake polls, when it comes
[10:48.440 --> 10:54.440]  to media bias, when it comes to Google, admittedly gaming, the Internet, and search results for
[10:54.440 --> 10:56.000]  Hillary.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.120]  Every trick, every dirty trick, every lowdown trick, every underhanded trick, every naked
[11:02.120 --> 11:09.440]  trick, every brazen trick, you name it, they've thrown the kitchen sink at populism with
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.080]  the Brexit and failed, and now they've thrown more than the kitchen sink, they've thrown
[11:13.080 --> 11:22.320]  the bathtub, the plumbing, the drywall, everything at the Donald Trump movement.
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.160]  Trump had the courage to buck the mainstream media, Trump had the instincts to stand up
[11:26.160 --> 11:27.160]  for nationalism.
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.680]  He's not perfect, none of us are, but he's our champion now, and we are four days out
[11:32.680 --> 11:34.160]  right now.
[11:34.160 --> 11:39.080]  They're canceling school across the country in many areas, they're admittedly preparing
[11:39.080 --> 11:44.960]  for civil unrest at levels number 14, the Soros groups have been fully activated, they have
[11:44.960 --> 11:52.160]  increased funding many, many times what it previously was for disruptions.
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.640]  This is the greatest threat this nation has ever faced, and that's why there has been
[11:56.640 --> 12:02.920]  counter coups in what's left of the good intelligence community out there in our government, which
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.760]  is substantive, against the globalist coup through Hillary Clinton, and they're just
[12:07.760 --> 12:09.840]  busy rubbing our faces in it.
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.880]  They see how weak the population is in places in trendy areas, they see how weak people
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.160]  are in the Mark Dice videos, they see how dumb down people are in the statistics, and
[12:19.160 --> 12:25.280]  they just think everyone's like that, and they have total abject complete contempt.
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.920]  But more and more they're realizing you may have the majority of people in a mind-numbed
[12:29.920 --> 12:37.560]  psychological fetal position under mass Stockholm syndrome via learned helplessness and normalcy
[12:37.560 --> 12:44.160]  bias, but you have not moved the Overton window for many of us from our republic to hell that
[12:44.160 --> 12:46.760]  you're trying to basically set up.
[12:46.760 --> 12:53.560]  So coming up today, four days out, William Jasper, editor of the New American magazine,
[12:53.560 --> 12:58.080]  the folks who were first fighting the New World Order, starting in 1956, boy they've
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.200]  been proven correct in Treplicate, he'll be joining us to talk about his views on the
[13:02.200 --> 13:07.480]  world, and then we've got Colonel Tony Schaefer, who of course blew the whistle on the government
[13:07.480 --> 13:13.880]  not killing bin Laden in 2000, 2001, ordering stand downs, and of course in exposing Benghazi
[13:13.880 --> 13:19.560]  and then exposing Syria, he's been one of our main sources on air, and obviously off
[13:19.560 --> 13:24.080]  areas has given us anything classified, but he's directed us towards things that are already
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.400]  publicly available, and along with his analysis and a lot of other people, we were able to
[13:29.400 --> 13:32.720]  first break what happened with Benghazi and what's currently happening with Obama and
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.960]  Hillary backing Al Qaeda and other Wahhabist groups known as ISIS out of Saudi Arabia,
[13:38.960 --> 13:43.400]  and that's what Dr. Steve Pacenek, former head of psychological warfare for the State
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.720]  Department, the US Army, the Pentagon, Central Intelligence Agency, he's run operations for
[13:48.720 --> 13:54.000]  all those groups, and he's obviously getting ready to talk about even more on air, he is
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.200]  risking his life big time, because he has been where the bodies are buried, you can
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.920]  believe it, overthrowing at least eight countries, so he'll join us for a full hour tomorrow.
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.360]  We had a great interview yesterday, but I was letting him talk about 80% of the time,
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.520]  but I saw some complaints that I was still saying, hey, get into the counter coup, get
[14:10.520 --> 14:14.280]  into the shadow government, get into what's coming out of this, get into what dirty tricks
[14:14.280 --> 14:15.280]  you might play.
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.280]  I know he was specifically, though, not communicating with the main audience yesterday, he was communicating
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.320]  with people in the intelligence networks and with Umma Abedin and others, letting him know
[14:25.320 --> 14:32.200]  we're coming after you, Weiner and Podesta and others, so you better roll over, which
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.160]  is exactly what the FBI and NYPD are telling him to do right now, so he'll be joining us
[14:37.160 --> 14:39.520]  for an hour tomorrow.
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.840]  I think I'm gonna come, in fact, I know I'm gonna come in and do a two hour broadcast,
[14:43.840 --> 14:49.320]  I mean, I wanna rest the crew, but I'm gonna come in with a skeleton crew on Saturday and
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.400]  do a couple hour live round table with some folks, because I don't wanna miss one day
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.640]  as things develop and as things unfold, we normally have the Sunday show, of course,
[14:57.640 --> 15:01.800]  four to six PM, I'll be here live for that, we may even expand that coverage, and then
[15:01.800 --> 15:07.360]  we go right into Monday with the 52 hour broadcast that kicks off at 11 AM, right through Super
[15:07.360 --> 15:14.640]  Tuesday, you know, right through November 8th into the ninth, so please, this is about
[15:14.640 --> 15:19.720]  a revolution of awakening, it's already happened, spread the word about infowars.com, spread
[15:19.720 --> 15:28.040]  the word about other groups that are fighting for the republic, Breitbart.com, DrudgeReport.com,
[15:28.040 --> 15:34.960]  WorldEndDaily.com, WND.com, A Daily Caller, and my site's not perfect, Drudge isn't perfect,
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.280]  none of us are perfect, but we're not out to get the country, we want prosperity, we
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.360]  want justice, we wanna be secure, and that means having our freedoms, and we want the
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.520]  promise of America back, we're fighting for it, and you know that, and so when you spread
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.480]  the videos we're putting out, and you spread the articles, which by the way, we went from
[15:51.480 --> 15:57.320]  like 200 something on the web to 200 to 198, I'm told the new algorithm really shows, because
[15:57.320 --> 16:01.080]  the way we have our sites set up, they're only tracking part of our traffic, but the
[16:01.080 --> 16:08.200]  point is, we're bigger than CNN.com, they now admit, and it's really freaking the establishment
[16:08.200 --> 16:15.520]  out, and infowars is only one 20th or so of all of our reach, when we've got the numbers,
[16:15.520 --> 16:21.160]  it varies like 15 to 25%, week to week, we've got all the other platforms, all the other
[16:21.160 --> 16:28.200]  systems, and you put that together, infowars dwarfs, much of the mainstream media combined,
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.840]  and that's not bragging, it's so you understand how pathetic the enemy is, because I'm not
[16:32.840 --> 16:38.080]  that good, it's that they're that bad, and we're all working together to expose this,
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.360]  if you go to drudgereport.com right now, Drudge has a link to the radio shows and TV shows
[16:42.360 --> 16:47.200]  that are covering this live, and that are giving you different important thought out
[16:47.200 --> 16:53.120]  not scripted angles, and he's got us there as a second link, so folks can find the broadcast
[16:53.120 --> 16:59.360]  and spread it, that's what this is all about, safety in numbers, growing the movement, so
[16:59.360 --> 17:05.080]  many people over the years said, Alex is actually trying to change the government, you'll never
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.840]  do it, or Alex wants to be the system, no I don't, I wanna return the republic, I wanna
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.960]  overthrow the counterfeit globalist system, but yes, if it's selling out to win, then
[17:15.960 --> 17:20.360]  I'm a sellout, no that's not selling out, selling out, selling out of the current system,
[17:20.360 --> 17:27.520]  I want to change the culture, I'm promoting freedom, I'm promoting choice, I'm promoting
[17:27.520 --> 17:32.680]  justice, I'm promoting classical liberalism that means real free association, and live
[17:32.680 --> 17:39.040]  your life how you want, as long as you don't hurt somebody else, that's just classic americana,
[17:39.040 --> 17:44.440]  classic common sense, classic renaissance, classic enlightenment, I mean I'm not inventing
[17:44.440 --> 17:51.720]  something new here, I know what we're promoting is a universe better than what the globalists
[17:51.720 --> 17:58.280]  are pushing, because they don't want a big open free society with choice, they want monopolies,
[17:58.280 --> 18:04.920]  and so more and more you see what the future is, it's people that get it, and it's people
[18:04.920 --> 18:12.320]  that understand we're coming together through our independence, and then creating something
[18:12.320 --> 18:17.480]  even stronger that can't be stopped, it's a very very very exciting time to be alive,
[18:17.480 --> 18:23.200]  and it's the opposite of the globalist collectivism that's centralized, this is the collectivism
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.440]  of there's a restaurant in town that has the very best food, it's gonna always have its
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.280]  parking lot jam packed, it's not collective, it's independent, independent ideas though
[18:31.280 --> 18:39.280]  make it number one, and that's what's happening, is that freedom is being rediscovered and
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.480]  it's unbelievably exciting, now let me get into the big news, when the big FBI announcement
[18:45.480 --> 18:52.040]  came out last friday, I went out and made some phone calls and they said oh yeah it's much
[18:52.040 --> 18:58.040]  worse than you know blah blah blah, you know it's gonna be huge, there's gonna be a bunch
[18:58.040 --> 19:01.440]  of indictments, there's no way Hillary's gonna get out of this, and I said well what are
[19:01.440 --> 19:05.000]  the specifics, well we can't tell you the specifics, so I did my report saying oh my
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.200]  gosh Hillary's gonna get indicted sometime after the election, that's what I've been
[19:08.200 --> 19:11.160]  told is they don't want to make it political, but she better know to stand down what they
[19:11.160 --> 19:18.520]  found, and the 650,000 emails the rest of it, but what was there was the ongoing investigation
[19:18.520 --> 19:21.480]  that's been happening for a year with the NYPD and others, and you heard about this
[19:21.480 --> 19:27.040]  yesterday from some of our sources we had on air, Doug Hagman, well it's in the news
[19:27.040 --> 19:33.640]  today, it's up on infowars.com, it's Fox News reporting that multiple FBI sources say indictments
[19:33.640 --> 19:39.440]  are coming, and that Hillary is basically in deep trouble, meanwhile that ties in again
[19:39.440 --> 19:46.320]  to my last friday's announcement, or thursday's announcement, and that ties into this report
[19:46.320 --> 19:53.800]  insider FBI uncovered Clinton criminal enterprise on Wiener's PC looks like sex blackmail NYPD
[19:53.800 --> 19:58.320]  blows whistle on new Hillary Clinton email money laundering, sex crimes with children,
[19:58.320 --> 20:04.560]  child exploitation, pay-to-play and perjury, do you ever wonder what happened, change has

[21:00.200 --> 21:05.840]  Hi, my name is steven holstein, in my 20s I abused stimulant and anabox steroids and
[21:05.840 --> 21:09.800]  the point where my adrenal glands were shot, I suffered from extreme fatigue and inability
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.440]  to handle stress, for over 6 years I had been taking adrenal supplements including herbs,
[21:14.440 --> 21:19.760]  glandulars, vitamin c, and vitamin b5, all these supplements did was treat the symptoms
[21:19.760 --> 21:24.800]  and produced only minimal results, now just after one month on synergy 1 and adiometics
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.600]  I truly feel rejuvenated, I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement
[21:30.600 --> 21:36.480]  and I did just 10 minutes after taking adiometics, I then noticed synergy 1 made me wake up rested
[21:36.480 --> 21:41.440]  and with much more energy, no more hungover groggy feeling upon arising, I had almost
[21:41.440 --> 21:46.320]  considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort, but now I truly
[21:46.320 --> 21:49.960]  feel rejuvenated on synergy 1 and adiometics.
[21:49.960 --> 21:56.760]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition, call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com,

[22:00.640 --> 22:04.920]  Think about this, your communities aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be
[22:04.920 --> 22:09.840]  contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine
[22:09.840 --> 22:14.320]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants, and
[22:14.320 --> 22:18.760]  no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[22:18.760 --> 22:23.600]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted big Berkey water filter, new NSF EPA

[23:00.480 --> 23:04.320]  In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food
[23:04.320 --> 23:05.320]  and boil water.
[23:05.320 --> 23:09.520]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire
[23:09.520 --> 23:11.120]  then there's a much better way.
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.960]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities

[24:00.480 --> 24:12.080]  Seems like every day I see another one of these from the New York Times or the LA Times,
[24:12.080 --> 24:16.920]  you name it, where they'll have a journalist, sometimes senior journalist, people pretending
[24:16.920 --> 24:21.520]  to be journalists send out a tweet saying, we need to kill Donald Trump or somebody needs
[24:21.520 --> 24:26.400]  to kill Donald Trump, they do this over and over again, they've done it again, the story's
[24:26.400 --> 24:32.040]  up on infowars.com, LA Times journalist hopes for Trump's death, sickening tweet underscores
[24:32.040 --> 24:38.800]  bias media, he says, I would rather see Donald Trump's life end, Steven Borowick, so think
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.600]  how you pronounce it, it's got some weird selfie of him looking all angelic, these people
[24:43.600 --> 24:49.480]  are all on such little delusional power trips as their diminishing empire seeks beneath
[24:49.480 --> 24:55.680]  the waves of zero credibility, those because time had put out an article saying, see Donald
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.920]  Trump's life in photos.
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.320]  This tweet is from time is what the LA Times journalist, Steven at Borowick was responding
[25:07.320 --> 25:10.840]  to and he said he wanted to see Trump dead.
[25:10.840 --> 25:19.960]  And again, these are all really soft wimps, but they love Hillary overthrowing countries,
[25:19.960 --> 25:24.480]  they love radical Islamists, cutting women's genitals off and murdering Christians by the
[25:24.480 --> 25:30.240]  hundreds of thousands, they get off on totalitarianism as long as it's called leftist, they don't
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.360]  care what Hillary does or how many crimes she commits her, you know, how many Lolita
[25:34.360 --> 25:41.960]  express flights Clinton's on with them pedophiles, they don't care, because it's all about delusion,
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.720]  they're the moral high ground people, they're fighting the racist Donald Trump, it doesn't
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.520]  matter Bill Clinton played golf and wouldn't stop and didn't apologize for playing in a
[25:51.520 --> 25:55.080]  golf course where no blacks were allowed.
[25:55.080 --> 25:57.440]  Can't believe they even still have those.
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.480]  It doesn't matter how many times they've come out and you know, past minimum sentencing
[26:01.480 --> 26:07.440]  to quote, keep the black predators at heel, doesn't matter if they hang out with grand
[26:07.440 --> 26:13.320]  dragons, doesn't matter if the Dixie mafia put them in power, doesn't matter if all these
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.120]  chefs and other people say that they're horrible racist, it's okay because Bill Clinton and
[26:18.120 --> 26:23.720]  Hillary are their racist and they're all part of the club who have jobs at the LA Times
[26:23.720 --> 26:29.160]  in places like that because they go along with the mindless empty party line.
[26:29.160 --> 26:31.560]  And hey, that's your business.
[26:31.560 --> 26:36.360]  If you're successfully able to steal this election and install Hillary to the world's
[26:36.360 --> 26:43.920]  horror and to real liberals like Julian Assange's horror, you will only further accelerate your
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.160]  diminished stature to one that can't be found under a microscope.
[26:48.160 --> 26:54.760]  I mean, you truly are jokes, you are making yourselves obsolete and you associate the
[26:54.760 --> 27:01.520]  centralized power of a hijacked COG system, continuity of government.
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.680]  You take that whole shadow government bureaucracy that's totally illegitimate and you think
[27:05.680 --> 27:10.480]  because it's made itself above the law that you by extension are above the law, but you're
[27:10.480 --> 27:16.320]  not above the law public opinion, which is the total system in which you survive.
[27:16.320 --> 27:19.800]  It's your atmosphere.
[27:19.800 --> 27:22.200]  Government corruption can hold on a season longer.
[27:22.200 --> 27:29.840]  You can't, you don't have the power or the purse, but more and more they want to make
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.560]  you buy your media like the BBC, taxes everybody in the UK that has television set or you want
[27:34.560 --> 27:37.640]  to make us buy big banks overpriced insurance.
[27:37.640 --> 27:46.880]  So that's where this economy is going is where they're going to make us buy their products,
[27:46.880 --> 27:49.440]  but that's not going to work either.
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.680]  We've shown it and no amount of technocracy is going to ever repair any of this for you.
[27:53.680 --> 27:55.880]  You are true jokes.
[27:55.880 --> 28:03.800]  Now coming up in the next segment that's longer, I've got Donald Trump who is now ahead six
[28:03.800 --> 28:12.400]  points, not four points, but six and growing in mainline polls that over sample.
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.200]  We're going to come back with some of a live speech that Trump is engaged in right now
[28:16.200 --> 28:20.280]  that we have posted on infowars.com.
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.160]  We're also going to get into the clips where FBI sources tell Fox News, Clinton Foundation
[28:24.160 --> 28:27.640]  investigation much bigger and indictments likely.
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.240]  That's what I was told last week.
[28:31.240 --> 28:38.240]  But what the NYPD found in the Wiener investigation is unbelievable.
[28:38.240 --> 28:44.560]  It's worse than I thought and so incredibly reckless dealing with not just paper play,
[28:44.560 --> 28:52.480]  but trafficking in sex, trafficking reportedly in children.
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.920]  I was told by high level sources about two weeks ago, let Hillary and the media ignore
[28:56.920 --> 28:57.920]  WikiLeaks.
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.920]  I said this two weeks ago, we're trying to not hurt the country irrevocably, but it's
[29:02.920 --> 29:04.840]  like emergency cancer surgery.
[29:04.840 --> 29:09.760]  We may have to just go all the way and release the really bad stuff on Hillary and the Democrats.
[29:09.760 --> 29:17.840]  So they want to engage in thermal nuclear option of setting up a coup in this country.
[29:17.840 --> 29:20.640]  Well, the really bad stuff is going to come out.
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.600]  And I'm told there's FBI agents, you name it, ready to have big press conferences.
[29:24.600 --> 29:26.520]  There's data packets ready to go out to everybody.
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.040]  I mean, they'll have to shut the web off and start a war to get out of this.
[29:31.040 --> 29:34.220]  Right now she could just sail off and not steal the election.
[29:34.220 --> 29:35.220]  Let Trump win it.
[29:35.220 --> 29:40.840]  But they've got the media and the feds and the UN in place with the European Union to
[29:40.840 --> 29:41.840]  steal the election.
[29:41.840 --> 29:43.360]  And they're intending to in four days.
[29:43.360 --> 29:45.840]  So that's the big chicken match.
[29:45.840 --> 29:46.840]  We're all in.
[29:46.840 --> 29:47.840]  Boy, I'd be hitting the knee right now.
[29:47.840 --> 29:48.840]  I know I'm doing it.
[29:48.840 --> 29:50.760]  I'm praying to God.
[29:50.760 --> 29:52.040]  We're on the march.
[29:52.040 --> 29:54.520]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.520 --> 30:01.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.640 --> 30:07.360]  New York police department detectives and prosecutors are working on an alleged underage
[30:07.360 --> 30:11.200]  sexting case against former congressman Anthony Weiner.
[30:11.200 --> 30:16.800]  And they have turned over a newly found laptop that he shared with his wife, Uma Abadine,
[30:16.800 --> 30:18.160]  to the FBI.
[30:18.160 --> 30:23.280]  True pundit is reporting that there is enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew
[30:23.280 --> 30:24.880]  away for life.
[30:24.880 --> 30:30.640]  The NYPD sees the computer from Anthony Weiner during a search warrant and sources now say
[30:30.640 --> 30:37.480]  that emails from the laptop link Hillary Clinton herself to a host of crimes that include
[30:37.480 --> 30:43.800]  money laundering, perjury, obstruction of justice, child exploitation, sex crimes with
[30:43.800 --> 30:49.000]  children, pay to play through the Clinton Foundation, and of course, more classified
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.500]  top secret breaches.
[30:50.500 --> 30:54.280]  Well, it sounds like bad news for Crooked Hillary.

[32:00.920 --> 32:05.880]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[32:05.880 --> 32:10.860]  talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential
[32:10.860 --> 32:13.280]  for power grid chaos.
[32:13.280 --> 32:19.720]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very
[32:19.720 --> 32:21.320]  real threat to our grid.
[32:21.320 --> 32:24.600]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.

[33:11.160 --> 33:18.520]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:18.520 --> 33:22.480]  Donald Trump is in Jacksonville, Florida right now speaking about Obamacare and what a horrible
[33:22.480 --> 33:24.160]  scam it is and I agree with Trump.
[33:24.160 --> 33:28.200]  I mean personally that's one of the things that makes me the maddest about Obama and
[33:28.200 --> 33:33.920]  Hillary is that it's in the WikiLeaks, they plan to bankrupt the economy and implode one
[33:33.920 --> 33:38.200]  seventh of the economy, that being healthcare and then come in with an even worse system
[33:38.200 --> 33:41.720]  after it administered by private interest ripping us off.
[33:41.720 --> 33:48.840]  I mean this is our economy being taken over by criminals that tell the lottery mentality
[33:48.840 --> 33:54.080]  public that is 40% or so maybe more that hey you're going to get something free and they
[33:54.080 --> 33:59.080]  just keep hearing it and they keep wanting to hear it even though the engine of free
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.200]  market that made us the wealthiest country in the world has for all intents and purposes
[34:03.200 --> 34:04.880]  already been blown up.
[34:04.880 --> 34:10.120]  That's what Trump keeps saying, it's your last chance, they're dismantling the country
[34:10.120 --> 34:13.920]  and it's borders now, we're going into globalism.
[34:13.920 --> 34:18.240]  They want you poor, that's because that's the real plan.
[34:18.240 --> 34:23.320]  Trump again just doesn't have to be out to get us and have fair trade deals and control
[34:23.320 --> 34:29.440]  our borders and have decent healthcare, pay for all the poor people and then just leave
[34:29.440 --> 34:30.440]  the rest alone.
[34:30.440 --> 34:37.600]  It would be half the cost they estimate but they won't do it because they want full control.
[34:37.600 --> 34:42.880]  It's unlimited what they can do and now they're coming after the guns but the people know
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.960]  that's why gun sales broke the all time previous record again last month, the numbers are
[34:47.960 --> 34:56.520]  out today, biggest spike yet, that's on infowars.com, October gun sales see massive spike see
[34:56.520 --> 35:00.320]  yet another record broken.
[35:00.320 --> 35:05.880]  People know, but let's go to Donald Trump in Jacksonville, Florida.
[35:05.880 --> 35:15.080]  Of information is coming in, the FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield
[35:15.080 --> 35:16.080]  an indictment.
[35:16.080 --> 35:26.440]  That's right, he's live now but he backed it up, he backed that up again, you hear that
[35:26.440 --> 35:30.280]  likely to bring an indictment, a perfect place, I said back up a few minutes, they
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.680]  backed it up like 12 minutes and there he is saying likely to bring an indictment, that's
[35:35.680 --> 35:40.360]  Fox News Associated Press, they're saying it is just so damning there's no way to cover
[35:40.360 --> 35:41.360]  it up.
[35:41.360 --> 35:46.600]  The FBI is investigating how Hillary Clinton put the office of Secretary of State up for
[35:46.600 --> 35:55.040]  sale in violation of federal law.
[35:55.040 --> 36:08.880]  The investigation is described as a high priority, it's far reaching and has been going on for
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.120]  more than one year.
[36:12.120 --> 36:18.880]  It was reported that an avalanche of information is coming in, the intelligence community said
[36:18.880 --> 36:25.760]  we're releasing all of that stuff, if you don't do an FBI, it's likely to yield an indictment.
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.360]  It's called checkmate Hillary and all the scum that supported you and all the filth
[36:30.360 --> 36:37.600]  that backed you, you're as shameful as the Nazis, you are scum, I don't want to hate
[36:37.600 --> 36:48.120]  you but you are, you deserve hate, you deserve to be despised, you're disgusting.
[36:48.120 --> 37:00.320]  But just remember, the system is rigged, just remember that, and reports also show the political
[37:00.320 --> 37:08.200]  leadership at the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton and is interfering
[37:08.200 --> 37:10.120]  with the FBI's criminal investigation.
[37:10.120 --> 37:13.840]  Yeah, they've been appointing Clinton friends and confidants over each investigation, that's
[37:13.840 --> 37:14.840]  in the news.
[37:14.840 --> 37:23.120]  Right, comparison, four star general, just last week, James Cartwright, highly respected,
[37:23.120 --> 37:32.080]  is in very serious trouble for doing a tiny fraction of what Clinton did, they go to jail
[37:32.080 --> 37:39.320]  for up to five years, think of it, general Cartwright, last week, four star general respected
[37:39.320 --> 37:47.960]  by everybody, a tiny, tiny fraction may go to jail for now five years, and general Petraeus's
[37:47.960 --> 37:54.000]  life and reputation has been destroyed, it's all part of the purge, nothing, nothing by
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.960]  comparison to what Hillary Clinton did, she shouldn't even be allowed to run for the office
[38:00.960 --> 38:01.960]  of President.
[38:01.960 --> 38:06.000]  That's right, as I said, she's disqualified because of that, and she stole the nomination,
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  she stole that.
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.800]  This is where the system is rigged, she shouldn't be allowed, it was also reported that the
[38:14.800 --> 38:22.960]  laptops of Clinton's top aides, which had been slated for destruction, were not in fact
[38:22.960 --> 38:33.720]  destroyed, good job, by the FBI, and that the FBI has been successfully using them to
[38:33.720 --> 38:45.640]  gather information for their criminal investigation, further they have found new emails as part
[38:45.640 --> 38:58.800]  of the 650,000 emails just recently found, can you imagine 650,000, what do these people
[38:58.800 --> 39:01.440]  do, no wonder nothing gets done in government.
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.360]  That's what I said a few days ago, I mean, how are they controlling so much stuff?
[39:05.360 --> 39:13.480]  I guess you'll say those 650, remember the 33,000, well the 650,000, also the wedding
[39:13.480 --> 39:14.960]  and some yoga, right?
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.200]  That's what she said, the wedding and some yoga.
[39:18.200 --> 39:24.840]  That no less than five foreign intelligence agencies successfully hacked into Clinton's
[39:24.840 --> 39:33.200]  illegal and secure server, which contain classified information, creating an ongoing security
[39:33.200 --> 39:34.200]  threat to the United States.
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.800]  And by the way, they're now saying, when I said years ago, they were selling it all,
[39:37.800 --> 39:43.240]  that's why there's 650,000, Hillary was part of it, it was a bizarre comparison, think
[39:43.240 --> 39:44.240]  of it.
[39:44.240 --> 39:45.240]  They were selling it all.
[39:45.240 --> 39:52.680]  Hillary Clinton has engaged in a massive far reaching criminal conduct and equally far
[39:52.680 --> 39:55.680]  reaching cover up.
[39:55.680 --> 40:05.880]  She created an illegal email server to shield and guard her activity, so simple, so simple.
[40:05.880 --> 40:08.560]  Should have happened a long time ago, folks.
[40:08.560 --> 40:12.920]  Now we're going through phase two, which sounds like it's even worse than phase one,
[40:12.920 --> 40:18.360]  should have happened in phase one, but she was protected by the Department of Justice.
[40:18.360 --> 40:23.920]  Then we have all the WikiLeaks that are even more of them shut, that's the key, Donald.
[40:23.920 --> 40:30.160]  She illegally transmitted confidential information and then lied about it to Congress.
[40:30.160 --> 40:38.680]  She illegally destroyed federal records, including 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional
[40:38.680 --> 40:47.600]  subpoena and she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer.
[40:47.600 --> 40:54.240]  Who in this room has gotten rid of a phone and then smashed the hell out of it with a
[40:54.240 --> 40:55.240]  hammer?
[40:55.240 --> 40:57.320]  Anybody, raise your hand please.
[40:57.320 --> 41:02.440]  Raise your hand, I see one hand over there, I see a hand there, what business are you
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.440]  in?
[41:03.440 --> 41:08.760]  I want to know, no I don't want to know, I don't want to, I don't want to meet him.
[41:08.760 --> 41:15.360]  She engaged in corrupt pay for play at the State Department for personal enrichment.
[41:15.360 --> 41:22.960]  She lied to the FBI and she lied to the American people many, many times.
[41:22.960 --> 41:27.560]  Remember she lied 39 times, I don't recall, I don't recall.
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.480]  We're going to come back to more of this in a few minutes.
[41:31.480 --> 41:35.320]  That's Donald Trump in Jacksonville, Florida, very, very powerful information.
[41:35.320 --> 41:41.680]  You can feel it, you can intellectually see it, you can mathematically calculate it.
[41:41.680 --> 41:48.320]  Hillary's done, Hillary's done and I'm not somebody that says things like that so it
[41:48.320 --> 41:50.280]  becomes reality.
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.480]  Everybody knows I'm a pessimist, she's done unless her and Obama try to start a nuclear
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.680]  war or something as a distraction, which has been done before, I mean not nuclear war but
[41:59.680 --> 42:06.600]  leaders have started big wars when they're on the verge of being removed or basically
[42:06.600 --> 42:09.100]  overthrown.
[42:09.100 --> 42:18.720]  But if anybody is overloaded with Hutzpah and hubris, it's Hillary Clinton, I mean I was
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.440]  watching the news last night, Obama running around saying a vote for Trump is a vote to
[42:24.440 --> 42:29.440]  persecute women, this guy funded Al Qaeda and ISIS, murdering women, enslaving women,
[42:29.440 --> 42:35.240]  selling them into sex slavery, all the rappers they have to the White House that openly sing
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.560]  about date rape and pushing some of the most degenerate garbage ever, it's just the total
[42:40.560 --> 42:46.640]  hypocrisy when they're thousands of times worse than Donald Trump, it staggers the mind
[42:46.640 --> 42:51.920]  that their constituents buy into this delusion.
[42:51.920 --> 42:57.680]  It really is mind boggling.
[42:57.680 --> 43:00.840]  We shot a special report on it, you should send it out to everybody, shocking, Michelle
[43:00.840 --> 43:05.600]  Obama and Hillary caught glamorizing date rape promoters, but it gets worse, there's
[43:05.600 --> 43:13.520]  these weirdo Lena Dunham and all these unfunny comedians that Hollywood pushes that would
[43:13.520 --> 43:21.440]  straight faces get up on TV and go, they have ABC News specials about why she loves Hillary
[43:21.440 --> 43:25.840]  and then it turns into an 8 minute piece on why white males are the problem and as soon
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.400]  as we get rid of them everything will be great and then the white males all come and sit
[43:29.400 --> 43:38.320]  with their families and hear how bad they are from her as if white males are some unified
[43:38.320 --> 43:39.320]  group causing trouble.
[43:39.320 --> 43:44.360]  Imagine you said that about Jews or black people or Hispanics, it would be the most
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.640]  racist thing but it's the establishment trying to organize women and minorities into their
[43:49.640 --> 43:57.120]  own race based cult so that you can't work with people, so that you're incompatible and
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.040]  so you don't become upwardly mobile in society.
[44:02.040 --> 44:07.000]  The truth is you go to Indonesia 50 years ago and you're not Indonesian, you're not
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.120]  getting a job or moving up in that culture.
[44:10.120 --> 44:15.760]  You go to some place in Germany or Japan, same deal, that was just what cultures did.
[44:15.760 --> 44:21.200]  Somehow the white males are the only people that ever had a culture or a country and then
[44:21.200 --> 44:27.280]  it's Christians, Christians that create the true original multiculturalism of an open
[44:27.280 --> 44:35.680]  society and actually end the more primitive associations of humans and then that gets
[44:35.680 --> 44:41.280]  hijacked by people that are using it to destroy any culture and bring in a plastic corporate
[44:41.280 --> 44:44.480]  culture who are all of each other's throats.
[44:44.480 --> 44:53.080]  Classic racism, classic sexism, classic stereotype with just these reeling, upset, crazy white
[44:53.080 --> 44:58.680]  women mainly just freaking out that they hate men, they've run them off, they're totally
[44:58.680 --> 45:02.160]  alone, they've got their girlfriend, that's not making them happy, they're totally freaked
[45:02.160 --> 45:04.480]  out and they're just screaming white men, white men.
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.480]  When you drive down the road, see a white guy driving an exterminator truck or see a
[45:08.480 --> 45:13.000]  white guy working on the side of the road or see a white guy mowing somebody's yard,
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.240]  they drive by, there's an Hispanic guy doing it, a black guy, it's just working class people
[45:16.240 --> 45:23.400]  who are hard working and go home and go to their kid's baseball game and their wife takes
[45:23.400 --> 45:27.280]  care of him, when he's sick he takes care of her, they try to go on vacation, they try
[45:27.280 --> 45:30.920]  to live their life, they try to go to a football game and then they're just sitting there hearing
[45:30.920 --> 45:34.040]  how they did something, it's like what the hell are you talking about?
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.640]  I'm a white male folks, I don't know where all these special little privileges and things
[45:39.640 --> 45:41.800]  are.
[45:41.800 --> 45:46.440]  I mean I'm sure there's something there, but the whole point is, this is all just wealth,
[45:46.440 --> 45:49.320]  if it's so bad, why does everybody want to get here?
[45:49.320 --> 45:52.400]  Because this is where the Christians, and we did a lot of bad stuff in this country,
[45:52.400 --> 45:56.400]  it was all a free for all, the Indians were all killing each other, I use that word to
[45:56.400 --> 45:59.760]  be politically correct saying that of Americans, they were all killing each other, they'd kill
[45:59.760 --> 46:03.280]  you if you wouldn't help, you know, go out the other tribe they didn't like, that's no
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.600]  judgment on them, that's how humans operate, they just know the public doesn't have any
[46:08.600 --> 46:11.840]  real history.
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.880]  And so the world's always been about conquest and domination, and it's Christianity that's
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.120]  tried to stop that and make it about free association and free will.
[46:21.120 --> 46:25.160]  And it's real Christianity, not the little fake church that just wants your money and
[46:25.160 --> 46:29.680]  to make you feel guilty, that's the opposite of western civilization, but the real church
[46:29.680 --> 46:35.200]  is what created the prosperity, the freedom, women's revolution, it's what said we need
[46:35.200 --> 46:38.280]  to build everybody up, we need to build the third world up, then they turn back against
[46:38.280 --> 46:41.920]  that in the last hundred years and say, oh, white man's burden, you know, Rudger Kipling,
[46:41.920 --> 46:45.040]  how dare you try to build up the third world, don't do that.
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.280]  Well, that was the British government changing its view and saying, no, we're going to keep
[46:49.280 --> 46:52.240]  folks in squalor, we're not going to build these people up.
[46:52.240 --> 46:58.160]  That decision was made by the late 40s, as in the Royal Commission on Population.
[46:58.160 --> 47:03.440]  But see, I'm not a pseudo-intellectual, I actually read the history books from different perspectives,
[47:03.440 --> 47:06.680]  I actually do the research, I know the game plan.
[47:06.680 --> 47:14.280]  Now, I've got a few clips I want to play that are so illuminating, because we've got Weld,
[47:14.280 --> 47:19.480]  true from the beginning, is basically Democratic Party operative, we have the Democratic Party
[47:19.480 --> 47:28.440]  take over the libertarians, the party itself, for recognition, totally sold out their name
[47:28.440 --> 47:29.440]  forever.
[47:29.440 --> 47:33.400]  I don't want to be known as libertarian now, they have really, really, really done a number
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.240]  on themselves, he's out endorsing Hillary on the campaign trail, and then Gary Johnson
[47:38.240 --> 47:44.000]  is this arrogant, he acts like a crazy power tripping six-year-old.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.680]  He was in my offices a year ago, and I mean, I told people I said something's wrong with
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.680]  that guy.
[47:47.680 --> 47:51.680]  Now you see him degenerating in public, just a complete lunatic in my view.
[47:51.680 --> 47:57.840]  So, I mean, I'm telling you, I thought rubber room time or something, so I don't know what's
[47:57.840 --> 48:05.160]  going on, but man, this is so obvious as a little pissant third-party run to derail
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.800]  Trump who's taking over the Republican Party, that's what's happening here.
[48:10.800 --> 48:13.280]  Four days left, you think there's gonna be another big October surprise?
[48:13.280 --> 48:15.760]  I do, I think they're gonna dig up some more crap, I think they throw everything they can
[48:15.760 --> 48:19.000]  at Trump, but it is quite a time to be alive right now.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.240]  We're gonna come back, go to more of Trump's speech, and kind of dole that out to the rest
[48:23.240 --> 48:25.040]  of the broadcast today.
[48:25.040 --> 48:32.160]  But before I go any further, in these times, it's important to have high-quality, storeable
[48:32.160 --> 48:35.600]  food, and we've gone out and found the biggest, best high-quality company, we've been working
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.640]  with them eight years, quite the largest in the nation because they've scaled up, they
[48:39.640 --> 48:42.200]  have high-quality, very low prices, my Patriots apply.
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.600]  We saw their entire catalog at infowarstore.com, and we have it private labeled under the label
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.240]  infowarselect, their full catalog, normally 10% below whatever their biggest specialist
[48:52.240 --> 48:53.240]  at the time.
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.280]  We're just changing it as new specials come in, we're under a contract with them, because
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.160]  again, they have other distributors, though we're the biggest because of this, the private
[49:01.160 --> 49:02.160]  labeling.
[49:02.160 --> 49:06.640]  30 to 40% off, we're running a special, we only do every few months, used to be introduced
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.120]  every once a year, but things are moving so fast, things are unfolding so fast, we're
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.320]  doing this special more often.
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.920]  Take advantage of it, the purchase also helps find the operation, infowarstore.com, or call
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.920]  toll-free, 888-253-33139, hundreds of different packages, different meals, special diets,
[49:22.920 --> 49:26.200]  whatever you want, it's there, and we have a new product, I haven't really rolled out
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.120]  yet, but it's here, so we're selling it.
[49:28.120 --> 49:31.160]  It's the ultimate, I mean, for the price, I mean, I'm sure they got stuff you can get
[49:31.160 --> 49:37.520]  from a, you know, cosmetics, top, you know, I mean, even medical doctors that build skin,
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.040]  you can probably get something better that costs thousands of dollars, I mean, some of
[49:40.040 --> 49:45.440]  the stuff's incredibly expensive, this is $29.95 with the organic concentrated known
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.200]  compounds for healthy skin, hair, nails, I'm really proud of it.
[49:51.200 --> 49:54.520]  It took a lot of time, actually had a bottle of it in here earlier, I guess somebody took
[49:54.520 --> 50:00.000]  it out, no, here it is, it's a BioPCA hair and nail formula, and I'm going to cut a
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.960]  piece soon and add breaking down the different compounds that are in it and what they've
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.960]  been connected to and what they do, but it contains 10,000 MCG of biotin per serving
[50:08.960 --> 50:16.360]  with collagen, protase, folate, and more, just two vegetable capsules, daily 60 in the
[50:16.360 --> 50:23.200]  bottle, very, very, very, very proud of it, because again, the leading competitors out
[50:23.200 --> 50:29.160]  there are $60 to $100, and the thought is, if you charge six, seven times markup, that
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.320]  then somehow people think it's worth it and pay it, no, this is top of the line that you
[50:34.320 --> 50:40.200]  would get from a dermatologist, this is top of the line for $29.95, we can sell it for
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.400]  $100 easily, and folks, it's got a, you know, 80% markup on it, that's how we fund the
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.440]  operation, but I'm not putting a 200, 300, 400% markup on it, no, this is super high
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.040]  quality, just like knockout, is $19.95, and there's no other sleep aid out there over
[50:56.040 --> 51:01.760]  the counter like it, infowarslife.com, stay with us, we'll be right back.

[53:59.440 --> 54:09.440]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:09.440 --> 54:20.720]  So we have this governor openly endorsing Hillary Clinton. And I said six months ago,
[54:20.720 --> 54:24.960]  the guy's a Democrat. He goes out and badmouth Trump everywhere. Gary Johnson clearly is
[54:24.960 --> 54:32.280]  a surrogate for Hillary. He's a total buffoon. He's a total travesty. He's a total joke.
[54:32.280 --> 54:36.720]  And you've got folks sitting and outgoing. I'm not going to be part of either party,
[54:36.720 --> 54:41.280]  but you know, I'm just going to take the high road and be for third parties. I'd be all
[54:41.280 --> 54:47.200]  for third parties if we were trying to build an alternate idea. Trump is the Americanism
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.200]  against globalism taking over the Republican Party. And I know that's known, but the Democratic
[54:53.200 --> 54:57.840]  Party has taken over the Libertarian Party, a party that had a lot of good people and
[54:57.840 --> 55:03.820]  a lot of good ideas. And it's sickeningly disgusting. And we should hear the party coming
[55:03.820 --> 55:09.080]  out and criticizing Weld and criticizing Johnson. We're not. It's despicable. And that's why
[55:09.080 --> 55:13.200]  he's gone to two to three points in major polls from upwards of nine points. He is a
[55:13.200 --> 55:21.240]  joke, a total joke. And they're hoping he takes enough points from Trump to put Hillary
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.200]  in the office. We've got major evidence too of election manipulation. We're going to
[55:25.200 --> 55:31.240]  be getting to her in a moment. But first here's Governor Weld, another fake stuff shirt, pseudo
[55:31.240 --> 55:36.080]  intellectual with a fake intellectual accent. I mean, these people are a plague on this
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.080]  nation.
[55:37.080 --> 55:44.200]  I can't imagine that you wouldn't tell a person in North Carolina or Ohio to vote for Hillary
[55:44.200 --> 55:51.080]  Clinton if the choice they were making was between giving the Libertarian Party 5% or
[55:51.080 --> 55:55.240]  potentially electing Donald Trump, because you guys don't have a chance against Donald
[55:55.240 --> 55:59.680]  Trump and she does. And if they vote for you, they would be helping to elect Donald Trump.
[55:59.680 --> 56:03.040]  The Libertarian Party hasn't treated you great if they're putting out statements that you
[56:03.040 --> 56:08.120]  disagree with over your own name. Even now, this one week before the election, I can't
[56:08.120 --> 56:11.080]  imagine that the loyalty to them is stronger than your fear of Trump.
[56:11.080 --> 56:12.080]  Governor Weld.
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.720]  Well, I'm here vouching for Mrs. Clinton and I think it's high time somebody did. And I'm
[56:15.720 --> 56:22.400]  doing it based on my personal experience with her and I think she deserves to have people
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.600]  vouch for her other than members of the Democratic National Committee. So I'm here to do that.
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.800]  So it's all prescripted. Rachel Maddow with almost no audience, a couple hundred thousand
[56:31.800 --> 56:37.160]  viewers, total joke, no she's a joke, propped up there, no Hillary's a monster. He was spoken
[56:37.160 --> 56:42.920]  out against her when she was quote pro Bernie Sanders. Total intellectual frauds at the
[56:42.920 --> 56:50.080]  end of their days politically sitting there. Oh, your party's treated you terrible. No,
[56:50.080 --> 56:55.200]  it's let you come in. It's let you piss all over it. It's let you do whatever you want.
[56:55.200 --> 56:58.800]  And then they invert reality again, because here's the guy that's come in, lied about
[56:58.800 --> 57:05.640]  who he is, taken over, tried to get Hillary in, committed basically fraud politically,
[57:05.640 --> 57:10.200]  taking with donations of Libertarians that believed in him. He's a hijacker. And then
[57:10.200 --> 57:13.920]  she turns it around. Oh, the Libertarians aren't treating you good. You poor baby. What
[57:13.920 --> 57:16.720]  are you going to do? What are you going to say for that? Well, I'm here to vouch for
[57:16.720 --> 57:21.120]  Hillary because she deserves it. And then it gets worse. Here's another clip. Weld suggests
[57:21.120 --> 57:26.160]  America ignores Clinton's emails. Yeah, Weld, how are you going to feel when all the wieners
[57:26.160 --> 57:31.400]  stuff and the paper play and the Epstein plane comes out? And then Hillary was using it to
[57:31.400 --> 57:37.200]  blackmail people. How are you going to feel then if that comes out? Well, there's no
[57:37.200 --> 57:41.840]  end to these people. There's such jokes when you're around them. They're like walking into
[57:41.840 --> 57:46.680]  walls and just stumbling around. They're just dumb. They're just nobody sellouts that the
[57:46.680 --> 57:53.840]  system goes and uses to throw in front of the American people. They are dishonored.
[57:53.840 --> 58:00.000]  They are fraud. They are deceit. They are anti-Americanism. They are the enemy. They are anathema.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.480]  They are cancer. They are everything you don't want to be. Everything if you're a young
[58:05.480 --> 58:15.120]  person growing up, you don't want to be. These people are abominations to freedom. Now, when
[58:15.120 --> 58:20.120]  we come back, we're going to talk about some of the scams that are undoubtedly already
[58:20.120 --> 58:28.720]  preparing like projections. We're going to look for early network projections starting
[58:28.720 --> 58:32.960]  Monday and Tuesday. They already try it with early voting, but Trump's winning so bad they
[58:32.960 --> 58:37.000]  don't want to talk about it. See, it's hard to beat a landslide, but they've still got
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.560]  tricks up their sleeve. We'll be back. Stay with us. Hour number two straight ahead.
[58:41.560 --> 58:51.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:20.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:27.040]  You know, I'd love to say we just got four days left, but we all know they're going to
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.400]  try to contest it. They're going to try to steal it. I've got all the news here. The
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.240]  polls show Trump in rigged polls is six points ahead, four points ahead, eight points ahead,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.520]  ten points ahead, depending on the battleground state, six points ahead in Florida. They are
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.200]  crapping their little britches right now and they are getting ready to pull out all the
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:51.520]  stops fraud wise. I've been up late every night working and so it's like a calm before
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.760]  the real storm hits. I am just super calm today. I'm normally just chomping at the
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.880]  bit bouncing off the walls. I am super calm. Now I only had a half cup of coffee this morning
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.840]  is because I take selenium. It gives me so much energy because it's key to electrochemical
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.200]  processes in the brain. I realize I'm taking selenium in a couple of days. So I'm going
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.520]  to take, this is not a plug. I realize I was just doing it and forgot to take it during
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.520]  the one minute break. So now I'm plugging because it's out of necessity. I'm going to
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:23.200]  take my probiotic. I'm going to take my selenium from m4slife.com. I'm going to take a brain
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:34.720]  force too because I don't normally need, yeah, I wasn't planning this. I don't normally
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:44.720]  need brain force. Like I said, taking selenium, I've even cut back on caffeine, 90% probably.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.160]  But then sometimes going off caffeine, I just suddenly get like a doldrum. I mean, I got
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.120]  tons of energy but compared to normal. So right now I'm taking a brain force and I'm
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:02:01.720]  taking a, I'm taking a probiotic, biome defense from m4slife.com. And then again, I don't
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:08.680]  know where it's gone. There it is. My selenium, bio truce selenium from m4slife.com. I'm going
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:14.400]  to take this right now as well. I'm just thinking, why not just plug on here as I was already
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.360]  about to take it during the break.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:28.440]  Mmm. Watch what happens the next hour. Mighty mouse. It's like the, I'm strong to the finish
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:37.960]  because I eat my spinach and pop by the sailor man. You know, part of that is just being
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.680]  on my shelf and being self deprecating because pride go before fall. It's fun to ask stupid
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:48.520]  sometimes, isn't it? Gallows humor, my friends, but I'm not going to mix being silly now with
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.320]  this important information. So I'll cover it when we come back from break as I reset
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.880]  my mind. But man, when you're reading about pedophile rings and Epstein and the Clintons
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:04.040]  and just at a certain point, I just want to, that's like, wow, could we just get some half
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.760]  decent people in government that aren't total scum and who aren't trying to start World
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.840]  War three and who aren't in love with radical Islamists opening our border up? I mean, really,
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:19.400]  it goes to the psychology of these people that they're so outrageously unhappy.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.480]  And Hillary, a lot of psychiatrists, the point of the sound, I'll have Pachenicon just about
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.000]  how she only wants to be around really ugly people. Now, I'm not a crazy, fake person
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.160]  where I just want to be around beautiful people, but with Hillary it's known really ugly, really
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.640]  nasty, really weird people, really criminal people. She likes hanging around with pedophiles.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.920]  She likes representing scum. She likes just, just, just, she likes not taking baths. She's
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:48.200]  just a big, stinking, horrible, nasty monster. And she is probably one of the greatest villains
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:54.480]  I've ever known of. And if she hides it all because she's this waddling, evil old woman,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.200]  you know, it's supposedly okay because she's a woman. We have names for evil women. We
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:04.680]  call them witches. Alex Jones calls her a witch. I don't mean that literally. I mean,
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.840]  it figuratively is an archetype. But I love how the media test markets all these attacks
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.480]  on us and then drops them immediately because all it does is boost Donald Trump's polls.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.020]  We're not in the same old world anymore where you control things and you say what's
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:26.560]  normal and you get to criticize us. When you criticize us, our stock goes up. You are done.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.840]  I know you still have the big paychecks and still think you're somebody in the MSM. You're
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:38.320]  not. You're a disgraced joke. And Donald Trump smelled that. He's always been a nationalist
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.840]  and a patriot and it's naff and gat, but he's become dominantly that now and has gone through
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.760]  trial by fire and has come out after the battle with the metaphysical bullrog even stronger.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:58.960]  He's no longer Donald Trump the gray, but Trump the white. We'll be back, ladies and
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.240]  gentlemen.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.200]  We're red on election day. Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.240]  away. We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.520]  and election fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.680]  to government leaders providing fast track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.320]  This is happening right in front of us. Now we are seeing the establishment send all its
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:25.480]  hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Government chills are campaigning for
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.640]  Clinton. Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds, rigged polls
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.960]  being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.760]  and to discourage people from voting Trump. Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.360]  all platforms. So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.040]  What can we do to prevent election fraud? I propose that all Donald Trump supporters
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.800]  wear red on election day. On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.320]  Trump, be decked out in red. This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.640]  and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout. Wear red on election day
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.000]  and make America great again.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.840]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:09.560]  Charlie Daniels. He's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.320]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21. The American system of justice must be
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:19.480]  changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a backseat
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.800]  to the collective. Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you? It's gonna
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.960]  be coming after you're done. Oh, yeah. I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way. At all.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.320]  It ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.200]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reviewers. When I was a boy, it was okay
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:43.160]  to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie. And beef was for supper.

[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:32.680]  We're only four days out, and Donald Trump is Americana. Americanism? Not globalism will
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.320]  be our credo. That there is a seismic shift, just like Brexit, the awakening to the true
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:43.160]  nature of planetary control. And once you force that debate out in the open, and people realize
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.200]  that they've been kept in the dark and are being governed from afar, just as with our
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:55.800]  colonies in 1775 and 1776, the breakaway is as sure as night, following day, and so on
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.800]  and so forth. Here's part of an intro with Donald Trump.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:06.800]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. Americanism, not globalism, Americanism, not
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:14.240]  globalism.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.600]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:25.040]  We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.400]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure,
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:35.400]  wanton, henchmen of totalitarianism. If you were a foreign power looking to
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:41.600]  weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.800]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:51.520]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.000]  and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.840]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.880]  dark age. That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:12.880]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.560]  of our own.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.080]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger. A world
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.880]  that gets uglier and stupider and more stunting.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:28.880]  That the government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.880]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.680]  Well, I voted for Hillary. I guess I have to, since I'm working for her as well.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.520]  You want an image of the future, Winston? It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.920]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.400]  Women are treated, discriminated against, and all of these countries she took money against,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.960]  gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely. They're mistreated. She claims
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960]  to be their champion.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.720]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes and see how ugly and
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.280]  weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.720]  a horrible life. That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power, ripping
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.680]  apart humanity. We're here to hurt humans. We're here to suck your guts out.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:21.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.240]  Well, I told the Clintons two weeks ago that, for my sources, that if they didn't start
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:33.360]  backing down and didn't stop trying to steal the election, that more info would be coming
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.240]  out dealing with sex, dealing with children. And you notice now that's coming out in the
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:43.000]  New York News. We've had guests on yesterday. The NYPD's got the information. This will
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.240]  destroy the Democratic Party. This will irrevocably annihilate you. But you tried to kill the country,
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.200]  didn't you? You tried for a full takeover. You were so naked. You were so arrogant that
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:59.440]  you openly had all these servers selling our secrets to the world. These were drop boxes
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:05.160]  to then corrupt other politicians and get them involved using secret servers and pseudonyms
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.920]  and numb deplumes to complete your corruption. Now, until 45 after we've got some breaking
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.760]  news coming then, we have William F. Jasper joining us to cover the election, what he
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.400]  thinks is coming, what's happening. He's the editor at thenewamerican.com. And I don't
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.800]  always introduce him this way because I like to do this for the average guest. It's important
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.320]  to know where we came from and what we've done. I've ever been a member of the John
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.880]  Burst Society. It was set up in 1956. And it was set up by American patriots who discovered
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:39.200]  that we turned our back in China and put the Communist Chinese in power in 1949. That's
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.160]  now been declassified, what, 13, 14 years ago. But the John Burst Society with military
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.920]  people and others began to go public. They got demonized. They got attacked. Back when
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:55.680]  mainstream media was like God in this country. Back when it was totally trusted. And if you
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.640]  go back to what they said back then, it was basically all accurate on target. And that's
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.440]  where Barry Goldwater and everything else we've seen and Ron Paul came from. So when
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.800]  you hear the media say Donald Trump spouting Alex Jones' information, he gets it from
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.640]  Alex Jones, I'd love to say that was true. And we've had conversations on and off air
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.240]  and Trump does agree with me on a lot of things because we're seeing the same thing and he's
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.320]  advised by people like General Flynn who understand how the real world works. This isn't like some
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.800]  political view we have that's our opinion. Global government's now out in the open. And
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.840]  it's exactly as the founders of the John Burst Society said it was back in the 1950s. And
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.240]  these people put everything they had into fighting this. Everything. They sold their
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.240]  companies, you name it. These are the folks are the reason we're even able to put on this
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.920]  defense now. But here's the good news. Even if they steal this from Trump and he's an
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.640]  imperfect messenger, everybody has, I think he's going to win. This is the beginning of
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.120]  the end for global government. And they admit that in the financial times in the economist
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.720]  in their publications, they are chicken with their head cut off freaked out. Now they admit
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.440]  authoritarianism might still work, but they've got to take the gloves off now, which makes
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.920]  it a lot harder. So the reason I bring up the John Burst Society is you have to understand
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.200]  folks, our resistance to this started a long time ago in this country and other areas and
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.800]  is now a global phenomenon.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:23.360]  And so if you think we're in trouble now, look at what 50, 60 years ago, almost no one knew
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:29.920]  about this. So we've come a long way. Most Americans know the Federal Reserve represents
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.480]  a bunch of private interests and isn't federal. Most Americans now know about global government.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.800]  They know about NSA spying. They know about government picking winners and losers. They
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:44.020]  know about the Uber rich wanting to make us poor. And once that paradigm shifts, the
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:50.560]  class warfare doesn't work anymore. So we're in a race right now, a race against tyranny.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:56.960]  William F. Jasper, the new American magazine, new American.com. Great news site as well.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.560]  Joins us. There's so much to cover. I've got evidence of them to have early projections
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.600]  and how they're going to announce that Hillary's won early to turn folks away and try to sell
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.960]  it up Tuesday afternoon. We've got other information we're going to get into. But the good news
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.000]  is Trump is surging in every poll, even polls that sample way more Democrats. They're in
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.520]  panic mode and there is good elements of our government that are now leaking information.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.200]  It's coming out. It was not, not the Russians. This is an incredible time to be alive. And
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.000]  so William F. Jasper is our guest. I kind of set the table there with this epic fight.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.040]  But what is it like for you being involved for 30 something years? Your parents, early
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.040]  members, you thought they were crazy World War two vets saying that our government was
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.320]  working with communists. You investigated their claims, found out they were right. I
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.560]  mean, I'm kind of recapping your story, but you've been a member since you were, you
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:51.880]  know, a young man to now see how we've been vindicated. My dad, you know, given speeches
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.880]  when he was in high school and college about this, he's been vindicated. I mean, thank
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.640]  God for the folks that have been out there. And it's not about the credit, but it's understanding
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.480]  how now worldwide the movement that John Burt society started is now the worldwide resistance,
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.040]  not, not in the actual organization, but in the spirit of it is not not accurate.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:15.720]  Well, I think it is, Alex. And I thank you very much. And a great deal of that can be
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:22.880]  credited to you. You've done an amazing job in the last decade, the last couple of decades.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:32.400]  Next month will be my 40th year in this fight. And so I have seen a lot of crazy, wild and
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:41.960]  terrible things happening. And I have to say this election cycle, this current cycle that
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:48.280]  we're in right now is the most amazing wild ride that we've ever experienced with all
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.960]  the things that are happening, all the things that are coming out. And it is a very exciting
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:17:00.400]  time. And it's a very sobering and in many ways a frightful time because so much as
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.480]  it's state, we are now down to the wire in this battle of nationalism, Americanism versus
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:15.440]  globalism. And we don't know exactly how that's going to come out. But we did not think weeks
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:22.280]  ago, months ago that it was going to be this close, the way the media had stacked at the
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:29.480]  insider, globalist media had stacked it for Hillary. As you reported, as we reported last
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:37.000]  this past June, at the Bilderberg summit, it was all stacked with Hillary Clinton's
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.640]  people, stacked against Trump, and stacked against the other big issue at that moment
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.680]  was the Brexit in the UK. And I think, and we reported and we said and we opined since
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:18:00.520]  then that the way the Brexit vote came out in the UK in favor of exiting the EU in spite
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:06.800]  of the project fear launched by the British Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.680]  Liberal Democrat Party, a sweep of all the parties except for the UKIT. And with all
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:20.680]  of the media, all of the banks, all of the big globalist corporations, the establishment
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.760]  think tanks and establishment economists all warning the British people that the island
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:34.600]  would self-destruct and Godzilla would eat London if they voted for the Brexit. Nevertheless,
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:41.160]  against all of the polling, the British people surprised us all and came out in favor of
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.360]  the Brexit in favor of leaving the EU, which has been a monstrous attack on their national
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.560]  sovereignty and this national sovereignty of all of the EU member nations.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:58.800]  And so, we said at the time, I said in my opinion pieces at the time that this was a
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:06.920]  very sobering thing and it was a very exciting thing for us because it presaged what was
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:13.120]  likely to happen with the same odds in the Trump-Clinton matchup.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.400]  William F. Jasper is our guest, New American Magazine, NewAmerican.com. If Trump gets in
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.720]  if they're unable to steal it, how will they counter-strike? Obviously, they've tried to
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.560]  now bring the UK down economically, but the people see through that, kind of like Hitler
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.720]  in the Blitz had only hardened the Brits to fight harder. Now that global government's
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.920]  out in the open and they openly threatened to implode our economy and they openly threatened
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.120]  to do all these horrible things, you know, if we elect Donald Trump or burn down US cities,
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:45.760]  it only illustrates the fact that we do have this alien foreign corporate system over us
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.200]  that is in the news financing Hollywood today to openly say white males are inherently bad
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:57.160]  and should be, quote, killed. I mean, the rhetoric of these people is beyond anything
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:03.480]  I've ever even saw Marxist put out. It is the most virile, bizarre authoritarian, insane
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.560]  asylum garbage I've ever seen. What's behind that?
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:14.400]  Well, that's part of this whole culture wars, which is really the setup for all of the change
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:23.120]  of our whole system. If you capture the culture, that is the entertainment, the education,
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:31.920]  all of the methods and means of transmitting to the younger generation what this country
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:39.520]  is supposed to be about and the world view, you essentially have won. And that has been
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.080]  the principal psi ops attack of the communists and of the conspiracy from day one, going
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.560]  back over 100 years. And it's been the principal means by which the globalist insiders working
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:58.960]  together with communists have accomplished the same thing, assisting the transformation
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:05.960]  of our culture through entertainment, through education, through propaganda. You can convince
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:13.960]  that one of the most potent examples of that, of course, is the acceptance by the younger
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.160]  generation now of homosexuality, something which a generation ago was so important that
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:27.480]  it wasn't even mentioned. But if you constantly on the network, television sitcoms, soap operas
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:37.360]  et cetera, present people with homosexuality, with perverse sexuality of all kinds, pornography,
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.600]  you're going to wear down the resistance to that. And that's what they have done. And
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:50.120]  the same thing with gender politics, with race politics, the very people who claim that
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:54.880]  they are against hate are the ones who are engendering hate. They're particularly engendering
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:00.760]  and now, as you point out, coming right out in the open and demanding hate for European
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:07.640]  culture, Christian culture, and it's mainly white people pushing it. And again, you know,
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.880]  they use these football issues of sex and things, they admit this to divert off the
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.360]  financial thieving, the spine, we're all losing our rights. And they just get us all fighting
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.960]  with each other when we were all basically getting along before. But how do they square
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:25.640]  this idea of announcing world government, having the Pope push world government, global
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.840]  carbon taxes, Time Magazine, Newsweek, the Financial Times of London, we need world
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:35.440]  government. It needs to be unelected for your own good, carbon taxes. But then they separately
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:42.520]  say it doesn't exist. It's insane. If Donald Trump talks about it, if Donald Trump talks
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:48.040]  about the TPP, I mean, there was an article a few days ago in Bloomberg saying, yes, cities
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.880]  are passing laws for illegals to vote. And we should have illegals voting. But Trump's
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.760]  against it. And it doesn't exist. He's insane. They're actually writing articles that are
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.360]  like meant to be mentally ill now, where it says the illegals are voting and we need
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.160]  to make more vote. But Trump's insane. They're not voting. I mean, I'm or they're yes, world
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:14.240]  governments here. The common sense of American goal. Okay. We're not supposed to be having
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:22.360]  a legal aliens vote. But when somebody makes a common sense proposal or passes legislation
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:29.600]  they scream racist for voter identification, then automatically you're a xenophobic racist.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.560]  But I'm asking you, you're a smart guy. There's this new thing where they go, we're setting
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.720]  up world government, but we'll call you racist if you say it exists. It's almost like they're
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:44.040]  trying to break us or something by openly engaging in nonsense. I mean, I'm seeing a
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:50.440]  new a new assault now of like nonsense. Well, and that's one of the benefits that we have
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:57.760]  seen with Trump's ascendancy is that he has called this political correctness this brainwashing
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:04.480]  this propaganda for what it is. And many people have been afraid to criticize anything
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.600]  because they're afraid of the racist label. They're afraid of being called hateful. They're
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:13.320]  right. So his biggest thing is being brazen and getting us out of our comfort zones.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:20.880]  Yes. And so I was just at the United Nations the week before last. I've been a correspondent
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:28.200]  there for 30 years. They hate me. I hate them. That's one hate I will admit to. But they
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.920]  frequently try to stop me from being accredited there. I have been accredited there for three
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.360]  decades. Yeah, that's a perennial deal. They try to kick you out or stop you. Right. And
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.040]  I don't know whether they're going to credit me this time. They were they've gone through
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.160]  a new procedure. And the day before I arrived there, I read a story in the Canadian Financial
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:55.840]  Press that they had instituted a new accreditation process for alternative media for those who
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:04.560]  represent advocacy positions. So I'm sure they're going to give me a tough time about
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:12.080]  getting accredited. But while I was there in New York at the UN, we had just gotten
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.080]  the new secretary general, Antonio Gutierrez, and he's a buddy of Hillary Clinton's and
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.240]  Bill Clinton's. He was the president of the Socialist International and the Socialist
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.400]  International proudly traces its lineage back to Karl Marx. It is the largest organization
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:34.840]  of communist and socialist organizations. He's the former prime minister of Portugal, president
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.640]  of the Socialist International. Now he's the secretary general of the UN. Prior to that,
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:45.720]  he was the man in charge of designing the refugee program that flooded Europe and is
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:51.840]  trying to flood the United States. He worked there with Peter Sutherland, the chairman
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.800]  of Global Sacks International and with Anthony Lake, the Institute. And again, the biggest
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:02.200]  banks, what the John Birch Society has done was the first to do was, and then Barry Goldwater
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.040]  was, the senator obviously was in there and able to see the documents and confirm what
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.240]  you were saying. Your parents were saying, those were saying, is that, and what Wells
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.120]  was saying obviously, was that the ultra rich want to get rid of a free market and have
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.160]  a monopoly, as John D said, competition's a sin. And that's why they're always caught
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:22.280]  running the communist, running the socialist, running the Russian Revolution. It's a, it's
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.320]  a plague. I mean, don't we almost have to apologize to the Russians being from the US
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.200]  or England, because our country's money and people contributed to the overthrow of Russia?
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.320]  Well, absolutely. And again, we want to make a distinction between the Russians and the
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320]  communist regimes. Yes.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:46.040]  That ruled them. It was not Russians per se. In fact, most of the Bolsheviks, the communists
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.320]  who went in to affect the Bolshevik Revolution were non-Russians.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:55.200]  Yeah, they were from New York and London. Right. And so this is the thing that many
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.400]  people on both the right and left don't understand. Many of the Bernie Sanders people who think
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.520]  that Bernie Sanders was opposing Wall Street, that he's an anti-Wall Street guy, just like
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:10.360]  Hillary Clinton. Some of them see through Hillary because it's very obvious. She takes
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:16.560]  huge cash fees from. She's the biggest Wall Street candidate ever.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.400]  Black Rock, JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, et cetera. Yeah, she's the most connected Wall
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:29.560]  Street-funded politician ever. And yet, so I mean, she is comfortable and happy with
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:36.000]  the top 1% of the top 1%. And yet, she uses this populist rhetoric, this working class
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  appeal.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.560]  Oh, she even talks in fake-hick accents. It is so, she'll talk to Hispanic group and
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.440]  put on a weird accent. She showed up in a black group and goes, look, soul food. Or she shows
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.880]  up in Hispanic group, goes, look, hot sauce. And then she goes, how you doing there today
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.120]  when she's in Kentucky? I mean, talk about a fake.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:00.640]  So, but this is what we're dealing with at the highest levels, complete ponies and monsters
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.800]  who are posing as champions of the people while they are actually working to concentrate,
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:15.360]  centralize all power. And this is where you see the key important issue with the globalists
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.760]  and the communist socialists cooperating. What do both of them want? They both want total
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:25.280]  power, concentrating political, economic, social power, all in the hands of an oligarchy
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:31.680]  of few. That's a jab in the communist countries and still have in the communist countries.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.360]  That's what we are getting more and more here. As our free market, free enterprise system,
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.400]  what's left of it is eroded and destroyed piece by piece.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.280]  And let me just add, William F. Jasper is joining us, the editor-in-chief at the New
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.560]  American magazine, the preeminent publication everybody's subscribed to, especially to give
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.400]  to people who, hey, you want to know what's really going on? Read this. I mean, you talk
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.680]  about Veritas, it's it. And when we come back from break, sir, I want to just ask you in
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.280]  the final segment we have what the world will look like if they succeed because you, unlike
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:05.680]  anybody else, have studied their own documents, their own admissions, what they want to set
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.360]  up. And it's so nightmarish that I get why people think we're conspiracy theorists because
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:14.280]  this sounds insane. But if you look at what Hitler wanted to do or what the Soviets wanted
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.840]  to do and other, you know, command and control utopians, it's always over the top. Unbelievable.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.560]  That's why each generation gets caught by it because the average person doesn't think
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.720]  like this. So we'll come back with William F. Jasper in the final segment. Then I've
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:33.960]  got big breaking news and into the third hour today, Colonel Schaefer, who blew the whistle
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.160]  on Hillary and Obama being behind ISIS and al-Qaeda. He's going to join us with the biggest
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.120]  intel yet about what's happening currently in the world and surprises, surprises are
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:50.960]  coming today in the next few days, infowars.com. Four days out, stay with us. We're on the
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:30:02.120]  march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. New York Police
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:08.480]  Department detectives and prosecutors are working on an alleged underage sexting case
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.000]  against former congressman Anthony Weiner. They have turned over a newly found laptop
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.960]  that he shared with his wife Uma Abedine to the FBI. True Pundit is reporting that there
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:25.960]  is enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew away for life. The NYPD sees
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:31.560]  the computer from Anthony Weiner during a search warrant and sources now say that emails
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:38.440]  from the laptop link Hillary Clinton herself to a host of crimes that include money laundering,
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:45.240]  perjury, obstruction of justice, child exploitation, sex crimes with children, pay to play through
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:51.360]  the Clinton Foundation, and of course, more classified top secret breaches. Well, it sounds
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:31:20.280]  like bad news for Cricket Hillary, and you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.560]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone

[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:21.560]  You ever wonder what happened to America? When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:28.560]  of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie. God was in school, morality had a future,
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:35.680]  and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government. We're the solution,
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:41.160]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that. Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:47.160]  Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:54.600]  orange sheds and tears over the red, white, and blue. Revelation, the movie.info. Americans
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:03.880]  need to see this film. Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:11.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.320]  Again, I want to be very clear here. I don't give credit to people just because people
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.560]  want credit. William F. Jasper and the John Byrd Society does in the New American magazine.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.840]  We have to recognize that people have been fighting a long time against this tyranny
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:27.880]  and who have gone through hell and have been proven right. Somebody else, I want to point
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.200]  out, who is the most valuable player in this fighting against globalism and who, time after
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:37.720]  time, is who breaks through the line to get Julian Assange's information out, or to get
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:43.160]  Donald Trump early on out there, or to get info wars out there. I just had my IT people
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.360]  run in here with a laptop, and they said, look at this. We had like five times our record
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:34:00.040]  traffic a few days ago. Look at this. Speakingofrecordreport.com, they said, we are having way more than
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.760]  eight times our previous record traffic listening to the audio streams and watching the video,
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.840]  which is a small part of our audience, but still huge, from the drudge link. And see,
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.280]  that's what Matt Drudge is doing. We're not paying for that. Matt Drudge is just linking
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.400]  to everybody that's fighting because we're in a war. So what you do is you go to drudgereport.com,
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.480]  you click on the sponsors and support Drudge, because it's symbiotic. You go back to the
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.080]  Clinton Foundation and not the new current one or the global initiative, the even bigger
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.920]  one, the third incarnation that's got tens of billions coming into it. But if you go
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.640]  back to their original library, they got the documents from the Clintons when they first
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:45.080]  got it in 93. And it's all about shut down competition. Don't let a new media develop.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.760]  Don't, you know, people sell books or people fund their new media. We've got to go after
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:53.760]  them and shut them down and use the IRS and use the media and call them conspiracy theorists,
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:01.080]  because that'll produce an economy of outside ideas. Well, you failed. You failed. And you
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.520]  failed to stop drudgereport.com and you failed to stop the New American Magazine. You failed
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.400]  to stop Info Wars. You failed. And so this is a big deal. I'm not trying to have a celebration
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:16.120]  here four days out from the election, but I'm telling you, folks, we've gone from not
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:23.280]  even on the map fighting this 50 years ago to now globally, succession from the corporations
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:29.960]  and big mega banks is the hottest thing out there. And they've had Washington Post articles
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:34.560]  in New York Times articles in Austin, America, statesman articles where they go, Oh my God,
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.480]  Info Wars gets more traffic than CNN and national review combined. What are we going to do? And
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:46.440]  I'm like, you just now notice this drudge is getting 15 times the traffic we are. It's
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.200]  just before they would announce drudge was over because the bigger he got, it shows their
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.600]  attempt to sell delusion and William F. Jasper getting back to you and talking about what
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.000]  the stakes are if we lose because certainly the empire is going to strike back. But there's
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.920]  an intellectual victory. They're still in control, though, financially. So how do we
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:06.080]  get through that? But just you concur or do you disagree? I mean, we should all just pause
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:12.200]  for a moment and say, mainstream media is collapsing. Free thinking is exploding. Renaissance
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.440]  is being rediscovered. I mean, this, this is a magic moment.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:22.840]  Well, that is why, Alex, there was such a big battle over the last couple of years about
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:29.520]  control of the control of the Internet. You know, and that battle is not finished yet.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.640]  The United Nations, the globalists have tried to put the United Nations in charge of the
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.160]  Internet. That did not work. Even many on the left said, Hey, wait a second, wait a
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.800]  second. The United Nations kind of partially because of folks fighting. It's now kind of
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:50.680]  a limbo. Right. So now they've taken a transition to that. We're going to go through this nebulous
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.880]  icon corporation. It's not spelled out. And now we're going to put it there. But ultimately
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.440]  the game plan is the same. They would have, they will have a global entity under the United
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.840]  Nations controlling it. And of course, it'd be the oligarchy, the one worlders who would
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:12.800]  be really top Supreme Court justice told Matt Drudge a year ago, that is the plan. Yes,
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:18.080]  that's, that's been the plan all along. And we've been reporting from those UN summits
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:22.560]  on the Internet that that's precisely what they, what they're planning.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.000]  And the Soros WikiLeaks show that he says, we've just kind of shut down our competition
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.640]  by you and take over the web. So we have them admitting that's their plan. So what do we
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.640]  do?
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:38.360]  Right. And so, well, what we, what we have to do is, is exponentially increase all of
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:46.120]  our reach over the Internet. Get, get the, this information out to stop them from moving
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.480]  ahead with this. And what we have in the next few days are a number of different scenarios.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:56.760]  I'm sure you played some of them out. If, if Trump wins in the, in the elections, they're
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:05.000]  not able to steal it with election machinery, with the electronic voting, then we know that
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.360]  quite a number of things are going to happen. We will have the Black Lives Matter, La Raza
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.080]  folks are creating riots in the streets, social turmoil.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.440]  That was my next question. What happens if Trump does get in? I mean, you got one of
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.160]  the best crystal balls out there.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.800]  Well, that, that's almost a given that that, that would happen.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.520]  How do we respond then?
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:29.840]  Well, that, that would not be sufficient to bring down our country. We'll have to wait
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:34.680]  it out. Obviously, we're going to have to try to, that's why the Second Amendment is
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:40.920]  so important. If you have widespread rioting, the citizens themselves, armed citizens will
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:46.400]  protect it and stop it from going on. I was in the LA riots down there and in those Black
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:51.040]  neighborhoods where the, where the rioters didn't destroy the neighborhoods because the
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.920]  Black citizens there in South Central LA came out with their guns.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920]  That's right. The media would not show that.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:03.200]  No, they didn't see that. It was, it was the Koreans and the Mexicans and the, the Black
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:07.160]  people in, in South Central that protected their own neighborhoods. They barricaded their
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:10.440]  streets and the Bobs, the rioters that were coming down.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.480]  I've always noticed the media is very racist. They claim they love Black people, but they
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.560]  never show Black people doing the right thing, which they do almost all the time, just like
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.480]  everybody else does. They show the bad examples to kind of promote that and then say that's
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:24.320]  their rowing. But I remember the reports. It was a lot of Black folks standing up for
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  the rioting, but they would never show that.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:31.440]  That's why minorities, racial minorities, religious minorities are the ones who should
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:36.720]  most embrace the Second Amendment. That's their final protection. When, when you have
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:43.200]  a majority or a mob coming after you and the police can't be there or the police are
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.360]  nowhere in sight, you're on your own and you better be able to protect yourself. So for
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.800]  Asian Americans, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, one of the, the Second Amendment
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.960]  is one of their, their hitlers, a great example, taking the Jews guns, putting them in ghettos.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.000]  I mean, first you take the guns of who you're going to oppress.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.480]  Well, we know that beyond that, we already have a setup for this election. We have OSCE
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.480]  and UN monitors coming in.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.720]  That's where I wanted to go next. I mean, they've been here a few of them before. Reuters
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:19.120]  reported a 10-fold increase. So they're saying Trump's insane. It doesn't exist. There's
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:24.400]  no fraud, but the biggest fraud ever is here. So we've got to have the, the, the OECD's
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:27.600]  paramilitary security force here.
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:33.440]  Well, and that's part of the plan. They haven't gotten to that point yet, but in other countries
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:41.600]  around the world, they have used the, the claim of ungovernability to justify bringing
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.600]  in the blue.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.120]  That's where I was going. There's a level even beyond what we're saying here.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:52.520]  Yes. And, and at this point, that would be very difficult for them to do because we still
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:59.360]  have a couple hundred million armed Americans. And there are increasingly, you know, 50 years
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.200]  ago when the John Birch Society launched the Get Us Out of the United Nations campaign,
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.040]  a lot of people thought that they were crazy. I did at the time when I, when I was in college
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.600]  and until I started studying their materials. And I said, well, you know,
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.880]  I tell that story about your parents, you know, the world war two, that's if I remember
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.720]  correctly. And then you, you know, you're crazy. You look at the material and you were
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.760]  a smart student in college like, well, this is real.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:27.680]  Yeah. And, and I think anyone who really will look at the information, for instance, a lot
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.440]  of the material that you're presenting here, people haven't heard of before until they
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:38.880]  said, but the public records are out there behind me as a small part of my library.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.320]  Most of the information that we have comes from public sources. Like most media, we have
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:53.040]  to use inside sources who are anonymous within government agencies or within corporations,
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.280]  et cetera. But most of the, the most damning material we get from public source materials,
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.880]  they can be checked, they can be verified. And that's all, that's all we're asking people
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.440]  to do is look, your, your liberty is at stake, your futures at stake, your children's lives,
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.880]  fortunes and liberties are at stake. Let's put, put aside all of this entertaining of
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:21.000]  ourselves to death and get serious about saving our country and saving our civilization.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.680]  I agree. And people are finding out it's fun to be informed. It's fun to be involved.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.880]  I mean, I'm seeing the awakening, it was like a one on a record scale five years ago.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.600]  It's like a 10 right now. I mean, it is, it is exceedingly strong. That's got to be
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.200]  really, really panicking with social engineers.
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.600]  Well, and that, that it is invigorating and particularly for men, it's a manly thing to
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.040]  be involved in taking control of your life, of your community, of your family. It's, it's
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:53.800]  a terribly emasculating and wimpy thing for men to just be concerning themselves with
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:00.600]  the sports and other movies and video games while their civilization is being destroyed.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.480]  So the manly thing to do is to roll up your sleeves and jump in, educate yourself.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.520]  And that's why we see the colleges and the big money at total war against men saying
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.360]  masculinity, leadership, strength is a bad thing. They're trying to teach women that
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.920]  women instinctively know that's a load of manure.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:23.080]  Well, and this is one of the things that that's encouraging that we're seeing here is that
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:29.920]  people are coming out of, as you know, I was not an early supporter of Trump. We still,
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:35.840]  we don't endorse people. We don't publicly endorse anybody. I still have my reservations
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.200]  about Trump. He's an imperfect candidate. But many of the things that you have pointed
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:47.960]  out, we have noted as well, we take our time in analyzing these things. And we've been,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.520]  we've seen the American people fooled many times before by politicians who claim like
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.120]  Jimmy Carter, that he's an outsider and he, we need to change and get our bush wasn't
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:00.840]  gonna be the world's super cop. But I mean, with Trump, the fear of the elites real. I
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.920]  know the inside baseball. Trump is so pigheaded and does love America and doesn't like being
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.560]  screwed over by other elites. He sees himself as an underdog. He relishes defeating these
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:18.120]  people. They've got his MO. Mr. Jasper, that's why I, I, I have been convinced as we studied
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:24.960]  it more and more that the opposition was not just shadow boxing, the, the overwhelming
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:34.240]  anti Trump forces in both Republican Democratic administrations, the Council on Foreign Relations
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:39.640]  Prilateral, Bilderberg, one world elites have just come down on him like even more than
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:45.320]  they did against Goldwater. The same thing that we experienced over the last 50 years.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:50.320]  And so what's your prime analysis? They, they know he's imperfect, but he's a man. He's
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.800]  a bull. He does love the country. He's going at them. They know he'll, he will never back
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.840]  down. That's why they're scared. And so this brings us another scenario. And that is should
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:08.560]  Trump win the election. What happens to him? As you know, there have been many assassinations
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:16.360]  throughout history. We're talking about a huge impetus, a huge motive on the part of
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:22.440]  those who he knows that and he's, he doesn't want that, but quite frankly, he has no fear.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:29.720]  I mean, the guy, that is what anyone taking this position has to face up to. Because if
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.320]  you have that fear going in, you really shouldn't be in this, in this race. You have to expect
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.320]  that.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.280]  Well, William F. Jasper, I want to invite you back up for a full hour, very, very soon.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.640]  Even next week, if you've got time, we're going to do 52 hours live broadcast kicking
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.720]  off Monday. Thank you so much for your great work. What a historical time to be alive and
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.640]  it's great to just be able to recognize how far we've come. Thanks to those Americans
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:59.640]  in the fifties. I mean, who just had the spin 60 seconds on that. How did, how did the founders
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.080]  of John Birch decided to get it so right? I mean, just dead on.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:10.480]  Well, first of all, the credit goes primarily overwhelming to Robert Welch himself. He was
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:17.680]  a brilliant man. He was a child prodigy who was reading at the age of three and was phenomenally
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:26.520]  intelligent, but he surrounded himself with a number of other very brilliant men, but
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:35.120]  men who had experience in the military, in business, in finance, in academia, guys such
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:44.520]  as Ludwig von Mises and Henry Haslett and many other experts in geopolitics. And he
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:52.520]  was wise enough to know that one person cannot know everything. And they trusted him because
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:59.080]  of his integrity and his brilliance and knowledge. And so he put together this core group of
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:04.760]  people and this was right at a time when Americans were realizing, hey, something's terribly
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.440]  wrong. Communists are taking over one country after another. This is like something the
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:15.960]  world had never seen before, a global conquest, a global slaughter, massacre, genocide on
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:23.040]  a scale never seen before. And it was being aided at every step by people in our own
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.920]  government. And Welch with the military, the Patriots discovered that it was mega, not
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:32.080]  only the Alger Hisses and those types of top banking and business people. And so he was
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:39.040]  able to get enough people together and they finally began to make a big enough impact
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:46.840]  that all of the establishment and the communists and globalist media and academia just came
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.520]  down on them. But we survived.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.800]  And the emergency message got out. We held off the globalists a long time. And now every
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.720]  time they try to complete their work, it just proves us right that it blows up again. What
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.680]  an amazing thing you guys have done. And I see that as a testament. That's why I don't
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:04.040]  care about being demonized or lied about. I know I'm doing the right thing. And I know
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:07.880]  in history, we're standing up for what's right. That's why I don't care what a bunch of collaborators
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.800]  and enemy media say. I like to invite you sometime to town if you'd like to come, maybe
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.160]  make a documentary for online with the history of the John Burr Society and the New American
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.360]  Magazine because it's a blueprint for victory into other countries and into the future will
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.760]  always face these types of criminal operations. We're not trying to build a utopia here. We're
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.480]  just trying to build a free market. And I want to salute you, my friend.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.880]  Well, thank you, Alex. My pleasure.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.000]  I mean, folks, it's just gives me chills. You read the stuff Welsh wrote in the fifties.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  I mean, it's just it's like, I mean, they say basically that guy could like predict
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.280]  the future. And that was he was so smart. And he but he he understood it. He had the analysis
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.000]  and then as he found out about it, all these generals and people in Congress came to him
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.200]  and said, How do you know this? This is what's happening. And then he said, Well, I could
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.800]  just see it. And they're like, Yeah, that's what's going on. And God gives us these type
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.640]  of people. And there's people out there right now. And look, Donald Trump's not perfect.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:10.880]  We all know that. But he is a real man. He loves this country. He wants to take the shackles
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:14.680]  off. He wants to have war with Russia, because they've done nothing with us. China's in
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:19.440]  our face. He's like, Okay, you want some? The Islamists want to piss all over us. He's
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.720]  ready to stand up to him. Russia does something to Trump. He'll stand up. That's one false
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.680]  flag they might pull is start some stuff with Russia to try to get Trump after Russia. So
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.600]  Trump's got his problems because he's so real that that he can be manipulated, but any of
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:33.600]  us can.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.440]  The point is, is that this is an epic battle taking place. It's historical. And I'm just
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:43.400]  honored to be here. Now, Anthony Gutierrez here. I drug him in here because we have developed
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:48.160]  now what is this like our 20th product bio PCA here and nails formula. This is the best
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.760]  selling formula, not this formula, but formulas similar to it. Of all the different supplements
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.200]  out there, we've spent a long time coming out with this order to be very inexpensive,
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.480]  but the highest quality and obviously to make sure nails and your skin and your hair healthier.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.320]  It's everything else. This is, but if you want that glow, we've developed it 2995 competitors.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:16.120]  Actually, it's 1995 or discounted on the gates. I forgot that. So this, this, this is the
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.960]  best till we've ever put out. And especially for women and other folks. Tell us about it.
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.600]  Anthony, we're going to go to break him up and start telling us about it.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.520]  Now briefly, look, let's just say it like this. You talk to people in the industry and
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.240]  they say, we can't believe what you're doing because they put a bunch of junk into something
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:33.840]  for comparatively way more pricing. We can go over some products that just my dermatologist
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:38.600]  friend said, this is absurd. For example, you have just silica, which is one of the ingredients
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.320]  in this, one of the ingredients we have hit the labels taken off. Obviously $28 for just
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.640]  one of the ingredients we have. We have 14 different ingredients proprietary formula.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:52.560]  I mean, it's endless amounts of information. You're showing what you get from a dermatologist.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:53.560]  Yes.
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:59.880]  Where, where, where just one ingredient the same does is, is, is more $28 to $35.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.080]  Then what we've got Charlie Daniels. He's always offended the second amendment.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:08.720]  Let me just read a little thing here from McKinsey 21. Individual rise of architecture
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:12.680]  backseat to the collective. We're, you know, the next move is going to be, don't you? It's
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680]  going to be coming up to you. Good.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:19.680]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag and beef was for supper. Revelation,
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:25.920]  dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available. Want to shed

[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.040]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:09.400]  and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:13.800]  an open fire, then there's a much better way. The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.360]  burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.520]  Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the

[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.120]  From the pages of the Bible comes a terrifying account of an ancient beast that was half
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:41.040]  man, half demon. It is returned in a best selling novel, Nephilim by L.A. Marzulli. Indiegogo

[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:08.960]  Now coming up when I start the next hour, I'm going to get into will Hillary break? Will
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:15.360]  Hillary drop out as all this indictment news comes out and reports of sex slaves and children
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:22.080]  all connected to this new probe in New York with the expansion of Wienergate and just
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:26.120]  all the massing total proof that she lied to Congress and lied to everybody else and
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:31.720]  was the paper play was much, much worse. They've got her. They've got her. But are they crazy
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:37.120]  enough? This is so historic and so dangerous. Are they crazy enough to start a war or civil
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.760]  unrest? I mean, who knows? We're four days out. It's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.560]  It is totally insane. And it is the products we sell here that have funded this independent
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.720]  organization. This is not the model of more independent media to just direct sell the
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:57.160]  public. And that's what other Liberty organizations should just do. I suggest bypass advertising
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.080]  all together, bring folks really high quality products that you develop or we just private
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:04.320]  label. It's already a best seller. We've kind of done that with this. We've got all the
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:08.400]  best sellers, the highest quality organic companies. That's kind of my model. Like
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.480]  like knockout is nine different known compounds, Valerian root, L-trip to fan, melatonin. The
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:20.440]  dose in it of melatonin is the dose that in most bottles is 1995. And then you get eight
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:25.960]  other compounds in it. I mean, that's crazy because they mark stuff up five to seven times.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.760]  We don't do that. So Anthony, it's FTC and other laws. We have to cover up competitors'
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.240]  names and labels. We're not supposed to show them. We show ours. Okay, whatever. Everybody
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.960]  knows this. Go over what's in our product versus all the stuff people have to take to
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.960]  get the same thing.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.760]  Well, it's by a PCA. It's the hair and nails formula, but it's so much more than that.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:46.240]  And as always, you know, you can only say certain things about the products. But like
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.360]  I was talking about people in the industry, we talk to them all the time, heads of major
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.960]  manufacturing companies and things like that. And they're always saying like, you're girlfriends
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:56.920]  and as a tissue, she can't believe what a good, right. And I have a good dermatologist friend
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:00.920]  too. He was showing me some of these. I mean, for example, this has Biden, which was one
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:04.340]  of the best for hair and nails. I mean, it's just proven over and over again to grow and
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:05.640]  strengthen the nails, et cetera.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.640]  But we're under attack and infowars life is all about fighting back. And when you take
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:14.920]  a shower, it is literally giving toxic junk in your skin. It's messing with your hair.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.120]  The shampoo you use is junk. It's all just crap. Okay. And it's time to actually fight
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.560]  back and do something about it. And we put the best stuff in here. It's a proprietary
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:28.240]  formula with collagen, enzymes, biotin, vitamins, zinc, orate, the best forms of it. But there's
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:33.720]  10,000 as comparison, 10,000 micrograms of biotin in this, right? In two pills. Now,
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:39.480]  let's compare. This is a $48 product a dermatologist will sell and it only has 3000 micrograms
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.920]  of biotin. Okay. So it's about four times like industry tells us they go, hey, nobody
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:49.120]  does what you do. They just do marketing. I'm like, why not really have bad ass supplements?
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:53.360]  Exactly. And I mean, I want, I treat you like I want to be treated. People say they're
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.960]  superstitious. I'm not superstitious about broken mirrors or Friday the 13th. I'm superstitious
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.800]  about, I better treat you like I want to be treated. I better tell you everything I'm
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.960]  up to. It's got a hundred percent markup or this one's a little bit less when it's this
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.120]  kind of like, it's 50% right now. But the point is we're funding our operation. That's
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:14.480]  enough. Something profits bad. It's that I just don't get seven times markup being the
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:20.360]  average and then giving people crap. Well, and it's, and it's way less than his 48 bucks
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.520]  and ours is not, that's one ingredient. Look, this is also the dermatologist said, well,
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.440]  if you got to look at this other stuff, silica, which is what we have from bamboo extract,
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.920]  a lot of it synthetic junk, $35. This is just one ingredient in our product. They're selling
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:37.800]  it for 35 bucks. And this is a top seller. Okay. So look, we're not going to screw people.
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.800]  So this is more than just the product itself also, which is great. And we're not even differentiating.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:46.000]  I can't believe the industry's like this. And this is from people that have told me
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.800]  that they just can't help. They just can't help. They just can't help but put only a
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:53.960]  little bit and then weigh over charge because they make more money. Instead of just saying,
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.480]  I want to give them the best price I can and then dominate and then get all the sales.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.320]  Exactly. Which I didn't even do from a greedy position. I always put out my videos for free.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:03.640]  Always said, you can make copies. People said, oh, that's really smart marketing.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.920]  That's why you went so viral. I didn't think that I want to do exposed stuff,
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:09.720]  but that's why we were successful. They just don't get it, Anthony.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.080]  And why not support something meaningful you believe in, right? It doesn't mean you have to
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:17.080]  agree 100% with everything Infowars does, but why not actually spend as much as you're going to
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:21.480]  spend on Starbucks to do something that's actually real. And then there are other supplement
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:24.360]  companies out there. And that's where we get probably level from that really do sell you super
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:27.880]  high. Yeah, of course. There's other great stuff out there. And then they mark up 150%. We mark up
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:32.280]  100. And that's how we dominate the market. I mean, take Chaldea. That's been around 30 years.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.440]  It's a top product, you know, under another name. So little foods. We just discounted
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:41.880]  InfowarsLives.com. Get the new product by OPCA hair and nails formula or triple eight,
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.160]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, a few more minutes on this. And I'm going to get into the
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:52.600]  latest developments while I tell you this, this is huge. Dr. Group, you develop living defense
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:57.400]  for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:03.000]  up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:09.080]  put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:14.440]  parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:20.600]  now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:23.880]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:29.400]  in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.800]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:38.120]  because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense InfowarsLife.com
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:43.240]  and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body period. And you support the
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:47.960]  broadcast. InfowarsLife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:56.040]  for all your work, sir, on this great product. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:07.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:17.480]  So civilization is based on win-win. Conquest is based on conquest. But after you sack the city
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:23.000]  in a couple of days, there's no cool fountains. There's no cool hot baths. There's no cool,
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:28.760]  you know, restaurants. There's no cool, you know, temples. There's nothing.
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.960]  You've wrecked the civilization. Okay, you sacked it. You took control of it. You're like cancer.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:39.080]  You killed it. And we've always had a balance. It's not a good balance, but there's always been
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:44.280]  a balance between tyranny and liberty, between renaissance and conquest. And the globalists
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.440]  claimed, oh, we're bringing in the end of conquest. We're going to domesticate you. We're going to,
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:53.320]  it's the opposite. That's just so they can prey on us and have the ultimate conquest over the species.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:59.640]  The globalists acting like they're aliens or something. I mean, this is the craziest mental
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.840]  illness I've ever seen. But of course, you look at the elites. They have the most unhappy kids,
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:08.920]  highest rates of suicide. They're not happy. It's blowing back on them. They think they're insulated
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:15.000]  from pissing on everybody. No, it's like at every level, how much are you getting screwed, right?
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.320]  At every level, if you think about the reality of it, someone goes to, we're talking about health,
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.080]  so we'll get into this for a second. Someone goes to a store and I just saw, I was at CVS to the
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:28.600]  day, I saw someone checking out with a bowl of like ramen noodles and a Miller light. Okay.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:32.040]  And then they say, oh, what are you up to? And he goes, this is my dinner.
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:37.160]  And it was like a dollar. Okay. Now, these people want to save money. People buy cheap stuff, right?
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:41.240]  But guess what? It's the corporations and government bodies that allow the absolute junk
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:45.400]  to be in it in the first place. They actually worry that to lower the quality of everything
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.320]  so you don't recognize and demand quality. And they write white papers admitting it. Here's
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.880]  a perfect example. In the 60s, the McDonald's con artist, there's a movie coming out about him.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.040]  He said, we won't need people to clean up. We'll just put thank you and peer pressure,
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:03.000]  throw your thing away, claiming it keeps prices down. Instead, it stops entry-level people
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.480]  and creates a culture where everything's dirty and falling apart. It's the same deal. We get
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:12.680]  what we demand. We take care of old people. We hire 10 people. We don't not take care of grandma
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:16.840]  and then hire 10 people like Bill Gates says. He says, kill grandma. We'll hire 10 teachers.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:20.680]  Bull crap. A guy that wants to kill your grandmother ain't going to take care of you.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:25.640]  You dumb moron. Not kept side your head. Exactly. It's like being honorable is what
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.200]  actually happens and actually grows society. Being honorable builds incredible civilizations
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:34.360]  and empowering. But then it creates spoiled brats. Yeah. So how do you fix that paradox?
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:37.560]  Well, I don't know how to fix paradox because the whole concept is now like,
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:42.200]  look, it used to be, we've talked about this before. Okay, you had to hunt for your food and
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:45.720]  you had to like go out and kill bears and defend yourself and build villages. Those were noble
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:49.800]  people. And now it's like you're offended on Twitter and that's just as big of a deal to
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.040]  most people, right? So it's like we've, as we've progressed so deeply and so greatly,
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:58.600]  we've also fallen into complete just a shell of our family. As we have more information than ever.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.240]  Yeah. The average trendy says there's no world government because, because NPR said so. I think
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:08.760]  it's because we believe in this lie. I think we believe in the lie that basically, you know,
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:14.040]  it turns into a, it's like a farm, right? Instead of like actually cultivating ideas and growing
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:18.920]  things. It's, it's true that people are actually now more treat like cattle because as we have this
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:23.480]  wealth and rich society, whatever you want to call it, which is all kind of in shambles now too,
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.560]  it's whoever is the most screwed up, can dominate it. It's whoever is the most corrupt,
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.800]  whoever wants to milk the most people and like screw over everybody. But then we have someone
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.440]  like Hillary Clinton, who's the epitome and embodiment of all of that. And somehow, and then
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:40.760]  she lectures us how we're greedy and bad because we want to build companies and hire people, but
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:46.440]  we're bad for even talking about her issues and her crimes, her true crimes. She's a woman. And
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:50.360]  again, they try that thing briefly because I got you in a plug this, this really, even so excited
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.960]  about this last year developing and getting with all the big organic producers coming out with
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:59.880]  one of the biggest, you know, private organic firms in the country makes this. I mean, I'm
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:06.600]  really proud of this product. If somebody wants the ultimate hair, nails, skin formula, bio, PCA,
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:11.800]  1995, I thought it was $39.95. I mean, at least we're going to discount it down to $29.95.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:15.080]  Yeah, we actually have an introductory pricing right now, $19.95 because...
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.040]  So that's all, I keep saying I have a hundred percent market. That's not even 50%.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:21.880]  No, no, it's because... So this is an introductory, you're the one running all this stuff. So all
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:26.520]  this is the epitome of everything you just said. Instead of screwing people over, instead of giving
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:29.960]  them junk, we're going to give them the actual best stuff for the lowest prices. It's not BS,
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.720]  it's not, it's not some scam thing like, oh, we're going to lowest prices. It's the real deal.
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:36.440]  And that's why we're impassioned about it. And that's where... Well, that's our religion.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:40.120]  Yeah. And then we want you to go show this to dermatologists and people around you. They're
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:44.520]  going to go, what the hell? This was $19.95 because I thought we had a hundred percent
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:49.720]  markup at $39 and we're going off to $29. I didn't know. I missed... You guys went to $19.95?
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:53.480]  Yeah. Okay. Well, okay. Well, this is like almost at cost, folks. So it's a loss leader
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:57.960]  introduction. We're so excited about it. Infowarslife.com. Thank you, Anthony. That's amazing.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.720]  Thank you. Well, how long is it going to last though?
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:06.520]  New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors are working on an alleged under
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:12.280]  age sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner. And they have turned over a
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:19.320]  newly found laptop that he shared with his wife, Uma Abedine, to the FBI. True pundit is reporting
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:25.480]  that there is enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew away for life. The NYPD
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:31.400]  sees the computer from Anthony Weiner during a search warrant and sources now say that emails
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:38.120]  from the laptop link Hillary Clinton herself to a host of crimes that include money laundering,
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:45.080]  burgery, obstruction of justice, child exploitation, sex crimes with children, pay to play through the
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:52.280]  Clinton Foundation, and of course, more classified top secret breaches. Well, it sounds like bad news
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:57.240]  for crooked Hillary. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:22.520]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:28.040]  Well, one of the best parts of having this job is they get to talk to great Americans like
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:33.320]  Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer, who still advises Congress and does a lot of other things
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:41.400]  that are obviously not public, but it's just a super patriot who, back after 9-11, testified to
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:45.960]  Congress in private and then also in public about how there was a stand-down to not kill
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.600]  bin Laden and 9-11 stand-down basically. And Sybil Evans came out and backed up what he said. He
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:54.440]  went through a lot. They tried to prosecute him. They tried to be false. He smiled with the whole
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:59.320]  thing. Never really complained. He's a best-selling author. And he day one, along with our other
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:03.320]  sources, he didn't give us classified info, but he pointed us where to look. He got a lot of heat for
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:08.360]  that. He came out and exposed what really happened at Benghazi and what he said four years ago
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.720]  here on the broadcast. It turned out to be dead on. So we'll give you his website, his Twitter,
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:21.080]  his Facebook, and more. But he's just one of the visible patriots who ran the Army-wide program
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:29.880]  against al-Qaeda. He's one of the visible people, like an iceberg tip, out there in the different
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:34.840]  military groups and the different agencies that are patriots. And I've always said our
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:39.240]  governments are biggest problem and our best asset in that America's still there.
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:43.640]  Bill of Rights is still there. Good people are still there. It's special interest of hijacked
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.880]  the country. They're the problem. But on average, it's our military. I'm not lionizing them. It's
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:52.360]  just a fact that is the most awakened aware of what's happening. And it's our military that said
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:57.240]  no to backing ISIS in al-Qaeda. They've now basically forced a program to engage them and
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.880]  they're being defeated. A lot of that's, you know, super secret and it's very, very fluid. But
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:05.240]  we have seen the chairman of the Joint Chief come out and say, we could put up an un-fly zone,
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:10.280]  but that'll cause World War III. So we've got a lot of jockeying going on with Obama and Hillary
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:14.440]  with the election four days out. I appreciate him coming on to tell us as much as he can that as
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:19.880]  he classified off open source of, because I get really concerned that they might pull something
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:25.080]  as a distraction with this election. They might, they've been saber-rattling with Russia, who I
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:29.400]  know, four years after he told us about it. Psy Hirsch, Pulitzer Prize winner came out and was
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:34.200]  military to military, was the headline in the London Review of Books and the Newarker Magazine
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:40.920]  about how our military didn't engage in mutiny and just ignored Obama and Hillary and just did not
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:46.360]  aid ISIS in al-Qaeda and gave Russia the intel. Obama was faced to get behind it after he was
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:51.240]  embarrassed. This is unprecedented. Talk about books should be written. No one really knows about
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:55.480]  this. So Colonel Schaefer has been at the heart of this from the beginning. He doesn't like to
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.960]  say that. He doesn't want the attention because they come after him. But again, he's one of those
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:05.480]  people like you talk about with Steve Pacinac, Dr. Pacinac coming out and speaking out about
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:11.560]  the soft counter coup against the globalists trying to take over this country. So my friend,
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:15.400]  good to have you on. I appreciate all you've done. Well, Alex, thank you for having me. It's good.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:21.480]  Always an honor to speak to you. And look, you're spot on. I think there are patriots amongst us
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:26.520]  who are trying to do the best they can. And ironically, as you mentioned, regarding able danger,
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:31.960]  yes, those who serve in a project have quietly gone back into service and are doing everything
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.680]  they can to protect the country. I'm one of those like they, they, I don't believe there's an
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.920]  expiration date on our oath of office. And I think once you take that oath, it's kind of a
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:46.200]  commitment to life and for life. And you've got to take it seriously. And to your point, I was over
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:52.120]  since we last spoke, I was over in England at University of Warwick on a panel and something
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:57.560]  they call Question Time with Suzanne Evans, by the way, who's the spokesman for the Brexit movement.
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:03.080]  And one of the notable things about my visit there and about the whole Brexit situations,
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:09.240]  I think there are some deep parallels that resulted from the Brexit vote and the people
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:14.840]  of England saying enough is enough of this global, global idea and lack of accountability.
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:21.080]  We don't believe we should be, you know, ruled by people on the continent who are not accountable
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:26.840]  to our needs. So I'd like to believe that the very thing you said is that there's an effort for
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:34.920]  people to recognize that their freedoms, their ideals, the culture we live in, where we teach
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:40.680]  independent thought, independent action, but accountability of action is being lost in this
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:46.280]  larger attempt to establish essentially a global perspective on everything. And I think, again,
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:54.360]  the Brexit issue, the Brexit vote went in the way of the independent minded. And I think we are now
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:01.160]  facing a very similar set of choices between Ms. Clinton, who is clearly pro-open borders,
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:06.120]  pro-world government, lack of accountability. I mean, I don't know of anyone who's been less
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:12.200]  accountable in their entire life than Ms. Clinton versus Donald Trump, who I think is actually as
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:18.200]  someone who's actually had to be someone who's worked, who's developed, who's seen results
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:24.760]  from his own sweat equity and has actually, you know, his success is ingrained, is built into
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:29.880]  the landscape of New York, Washington and yeah, America. So there's a very clear choice here
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:32.440]  to be made. And I think it's one of the American people must make very careful.
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:38.920]  Now, looking at this, you obviously bucked the system early on to expose what happened
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:43.560]  and we're able to survive it most can't. You were trailblazer in that. Looking now,
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:49.480]  I was told a week before this latest FBI probe by a former high level CIA operative,
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.800]  I'll just leave it at that, but even beyond that, even deep state. And they said watch,
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:57.880]  it's going to be reopened. The FBI is in rebellion. We already knew that, but he said watch the next
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.920]  week it happened. He said then watch what happens with the NYPD. And with this whole situation
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.880]  with Wiener, it ties into Epstein. And I'm seeing it all happening quite frankly. I don't say it's
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:14.120]  frightening, but to really realize this isn't talk. This is a real move by patriots to let
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:18.200]  Hillary and the globalists know, look, you better watch out, we're going to bring everything out.
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.840]  And I'm told there's even worse stuff they're about to bring out. So I'm just wondering what
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:27.080]  these globalists that have hijacked the country are going to do when they're faced down
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.320]  by people that aren't scared of them and are basically calling their bluff. I mean, because
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:35.480]  this is just what I'm told is there is a literal war going on inside the government right now.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.880]  And people that told me this, I'm now seeing it manifest. I mean, it's confirmed.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:44.200]  Well, Alex, you know, we talked about this our last interview with my book talking about this
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:49.080]  very issue four years ago that it was coming. So yeah, I think several groups, and I'm not
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:53.080]  unique. I mean, I'm one of the folks I think I picked up on this trend early, that there's a great
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:15:03.240]  deal of people who have recognized this slow boiling frog effect of the loss of our rights,
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:09.000]  this overabundance of taxation, this overabundance of control. And look, I don't know if your audience
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.840]  is aware of this. I actually have a degree in environmental studies. I'm one of the few conservatives
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.160]  who actually has taken the time to study what the left puts out regarding climate change and
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.320]  that sort of thing. And it's a complete grab of control. It's all about grabbing control,
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:27.160]  not saving humanity. So I think there's been a movement behind the scenes, both at the large
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:31.240]  level and the small level of people who have taken the oath of office and are taking their
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:39.080]  responsibilities very seriously. So to your point regarding NYPD, regarding the Federal Bureau of
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:44.280]  Investigations work, other things behind the scenes, there are a lot of people who know exactly
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:51.720]  what's going on. And Alex, this WikiLeaks thing, this ain't the Russians. I think people start,
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.640]  you know, Judge Napolitano, my friend Judge Napolitano did a video which I'll refer to you
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:01.240]  all to look at where he talks about, he believes that the source of all this is actually retired
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.720]  members of our own government. Well, I've been told by William Benny six months ago,
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:09.240]  the former head of technical and I say that he knows that's the case. Now the former British
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:13.320]  ambassador was at a meeting in the U.S. and was actually told to get it. So I mean, I know we
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.440]  don't want to actually let out who's done it because I've talked to folks who actually know who,
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:20.280]  but let me bring this up because why, and I'm not saying this because you were in the Army or in
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:27.000]  the Army and the other services are great, but why is it over and over again, the Army in this
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.360]  whole internal deal seems to be the main group resisting the globalist takeover. I mean, out of
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:37.720]  all the groups doing it, it does seem to be the Army and then also Defense Intelligence as a whole
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:44.200]  and General Flynn are at the heart of this resistance. Well, you know, I gotta tell you,
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.200]  it's not just the Army. I think the Marines are behind this a lot more than people acknowledge.
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:53.080]  The Marines are a little bit smaller and they're doing what they can, but absolutely.
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:59.880]  Right. So I think what we've seen here is that let me speak philosophically for a moment.
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:06.840]  Warriors truly seek not to go to war. I think we are all very reluctant, especially those who have
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:13.640]  seen the havoc and death which comes both to innocent and guilty and war. And so I think
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:18.920]  all of us have recognized the need to try to forego and prevent conflict rather than embrace it.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:24.760]  And once you've come to that as an understanding, you see politicians like Hillary Clinton who are
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:29.480]  the first to try to use the military for purposes of political gain. And then she makes jokes about
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:36.280]  it. Absolutely. So I think you see both the brother-in-arms concept of all of us who have come
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:43.960]  through this trial by fire, working to establish work which I believe is in the best interest of
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:48.280]  the American people. I'm sorry, Ms. Clinton does not speak for the American people. She does not
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:55.800]  speak for working together. She actually works to be very divisive, very dismissive as well,
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.840]  of the idea of doing the right thing for the American people. So I think you see this as like
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:09.720]  a tide, a tide of concern, a group of concerned military officers who have always recognized
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:15.480]  it is our responsibility to defend the country. And let me say this in parallel. Both the Egyptian
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:22.360]  military and the Pakistani military have been essentially set aside and designed to be the
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:29.000]  protectors of those constitutions. The Egyptians, as we saw, have defended their government several
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.520]  times against the extremists. I mean, they removed President Morsi from power because he was...
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:39.800]  And that's my next point. Why would Hillary and Obama on record and CNN all back, the Muslim
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.120]  brother of the especially al-Qaeda light, to blow up hundreds of churches, to attack the government,
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:49.560]  to destroy their economy? Why would we remove our allies there? What is behind this?
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.400]  Well, that's an excellent question. I just came out of a meeting. I'm literally in the same room
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.800]  as in the meeting regarding the Muslim brother as being a primary topic. Look, the Muslim brother
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:03.560]  is a terrorist organization. I met with the Egyptian chief of intelligence, General Alto Hemi
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:10.040]  on this back in 2013. And Alex, he made the point brilliantly that the Muslim brotherhood is not
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:16.200]  simply an Egyptian problem. It is a global problem. And they are the underlying foundation for al-Qaeda
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:20.120]  and ISIS and other extremist groups. They simply... That's right. They're the recruiting and funding
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:24.120]  arm. They're the main group from my research. You're the world expert. Aren't they the main group
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:28.840]  behind the invasion of Africa? Yeah, absolutely. They are doing everything they can to destabilize
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:34.920]  central government. So when we recognize this, and when you see Ms. Clinton and Mr. Obama warming
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:39.560]  up to them, you need to ask the hard questions. We've asked these hard questions. Members of
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:44.680]  Congress, I deal with my friend Louis Gohmert all the time on this. Louis is completely correct
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:50.280]  in his assessment that there are issues that we have to defend and work that are literally...
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:56.440]  Sure. Let's expand on that. I mean, Google brags that five years ago, they helped quarterback with
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:03.240]  the intelligence, with the electronic signals to manipulate and fund the Arab Spring and launch
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:07.720]  it. So who are the elements in our government? I know you know this. I'd like you to talk about it.
[02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:12.120]  That are actually behind a Muslim brotherhood takeover the Middle East ally with Saudi Arabia.
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:18.280]  What type of insane group does that? One of the most insane things I know directly is that
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:22.760]  this guy named Jim Clapper, the director of national intelligence, actually opened an office of
[02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:28.280]  outreach within the ODI. Now, think about this, Alex. The office of the central office of our
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:33.560]  intelligence community opens an office of outreach to work with them. That's how insane this got.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:38.120]  And Mike Flynn, our friend Mike, we've talked about this. Mike has publicly acknowledged that he was
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:44.600]  ordered to send arms into Syria to help arm the elements which were supposed to be resisting
[02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:49.480]  and helping remove President Assad from power. But it turned out that those arms went to
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:52.840]  Muslim brotherhood and other elements which were the precursors of ISIS.
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:58.360]  So again, and Mike did not do this willingly. He did it as he was ordered to do it. So I think
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:05.720]  if you just simply, Alex, if you simply look at the facts without emotion, there's a very clear
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:12.200]  leaning in support by our government for an organization which we know to be terrorist
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:16.440]  related and declared a terrorist organization by multiple Middle Eastern countries.
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:20.520]  And that was the breaking point four years ago for our military, as you said, across the board,
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:24.920]  the Marines, the army, you name it. And out of that, now we see the overall resistance,
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:28.600]  the attempt to bring these people into our country. What is the point of bringing 5 million
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:33.400]  into Europe, hundreds of thousands into the U.S.? Hillary wants a 550 percent increase.
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:37.720]  Why would we bring an 80 percent military age man from the most unstable places in the world?
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:42.600]  Well, two reasons. I mean, she has said publicly, Ms. Clinton said to the public,
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:47.720]  she really admires Angela Merkel. Well, what does that tell you? Ms. Merkel is responsible
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:53.560]  for destabilizing Germany in a country that did not have the capacity. She brought in a million
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:59.160]  plus refugees, immigrants, I call them immigrants. This is actually a migration, Alex. This is
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:06.040]  exactly. And now Germany is destabilized. I mean, it is not the country it was just three years ago
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.920]  because of this onslaught. So what does that tell you? If Ms. Clinton is saying, I want to do the
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:15.640]  same thing as Angela Merkel has done, that's, that's what she intends to do. She's not bluffing.
[02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:19.720]  She's not speaking politically. So what is the end game of the socialist? They just have such a
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:24.520]  hatred for the West. They think, hey, it'll be fun. Let's bring in Europe wide, 5 million jihadis.
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:31.160]  That's what's going to happen. And it does two things. First, it then gives the government
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:36.760]  more authority to, quote, unquote, do security. Oh my goodness, you, you're weird and insecure.
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:43.000]  We have to protect you. So Alex, it's a, it's a, it's a version of the, of the, uh, that disease
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.800]  where you injure your kids and then you want to be the one who solves them. It's the, uh,
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:53.560]  moonshows at my proxy done at the international level. So what happens is you create this
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:58.360]  underclass who will always vote for you. You, these people come in, their gratitude is going
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:02.600]  to be what the party brings them in the Democrats. You then, by that, by doing it, you create this
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:08.600]  permanent underclass and then at the same time you're creating chaos to the level that requires
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:14.040]  government intervention. It requires DHS to expand its powers. It requires the government to call for
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:20.040]  the federalization of local police forces. It actually does a number of things they seek to do.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:24.120]  Exactly. So the radical Muslim threat is real, but, but liberal governments are bringing them in
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:27.640]  as the false flag to then take control of society. Now I've been asking the questions,
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:30.440]  we've only got five minutes left. And Carol Schaefer, you're the real expert on what's
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:34.040]  happening globally. What is your gut level and what's the other intel you've got on this election?
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:38.760]  Trump's ahead in all the battlegrounds, the real polls, they're doing oversampling of nine to 20
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:42.680]  points on average, about 12 for Hillary. I'm not just saying this as wishful thinking,
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:47.160]  looks like a landslide for Trump. Even on the electoral college, Democrats don't like her,
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:52.040]  but she's still confident. We've got evidence of election fraud coming in. What are your concerns
[02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:57.320]  about the election and other points? There's been study put forth the last couple of days about how
[02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:02.440]  there's only been 31 instances of people being caught voting illegally. Alex, that's completely
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:07.080]  a false premise. If people don't have IDs, how do you verify if there's been fraud or not? It's
[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:10.920]  not possible. You, the reference group you're going to, it's not going to voluntarily tell you,
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:14.920]  yeah, I didn't have an ID and I voted twice. It's not possible to determine.
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:19.560]  There's zero enforcement. The Democrats admit they want emails to vote.
[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:24.200]  Exactly. So, so this is the other issue. So I think there's, there's a great potential for that.
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.760]  My advice to your audience, use paper ballots. Make sure that you have a record, a hard copy
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:33.480]  record. I've been putting this out to everybody I talked to. Go, go the old-fashioned way until
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:37.160]  we can get the system fixed because there's all sorts of electronic manipulation that can happen.
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:40.680]  There's been instances I've seen where people push a button and it votes from the candidate. So,
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:46.920]  buy or beware. Secondly, regarding the trend, look, a lot of friends of mine who have followed
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:54.280]  election trends for a long time see the shaping up just like the Carter Reagan run in 1980.
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:59.960]  A lot of the same dynamics are now at play. And clearly Carter was seen as an establishment
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:04.120]  candidate. He was, and there was a big backlash against the establishment candidate. And clearly
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:09.560]  Trump is a big backlash against the establishment, which is, I think, overdue. So I think if things
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:14.840]  run the way, I think others have predicted them and I tend to agree with these views. I think we
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.320]  would maybe be seeing 1980 all over again right now. I agree. In the four minutes we've got left,
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.000]  I know you're not even trying to pitch your book, but let's go back to it. It came out a few years
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.480]  ago. I read it where you, because I know you can't put obviously classified stuff in a non-fiction
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:31.880]  book. I'm not saying you did that with this book, but I tell you, wow, did it come true? How in the
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:35.480]  world did you write that book? Because four years ago, I mean, none of this was even on the radar
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:42.760]  for me at least. Well, there's two things. First, Alex, I saw, as many did, this rising Mexican
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:48.040]  nationalism, which was attempting to essentially say that, hey, there's no difference from the
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.000]  American of Mexico. We should, and by the way, there's this thing called the Zapatistas, this
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:01.160]  movement that calls for the return of the Southwest border states to Mexico. So I've seen, I saw that
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:05.320]  as a potential weak point within our own thinking that people aren't thinking this thing through,
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:10.840]  but I see these immigrants, these migrants coming in demonstrating that they have no respect for
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:16.360]  our culture, for our flag. And that was something I just noted as someone who studies trends and
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:23.000]  threats. So I put that together with some of what we've seen happen regarding this globalist attitude,
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.080]  you know, the certain place that you visited. I watched with greater music when I wrote the book
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:33.160]  regarding meetings of the elites and having certain ideas of what they think is best.
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:37.400]  And you put that together with some of the other things that I know have gone on in other places.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:41.800]  We turn it into a work of fiction. But with that said, we, everything in that book is,
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.720]  has elements of the truth embedded. It's just we've rearranged it for purposes of both good
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:50.120]  reading, but also as a warning. So that was why I wrote the book, Alex. I told you at the time,
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.360]  I think you were a bit skeptical, but I said, look, this is supposed to be a warning to the
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.120]  American people that there are things that could happen that they need to be aware of.
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:01.400]  And that was my interest. You know, I don't have a lot of time to write fiction, as you know,
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:05.720]  I'm very busy doing real things. So when I, when I write something, I tend to do it for purposes
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:11.720]  of, of informing. And frankly, you and I both know the best way to inform sometimes is to entertain.
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:14.760]  I agree. I'm not going to say skeptical. We know a few years ago and we talked about it.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:17.240]  It's not that I didn't believe what you were saying was accurate. It's just,
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:23.000]  it's so crazy that the elite run the US and they run Europe. Why do they want to wreck it
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.760]  if they're already in charge, but they fundamentally don't like what it stands for. They want to
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:35.400]  mount the head on the wall. It's really a very, I don't know, vandalistic. What do you call it?
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:40.040]  Psychologically, I think it's, it's, it's something that they didn't create. And,
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:44.440]  and therefore they want to destroy for purposes of reestablishing it in their own image. I mean,
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:52.840]  it's a very ego, ego driven, very, very egocentric, dare I say, narcissistic point of view. I, you
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:57.240]  know, this is why you see President Obama apologizing for the good, the America of America's
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:02.440]  then over the past 200 years. That's why you see Ms Clinton saying that, Hey, we're doing okay being
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.600]  number two. Really? Well, let me tell you something. You know, as much as you and I agree, I don't
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:11.480]  believe in aggressive war. There are things we stand for as a nation, which are, is the, is the
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.640]  gold standard regardless. They're the ones launching all the illegal wars that aren't right. They're
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:19.240]  the ones, and here's the deal. America's got a lot of problems, but you look at the history,
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:24.680]  we have been exceptional because of the liberty and freedom. We need to expand that. And so they
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:29.480]  sit and then they're the ones that are the worst managers ever. And then they, and then they blame
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:34.600]  America for what they've done. It's incredible. Right. Absolutely. That's the point is that
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:39.240]  they have gone to do everything they can to diminish our role, our leadership, and frankly,
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:45.480]  being a guide poster beacon of how to live. My close friend, Bruce Fine, has talked about how
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:50.600]  we should, should be an example. We wish to help people emulate, not an example. We wish to inflict
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:55.400]  on others. And this is where we differ with, with the, with Hillary and the neocons, some of the
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:59.480]  folks, they wish to go on and invade and somehow believe, you know, going into Libya, removing
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:03.880]  Gaddafi is going to, you're going to see democracy spring forth. It's not possible. Any culture has
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:08.280]  to make a deal with him, have him come out of the dark, democratize and then kill him.
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:12.920]  The dishonor is making the deal and setting him up. If you want to knock him out, do it.
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:17.320]  Don't, don't make a deal and stab him in the back. And exactly what happened. So
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:21.400]  this is one of those things I like to think we would agree upon. We as Americans have a great
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:25.640]  society based on the fact that we have, as you said, what makes this exceptional is the fact
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:30.040]  we have individual liberty. We have the ability to think for ourselves. And I think that's what
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:34.280]  we should be seeking to help others seek that for themselves and encouraging it. We cannot
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:37.800]  give it away. That's right. We're out of time. Thank you for the time. Tony dash shaver.com,
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:41.960]  find all his books online, Twitter, Facebook and more. Thank you so much. We really appreciate
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:46.360]  you, sir. We'll find out about the election soon and talk to you after that. We'll be back with
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:50.280]  the latest election news straight ahead. Powerful interview. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:57.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:05.480]  We're read on election day. Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:09.800]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election
[02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:14.440]  fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications to government leaders
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:18.600]  providing fast track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes. This is happening right in
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:23.000]  front of us. Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee,
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.240]  Donald Trump. Government chills are campaigning for Clinton. Mainstream news attacking Donald
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:32.120]  Trump all day like rabbit hounds, rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:36.120]  that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump. Fake
[02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:40.840]  celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms. So with all this, what are we doing to keep this
[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:45.400]  election from being stolen? What can we do to prevent election fraud? I propose that all Donald
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:49.480]  Trump supporters wear red on election day. On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote
[02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:53.960]  Donald Trump, be decked out in red. This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can
[02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:58.760]  prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout. Wear red on election day and
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:04.040]  make America great again. Brain force, it's completely different. Cry a bottle of it.
[02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:09.800]  Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force did.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:14.120]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:18.520]  at 8 30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:22.120]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right
[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:26.840]  there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:32.600]  clears up. Four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party

[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:41.560]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a
[02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:45.880]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:51.160]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find

[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.560]  I'm sure you got the report back on the response. Knock them dead.
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:13.640]  We got a lot coming up today, ladies and gentlemen. A lot to cover. A lot to break down.
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:19.560]  You know, I can just tell you this right now. Again, our military's done a lot of evil stuff.
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:22.840]  The government's done bad things, but that's what government's doing. We're not defending it.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:30.440]  But the military is so awake, it is crazy. It is absolutely crazy. I was talking to
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:39.240]  some of the UFC fighters that met with Trump out in Albuquerque when he came out there,
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:41.880]  gave a speech and was hanging out with some of the folks that were doing the
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:48.440]  pre-fight stuff with Tim Kennedy and some of the former UFC champions people were out there.
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:53.560]  And it's just all info wars. We had a crew member reporter out there. We've got all this footage.
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:00.600]  We've got James Donner fighting the former world champion, heavyweight female. That's on
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:04.760]  video. That's like super viral. They don't let anybody get her on tape. She let us have this
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:08.680]  footage. We've got so much stuff. It'll make your heads be saying, oh, why don't we hear about that?
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:14.280]  Because we get into the sports world and we wake up all the folks that are there who wouldn't be
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:19.480]  tuned into what's happening. It's not the sports are bad. You just can't make that the final thing
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:25.000]  that your whole life's about. But we jack into the matrix to get people that are in sports and wake
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.240]  them up on Liberty issues. That's why somebody like a Tim Kennedy is going for the championship
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:33.640]  is because then he can reach out to people with the message of Liberty. That's why you do this
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:39.960]  is because in this modern Rome, that's how you actually get to people. Now, I've got a bunch
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:46.600]  of stuff I want to get to, but Kit Dales just ran here with a new article. Cataclysm 2016,
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:54.920]  Cubs win, Brexit point to Trump victory. And I've been trying to think of the Cubs who have
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:58.760]  been with the World Series and forever. I don't claim to know the factoids on this.
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:04.440]  But I know this is the hottest thing right now is the Cubs and the election. And I'm trying to
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:08.680]  think of an angle to hijack this because I've done this before and like had, you know, videos with
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:13.640]  5 million, 10 million views when I hijacked a sports thing. So I'm going to ask the whole crew.
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:22.120]  I was asking Rob Duelastani came over for dinner with kids, my kids, his wife. How do I hijack the
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:25.960]  Cubs? Because I don't know for the New York Times says I'm going to physically do it. I mean,
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:29.960]  how do I hijack the Cubs? Are they in their final game tonight or something? I haven't even followed
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:34.120]  it. What is it? Is it over? Is it still going? I mean,
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:41.880]  well, they won the World Series. See, I don't even know this.
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:47.960]  My son's like, dad, please turn on the World Series. And I said, no, we're not turning the
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:52.360]  TV on because that's, you know, I mean, in fact, I'm proud of the fact that I didn't know this. See,
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:59.080]  people say, oh my God, this guy's an idiot. He doesn't know the Cubs just won the World Series.
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:02.280]  I know Bill Murray went to the White House two weeks ago. I was talking about them going to
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:07.880]  the World Series. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm concerned about globalists that want my guns. Now, I'll
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:13.160]  be honest, I pull out of the movie producer used to live in Austin and back when the Red Sox went
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:16.920]  again, because I like baseball, I played baseball in middle school and high school,
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.040]  but I'm either in it or I'm not. I did watch the World Series and I almost bought tickets to go
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.560]  see it. So see, I kind of like, I've either got to totally turn it off or I've got to totally get
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:36.360]  into it. I mean, does that make sense, Matt? Totally makes sense. All right, so I sound like
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:42.040]  I'm getting it here. Cataclysm 2016 Cubs win, but the Cubs, they say are unlucky and never win.
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:45.640]  That kind of is like a major omen that Trump's going to win. I agree with that statement. What
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:53.960]  do you say? I wouldn't necessarily link the Cubs win to Donald Trump. But yeah, you know, 2016
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:59.400]  has been a really interesting year. I thought about it last night. You know, we've got it is
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.520]  kind of quirky, like underdog, you know? Oh yeah, we've it's just been a roller coaster here. We've
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:10.680]  got this this wild election. We've got, you know, Prince Merle Haggard, they passed away. There's
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:17.480]  no need to fear. Underdog is here. Sorry. It's just 2016 is just breaking the mold. Everything
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:22.840]  that was old, everything that was 2016, because I mean, I'm not even a modern baseball fan by
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:26.600]  that. I mean, I followed, I was a teenager in college and just had to stop as I'm doing this.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:31.800]  But like I said, you know, you can only date one woman. But, but yeah, the Cubs were like the
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.560]  almost unlucky team ever couldn't win. It was impossible. There was a curse, right?
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:43.960]  I don't know if it's a curse on the Red Sox in one form or another. I guess it was more infamous
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:50.200]  with the Red Sox from what I know. But yeah, people have lived and died without seeing the Cubs
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:55.480]  win. So that that is it's it's a pretty big day for them. Pretty big day for I think it's a great
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:01.160]  sign the Cubs came back. I gotta tell you, I mean, you know, what's up? I mean, I do think it's a
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.640]  good sign for Trump. I mean, that's what Kent Daniels is saying. Cataclysm 2016 Cubs win,
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:09.800]  Brexit points to Trump victory. A political outsider Donald Trump could easily win the
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:14.120]  presidential candidate 2016 in a year of cataclysmic change. Which is what Kent's saying. What you
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:18.680]  just said, it's breaks the mold in human history. But the Chicago Cubs winning their first world
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:24.600]  series in 108 years and British voters rejecting their vacillage to the EU. I think that says it
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:33.000]  all brother. Are the Cubs winning the final nail in Hillary Clinton? I'm sorry? Is this
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.160]  the final nail with the Chicago Cubs where she's from? She's really a crime boss. Is that not a
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:44.040]  sign here? I mean, I think it's a sign actually. You know, if the Cubs can win, so can Donald
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:49.480]  Trump. How about that? How about that? That's pretty powerful statement. But I mean, I gotta
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.280]  really tell you, it is weird that they've never won. And then I thought they had another game.
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:57.480]  I've been paying attention and I knew they were closer. I was freaking out your stay.
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:03.560]  No wonder my dad and son were at my house were like, dad, turn on the TV, the world series.
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:10.040]  And I'm like, no, no, no. So there you go. It shows how is that is that shameful that I did?
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:12.360]  I wasn't aware of this. You're not a great American actually.
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:19.160]  So I was too busy with Rob do shooting a video about how we discovered the big company that
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:22.680]  does all the big graphics for the networks, preparing a Hillary win even in Texas. You
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:27.080]  know about that? Oh, I know all about that. You know, I figured they'd probably they've
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:32.840]  probably got the whole thing, you know, pre pre built, you know, I mean, they've probably had
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.360]  some of those graphics built a while ago. Well, you're right. It turns out it was a couple of
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.800]  months ago. Drudges linked to our story at least last time I checked. And again, we're not saying
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:46.280]  this is proof of rigging, but Google's been rigged. The polls have been rigged. Everything else
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:51.160]  has been rigged. I mean, my God, it's it's it's the era of rigging coming. It's the era of rigging
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:56.040]  being exposed. Can you can you imagine being in one of those liberal workplaces where it's like
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:02.280]  it's like this dictatorship and you go to give a presentation and you give something that's got
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:07.480]  a pro Trump slant, you probably be out of there faster than your head can spin. Absolutely. Well,
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:12.920]  here it is, since people bring it up. I've got the articles right here. Let me get your take on this.
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:17.880]  NBC caught preparing and I said this, but then I noticed it was all the networks. It's actually
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.840]  all NBC caught preparing Hillary victory results before election. Alex shows info wars. There's
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:27.880]  a warm for your mind and it goes on and NBC station was caught posting election results
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:32.760]  showing a Hillary Clinton victory. It's actually nationwide. Again, we just singled out this one
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:36.200]  feeling concerns that mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:42.520]  election favoring Hillary. Political activists discovered a hidden website for WRCB out of
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:46.600]  Chattanooga, Tennessee, where they're getting it nationally showing election results that Hillary
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:52.040]  Clinton securing a three, four, three election vote, 40% of the popular vote. The website originated
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:56.760]  from FTP server world now a media software company that provides real time data such as
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:01.720]  electronic results, election results, other media assets, the local news stations. And you go through
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:05.640]  it. As I said, it's nationwide. That was just the one we focused in on because that was an earlier
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:11.080]  investigation five at five PM by like nine at night. We were in it thousands of pages. They
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:16.600]  have her winning Texas by two points. They have her winning the nation by a million popular votes.
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:21.000]  And then and then narrowly winning because she wins Texas, which I've been saying
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  they're acting like they're going to win. What do you make of them getting graphics ready beforehand?
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:31.560]  Well, I think the other day you did use this statement when you said that they were sewing
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:37.400]  the the they're reaping what they sewed and that in the sewing phase, you know, they were putting
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:43.080]  out these these polls that again did over sample Democrats. And to that point, you know, how far
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:47.720]  they over sampled them. What you can take away from those numbers is that, you know, they're
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:52.760]  saying that people are more fired up for Hillary Clinton than they were for Barack Obama, which I
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:57.880]  think is contrary to what we see on the ground, especially at these rallies. So you got that
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:02.680]  going for you be she's not the change candidate. I think there are a number of other factors that
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:08.760]  are more insightful as to, you know, what what people are actually paying attention to. And
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:15.240]  one of those, you know, Michael Snyder was on the show about a week ago. And, you know, he had an
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:20.600]  article from a while back talking about how stock markets typically can can be a good indicator
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:24.840]  of who's going to win a presidential election. You've got, you know, all these Google trends
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:30.360]  where you see people are, you know, searching out the wazoo for these Hillary Clinton email
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.840]  scandals, the Podesta, the Wikileaks. You've got something like 15 to 20, depending on the day
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:41.160]  on Google, more searches for Trump. Oh, yeah. When it was normalized at one, right, the normalization
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:48.760]  being one, it was only 4% of that was Donald Trump searches for the sex tape, which I think was kind
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:54.920]  of they thought it was the nail in the coffin to Donald Trump. But I don't I think they grossly
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:44:02.040]  underestimated people's ability to kind of see people are idiots. You got a bunch of creeps over
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:09.320]  30 years on Hollywood sets, trying to record Trump. I've been at so many dinners with media,
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:13.960]  and they're asking me weird questions. And I go, wait a minute, let me look for a recorder. And
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:17.880]  they'll have a phone recording on the table or one in their pocket. I go, are you recording this?
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:23.880]  Oh, yeah, is that okay? I'm like, yeah, but you're asking me weird questions. Oh, stuff I didn't
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:31.080]  bring up. And I've had people record me, edit it, send me the edited tape and go, you want to talk
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:36.120]  about this? Like blackmail? I go, release it. You've edited that. Go to hell. I don't care. Oh, and
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:42.280]  when we talk about blackmail, it is the pot calling the kettle black in Clinton's case because she,
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:48.680]  you know, people are saying, you know, Jill Stein was in the media saying that Hillary is,
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:52.040]  you know, the worst person ever or whatever. And then she came back and said, you know, Trump is
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:57.400]  this walking scandal and that's what everyone wants you to believe. But the problem with that is that
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:03.160]  when you want to talk about blackmailable, let's talk about Huma carrying those, that 650,000
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.760]  set of emails, you know what I mean? That could easily blackmail Hillary Clinton. You know,
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:14.040]  when I start to think like a criminal, like one of those criminals in the Democratic Party,
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:21.960]  you know, it's tough to give her a pass on that any other way. What other reason would you have
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:27.160]  for keeping all those emails if you weren't going to sell them yourself? 650,000 emails. No, they
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:31.880]  admit that's why the FBI began this. It's an espionage investigation. Oh yeah, either she was
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:35.560]  selling them herself or she was planning to use them as blackmail. And if you think about all
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:40.760]  these people, what if she gave all that information to the people who are giving vast sums of money
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:45.720]  to Hillary Clinton's campaign, like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, right? She's feeding them all this
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:49.880]  information. They're like, okay, let's get this woman in. And that's why the communist Chinese
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:55.800]  and every other, the Muslims, they all want her in because she's compromised. She's a horrible demon.
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:00.040]  They put in, it's a big joke on us. It's not that our agencies are perfect or our government's
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:06.120]  perfect. This is such a bad deal. Finally, our government's forced to fight it because it's
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:12.360]  suicide. This is insane to put a sick person mentally, but also physically in who's totally
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:17.320]  compromised is insane, is a clear and present danger. We're only four days, three and a half days
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:25.720]  out, man. What do you predict? Well, you know, at this point, I wouldn't put it, it's tough to make
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:29.240]  a definite- Oh, she's a cornered rat, even though it'll blow up in her face. Oh, it is. It is. And
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:35.160]  you know, I've heard a lot of other pundits that talk about, you know, what she must have.
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:40.040]  She's got to empty it all now. You know, whatever she's got- She doesn't have stuff on Trump. This
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:45.400]  is key what you said. She has dirt on everybody else. Oh, yeah. And that's the real power that
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:50.040]  Hillary has right now is her dirt. But at a certain point, okay, release your dirt. We're
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:54.360]  going to release what you and Wiener are up to. Thank you, Matt. Yeah, no problem. Great point.
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:57.240]  Matt's a smart guy. We love getting him on the show. I encourage the rest of the crew to pop him
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:00.200]  too because, I mean, they're just really smart folks. They always make great points. A lot of
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:05.560]  what you hear on air is points they make to me. Before I go any further, because we've got Anthony

[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:23.640]  Comment, take it.
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:39.240]  I've seen a trend the last few weeks on CNN.com where they warn us about fake news like sampling
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:45.480]  45% or more Democrats than Republicans to give Hillary a 68% victory.
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:51.800]  I noticed when I went to CNN.com this morning they had Hillary winning by two points. They
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:57.800]  weren't having her win by 25 points or more because they know that it's going to be very close
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:01.320]  if they even steal it and that Trump's really way ahead.
[02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:07.480]  But they think you're dumb. They don't think you remember that last week she was 20 something
[02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:12.360]  points ahead, you know, Trump's down in 30 something. She's up at 60 something. They think
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:18.120]  you're a moron, but they're going to tell you about fake news. And so many times there are fake
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:24.120]  news sites out there. We track back to governments and corporations and they'll mix our info into it
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:31.080]  to make us sound like idiots. It's got to be info wars.com or prisonplanet.com if my name's on it
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:36.360]  or me talking about it or it's not us folks. So if they can't counter us, they just put out this
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:43.640]  info. I saw stories out this week going Alex Jones has found a group worse on the Nazis and
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:49.400]  the Soviets. It's the National Guard. The National Guard he believes wants to kill you and your family.
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.440]  The National Guard are great people. Some of the best folks out there.
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:58.600]  I said that operations where they do domestic training are to condition the military and
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:05.400]  the police for domestic control. That's what these different programs were, but they lie and
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:11.160]  misrepresent. And I know you the audience get that they're targeting people that are looking for the
[02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:18.360]  truth. But here it is. Oh CNN that cares so much about us. The plague of fake news is getting worse.
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:27.640]  Here's how to protect yourself. Oh thank you CNN for protecting us from the fake news. You are so good.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:36.440]  That's Brian Stettler telling us how to do it. And it goes on how Trump's making up that there's a
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:42.760]  criminal investigation into Hillary. It's really not criminal they say. So there you go. Thank God
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:48.760]  they're exposing Trump. He's fake. He's lying to us. Here's another one. Five stunning fake news
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:53.880]  stories that reach millions. They'll mix fake stories in with real stories to confuse people.
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:59.000]  Again that's the new talking point. That's from CNN Money. Here's another one.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:06.600]  Fraudulent ICOA press releases. Fake news is always fake news.
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:14.040]  Snopes that's like a not against her that she's fat but a fat lady with a cat that Soros finds.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:20.840]  She tells you what's real. Snopes. Oh it's like if I get up in the morning and you know eat eggs.
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:27.160]  Do I ask Snopes if I eat eggs or not? Thank God Snopes is there though. Thank our little
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:31.560]  lucky little lucky stars. Of course I couldn't say they're stars. Gotta ask Snopes what are
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:38.520]  those in the nice sky? Are those distant sons? Snopes is like no those are holes poked in a blanket.
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:46.360]  Now Google truth police to be run by a cat lady. That's an article. Snopes.com run by a cat lady
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:53.560]  and her husband. I know that against cat ladies folks. It's just I got a cat. Well my daughter's
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:58.120]  likes cats. We got two cats. Kind of like them kind of don't like they can walk by and knock
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:01.880]  something off for no reason. You're like you just broke two things today you little creature.
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:07.000]  Now you're on top of me at midnight with your feet in my chest like making biscuits.
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:14.440]  Making tortillas. I'll be asleep all of a sudden. Cat goes pow. Gives me a sigh of the head. I'm
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:21.480]  like why not deserve that? But Snopes says if a cat hits you in the face for no reason
[02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:25.560]  did it make a sound unless Snopes admitted it did. And that's the most important point.
[02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:31.080]  Snopes has the answers. You go to the mountain and then Snopes it gives you the answers down and
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:37.960]  CNN they tell you about the fake news. Thank goodness I know about fake news now from the MSM

[03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:12.440]  for the most historic election in modern history you are receiving this transmission
[03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:20.120]  you are the resistance from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones it's
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:28.600]  anthony akumya from our east coast studios here he is folks thank you alex very happy to be here
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:36.920]  once again for info wars dot com anthony akumya here um well like alex just said four days is
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:47.240]  that where we are four days what are we going to do after this is over this has become a part of
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:55.560]  our lives we it's like you you got a pet if you have a pet for a year and a half you're pretty
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:01:02.280]  attached to that thing you are pretty attached to the dog or cat or whatever you had for a year and
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:10.360]  a half and then it's just going to be gone and you know we'll have to live with the consequences
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:19.640]  like so let's say it's like a pet that made mess all over your floor uh and now the pet's gone but
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:26.120]  you're still you're left with the consequences of of the pet just enough to let you remember what
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:33.240]  it was all about but we got we got four days left and then we'll know who the next president is
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:38.840]  going to be after the inauguration in january uh and they'll talk about it on on the press but
[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:44.200]  it's not going to be anything like we've been through for the past year and a half because it
[03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:51.480]  won't matter anymore who said this and who said that and uh uh if it's hillary we will have the
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:57.720]  fun of watching her go through her various scandals and fbi investigations that'll be a little bit
[03:01:57.720 --> 03:02:05.480]  of fun and mark my words on this one too if and i hope i hope the opportunity for me to be right
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:10.840]  does not happen because it hinges on a hillary presidency which i absolutely don't want to
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:17.800]  see i want to see donald trump win this thing but um here's what i'm thinking as i drop my pen
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:24.360]  here's what i'm thinking let's say hillary does win the election i know i'm sorry
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:32.840]  she goes through these fbi investigations the press is not going to be nice to her
[03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:38.520]  you know how they're all in her corner right now they're all trying their hardest to get hillary
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:49.160]  clinton elected that will go away in four days i swear to you if she gets elected that will go away
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:56.920]  because one thing the press is more so than liberal bias which they have oh my god shown
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:03:05.800]  over the past year and a half is greedy oh are they greedy and they have zero loyalty
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:11.800]  there's not like they're loyal they have their reasons for wanting hillary clinton to be the president
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:18.680]  it's their liberal bias they have a reason for that and most of it does hinge on some kind of greed
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:26.920]  that they uh that they have uh but if hillary gets elected they're not going to cover up any
[03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:33.640]  of these stories anymore you will see and by the way now that i think about it maybe even after
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:40.360]  trump gets elected you're still going to see the the media completely spin on hillary because they
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:47.320]  know it's a juicy story and they can't leave a juicy story alone can they they will jump on her
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:52.360]  president or not that's what i'm saying there now it's better because it doesn't hinge on hillary
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:04:00.040]  presidency president or not they will turn on hillary in a second because it makes for a great
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:06.520]  headline and they will start digging and uncovering and you'll see all the stuff that we should have
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:13.880]  seen for a year and a half we'll see it all happen in four days and and that's what we're
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:24.760]  gunning for uh just amazing the media not stopping their steamroller over uh trump and uh trump
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:32.280]  supporters you see it every day every day turn on that mainstream media and uh first of all you
[03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:41.800]  won't see you won't see this uh uh donna brazil you won't see her uh she got fired from cnn because
[03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:49.000]  uh as you probably heard she got questions for uh the town hall and one of the debates um against
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:56.200]  perney sanders that hillary was having uh from roland martin over there and decided to give it
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:05:02.360]  to hillary and it wasn't even like well she didn't use it or this new york police department

[03:09:51.480 --> 03:10:00.760]  wars dot com uh i was talking about donna brazil that whole scandal that we've just barely seen
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:07.480]  on any mainstream media uh giving questions to hillary clinton for the debates where
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:16.120]  bernie sanders was just thrown to the wolves thrown to the wolves uh it's nice to see him
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:23.160]  getting so upset about it and talking about it and not uh criticizing hillary maybe picking another
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:31.240]  candidate to support oh that's right he hasn't just another shill just another hillary shill
[03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:40.120]  shill promoting her uh going around the country uh he was directly screwed over by hillary the dnc
[03:10:40.120 --> 03:10:51.480]  donna brazil uh wasmir uh before brazil they all just uh do what they want they do what they want
[03:10:52.120 --> 03:11:00.600]  like there's no rules or laws that apply to them and uh they they they do it to reach their their
[03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:07.400]  end which is hillary clinton as president of the united states wow that's a hard one to say
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:14.520]  that is a hard one to stomach um roland martin gave her the questions now uh brazil was fired
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:20.520]  by cnn she was a paid contributor she'd be on there and talk about uh the election and whatnot
[03:11:21.640 --> 03:11:28.280]  which is sort of odd i think in the first place how is the interim head and by the way she's the
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:34.600]  interim head of the dnc because remember the first one was fired for more cheating and scandals uh
[03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:42.760]  so so she's the interim head of the dnc and she's a paid contributor to one of the news stations
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:52.600]  do they even try anymore to separate uh so there's no conflicts of interest like that
[03:11:52.600 --> 03:12:03.480]  do they even try no they obviously don't the head of the the dnc a paid employee of one
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:12.360]  of the major news outlets that sorry call me crazy bothers me a little i see a bit of a conflict
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:20.120]  of interest there uh and roland martin is the one that gave her the question gave it to her
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:25.640]  little buddy buddy they're working at the same place why hasn't roland martin been fired
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:34.920]  if cnn fired her because they oh they just are the bastion of uh journalism aren't they
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:43.560]  of ethical journalism cnn so why not fire roland martin he was responsible too he gave her the
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:53.480]  questions but no we can't do that so they go on and on just lying to us um has anyone seen
[03:12:54.040 --> 03:13:03.800]  humor has anyone seen humor uh just such a close friend of hillary clinton's actually hillary once
[03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:12.040]  called her a second daughter right up until uh all those emails poured out of her and her husband's
[03:13:12.040 --> 03:13:23.240]  computers then she was called a staffer i think was it a staffer there's just no no pride with
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:32.920]  these people um so umma uh is part of now the newest scandal that's going on that the media is
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:40.840]  trying so hard to not acknowledge and not address uh there was um the investigation going on with
[03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:46.760]  uh anthony weiner who is now oh let's all give him our thoughts and prayers he's now in a sex
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:56.440]  rehab uh just trying to get better just trying to get better here's the deal i i believe with with
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:14:02.360]  sex rehabilitation uh i don't see it working especially for someone like anthony weiner this
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:13.400]  guy knew he knew that this was destroying his life everything in it his career his marriage his uh
[03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:22.680]  political aspirations he knew it and time and time again there he was getting in trouble again
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:30.920]  because this guy can't stop he just can't stop he is a degenerate and cannot stop rehab will do
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:38.040]  nothing it's just the thing to to put on a your apology resume uh and make things uh try to make
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:47.080]  things go away but this isn't going away so the fbi is investigating him uh sending um sexually
[03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:58.600]  explicit messages to a 15 year old girl and lo and behold there's these these emails these email
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:06.280]  more emails because uh uh and any correspondence between hillary and huma and huma's uh collecting
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:14.840]  correspondence from hillary and we don't know what it is yet but i tell you when uh comey fbi
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:23.560]  director comey uh came out and announced that there was indeed an investigation uh that they were
[03:15:23.560 --> 03:15:30.200]  going to continue looking into hillary clinton's emails looking for um some type of uh problem there
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:39.720]  uh you knew that it was something big i i i don't know it's obvious comey wasn't playing
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:46.360]  partisan politics when he came out and said well we recommended that uh no charges be filed against
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:52.680]  hillary clinton to the justice department back in july you might remember that and then all of a sudden
[03:15:53.960 --> 03:16:00.120]  he comes out with this i believe he's covering his own but here i honestly believe that there's
[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:07.560]  too much there and now it's been spread out with huma and anthony weiner there's no protecting
[03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:15.240]  that once the cat's out of the bag to that extent then you have to uh pursue it and i think in order
[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:23.240]  to cover his own but that's what uh fbi director comey did came out and said yes there is an issue
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:30.520]  and we are looking uh into it uh again what it is we can only imagine at this point and hillary
[03:16:30.520 --> 03:16:37.960]  and the democrats are doing their best to try to get this out of the news cycle try and everything
[03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:44.280]  i saw something the other day on i believe it was against cnn they brought up something from
[03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:50.920]  literally two years ago they were trying to uh get some kind of traction going they bring out this
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:17:00.280]  completely uh non-credible lawsuit that's going on uh or trying to get some uh traction
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:06.200]  with um donald trump some 13-year-old girl years ago was alleging that there was some
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:11.640]  sexual assault that went on between donald trump and her um
[03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:20.280]  um there were no criminal charges ever filed still aren't can't be uh but there's a lawsuit
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:29.480]  some kind of a civil case going on and apparently she had had this civil case years ago canceled it
[03:17:30.040 --> 03:17:37.160]  and now lo and behold again donald trump running for president well let's bring this out let's
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:44.200]  bring this up again after years and years and years uh two witnesses all the sudden are there
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:52.680]  it's so obvious if something stinks it's because it's bad and everything they try to grab against
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:18:00.440]  trump the media and and the democrats everything they try to bring up uh just reeks it reeks
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:09.960]  because there's there's no evidence to it and it comes up right before he's running for president
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:18.920]  all those years 40 years in the public eye in new york builder entertainer nothing
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:25.160]  nothing now he's the worst businessman ever he screws over every builder he's ever worked with

[03:18:33.080 --> 03:18:39.720]  i think has has problems they have problems how could you not people's eyes are not open
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:48.760]  they are so connected with hilly hillary clinton emotionally emotionally so the woman just the
[03:18:48.760 --> 03:18:57.080]  other day on the news crying uh the daughter asked her mom why are you crying she's like i i got to
[03:18:57.080 --> 03:19:07.720]  vote for a woman for president her only reason her only reason for voting for hillary she's a

[03:19:17.320 --> 03:19:25.000]  you went to the polls and thought well he's got two ears i'll pull the lever for the two-eared guy
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:33.320]  and that's what women seem to be doing when they hop on this hillary bandwagon for no other reason
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:39.960]  than to say look at what we did we elected one of our own and then they talk about how we shouldn't

[03:24:12.600 --> 03:24:26.600]  talk about the election obviously huge this is huge four days left and you got to start
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:34.840]  wondering what might this country look like in a couple of years after the president gets in
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:41.640]  there and gets up to speed i talk to a lot of people and they say a large majority of people say
[03:24:41.640 --> 03:24:46.840]  ah the president they don't do anything they don't really they're a figurehead they there's a lot
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:52.280]  of checks and balances in place but there's there is something the president does it's
[03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:59.960]  it's a mood that the country has the president can set a mood for the country we saw this
[03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:08.600]  in a blazing detail after jimmy carter left office and ronald reagan came in we were beaten
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:15.320]  as a country uh looked looked like a garbage in the world's eyes uh reagan came in
[03:25:15.320 --> 03:25:25.400]  and it without without any specific plan or or legislation or anything the country felt better
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:34.520]  about itself it started working together being proud to be american again after uh all those
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:40.760]  carter years where it just seemed like nothing worked uh there wasn't any pride in in in this
[03:25:40.760 --> 03:25:48.520]  country and i think a lot of people feel the same way now after eight years of obama that's the
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:55.240]  type of thing a president can do set a tone and a mood for the country what we looked at before
[03:25:55.240 --> 03:26:05.960]  if you recall uh the eight years before obama um do you recall the police being as despised
[03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:12.520]  as they are do you do you recall racial tensions being at the level that they're at now
[03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:22.360]  and and the world's view of the united states uh being so low to where russia
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:31.560]  uh is literally laughing at us and flying over our ships with their planes um as a goof
[03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:40.120]  it's that's the type of thing a president can do i honestly think that we need that boost
[03:26:40.120 --> 03:26:47.000]  back again we need somebody in office that will make us proud to be american again and a lot of
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:55.400]  people see that as oh gee look at you murka murka it's important the people that don't see that
[03:26:55.400 --> 03:27:02.520]  are the people that have no sense of nation they don't want borders they want them all open like
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:11.800]  hillary said like hillary said when she's talking to wall street open borders that's the problem we
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:20.920]  need a president that has a sense of nation that's a bad word now you say that you you
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:30.280]  love america you want america to be respected you want people to feel like they want to be americans
[03:27:30.280 --> 03:27:36.680]  and you're the idiot you're the one that's making the problem and you're probably a nazi that's
[03:27:36.680 --> 03:27:44.600]  they love that word too you're probably a nazi but that's we we need to to appreciate
[03:27:44.600 --> 03:27:50.280]  that we're americans that seemed to go away with a lot of people especially on the left oh my god
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:55.480]  and immigrants if i can even i don't even know what an immigrant is anymore you talk to left
[03:27:55.480 --> 03:28:02.440]  leftist anybody that decided to trot on in to the united states of america is an immigrant
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:11.720]  an undocumented immigrant uh when when people are just allowed to uh roll over the border
[03:28:11.720 --> 03:28:19.720]  into this country you're not going to see uh the type of immigrant that wants to become american
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:27.560]  you will see whatever country they're from if they're mexican then it's uh mexican people
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:34.440]  living in america as mexicans they there's no real sense or need to become american
[03:28:35.320 --> 03:28:44.120]  syrian refugees somali refugees i i don't see much assimilation going on there either
[03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:51.640]  there are a lot of um a lot of people from uh these countries uh collect in in one spot
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:59.960]  and don't assimilate and segregate themselves uh they have their own local government their own
[03:28:59.960 --> 03:29:09.800]  businesses and america is not even in their mindset they have no want or need to become americans
[03:29:10.440 --> 03:29:19.400]  this just needs to change there is a benefit and it's an asset to us to have the population
[03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:28.040]  of this country identify as americans and how that became a bad thing over the eight years that
[03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:36.600]  obama's been in office that's how a president can have uh an influence on the mood of a country
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:50.120]  and i would like to see that uh change uh we'll be back in moments don't go anywhere info wars dot

[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:44.840]  show me anthony kumia on info wars dot com um there is a huge huge uh collection of disillusion
[03:33:44.840 --> 03:33:52.440]  people and that's the whole trump thing that's what made uh trump a a viable candidate why he
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:59.720]  swept through the primaries and why i believe he will win the election i can't say for sure
[03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:07.560]  this is one of those situations where the polls i don't even understand the polls anymore and i'm
[03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:15.560]  not ashamed to say that i i look at a lot of news every day from a lot of different sources
[03:34:15.560 --> 03:34:21.720]  and i pop those polls up and i look and then some other polls and i'll see it on mainstream media
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:30.600]  on alternative media i'll look nothing jibes there doesn't seem to be a trend for anything
[03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:43.480]  based on different sources now i'm not one to trust uh cnn's polling or or uh nbc's polling or
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:49.320]  anything like that it and and theirs doesn't even jive together and they're both in in hillary's
[03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:56.840]  pockets uh and then alternative media you'll see trumps ahead and then i'll hear wow trump is really
[03:34:56.840 --> 03:35:05.640]  gaining steam in uh uh some of the um uh swing states and then oh boy hillary is way ahead in
[03:35:05.640 --> 03:35:14.920]  the swing state so we're being bamboozled it's not hard to see again open your eyes wide enough
[03:35:15.720 --> 03:35:20.680]  try to shake shake whatever ideology you've had in your head for so long
[03:35:20.680 --> 03:35:31.240]  and really look the why do you think there would be so many different results for polls
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:41.720]  it's to confuse us we must be kept confused we mustn't really know who's ahead or who's behind
[03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:48.280]  uh whom who has the best chance of winning who doesn't we can't be trusted with that kind of
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:56.200]  information people oh my god because when the results come out we aren't allowed to have something
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:36:05.240]  that says hey what but this said that it was supposed to go the other way so if they throw
[03:36:05.240 --> 03:36:15.560]  everything at us whatever the result is there'll be some type of proof that uh that it was on the
[03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:25.240]  up and up i cannot even believe i'm saying stuff like this because years ago i'd watch alex here
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:31.880]  on uh info wars and go my god what is this man talking about this is a little off the rails
[03:36:32.760 --> 03:36:41.320]  but if you open your eyes and really try to look and see what the the motivation is uh it makes
[03:36:41.320 --> 03:36:50.760]  it starts making complete sense how about this how about the fact that we have not seen one ices
[03:36:50.760 --> 03:36:57.480]  terrorist event in a western nation we have not seen any black lives matter protests
[03:36:59.560 --> 03:37:07.160]  where did they go did the world all the sudden get better is the world a better place is that
[03:37:07.160 --> 03:37:17.480]  not a problem anymore or are there absolutely people and groups that orchestrate this stuff
[03:37:20.120 --> 03:37:26.680]  again open the eyes take a look around i understand people will watch or listen to
[03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:34.440]  this and think wow anthony's lost his mind he's ready they call it the tinfoil hat uh group
[03:37:34.440 --> 03:37:42.040]  but if you really look into it why why haven't there been these protests you know why they don't
[03:37:42.040 --> 03:37:49.480]  bode well for hillary clinton and the democrats a terrorist event will not bode well for the
[03:37:49.480 --> 03:37:56.280]  democrats black lives matter being out on the street protesting doesn't bode well for the
[03:37:56.280 --> 03:38:02.520]  democrats or hillary clinton it makes the country look lawless when ices attacks somebody makes
[03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:09.480]  us look like we're not secure like someone's not doing their job and that's why they stopped now you
[03:38:09.480 --> 03:38:16.120]  think how could that happen if people could just stop it why don't they stop it all the time they
[03:38:16.120 --> 03:38:23.320]  don't want it stopped all the time they don't want it stopped all the time these are things that need
[03:38:23.320 --> 03:38:30.920]  to keep happening it's all about control it's all about control uh after a president's in office
[03:38:30.920 --> 03:38:38.440]  and there's terrorist events now you can enact a bunch of different rules and laws that will
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:46.520]  protect you politicians never take rights away from you they don't do that they protect you
[03:38:47.320 --> 03:38:53.960]  and the byproduct might be we might have to have a few of our liberties taken away but isn't it great
[03:38:53.960 --> 03:39:01.720]  that you're safe that's how it works that's how it's always worked but uh if you don't think that
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:08.040]  people well look at some of the uh trump protests that have happened at his rallies all the sudden
[03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:15.640]  after it came out in the wiki leaks uh one of the wiki leaks dumps that those protests were
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:22.920]  orchestrated by people connected to the dnc and hillary clinton and the cat was out of the bag as
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:30.040]  they say uh those stopped they just stopped happening you don't see it you watch a donald
[03:39:30.040 --> 03:39:36.280]  speech trump at a rally watch one today he's doing a thousand of them a day i believe but you
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:42.840]  won't have to see him stand there going oh okay get him out get him out all right i'll wait i'll wait
[03:39:44.520 --> 03:39:48.600]  all right here's another one yeah i'll go what how that stopped happening
[03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:57.160]  did all the sudden uh everyone that didn't like trump just decided to give up no they are told
[03:39:57.160 --> 03:40:06.120]  and instructed how to carry out these random spontaneous protests uh whether it's at a
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:13.080]  trump rally or in the streets with black lives matter it's all orchestrated all orchestrated
[03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:21.240]  uh by whom well there's the rub isn't it who's at the who's who's who's responsible for all this
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:28.200]  i know listening to info wars and alex globalists these people that want this global uh economy
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:37.720]  and community and uh no american exceptionalism uh could be i tend to think it's everyone that
[03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:44.440]  is in bed with hillary clinton at this point i don't really see um trump and his people
[03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:52.520]  that are in charge having the ability to do those things having the ability to muster up
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:41:01.560]  protesters to send to a a clinton rally or or muster up a street protest it just doesn't seem
[03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:10.600]  to happen that way but for some reason again they all just decided to uh to stop we have four
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:16.600]  days left and again trying to figure out what this country might look like uh talked about
[03:41:16.600 --> 03:41:23.480]  trump being in there i think it'll bring back american pride and uh the ability to um create
[03:41:23.480 --> 03:41:31.080]  again in this country a hillary clinton presidency within a couple of years again the disillusion
[03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:39.400]  people in this country are the people that have worked raised a family contributed to this country
[03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:46.680]  not contributed like a charity case that isn't what it's all about not opening up your wallet
[03:41:46.680 --> 03:41:55.080]  and throwing money out there to to uh uh needy people i'm talking about contributing through
[03:41:55.080 --> 03:42:01.720]  working setting up businesses and industry in this country again making it a great country
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:09.080]  um in the world that that can trade on equal footing with other nations and become
[03:42:09.880 --> 03:42:16.680]  uh an industry leader again that's gone when when you hear trump say make america great again
[03:42:16.680 --> 03:42:24.600]  you'll hear the left answer to that by saying oh what racism segregation separate water found
[03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:31.640]  there is no an industry leader someone that could do trade in the world and actually make money
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:37.640]  doing it would be a great thing that would be making america great again and that's the type of
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:43.080]  stuff i think trump is is pitching i don't think he's pitching bringing us back to any of the dark
[03:42:43.080 --> 03:42:53.160]  ages of this country but again if you listen to hillary's speeches uh it is um here it is uh
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:43:02.440]  trumps people who are negative dark divisive or divisive and dangerous this is what they have now
[03:43:03.160 --> 03:43:11.000]  uh trying to present trump and the people that support him and will be voting for him as monsters
[03:43:11.560 --> 03:43:20.040]  who want to bring america back to all of its evils and uh terrible deeds that uh america's
[03:43:20.040 --> 03:43:27.320]  done over the years not thinking about when america was great and we were a leader in industry we
[03:43:27.320 --> 03:43:36.680]  made things we were innovative uh eager eager to to be proud remember the space program how proud
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:45.240]  we were of things like that achievements as a nation where's that that's when america was great
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:58.360]  so when hillary yells we're already great in that voice uh she's missing the point she's either well
[03:43:58.360 --> 03:44:03.480]  i think she's lying because any anything you could always excuse uh hillary it's always lying by the
[03:44:03.480 --> 03:44:10.120]  way it's not she's stupid or she didn't see this she's lying that's what the bottom line is with
[03:44:10.120 --> 03:44:18.120]  hillary but uh she she's lying about america is still great it is great but america has a lot
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:27.000]  more great potential than it is great and years ago um when we were a leader in the world uh was
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:32.920]  when america was great i think throughout history no matter what year it is you'll always be able
[03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:41.080]  to find some dastardly deeds that any country has done that um they might not be too proud of again
[03:44:41.080 --> 03:44:46.360]  you can't take history out of context some things that happened many many years ago were commonplace
[03:44:46.360 --> 03:44:54.200]  and a business as usual as they say looked at with our today's ethics and morality uh it looks very
[03:44:54.200 --> 03:45:01.000]  bad but back then unless you were living in that time you can't judge uh but we i think as a nation
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:07.480]  we've always tried to correct those things and um uh essentially be good could be a good group of
[03:45:07.480 --> 03:45:15.320]  people americans uh here in america but uh when you say make america great again they always bring
[03:45:15.320 --> 03:45:23.800]  up horrible instances of america's history and say that that's what trump and his supporters
[03:45:23.800 --> 03:45:33.640]  are striving for to make america that again and it's just it's such a weak phony uh argument
[03:45:34.280 --> 03:45:41.400]  that isn't what it's all about because i i don't think uh half the country's voters which it is by
[03:45:41.400 --> 03:45:46.200]  the way it's half the country's vote whoever's voting half of them want trump at this point
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:52.680]  half one hillary who who gets it i have no idea but you're calling half the country
[03:45:52.680 --> 03:46:02.040]  uh racist homophobic misogynistic why the hell would you want to live in a country that's half
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:08.280]  of the people are that awful but that's how the liberals want to present it and it's not when
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:14.680]  you hear make america great again uh i'm not thinking about uh the clan writing in with their
[03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:21.800]  white hoods i'm thinking about uh factories with a lot of workers in them pumping out products that
[03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:28.360]  will go overseas and bring money back to this country it's just an amazing part of american
[03:46:28.360 --> 03:46:36.200]  history how uh constructive and innovative and successful we were as a country before i don't
[03:46:36.200 --> 03:46:44.440]  know what emotion kicked in before symbolism uh became more important than substance in this country
[03:46:44.440 --> 03:46:54.440]  before the people that that were doing all of the heavy lifting became the enemy in this country
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:47:03.480]  it's the bad guy the the the dad and the mom raising a family going to work every day paying
[03:47:03.480 --> 03:47:16.440]  their taxes keeping their their lawn nice that is the bad guy that's the enemy now it's not diverse
[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:28.920]  enough it's uh it it doesn't um reflect some of the uh uh alternative lifestyles that we have in
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:35.800]  this country that's all well and fine but can we just get back to basics we've gone so far off
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:44.840]  off the rails in this country that things that are just not that important are now paramount
[03:47:44.840 --> 03:47:51.240]  and things that are very important uh have either taken a back seat or been delegated uh designated
[03:47:51.240 --> 03:47:59.560]  evil in this country and you know when when when you hear people knock that motto and and it is a
[03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:05.560]  little hard look i'll be honest it is a little hard for a year and a half to hear a motto or a
[03:48:05.560 --> 03:48:14.440]  credo or or a slogan let's make america great again ah you know i've never been one for the
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:22.680]  rah rah kind of thing but when there's uh honesty behind it and you can actually understand what
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:31.640]  it means uh then it then it takes on a new meaning and i think um i think many americans know what
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:38.200]  that does mean and and they can counter when you hear hillary clinton yelling she was literally
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:46.120]  yelling about how negative and dark and awful uh trump supporters and donald trump are because
[03:48:46.120 --> 03:48:54.840]  it's all she's got it's all she's really got right now uh i have not heard her uh talking about
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:49:01.800]  any policy i've not heard her actually bashing any of trump's a policy that he's come out with
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:10.680]  with it's all about just bashing him personally bashing the voters uh personally telling people
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:16.680]  to get out and vote early that was a good one i loved that one when the fbi um story broke with
[03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:22.760]  her uh the new investigation uh or renewed investigation on her emails i love that she's
[03:49:22.760 --> 03:49:30.280]  like get out there and vote early if that doesn't speak volumes oh really hillary why why is that
[03:49:30.280 --> 03:49:36.280]  that maybe i want to use this last uh week or four days whatever's left uh maybe i want
[03:49:36.280 --> 03:49:42.520]  to use that to really delve in and do some research and and really choose that candidate
[03:49:42.520 --> 03:49:48.520]  that i think will be good for the country and no no no just get to the balls quickly quick
[03:49:49.880 --> 03:49:55.400]  that uh smells of fear a little bit smells of something might be coming out of the uh
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:50:01.240]  uh out of the molding pull the sheet rock off and you'll see some black mold behind it uh that's
[03:50:01.240 --> 03:50:06.840]  that's hillary that's hillary's i bet she takes that makeup off on a nightly basis and you just
[03:50:06.840 --> 03:50:15.880]  see like water damage and black mold all over her face very dangerous very toxic but that's all all
[03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:22.840]  she has right now and uh again like i was talking about at the top of this break the polls don't
[03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:29.160]  they they don't tell me anything i've said uh time and time again this election could be a
[03:50:29.160 --> 03:50:35.800]  landslide either way i don't know i just don't know i know what i feel and what i want or it could
[03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:45.640]  be a squeaker either way that's how mixed up uh they've made us as a populace that's how confused
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:49.480]  they've done they've just shoved these graphs in front of us we don't know what the hell they mean
[03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:55.320]  uh anthony comia for info wars dot com back in a moment
[03:51:01.160 --> 03:51:06.760]  extendivite is more than just a heart tonic most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut
[03:51:06.760 --> 03:51:11.880]  and metals in the liver and we all have a bit of both the garlic and extendivite has a yeast
[03:51:11.880 --> 03:51:17.000]  killing effect in the gut while also helping the sulfur enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:23.560]  extendivite just may improve your overall health products like extendivite are the only way we're
[03:51:23.560 --> 03:51:27.960]  going to get our society healthy and if you're waiting for the government and pharmaceutical

[03:54:13.800 --> 03:54:21.560]  so uh with the election four days away what do we really want we want uh security i think right
[03:54:21.560 --> 03:54:31.400]  don't we want to feel safe in our own homes and in our nation um from from harm yeah i think so
[03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:38.760]  uh what i've heard from trump it sounds like he's more the guy for the job than hillary clinton
[03:54:39.960 --> 03:54:46.280]  that's how i see it hillary's trying to present uh donald trump as a madman if you've seen some
[03:54:46.280 --> 03:54:53.400]  of our commercials my god it it it harkens back to the days uh when reagan was running and they
[03:54:53.400 --> 03:54:58.200]  were saying that he's definitely going to get us into a war definitely get us into a war uh
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:07.080]  they're showing nuclear missile silos and interviewing people that have run the nuclear
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:15.240]  missile silos and saying hey it's donald trump got first of all he's not a politician this is
[03:55:15.240 --> 03:55:21.960]  where they don't know what to do with donald trump he's not a politician he's been a successful
[03:55:21.960 --> 03:55:30.840]  businessman a builder an entertainer and for some reason that means you're going to launch
[03:55:30.840 --> 03:55:40.040]  nuclear missiles i don't know how they make this uh make any sense whatsoever but hillary's the one
[03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:45.800]  that went over and made a uranium deal with the russians to give them uranium rights
[03:55:46.840 --> 03:55:55.400]  hillary's the one involved in the iran nuclear deal that uh absolutely gives iran the ability
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:00.200]  to make nuclear nuclear weapons and you might say well that's not till a few years down the road
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:07.720]  what what what are we all leaving at some point yeah it's giving them the ability the resources
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:16.200]  they need to build nuclear bombs that's what that deal did instead of keeping them under the the
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:24.920]  sanctions that were in place and the restrictions and the ability to bomb them if they got a little
[03:56:24.920 --> 03:56:32.920]  crazy with their nuclear program if you recall many years ago israel decided hey look at that
[03:56:32.920 --> 03:56:36.600]  they're building nuclear power plants which they're going to be able to take nuclear material from
[03:56:36.600 --> 03:56:42.040]  and make bombs what should we do bomb them and now with all the sanctions lifted and no one really
[03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:50.040]  keeping an eye on iran they've acquired missile defense systems that will be very difficult to
[03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:56.360]  get through if the need ever came about to take any kind of military action against their nuclear
[03:56:56.360 --> 03:57:04.920]  sites so again she screwed us in that respect economy the economy has been in the proverbial
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:13.240]  crapper as they say uh for eight years at least um i know it was uh not not at its best at the end
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:21.480]  of a w's term but man obama's done nothing to uh help that out um and hillary has done said nothing
[03:57:21.480 --> 03:57:32.360]  more than she will continue with his program and and legacy insane just insane uh and uh
[03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:36.600]  trump is a businessman he's been a successful business there's no denying that you could say
[03:57:36.600 --> 03:57:43.160]  that oh he owed people money he did this he's been a successful businessman for many years
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:50.520]  so uh as far as the economy goes and some of the stuff he's been saying about trade uh i buy that
[03:57:51.400 --> 03:57:59.800]  and national pride again just being feeling good about being uh american again just feeling good
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:08.120]  about it would be oh it's been so long hasn't it hasn't it just been so long to to show american
[03:58:08.120 --> 03:58:14.360]  pride and feel good about the country and the direction it's going in that would be uh
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:22.760]  kind of nice am i doing this now all right introducing bio pca the ultimate new hair skin
