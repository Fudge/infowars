[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400]  Alright, so there's a bunch of illegal aliens in Seattle, Washington stomping around with
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.800]  their supporters yelling, this is Mexico, a Reconquista, pilgrims go home, the regular
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.720]  racist stuff, anti-American stuff, and this guy's blocked in traffic, can't get to work,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.200]  so he starts flipping them off, the illegals come over and physically assault him, the
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.760]  cops pull him off very lightly, I mean, as if they were touching the Pope or something,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.200]  or the President, and then they grab him out of the car, because he dared be assaulted
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.280]  by the gods, and they slam his face down in the concrete, blood's literally pouring out
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.800]  of his lips and nose, and our guest, Josh Moore, who just so happens to be a videographer,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.160]  happens to have his own little media company, and took a lot of great photographs he sent
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.680]  us, we're going to get posted as well, that aren't with the Google video, and he protested
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.800]  the best way he could, and he shows what happened.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.960]  And it goes on from there, we wrote an article titled, Illegal Immigrants Above the Law at
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.200]  PrisonPlanet.com, it's in the News and Focus section, we'll be doing another update on
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.740]  this from the eyewitness reports of our guest, then the illegals, it's not enough to beat
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.380]  him up and have the cops beat him up, because the cops have been told, these people are
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.340]  here to destroy America, they're here to break down the borders, they're here to bring in
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.980]  the New World Order, they're here to bring in the North American Union, they're allowed
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.540]  to have bank accounts without ID cards, they're allowed to be above the law, and the cops
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.060]  know, I mean, they can shotgun or attack whoever they want with rubber bullets up close for
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.120]  no reason, but you do it to illegals in LA, you get fired, and that's the rule, so it's
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.820]  not enough that they beat up the car, knock out its windows, then they come over and put
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.120]  signs right by the cops while they're still shackling the man they've now bloodied and
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.400]  clearly loosened his teeth, busted his lips, smashed his nose, I mean, the blood isn't
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.400]  just dripping, it's gouting, gouts of it are spraying the ground, and mission complete,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.840]  America destroyed, one cut at a time, death by a million cuts, good job, police, you work
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.680]  for the New World Order.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.200]  With that said, that's just what I got from the video, the eyewitness, Josh Moore, who
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.200]  shot the video, is our guest, we appreciate him taking time out to join us today, Josh,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200]  good to have you on with us.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]  Thanks, how are you doing?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.200]  Good, it's good to have you here on the show, it was exciting to hear that you'd actually
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200]  heard me on the radio before and heard me on Coast to Coast, you kind of know where
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.200]  we come from, I've never pre-interviewed you though, my producer talked to you, Trey did,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.200]  just give me your views on what happened, what you witnessed, and anything else that,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.200]  you know, isn't in the short video you put up on Google.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200]  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I head down to Seattle to kind of check it out, never
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.200]  been to a protest rally like that, and I picked myself a high point on the street so I could
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.200]  get a nice view of how many people were coming down there, and there was a lot more protesters
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.200]  than I think was anticipated, and so it was pretty amazing.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.200]  You were also there to see a first-class citizen, I mean, as an American citizen, you have no
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.200]  rights, you're a complete slave now, you probably wanted to see an actual god.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200]  Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.200]  And I had these guys sitting there trying to recruit me down into the crowd to march
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.200]  with them, too, which was kind of amazing to me, every now and then some guys would
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.200]  come along and try to talk to you and try to get you out there, and I just said, just
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200]  watch, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200]  So as I'm sitting there watching everybody come down the street, I notice people start
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.200]  whistling and pointing, you know, kind of almost like they're having fun.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200]  You heard the whistles of gods.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.200]  Yeah, and they just threw cheer in and kind of waved into the guy, and I thought, huh,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]  what's going on over there?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200]  And I maybe missed a minute of the guy sitting there in his car, and so I walked around the
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.200]  corner and noticed the guy's hand out of the center of his car, and he was just sitting
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.200]  there, stone-cold face, you could tell he was a little bit petrified, but he was emboldened
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.200]  to do what he needed to do, which, you know, I was tempted to walk up to him and tell him
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]  to keep it up because everybody else was yelling at him.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200]  Yeah, and the revolution's going to start when all the American cases start killing
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200]  people in the streets, so don't worry, that's when their destruction comes, but please continue.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.200]  Oh, yeah, and so, you know, he's sitting there with his hand up, people are running by, hitting
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.200]  his car, slapping his hand, yelling at him, and one of the pictures you can see, one of
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.200]  the main instigators of the situation was reaching inside his car, you know, just screaming
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.200]  at him, and the guy, he never said anything to anybody.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.200]  Well, looks to me from the video they're grabbing on him, looks like they're grabbing his hair
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.200]  and other loving little gifts, but the cops, they know who's bad, not the guy being assaulted,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.200]  I mean, not the people doing the assaulting or attacking the vehicle, it's the evil American.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.200]  Oh, absolutely, and it was, you know, it really was, it was truly heartbreaking to see that,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.200]  you know, a guy has to stand up to invaders of his country and not fear them, but fear
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.200]  his own government, just basically ripping them down and taking them in while he's standing
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.200]  up to protect, you know, basically his own country, his own, I don't know, it's just
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.200]  really, it was really disturbing at the time.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.200]  Now, by the way, people then say, well, he was flipping off the gods, and that may have
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.200]  made the illegal aliens angry and they could have had a riot.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.200]  The point is, they run around hitting cars, knocking over trash cans, flipping people
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200]  off, that's routine, I've been to these events, and they're left alone.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.200]  So the point is, it's selective enforcement, again, the American citizen is, I like it
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.200]  for the right whale, because whalers are the right whale, it was sweet, it was nice, it
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.200]  put up with anything, we're the marks as American citizens, we're the people that are to be
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.200]  abused, but please continue.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.200]  Yeah, and, you know, so he's just sitting there, and just as I'm getting ready to walk
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.200]  up to the car, I see a couple police officers start to walk towards him, and I thought,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.200]  well, you know, maybe I should shoot this, shoot the video instead, and so basically
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200]  they just hollered at him to put his hand down, I think they told him twice, and I'm
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.200]  not even sure he could have heard the cops, it was so loud there.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200]  He might have seen the one officer.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200]  Heard the gods.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200]  Yes, heard the gods, excuse me.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:25.200]  And so, one officer walked up to him and basically reached inside his car, and as you can see
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.200]  in the video, they just, you know, basically drug him out.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.200]  They grabbed the serf slave.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.200]  Yes, and as soon as they grabbed the serf, he basically took his foot off the gas, or
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.200]  off the brake, because he had, I assume he had a stick.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.200]  He was in a red light, yeah.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200]  Yeah, and, yeah, because the protesters were blocking traffic, and the car rolled forward,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.200]  and what you can see in the video.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.200]  And of course, now they're going to charge him with trying to use a car as a weapon and
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]  working with Al Qaeda.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]  Oh, I'm sure.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200]  I mean, just watch him.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.200]  Yeah, and his car rolled forward, and there was a cop bicycle, because there are bicycle
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.200]  cops, of course, in Seattle, and it crushed one of the cop bikes underneath the car in
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.200]  front of him, and fortunately, actually, there was a bunch of people standing in the car
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.200]  just moments before, and nobody was hurt.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.200]  But he did crush the cop's bicycle, and that really pissed the cops off, and you can see
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.200]  when the car rolled forward, they just drug him out, and he went out really without protest.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.200]  He just wasn't sure what they were doing, and he stood up.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.200]  He had his hands behind his back, and then they just threw him to the ground face first,
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.200]  and then he beat the deal on his head.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]  Well, that's what we deserve.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.200]  You know, the cops throw fits.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.200]  I mean, in fact, a lot of times when cops in a raid shoot thrown officers, they just
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.200]  go ahead and throw a fit and shoot the whole family.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200]  It's just what they do.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200]  I mean, let them.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200]  Come on.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]  We deserve it.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200]  Yeah, it's always easier to take the less...
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.200]  Yeah, I mean, don't take on the foreigners that are usurping everything and screaming
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200]  death to America.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200]  Just go ahead and beat up an American citizen.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.200]  It's much easier.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.200]  Yeah, yeah, and you know, I think what even upset me at the time more was that everybody
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:04.200]  who was there taking pictures, media, was cheering on the cops, and afterwards, I had
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.200]  some guy tell me, you know, what a jerk to me about the guy that got thrown to the ground,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.200]  and he didn't say it so politely, and I kind of went over and had a few words with him,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]  but it just...
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.200]  I couldn't believe that somebody's thinking that he's a jerk.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200]  Now, you've just brought up the key here, because from Texas to California to Washington,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.200]  in the curriculum, they teach America is Latin American.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.200]  It belongs to Mexico, not just the Southwest, the whole country, that whites are evil, and
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200]  white teachers actually teach this.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200]  Black teachers teach it as well.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.200]  And of course, this is all federally funded to break the country up with the North American
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200]  Union.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200]  It's all part of balkanization.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.200]  And so, yeah, these are the type of cowardly yuppies who will stand there and have a celebration
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.200]  as the First Amendment in America dies, they think, as long as they agree with it, that
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.200]  somehow they've got personal power.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.200]  So you've just got to feel sorry for the people there, you know, the media and stuff celebrating
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200]  it, because they're just scum.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]  Yeah.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.200]  I mean, they think America is like a popularity contest.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200]  All they are is social climbing trash.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]  Yeah.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.200]  And they'd rather trash on the guy that's protesting the 20,000 illegal aliens instead
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.200]  of doing what they know really needs it to be done.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]  Exactly.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]  They're actually intimidated by it.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200]  They're scared by it at a subconscious level.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.200]  But they then see it as popular.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.200]  Oh, there's 20,000 for the destruction of America, and the North American Union, and
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.200]  Lowry Conquista and Greater Aslan, then I better go join that, and then I'll be on the winning
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]  team.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.200]  It's like people who pick a baseball or football team when they're in the finals and sure to
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]  win.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]  Yeah.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]  Absolutely.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200]  Yeah.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.200]  And, you know, the thing that was really frustrating about it is as there was, you know, multiple
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.200]  police officers there.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.200]  Multiple first-class gods.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200]  Multiple first-class gods.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.200]  And as they're arresting that, the serf, he, you know, there was people basically smashing
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200]  the guy's car.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.200]  You can't even see it in the pictures, them kneeing it and what have you.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200]  I did catch one guy ramming his body up against it where they broke out his window, and they
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]  didn't go after any of those guys.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.200]  Oh, no, they're two feet from police savagely ripping the vehicle.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200]  They've already attacked this guy.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200]  That doesn't matter, you see.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.200]  I mean, listen, we've got video now in Southern California where the illegals attacked this
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.200]  guy.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.200]  They come over and beat him to a pulp.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.200]  He tells the police, gives them video.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.200]  They're now charging him with the assault.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200]  You understand, sir?
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200]  Yeah.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.200]  Listen, we had Vicente Fox come to Austin and give awards to the Austin Police Department
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.200]  for not enforcing and not arresting illegals without a driver's license.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.200]  I mean, the APD are traitors to America.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.200]  And I don't mean every cop is, but the leadership and that organization is criminal.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]  Period.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.200]  Foreign leaders coming and giving you awards for destroying America?
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200]  And I'm not just putting words on this.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.200]  I mean, that's really what they're doing.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]  It's a machine.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200]  And, you know, the individual set aside the machine is definitely going in the wrong direction
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.200]  as far as the interest of Americans goes.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.200]  So, yeah, that's insane.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200]  It really is.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.200]  You don't know what to do as an American when you're in a situation like that.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.200]  If you stand up, you can lose your rights.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200]  You know?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200]  And that's all we have as Americans is our rights over illegals.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.200]  And apparently we don't even have that.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.200]  Well, I want to hear how they took him away.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.200]  Thank goodness he was so dangerous.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:34.200]  And did any of the dear, special, first-class people, did they hurt their knees on his car?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200]  Should they sue him?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.200]  Because by him not going along with what they were doing,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.200]  he forced them to physically attack him in the vehicle.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.200]  And maybe the officers should sue the man whose teeth they knocked out because he's evil.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.200]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.200]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.200]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.200]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.200]  causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.200]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.200]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:30.200]  cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.200]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:44.200]  Get the advanced Berkey Light purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium 888-803-4438

[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.200]  The Ron Paul for President Rally and Fundraiser will be at the Texas History Museum in Austin, Texas,
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:38.200]  at Congress and MLK on Saturday, May 19, from 6.30 till 10 p.m.

[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.200]  This atomic age of renegades.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.200]  We're the renegades of this atomic age.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.200]  This atomic age of renegades.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.200]  Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.200]  While down through the middle ages, planet Earth kept going through changes.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200]  And then the renaissance came.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200]  The times continued to change.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.200]  Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.200]  Like Chief Seymour, Tom Payne, Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.200]  They were renegades of their time and age.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.200]  The mighty renegades.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.200]  We're the renegades of funk.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200]  Yeah!
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.200]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.200]  Yeah, we're gonna deprogram all the commies, too. They can join the real rebellion.

[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.200]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.200]  Josh Moore is our guest.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200]  Josh, it is great to have you on.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.200]  In the last few minutes we've got together.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.200]  Anything else you want to add without me being satirical here?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.200]  This footage, for those that haven't seen it, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com on the right-hand side.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.200]  It says illegal aliens, illegal immigrants are above the law is the link.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.200]  You need to go read it if you haven't seen it and watch the video.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.200]  But for anything we couldn't see on the video or capture and then how it ended as they drug him away,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.200]  the huge celebration of pleasure?
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:52.200]  Yeah, well, you know, they basically did what you saw on the video and stood around and loitered around his car
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.200]  where they figured out, you know, what to do.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.200]  They had to get a tow truck there and they pranced him around the corner into a paddy wagon.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.200]  And they kind of dispersed everything.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:08.200]  What was interesting is I got a guy on YouTube who said he was in the paddy wagon with the guy.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.200]  And he said a whole group of protesters, including not the guy in the car but including some other people,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.200]  were holding up signs that were just simple anti-immigration signs
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.200]  and they were all detained inside the paddy wagon until the end of the protest.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.200]  Oh, my God, this just got 50 times worse.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.200]  You mean in Seattle they were scooping up anybody that didn't submit to the illegal aliens or Reconquista.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.200]  You see, Seattle, the Fed staged the riots there with 100 protesters they hired and funded.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200]  And we have this all on my film, The Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.200]  You can go watch it on Google Video or get the DVD from us.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.200]  Now I've got to hold you over. This is incredible news.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.200]  It's always worse than we say.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200]  And they were scooping people up.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:54.200]  And at Seattle I have on video where they go, no protesting is allowed anywhere in the city if you protest.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:00.200]  And they're searching bags and confiscating little anti-WTO pins in 1999.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.200]  Were you aware of that?
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.200]  I didn't know that happened, but I was aware of the WTO protest for sure.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.200]  My God, Seattle has got some of the worst.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.200]  But it's real liberal and real velvet glove type police state.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200]  But there's an iron fist inside.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.200]  Tell me more about the YouTuber you talked to. I must have contact.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.200]  Yeah, he makes his basic comment on the YouTube comments
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.200]  and said that basically he's in the paddy wagon with this guy.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.200]  And after everybody else was released, this guy that had the blood dripping from his face,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.200]  which was covered in blood by that time,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.200]  that he was the only one that was arrested is the one in the video.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.200]  Well, yeah, they have to arrest whoever they've abused
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.200]  because they've now got to false charge him to protect themselves.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.200]  Yeah, plus they destroyed somebody else's car, cop bicycle.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200]  They've got stuff they've got to charge somebody.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200]  See, that's why I hate the police system.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.200]  I don't hate the cops individually, but I just, I mean, the system is just totally gone.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.200]  Yeah, yeah, it's insane down there.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.200]  And after having that, I tried to look up to find out who the guy was.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.200]  I looked in the papers to see who was arrested.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.200]  And there were some people arrested at the event.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.200]  They had a guy that drove through the crowd.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.200]  But for some reason, they didn't list this guy as being arrested.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.200]  And I couldn't find out any information about it.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.200]  Yeah, I guarantee you the guy that drove through the crowd just guaranteed it was an accident.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.200]  But they probably beat him for two hours.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.200]  You're going to learn. This is Mexico. Yeah, we're going to beat you.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.200]  I mean, don't the illegal aliens get it that the system is behind them?
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.200]  They just stop acting like they're revolutionaries?
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.200]  Don't they understand that the man is behind them?
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.200]  Yeah, yeah, they've got a golden ticket in here, that's for sure.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.200]  And, you know, we put that on YouTube.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.200]  And I wasn't really sure what to expect.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200]  And, you know, it was amazing the number of people that were interested.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:52.200]  And I'd say 60% of the people who leave, you know, comments about the video were anti-immigration.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200]  But you get some real nutty people who are pro-immigration.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.200]  And the arguments don't make any sense. They're threatening, usually, you know.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.200]  And right now I think of 40,000-something people looked at it just in a week and a half.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.200]  Yeah, that's just one version of it. There's actually a score of versions.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.200]  I did an aggregate check of that. It looks like about 65,000 people have seen it.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.200]  Oh, really? Good, good, yeah.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.200]  Yeah, I noticed we got a lot of people, a lot of clicks from people from your website.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.200]  I mean, something like 12,000 just to our link there.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.200]  Well, I'm glad that you appreciate that.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.200]  Normally, folks, these videos we link to, they don't appreciate it.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.200]  They think it's some slight to send people to their videos.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.200]  I'll tell you what, let's talk about it a few more minutes on the other side.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]  Do you have time?
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]  Sure.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200]  Fantastic. We'll be right back.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.200]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.200]  Did you know that at the 29 Palm Marine Base located in California,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.200]  a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.200]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.200]  Would the Marines accept this?
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.200]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.200]  I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.200]  banned by the United States government.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.200]  Is this what Americans want, forced confiscation of guns?
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.200]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.200]  by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.200]  Concise, hard-hitting?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.200]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.200]  War in Iran? A coming One World Church?
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.200]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.200]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier,
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:22.200]  write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland 21609.

[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.200]  write to PO Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland 21609.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.200]  People who use Cartevite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.200]  For over five years, Cartevite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.200]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartevite.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.200]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.200]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.200]  it covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.200]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cartevite,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.200]  and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.200]  now going for a regular jog a few months later,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200]  we know we're doing something right.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.200]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.200]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.200]  and liver function is dead on.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.200]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]  and circulation problems.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.200]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.200]  or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:48.200]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:10.200]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:17.200]  Someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:25.200]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:33.200]  Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.200]  It's Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.200]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.200]  Josh Moore shot up a little handheld camera.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.200]  I tell you, they've been out for years, but now they're getting a lot better,
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.200]  just these little $200, $300 Sony-type handheld cameras I found are the best.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.200]  They can shoot video and the police still haven't figured out that they shoot video
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.200]  because cops will run up while you're under surveillance cameras that they put up
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.200]  and say, turn that off.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200]  Under what law?
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.200]  Under the destruction of America that I serve.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200]  I'm God.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200]  This is a third world pool now.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.200]  You do what we say.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.200]  But they don't freak out too much on the little cameras.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.200]  Though I was in Chicago last year and they did know what they were
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200]  and were like, turn those off there.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.200]  You're not allowed to tape us.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.200]  Didn't you get the memo?
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.200]  The country's dead.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.200]  And of course, that's basically what they're doing.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.200]  So I'm trying to get them to think about what they're doing.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.200]  And we're talking to Josh Moore who shot the video of this.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.200]  Do you know how many days ago that was in the YouTube comments?
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.200]  Because I want to go get that and I'm going to have Paul Watson do an article about it,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.200]  just about how you talk to folks that were saying that that's what they witnessed
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.200]  and I want to get those comments and post them into a part two on this story.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.200]  Elaborate on that and then just, what was it like to see them running up
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.200]  celebrating with signs right by the cops?
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.200]  And was there anything the camera didn't pick up going on on the periphery around you?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.200]  Yeah, well one of the things, as you mentioned, it was a small camera.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.200]  I was actually on my motorcycle that day so I didn't take my big camera with me.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.200]  And the one thing the video didn't pick up was the sounds as well as I'd like to.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.200]  And the stuff that people were saying, most of it's unrepeatable.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200]  It was just kind of a background, like a sports stadium, sure.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]  Yeah.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.200]  Let me guess, I've been to these, was it, you gringos are going to die, this is Mexico,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.200]  go back to Europe, go ahead and die, we're going to kill you, bleep bleep bleep?
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.200]  Nothing that intelligent.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:45.200]  Most of it was, this is our country, a lot of the f-word and that type of stuff.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.200]  You know, arrest them, take them down, that kind of thing.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.200]  You know, they didn't, they were just, I think, probably acting more on the moment,
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.200]  the people that were there.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.200]  But certainly some of the signs that people had that they were showing in front of the camera.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.200]  They were celebrating the death of the First Amendment.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.200]  Celebrating it, but notice, it's all selective.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.200]  Well, you know, what occurred to me is that, you know,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.200]  a majority of the people in this country are obviously citizens.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.200]  And if you're going to come to this country and want to become a citizen,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.200]  you'd want to make friends with these people, not sit there and get them arrested
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.200]  and cause conflict among these people because they're not going to be your friend,
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.200]  they're not going to let you in the country.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.200]  Well, here's the deal, you do this in Mexico, they will gun you down,
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.200]  not with rubber bullets, but with full metal jacket rounds, okay?
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.200]  So they get up here and then the media says, do it, it's yours, have fun,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.200]  because they want to foam in all this and they're just being used.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]  No idea.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.200]  But I mean, just to watch the cops, they're to make sure citizens can't protest,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.200]  they're to arrest people that were peacefully protesting,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.200]  they're to slam their faces into the ground and then frame them and set them up
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.200]  while just basically massaging the illegal aliens.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.200]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.200]  I mean, they gave them permission.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.200]  Of course, there was the fear that it might be a trick to deport everybody,
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.200]  but nobody really believed that.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.200]  And I certainly would have rather the police put their efforts into it.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200]  Oh, yeah, don't worry, you're not going to get deported illegals,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.200]  they're going to have a few show deportations to, you know, to full metal America,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.200]  you know, that supposedly something's been done.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.200]  You know, they'll deport 200,000 a year and cause a huge increase.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.200]  There's three plus million illegals, a million legals a year.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200]  Don't worry, you know, if America's legs were chopped off,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200]  they're just going to put a mandate on it.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.200]  They're not doing anything.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.200]  Don't worry, you're going to get to rule a giant third world cesspit.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.200]  Yeah, yeah, let's turn America into Mexico.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.200]  That's what we need.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.200]  Well, it's going to be far worse because it's just going to be a huge frothing mass
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.200]  of everyone hating each other and the government manipulating
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.200]  and pulling different strings to play different groups off against each other.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.200]  Well, you know, like I said before, they're hurting themselves by being our enemy,
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.200]  by being American citizens' enemy to the point where if they become citizens,
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.200]  how do we distinguish those people?
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.200]  Well, see, their leaders have been given the word.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]  Don't worry.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.200]  Whatever the American people do, we want a North American union.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.200]  You are going to be legalized.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]  Just come on.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]  And that's emboldened these people.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]  And then you're going to have a situation, I think,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.200]  where American citizens are going to have a lot of resentment
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.200]  towards the Mexican community in general.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]  Are you kidding?
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.200]  The illegal alien community, by and large, doesn't care.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200]  They love it.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.200]  They'll tell you in some restaurants, just get out.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200]  We don't want you here anyways.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200]  Yeah, well, you know, don't go.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.200]  There's other businesses, other restaurants then, I guess.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.200]  Well, the sad thing is, you know, Hispanic American citizens
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.200]  are some of the most patriotic, wonderful, nice, good people.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.200]  And they're integrated into society.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.200]  Their culture has merged with society and made it richer and better.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.200]  It's this new wave of illegal aliens and their supporters.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.200]  And unfortunately, I'd say they're about 30%, 40% of the 30 million that are here.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.200]  Another 20%, 30% are kind of on the fence.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.200]  And about 30% are great people.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.200]  And it's just hell on earth, brother.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200]  It's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.200]  And yeah, that guy that sent in the comments saying that he's in the paddy wagon,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.200]  you know, I emailed him once.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.200]  Yeah, I should almost ask him if he could give you any info there.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.200]  And because he's got some pretty incredible stories, I thought,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.200]  about, you know, being detained for protesting.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.200]  If you can get a hold of him, have him email his details.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.200]  It's just best if he writes up a statement to Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.200]  We can write an article around it.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.200]  Watson's so busy, he doesn't even really do interviews.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.200]  It's just better to have the info given to him.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.200]  Or he writes off my interviews on air.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.200]  We kind of multitask.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.200]  It's media fusion integration with a small crew.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.200]  Also, what you can do is you can interview him if you'd like
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.200]  and then send us the information.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.200]  Or you can meet back up with him and videotape it.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.200]  That would be a great part, too, to put on the web.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.200]  But this is definitely important to show the follow-up
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.200]  that it was everybody being stopped, because that's a racketeering,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.200]  that's a corrupt organization's criminal action by the city.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200]  And they should be sued for that.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.200]  Because it's not just that they did that to him,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.200]  that they did it to other peaceful people with signs.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.200]  That is a hardcore civil rights violation.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]  I mean, that is just unbelievable.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.200]  Well, and, you know, being down there, being in Seattle, period,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:30.200]  if you're at all right-wing, man, you're in a pack alone.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.200]  You know, going down to Seattle that day, I had to park really far away
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.200]  and walk through the streets probably, you know, a mile or two.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.200]  And there was all types of people walking the streets that day.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:46.200]  And, you know, I saw maybe five or six people that were anti-immigration
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200]  the entire day that I was there.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.200]  And obviously they were around, and there was a lot of people there.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.200]  But in Seattle, you don't realize how, you know, alone you feel in these views.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.200]  And you don't realize that there's other people out there.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.200]  And, you know, it's extremely liberal here.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200]  And when I put that on the Internet,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:12.200]  it was just amazing to see the numbers of people that responded to the YouTube,
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.200]  the number of people that were extremely passionate in their comments on there
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.200]  about what was going on.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.200]  And the links that I got from websites, you know, I got some from your website.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.200]  It's a website called newsnet14.com.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.200]  They gave us a huge number of hits.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.200]  It's just a really, you know, amazing response that we got on that video.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.200]  Well, we just appreciate the fine work you've done.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.200]  And this will illustrate from America, and it's going to get worse.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.200]  There will be public killings of citizens with cops helping.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.200]  And it will all just pave the way towards our victory against the New World Order.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.200]  This kind of stuff has to happen, just like the British soldiers had to engage
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.200]  in their crimes in front of everyone.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.200]  And it's going to be the same thing here.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.200]  And, again, we have an open hand to everybody who wants to join us,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.200]  black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.200]  You want to fight for America and the true fight?
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.200]  And all these fake conservatives that support the war,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.200]  the very people supporting the war are the ones dismantling our borders
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.200]  and dismantling our sovereignty.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.200]  Fox News is behind Hillary Clinton now.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200]  They're fundraising for her.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.200]  I mean, Josh, I don't know you well, but, I mean, you as a conservative,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.200]  have you figured out that there's the main line left
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.200]  and the phony conservatives are really snowing us and working together?
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.200]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.200]  You know, the whole George Bush deal, when he first came in, I was extremely hopeful.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.200]  And, you know, ever since he's been in office, it's been nothing but disappointment,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.200]  left-wing leanings, and it's just gotten further and further to the point
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.200]  where our now Republican Party is the old Democratic Party
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.200]  and, you know, just become liberal.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.200]  And the Democrats are the supreme and the Democrats are the supreme Soviet.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.200]  I would put it like the Republicans are the fascists
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.200]  and the Democrats are the communists, and in the middle they meet.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:11.200]  And it is quite a crowd of reckless, barbarous creatures that are just raping
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.200]  and subdividing and strip-mining the entire culture.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.200]  Good talking to you.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.200]  The video's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.200]  You can see there on the right-hand side, if you missed it, it says News & Focus,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.200]  and it's illegal immigrants are above the law, and they certainly are.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.200]  Go read the story, part two, coming in the next few days.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]  Good to have you on.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.200]  I'm going to have Mike Nelson call you right now, sir,
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.200]  and I appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.200]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.200]  Okay, there he goes, documenting what the government's little friends are doing.
