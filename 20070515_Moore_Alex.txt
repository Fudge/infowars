[00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:16.819]  Alright, so there's a bunch of illegal aliens in Seattle, Washington stomping around with their supporters yelling, this is Mexico, la reconquista.
[00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:20.642]  Pilgrims go home, the regular racist stuff.
[00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.943]  Anti-American stuff.
[00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:27.726]  And this guy's blocked in traffic, can't get to work, so he starts flipping them off.
[00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.447]  The illegals come over and physically assault him.
[00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:37.088]  The cops pull him off very lightly, as if they were touching the Pope or something, or the President.
[00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:48.076]  Then they grab him out of the car, because he dared be assaulted by the gods, and they slam his face down the concrete, blood's literally pouring out of his lips and nose.
[00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:52.519]  And our guest, Josh Moore, who just so happens to be a videographer,
[00:00:53.669 --> 00:01:01.474]  He happens to have his own little media company and took a lot of great photographs he sent us that are going to get posted as well that aren't with the Google video.
[00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:06.717]  And he protested the best way he could and he shows what happened.
[00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:07.758]  And it goes on from there.
[00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:12.061]  We wrote an article titled, Illegal Immigrants Above the Law at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.002]  It's in the News and Focus section.
[00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:19.085]  We'll be doing another update on this from the eyewitness reports of our guests.
[00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:22.107]  Then the illegals, it's not enough to beat him up and have the cops beat him up.
[00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:34.529]  Because, you know, the cops have been told, these people are here to destroy America, they're here to break down the borders, they're here to bring in the New World Order, they're here to bring in the North American Union, they're allowed to have bank accounts without ID cards, they're allowed to be above the law.
[00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:37.591]  And, uh, the cops know.
[00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:45.076]  I mean, they can shotgun or attack whoever they want with rubber bullets up close for no reason, but you do it to illegals in L.A., you get fired.
[00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:48.299]  And, you know, that's the rule.
[00:01:48.299 --> 00:02:00.649]  So, it's not enough that they beat up the car, knock out its windows, then they come over and put signs right by the cops while they're still shackling the man they've now bloodied and clearly loosened his teeth, busted his lips, smashed his nose.
[00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.552]  I mean, the blood isn't just dripping, it's gouting.
[00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:05.153]  Gouts of it are spraying the ground.
[00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:07.046]  And mission complete!
[00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:09.146]  America destroyed one cut at a time.
[00:02:09.146 --> 00:02:10.607]  Death by a million cuts.
[00:02:10.607 --> 00:02:12.568]  Good job, police.
[00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:14.588]  You work for the New World Order.
[00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:16.949]  With that said, that's just what I got from the video.
[00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.010]  The eyewitness, Josh Moore, who shot the video, is our guest.
[00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.752]  We appreciate him taking time out to join us today.
[00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:25.072]  Josh, good to have you on with us.
[00:02:25.072 --> 00:02:25.953]  Thanks.
[00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:26.393]  How you doing?
[00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:27.984]  Good.
[00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:29.546]  It's good to have you here on the show.
[00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:33.229]  It was exciting to hear that you'd actually heard me on the radio before and heard me on Coast to Coast.
[00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.710]  You kind of know where we come from.
[00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.572]  I've never pre-interviewed you, though.
[00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:38.214]  My producer talked to you.
[00:02:38.214 --> 00:02:39.014]  Trey did.
[00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:47.262]  Just give me your views on what happened, what you witnessed, and anything else that isn't in the short video you put up on Google.
[00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:50.025]  Yeah, well, I head down to Seattle to kind of check it out.
[00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:50.786]  I've never been to
[00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:05.183]  A protest rally like that and I picked myself a high point on the street so I could get a nice view of how many people were coming down there and there was a lot more protesters than I think was anticipated and so it was pretty amazing.
[00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:08.469]  You're also there to see a first-class citizen.
[00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.791]  I mean, as an American citizen, you have no rights.
[00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.292]  You're a complete slave now.
[00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:16.573]  You probably wanted to see an actual God.
[00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:17.314]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:17.314 --> 00:03:18.634]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:26.978]  And I had these guys sitting there trying to recruit me down into the crowd to march with them, too, which was kind of amazing to me.
[00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:31.740]  Every now and then, some guys would come along and try to talk to you and try to get you out there, and I just said, just watch.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.501]  You know, that kind of thing.
[00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:42.089]  As I'm sitting there watching everybody come down the street, I notice people start whistling and pointing, you know, kind of almost like they're having fun.
[00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.251]  You heard the whistles of gods.
[00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:46.272]  Yeah.
[00:03:46.272 --> 00:03:49.153]  And they just do cheering and kind of waving to the guy.
[00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:50.994]  And, you know, I thought, huh, what's going on over there?
[00:03:50.994 --> 00:03:54.997]  And, you know, I maybe missed a minute of the guy sitting there in his car.
[00:03:54.997 --> 00:04:00.420]  And so I walked around the corner and noticed the guy's hand out of the center of his car.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.662]  And he was just sitting there, stone-cold face.
[00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:09.586]  You could tell he was a little bit petrified, but he was emboldened to do what he needed to do.
[00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:14.709]  Which, you know, I was tempted to walk up to him and tell him to keep it up, because everybody else was yelling at him.
[00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.932]  Yeah, the revolution's gonna start when all American cases start killing people in the streets.
[00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:22.515]  So don't worry, that's when their destruction comes, but please continue.
[00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:30.941]  Oh yeah, and so, you know, he's sitting there with his hand up, people are running by, hitting his car, slapping his hand, yelling at him, and one of the pictures you can see
[00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:39.978]  One of the main instigators of the situation was reaching inside his car, you know, just screaming at him.
[00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:42.179]  And the guy, he never said anything to anybody.
[00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:44.000]  Well, it looks to me, from the video, they're grabbing on him.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.961]  It looks like they're grabbing his hair and other loving little gifts.
[00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:48.662]  But the cops, they know who's bad.
[00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:49.903]  Not the guy being assaulted.
[00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:53.025]  I mean, not the people doing the assaulting or attacking the vehicle.
[00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.126]  It's the evil American.
[00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:56.026]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:58.768]  And you know, it really was, it was truly heartbreaking to see
[00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.649]  That's
[00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:18.300]  It was really disturbing at the time.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.245]  Now by the way, people then say, well he was flipping off the gods and that may have made the illegal aliens angry and they could have had a riot.
[00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:29.467]  The point is they run around hitting cars, knocking over trash cans, flipping people off.
[00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:30.148]  That's routine.
[00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:32.409]  I've been to these events and they're left alone.
[00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.511]  So the point is it's selective enforcement.
[00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.492]  Again, the American citizen is
[00:05:37.452 --> 00:05:39.834]  I like it for the right whale, because whalers do the right whale.
[00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:42.815]  It was sweet, it was nice, it put up with anything.
[00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:47.658]  We're the marks, as American citizens, we're the people that are to be abused.
[00:05:47.658 --> 00:05:49.099]  But please continue.
[00:05:49.099 --> 00:06:01.306]  Yeah, and you know, so he's just sitting there, and just as I'm getting ready to walk up to the car, I see a couple of police officers start to walk towards him, and I thought, well, you know, maybe I should shoot this and shoot the video instead.
[00:06:01.306 --> 00:06:04.828]  And so basically they just hollered at him to put his hand down.
[00:06:04.828 --> 00:06:05.869]  I think they told him twice.
[00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.512]  And I'm not even sure he could have heard the cops.
[00:06:09.512 --> 00:06:11.133]  It was so loud there.
[00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:13.674]  He might have seen the one officer.
[00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.795]  Heard the gods.
[00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:17.316]  Yes, heard the gods.
[00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:18.377]  Excuse me.
[00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:24.420]  And so, one officer walked up to him and basically reached inside his car.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.002]  And as you can see in the video, they just basically drug him out.
[00:06:28.002 --> 00:06:30.744]  They grabbed the serf slave.
[00:06:30.744 --> 00:06:31.684]  Yes.
[00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:33.705]  And as soon as they grabbed the serf,
[00:06:35.393 --> 00:06:40.716]  He basically took his foot off the brake, because I assume he had a stick.
[00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:42.377]  He was at a red light, yeah.
[00:06:42.377 --> 00:06:47.900]  Yeah, because the protesters were blocking traffic and the car rolled forward.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.663]  And of course, now they're going to charge him with trying to use a car as a weapon and working with Al Qaeda.
[00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.244]  I mean, just watch him.
[00:06:56.244 --> 00:07:03.088]  Yeah, and his car rolled forward and there was a cop bicycle, because there are bicycle cops, of course, in Seattle.
[00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:07.258]  It crushed one of the cop bikes underneath the car in front of him.
[00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:12.879]  And fortunately, actually, there was a bunch of people standing in the car just moments before, and nobody was hurt.
[00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.799]  But he did crush the cop's bicycle, and that really pissed the cops off.
[00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:18.160]  And you can see when the car rolled forward, they just drug him out.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.520]  And he went out really without protest.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.700]  He just wasn't sure what they were doing.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.521]  And he stood up, he had his hands behind his back, and then they just threw him to the ground face first.
[00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:27.341]  Well, that's what we deserve.
[00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:28.202]  You know, the cops throw fits.
[00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:36.112]  I mean, in fact, a lot of times when cops in a raid shoot their own officers, they just go ahead and throw a fit and shoot the whole family.
[00:07:36.112 --> 00:07:37.352]  It's just what they do.
[00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:37.953]  I mean, let them.
[00:07:37.953 --> 00:07:39.514]  Come on, we deserve it.
[00:07:39.514 --> 00:07:48.639]  Yeah, you know, it's always easier to take the less... the less... Yeah, I mean, don't take on the foreigners that are usurping everything and screaming death to America.
[00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.540]  Just go ahead and beat up an American citizen.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.920]  It's much easier.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.761]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:59.264]  And, you know, I think what even upset me at the time more was that everybody who was there taking pictures, media,
[00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:02.003]  I don't think so.
[00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:28.239]  In the curriculum they teach America is Latin American.
[00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:31.601]  It belongs to Mexico, not just the Southwest, the whole country.
[00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:34.322]  That whites are evil and white teachers actually teach this.
[00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:36.263]  Black teachers teach it as well.
[00:08:36.263 --> 00:08:40.305]  And of course this is all federally funded to break the country up with the North American Union.
[00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:41.666]  It's all part of balkanization.
[00:08:42.503 --> 00:08:51.106]  And so, yeah, these are the type of cowardly yuppies who will stand there and have a celebration as the First Amendment and America dies.
[00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:55.587]  They think as long as they agree with it that somehow they've got personal power.
[00:08:55.587 --> 00:09:01.389]  So, you've just got to feel sorry for the people there, you know, the media and stuff celebrating it, because they're just scum.
[00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:02.950]  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.051]  I mean, they think America's like a popularity contest.
[00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:08.932]  All they are is social climbing trash.
[00:09:08.932 --> 00:09:12.033]  Yeah, and they'd rather trash on the guy that's protesting, but
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.263]  The 20,000 illegal aliens, instead of doing what they know really needs to be done.
[00:09:17.263 --> 00:09:17.823]  Exactly!
[00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:23.247]  They're actually intimidated by it, they're scared by it at a subconscious level, but they then see it as popular.
[00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:34.994]  Oh, if there's 20,000 for the destruction of America, and the North American Union, and La Reconquista, and Greater Oslon, then I better go join that and then I'll be on the winning team.
[00:09:34.994 --> 00:09:40.418]  It's like people who pick a baseball or football team when they're in the finals and sure to win.
[00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:41.799]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:42.443 --> 00:09:49.288]  Yeah, and you know, the thing that was really frustrating about it is as there was, you know, multiple, multiple police officers there.
[00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:51.489]  Multiple first-class gods.
[00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:53.891]  Yes, multiple first-class gods.
[00:09:53.891 --> 00:10:01.616]  And as they're arresting that, the serf, he, you know, there was people basically smashing the guy's car.
[00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:03.838]  You can't even see it in the pictures, them kneeing it.
[00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:04.834]  What have you?
[00:10:04.834 --> 00:10:09.155]  I did catch one guy ramming his body up against it, where they broke out his window.
[00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:10.995]  And they didn't go after any of those guys.
[00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:14.856]  Oh no, they're two feet from police, savagely ripping the vehicle.
[00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:16.276]  They've already attacked this guy.
[00:10:16.276 --> 00:10:18.557]  That doesn't matter, you see.
[00:10:18.557 --> 00:10:23.018]  I mean, listen, we've got video now in Southern California, where the illegals attack this guy.
[00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:24.898]  They come over and beat him to a pulp.
[00:10:24.898 --> 00:10:26.799]  He tells the police, gives them video.
[00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:28.319]  They're now charging him with the assault.
[00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:31.992]  You understand, sir?
[00:10:31.992 --> 00:10:39.793]  Listen, we had Vicente Fox come to Austin and give awards to the Austin Police Department for not enforcing and not arresting illegals without a driver's license.
[00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:43.174]  I mean, the APD are traitors to America.
[00:10:43.174 --> 00:10:47.994]  And I don't mean every cop is, but the leadership in that organization is criminal.
[00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:48.514]  Period.
[00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:53.695]  Foreign leaders coming and giving you awards for destroying America?
[00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.416]  And I'm not just putting words on this.
[00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:56.896]  I mean, that's really what they're doing.
[00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:07.450]  It's a machine, and you know, the individual set aside the machine is definitely going in the wrong direction as far as the interest of Americans goes.
[00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.632]  So, yeah, that's insane.
[00:11:10.632 --> 00:11:11.453]  It really is.
[00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:14.515]  You don't know what to do as an American when you're in a situation like that.
[00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:16.136]  If you stand up, you could lose your rights.
[00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:18.037]  You know?
[00:11:18.037 --> 00:11:22.980]  And that's all we have as Americans is our rights over illegals, and apparently we don't even have that.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.062]  Well, I want to hear how they took him away.
[00:11:25.062 --> 00:11:27.103]  Thank goodness he was so dangerous.
[00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:35.017]  And did any of the dear, special, first-class people, did they hurt their knees on his car?
[00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:36.859]  Should they sue him?
[00:11:36.859 --> 00:11:43.086]  Because by him not going along with what they were doing, he forced them to physically attack him in the vehicle.
[00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:47.832]  And maybe the officers should sue the man whose teeth they knocked out, because he's evil.
[00:11:49.722 --> 00:11:52.924]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:11:52.924 --> 00:11:57.107]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:11:57.107 --> 00:11:59.729]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:02.251]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:12:02.251 --> 00:12:10.756]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:12.197]  The brookie light is different.
[00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:16.220]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:16.740]  I think?

[00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.900]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:18.803 --> 00:17:20.743]  Josh Moore is our guest.
[00:17:20.743 --> 00:17:22.444]  Josh, it is great to have you on.
[00:17:22.444 --> 00:17:24.844]  In the last few minutes we've got together.
[00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:27.825]  Anything else you want to add without me being satirical here?
[00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:32.105]  This footage, for those that haven't seen it, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com on the right hand side.
[00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:36.106]  It says illegal aliens, illegal immigrants are above the law is the link.
[00:17:36.106 --> 00:17:38.507]  You need to go read it if you haven't seen it and watch the video.
[00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:45.508]  But for anything we couldn't see on the video or capture, and then how it ended as they drug him away, the huge celebration of pleasure,
[00:17:47.068 --> 00:17:55.054]  Yeah, well, you know, they basically did what you saw in the video and stood around and loitered around his car while they figured out, you know, what to do.
[00:17:55.054 --> 00:18:02.660]  They had to get a tow truck there and they pranced him around the corner into a paddy wagon and kind of dispersed everything.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:08.885]  What was interesting is I got a guy on YouTube who said he was in the paddy wagon with the guy.
[00:18:08.885 --> 00:18:14.029]  And he's had a whole group of protesters, including not the guy in the car, but including some other people.
[00:18:14.508 --> 00:18:22.974]  We're holding up signs that were just simple anti-immigration signs and they were all detained inside the paddy wagon until the end of the protest.
[00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:25.596]  Oh my God, this just got fifty times worse.
[00:18:25.596 --> 00:18:31.140]  You mean in Seattle they were scooping up anybody that didn't submit to the illegal aliens, Laurie Conquista?
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.664]  You see, Seattle, the feds staged the riots there with a hundred protesters they hired and funded.
[00:18:36.664 --> 00:18:39.566]  We have this all on my film, The Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:18:39.566 --> 00:18:40.707]  You can go watch it on Google Video.
[00:18:42.867 --> 00:18:43.828]  Now I've got to hold you over.
[00:18:43.828 --> 00:18:44.968]  This is incredible news.
[00:18:44.968 --> 00:18:46.928]  It's always worse than we say.
[00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:49.189]  And they were scooping people up.
[00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:50.049]  And it's Seattle.
[00:18:50.049 --> 00:18:54.690]  I have on video where they go, no protesting is allowed anywhere in the city if you protest.
[00:18:54.690 --> 00:19:00.252]  And they're searching bags and confiscating little anti-WTO pins in 1999.
[00:19:00.252 --> 00:19:01.532]  Were you aware of that?
[00:19:02.613 --> 00:19:06.215]  I didn't know that happened, but I wasn't aware of the WTO protest, for sure.
[00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:13.601]  My God, Seattle has got some of the worst, but it's real liberal and real velvet glove type police state, but there's an iron fist inside.
[00:19:13.601 --> 00:19:15.643]  Tell me more about the YouTuber you talked to.
[00:19:15.643 --> 00:19:18.245]  I must have contact.
[00:19:18.245 --> 00:19:30.534]  Yeah, he makes a basic comment on the YouTube comments, and said that basically he's in the paddy wagon with this guy, and after everybody else was released, this guy that had the blood dripping from his face, he said he was just covered in blood by that time.
[00:19:31.397 --> 00:19:35.219]  Um, that he was the only one that was arrested, is the one in the video.
[00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:41.702]  Well, yeah, they have to arrest whoever they've abused, because they've now got a false charge him to protect themselves.
[00:19:41.702 --> 00:19:46.084]  Yeah, plus they destroyed somebody else's car, cop bicycles, they've got stuff they gotta charge someone.
[00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:47.885]  See, that's why I hate the police system.
[00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:52.628]  I don't hate the cops individually, but I, I just, I mean, it's, the system is just totally gone.
[00:19:52.628 --> 00:19:55.229]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:56.130]  It's insane down there.
[00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.831]  And, and you know, and after having that, I tried to look up to find out who the guy was.
[00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:00.872]  I looked in the papers.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.463]  To see who was arrested, and there were some people arrested at the event.
[00:20:04.463 --> 00:20:07.385]  You know, they had a guy that drove through the crowd.
[00:20:08.349 --> 00:20:12.991]  But for some reason they didn't list this guy as being arrested, and I couldn't find out any information about it.
[00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:19.474]  Yeah, I guarantee you the guy that drove through the crowd, it was guaranteed it was an accident, but they probably casually beat him for two hours.
[00:20:19.474 --> 00:20:20.334]  You're gonna learn!
[00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:21.314]  This is Mexico!
[00:20:21.314 --> 00:20:23.095]  Yeah, we're gonna beat you!
[00:20:23.095 --> 00:20:27.657]  I mean, don't the illegal aliens get it that the system is behind them?
[00:20:27.657 --> 00:20:29.918]  They need to stop acting like they're revolutionaries.
[00:20:29.918 --> 00:20:33.099]  Don't they understand that the man is behind them?
[00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:34.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.101]  They've got a golden ticket in here, that's for sure.
[00:20:38.158 --> 00:20:44.064]  And, uh, you know, we put that on YouTube and I, you know, wasn't really sure what to expect.
[00:20:44.064 --> 00:20:46.767]  And, you know, it was amazing the number of people that were interested.
[00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:57.459]  And I'd say 60% of the people who leave, you know, comments about the video were anti-immigration, but you get some real nutty people who are pro-immigration and the arguments don't make any sense.
[00:20:57.459 --> 00:20:59.581]  They're threatening usually, you know.
[00:21:00.422 --> 00:21:05.689]  And right now I think 40,000 something people looked at it just in a week and a half.
[00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:07.131]  Yeah, that's just one version of it.
[00:21:07.131 --> 00:21:09.835]  There's actually a score of versions.
[00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.417]  I did an aggregate check of that.
[00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:14.020]  It looks like about 65,000 people have seen it.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.561]  Oh really?
[00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:15.402]  Good, good.
[00:21:15.402 --> 00:21:17.084]  Yeah, I noticed we got a lot of
[00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.512]  People, a lot of clicks from people from your website.
[00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:24.655]  I mean, something like 12,000 just to our link there.
[00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:26.296]  Well, I'm glad that you appreciate that.
[00:21:26.296 --> 00:21:28.638]  Normally, folks, these videos we link to, they don't appreciate it.
[00:21:28.638 --> 00:21:31.420]  They think it's some slight to send people to their videos.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.742]  I tell you what, let's talk about it a few more minutes on the other side.
[00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:34.542]  Do you have time?
[00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:35.543]  Sure.
[00:21:35.543 --> 00:21:36.043]  Fantastic.
[00:21:36.043 --> 00:21:39.426]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:40.807]  We're on the march.
[00:21:40.807 --> 00:21:43.349]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:46.031]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:51.923]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:58.748]  Did you know that at the 29 Pond Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[00:21:58.748 --> 00:22:03.492]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[00:22:03.492 --> 00:22:05.153]  Would the Marines accept this?
[00:22:05.153 --> 00:22:15.701]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:17.921]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.222]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[00:22:20.222 --> 00:22:28.564]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:04.807 --> 00:23:06.449]  A coming One World Church?
[00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:13.014]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:53.382]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:56.944]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:23:56.944 --> 00:24:00.706]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:03.968]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:24:03.968 --> 00:24:09.471]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:14.634]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[00:24:14.974 --> 00:24:15.474]  No, I'm good.

[00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:13.170]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.032]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:25:16.032 --> 00:25:20.515]  Someone who cares.
[00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:25.399]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.633]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:25:31.633 --> 00:25:34.996]  Someone who's there.
[00:25:34.996 --> 00:25:36.457]  It's Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:36.457 --> 00:25:38.859]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:42.382]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:42.382 --> 00:25:46.426]  Josh Moore shot a little handheld camera.
[00:25:46.426 --> 00:25:49.068]  I tell you, they've been out for years, but now they're getting a lot better.
[00:25:49.068 --> 00:25:54.573]  Just these little $200, $300 Sony type handheld cameras I found are the best.
[00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:55.494]  And they can shoot video.
[00:25:56.155 --> 00:26:03.437]  And the police still haven't figured out that they shoot video because cops will run up while you're under surveillance cameras that they put up and say, turn that off!
[00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:04.418]  Well, under what law?
[00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:07.379]  Under the destruction of America that I serve!
[00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:08.199]  I'm God!
[00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:10.760]  This is the third world pool now!
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.820]  You do what we say!
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.181]  But they don't freak out too much on the little cameras.
[00:26:15.925 --> 00:26:22.450]  Though I was in Chicago last year, and they did know what they were, and were like, Turn those off, yeah!
[00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.552]  You're not allowed to tape us!
[00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:26.033]  Didn't you get the memo?
[00:26:26.033 --> 00:26:27.254]  The country's dead!
[00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:28.595]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:33.619]  And of course, that's basically what they're doing, so I'm trying to get them to think about what they're doing.
[00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:35.901]  And we're talking to Josh Moore, who shot the video of this.
[00:26:37.381 --> 00:26:41.524]  Yeah, do you know how many days ago that was in the YouTube comments?
[00:26:41.524 --> 00:26:42.444]  Because I want to go get that.
[00:26:42.444 --> 00:26:44.905]  I'm going to have Paul Watson do an article about it.
[00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:49.268]  Just about how you talked to folks that were saying that that's what they witnessed.
[00:26:49.268 --> 00:26:53.150]  I want to get those comments and post them and do a part two on this story.
[00:26:53.150 --> 00:27:00.054]  Elaborate on that and then just what was it like to see him running up celebrating with signs right by the cops?
[00:27:00.054 --> 00:27:04.357]  And was there anything the camera didn't pick up going on on the periphery around you?
[00:27:05.225 --> 00:27:08.367]  Yeah, well, one of the things, you know, as you mentioned, it was a small camera.
[00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:12.490]  I was actually on my motorcycle that day, so I didn't take my big camera with me.
[00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:19.254]  And the one thing the video didn't pick up was the sounds, as well as I'd like to, and the stuff that people were saying.
[00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:22.577]  Most of it's unrepeatable.
[00:27:22.577 --> 00:27:26.561]  It was just kind of a background, like a sports stadium, sure.
[00:27:26.561 --> 00:27:27.461]  Yeah.
[00:27:27.461 --> 00:27:36.590]  Let me guess, I've been to these, was it, you gringos are going to die, this is Mexico, go back to Europe, go ahead and die, we're going to kill you, bleep bleep bleep?
[00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.211]  Nothing that intelligent.
[00:27:38.211 --> 00:27:45.398]  Most of it was, you know, this is our country, you know, a lot of the F word and that type of stuff.
[00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.932]  You know, arrest them, take them down, that kind of thing.
[00:27:49.932 --> 00:27:55.574]  You know, they didn't... They were just, I think, probably acting on the moment, the people that were there.
[00:27:55.574 --> 00:28:03.598]  But certainly some of the signs that people had, that they were showing in front of the cameras... They were celebrating the death of the First Amendment!
[00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:04.438]  Celebrating it!
[00:28:04.438 --> 00:28:07.759]  But notice, it's all selective!
[00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:13.722]  Well, you know, what occurred to me is that, you know, a majority of the people in this country are obviously citizens.
[00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:20.935]  And if you're going to come to this country and want to become a citizen, you'd want to make friends with these people, not sit there and get them arrested.
[00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:25.484]  And cause conflict among these people because they're not going to be your friend.
[00:28:25.484 --> 00:28:26.664]  They're not going to let you in the country.
[00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:27.404]  Look, here's the deal.
[00:28:27.404 --> 00:28:33.947]  You do this in Mexico, they will gun you down, not with rubber bullets, but with full metal jacket rounds, okay?
[00:28:33.947 --> 00:28:40.850]  So they get up here, and then the media says, do it, it's yours, have fun, because they want to foment all this, and they're just being used.
[00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.230]  They have no idea.
[00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:48.693]  But I mean, just to watch the cops, they're to make sure citizens can't protest, they're to arrest people that were peacefully protesting,
[00:28:49.113 --> 00:28:56.678]  They're to slam their faces into the ground and frame them and set them up, while just basically massaging the illegal aliens.
[00:28:56.678 --> 00:28:59.200]  I mean, it's just disgusting!
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.601]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:01.901]  I mean, they gave them permission.
[00:29:01.901 --> 00:29:13.289]  Of course, there was the fear that it might be a trick to deport everybody, but nobody really believed that, and I certainly would have rather the police put their efforts... Oh yeah, don't worry, you're not going to get deported illegals.
[00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:17.692]  They're going to have a few show deportations to fool middle America.
[00:29:18.212 --> 00:29:22.995]  Well, it's going to be far worse because it's just going to be a huge frothing mass of everyone hating each other and the government manipulating and
[00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:51.692]  Pulling different strings to play different groups off against each other.
[00:29:51.692 --> 00:30:02.420]  Well, you know, like I said before, they're hurting themselves by being our enemy, by being American citizens' enemy, to the point where if they become citizens, how do we distinguish those people?
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:11.207]  But see, their leaders have been given the word, don't worry, whatever the American people do, we want a North American Union, you are going to be legalized, just come on.
[00:30:11.207 --> 00:30:12.568]  And that's emboldened these people.
[00:30:13.286 --> 00:30:20.369]  And then you're going to have a situation, I think, where American citizens are going to have a lot of resentment towards the Mexican community in general.
[00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:20.970]  Are you kidding?
[00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.011]  The illegal alien community, by and large, doesn't care.
[00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:23.671]  They love it.
[00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:25.692]  They'll tell you in some restaurants, just get out.
[00:30:25.692 --> 00:30:27.293]  We don't want you here anyways.
[00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:28.713]  Yeah, well, you know, don't go.
[00:30:32.656 --> 00:30:40.822]  Well, the sad thing is, Hispanic American citizens are some of the most patriotic, wonderful, nice, good people, and they're integrated into society.
[00:30:40.822 --> 00:30:43.945]  Their culture has merged with society and made it richer and better.
[00:30:43.945 --> 00:30:46.907]  It's this new wave of illegal aliens and their supporters
[00:30:47.547 --> 00:30:51.890]  And unfortunately, I'd say there are about 30-40% of the 30 million that are here.
[00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.652]  Another 20-30% are kind of on the fence.
[00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.673]  And about 30% are great people.
[00:30:56.673 --> 00:30:58.334]  And it's just hell on earth, brother.
[00:30:58.334 --> 00:31:00.775]  It's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:02.616]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:02.616 --> 00:31:11.602]  And yeah, that guy that sent in the comments saying that he's in the paddy wagon, you know, I emailed him once.
[00:31:11.602 --> 00:31:16.285]  Yeah, I should almost ask him if he could give you any info there.
[00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:26.143]  Because he's got some pretty incredible stories, I thought, about being detained for protesting.
[00:31:26.143 --> 00:31:28.884]  If you can get a hold of him, have him email his details.
[00:31:28.884 --> 00:31:32.887]  It's just best if he writes up a statement to Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:31:32.887 --> 00:31:34.648]  We can write an article around it.
[00:31:34.648 --> 00:31:36.689]  Watson's so busy, he doesn't even really do interviews.
[00:31:36.689 --> 00:31:38.350]  It's just better to have the info given to him.
[00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.391]  Or he writes off my interviews on air.
[00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:41.732]  We kind of multitask.
[00:31:41.732 --> 00:31:44.874]  It's media fusion integration with a small crew.
[00:31:45.965 --> 00:31:52.712]  Also, what you can do is, you can interview him if you'd like and then send us the information, or you can meet back up with him and videotape it.
[00:31:52.712 --> 00:31:56.176]  That'd be a great part two to put on the web.
[00:31:56.176 --> 00:32:08.989]  But this is definitely important to show the follow-up that it was everybody being stopped, because that's a racketeering, that's a corrupt organization's criminal action by the city, and they should be sued for that.
[00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:14.032]  Because it's not just that they did that to him, that they did it to other peaceful people with signs.
[00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.674]  That is a hardcore civil rights violation.
[00:32:16.674 --> 00:32:17.254]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:32:17.254 --> 00:32:19.476]  I mean, that is just unbelievable.
[00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:29.282]  Well, and you know, being down there, being in Seattle, period, if you're at all right-wing, man, you're in a pack alone.
[00:32:30.052 --> 00:32:36.954]  Uh, you know, going down to Seattle that day, I had to park really far away and walk through the streets, probably, you know, a mile or two.
[00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:40.455]  And there was all types of people walking the streets that day.
[00:32:40.455 --> 00:32:47.858]  And, uh, you know, I saw maybe five or six people that were anti-immigration the entire day that I was there.
[00:32:47.858 --> 00:32:51.339]  And obviously they were around and there was a lot of people there.
[00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:57.040]  But in Seattle, you don't realize how, you know, alone you feel in this, in these views.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.961]  And you don't realize that there's other people out there.
[00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:03.172]  And, you know, it's extremely liberal here.
[00:33:03.172 --> 00:33:19.517]  And when I put that on the Internet, it was just amazing to see the numbers of people that responded to the YouTube, the numbers of people that were extremely passionate in their comments on there about what was going on.
[00:33:19.517 --> 00:33:26.759]  And the links that I got from websites, you know, I got some from your website, a website called Newsnet14.com.
[00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:28.199]  They gave us a huge number of hits.
[00:33:28.963 --> 00:33:31.725]  Well, we just appreciate the fine work you've done.
[00:33:39.342 --> 00:33:41.543]  This will illustrate from America, and it's going to get worse.
[00:33:41.543 --> 00:33:49.248]  There'll be public killings of citizens with cops helping, and it'll all just pave the way towards our victory against the New World Order.
[00:33:49.248 --> 00:33:54.771]  This kind of stuff has to happen, just like the British soldiers had to engage in their crimes in front of everyone.
[00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:57.532]  And it's going to be the same thing here.
[00:33:57.532 --> 00:34:02.535]  And again, we have an open hand to everybody who wants to join us, black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[00:34:02.535 --> 00:34:04.416]  You want to fight for America and the true fight?
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.742]  And all these fake conservatives that support the war.
[00:34:07.742 --> 00:34:13.605]  The very people supporting the war are the ones dismantling our borders and dismantling our sovereignty.
[00:34:13.605 --> 00:34:16.347]  Fox News is behind Hillary Clinton now.
[00:34:16.347 --> 00:34:18.148]  They're fundraising for her.
[00:34:18.148 --> 00:34:28.614]  I mean, Josh, I don't know you well, but you as a conservative, have you figured out that there's the mainline left and the phony conservatives are really snowing us and working together?
[00:34:29.134 --> 00:34:30.115]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:34:30.115 --> 00:34:37.498]  Yeah, you know, and the whole George Bush deal, when he first came in, I was extremely hopeful.
[00:34:37.498 --> 00:34:51.164]  And, you know, ever since he's been in office, it's been nothing but disappointment, left-wing leanings, and it's just gotten further and further to the point where our now Republican Party is the old Democratic Party.
[00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:53.445]  And, you know, just become liberal.
[00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:56.606]  And the Democrats are the Supreme, and the Democrats are the Supreme Soviet.
[00:34:57.819 --> 00:34:58.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:14.550]  I would put it like the Republicans are the fascists and the Democrats are the communists and in the middle they meet and it is quite a crowd of reckless, barbarous creatures that are just raping and subdividing and strip-mining the entire culture.
[00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.331]  Good talking to you.
[00:35:15.331 --> 00:35:16.432]  The video's up on
[00:35:17.152 --> 00:35:18.132]  PresentPlanet.com.
[00:35:18.132 --> 00:35:21.434]  You can see there on the right hand side, if you missed it, it says News in Focus.
[00:35:21.434 --> 00:35:25.915]  And it's illegal immigrants are above the law, and they certainly are.
[00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:28.496]  Go read the story, part two, coming in the next few days.
[00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:29.357]  Good to have you on.
[00:35:29.357 --> 00:35:34.779]  I'm going to have Mike Nelson call you right now, sir, and I appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:36.379]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:41.401]  Okay, there he goes, documenting what the government's little friends are doing.
