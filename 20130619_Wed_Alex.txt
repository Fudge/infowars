[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:29.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.800]  Well, strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because every day, more revelations come out
[00:35.800 --> 00:42.200]  than would come out in a year, when I first got on air 18 years ago. I mean, it is all
[00:42.200 --> 00:48.220]  just coming out in the open and really making so much of what I talk about passÃ©. But it's
[00:48.220 --> 00:52.360]  not passÃ© because people are now getting, whoa, this is real. And so some people are
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.840]  trying to rationalize in their mass Stockholm syndrome what's happening because of their
[00:57.840 --> 01:04.240]  learned helplessness and because they don't believe they have any power, while the rest
[01:04.240 --> 01:08.480]  of us are really going, man, how deep does the rabbit hole go?
[01:08.480 --> 01:16.920]  And I'm here to tell you, my consciousness and my limited cerebral focus cannot even
[01:16.920 --> 01:22.920]  image the hundreds of thousands of admitted tyrannies that I've researched and documented
[01:22.920 --> 01:29.600]  and others have documented. I can only focus in maybe on 50 at a time in my mind. Most
[01:29.600 --> 01:36.140]  people can't even focus in on one. And it is truly information overload. And when you
[01:36.140 --> 01:46.840]  know what's going on, you realize how naked the establishment is in their brazen, craven
[01:46.840 --> 01:48.200]  sneakiness and deception.
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.160]  I mean, it is just naked. Let me just give you some of the headlines here that are coming
[01:53.160 --> 02:02.340]  up. FBI director admits domestic use of drones as if I need him to tell me about admitted
[02:02.340 --> 02:08.320]  programs. Now, is there an apology to infoawards.com? To drudgereport.com when the White House run
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.200]  media matters and others ran with national stories, got picked up by the AP a few years
[02:12.200 --> 02:16.520]  ago saying we made it up and that there are no drones domestically, even though we had
[02:16.520 --> 02:19.160]  mainstream articles where it was happening around the country.
[02:19.160 --> 02:23.880]  They came out and said, we're liars. It's not true. Kind of like Rachel Maddow said
[02:23.880 --> 02:30.040]  that. I said Obama sent the tornado to Oklahoma City and they're still running out every week.
[02:30.040 --> 02:37.600]  That lie lying to their pathetic audience. They do have a pathetic audience is the pathetic
[02:37.600 --> 02:48.620]  Nabob rubes begging to be enslaved by the ultra Hitlerian fascist of the New World Order.
[02:48.620 --> 02:54.880]  So here is the article FBI director admits domestic use of drones in front of Congress
[02:54.880 --> 03:02.640]  yesterday. Michael Hastings, the one that did a real investigative report that brought
[03:02.640 --> 03:09.840]  down McChrystal. Rolling Stone contributor dead at 33. He died in a car wreck. And there's
[03:09.840 --> 03:10.840]  some real car wrecks.
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.340]  You could believe that if it wasn't so many investigative journalists committing suicide
[03:15.340 --> 03:21.400]  or murder, suicide or falling out of buildings or getting hit by cars or anything else. So
[03:21.400 --> 03:40.040]  there's that article. Rolling Stone reporting. Michael Hastings, Rolling Stone contributor
[03:40.040 --> 03:53.560]  dead at 33. Continuing with some of the headlines, Ron Paul dollar will collapse. Gold will go
[03:53.560 --> 03:59.160]  to infinity. And Ron Paul is joining us here about 25 minutes from now.
[03:59.160 --> 04:05.360]  So we're gonna be asking him about that. That story just went live up at infowars.com. And
[04:05.360 --> 04:13.280]  he said that yesterday on CNBC. Ron Paul, dollar will collapse, gold will go to infinity.
[04:13.280 --> 04:21.600]  So those are some interesting headlines. And then here's another one. This is out of Bloomberg.
[04:21.600 --> 04:30.880]  And it's reporting on a Harvard public health school long term study. Autism tied to air
[04:30.880 --> 04:37.360]  pollution brain wiring disconnection and guess what they found it was? Mercury. But being
[04:37.360 --> 04:42.080]  government finance, they're gonna say it's diesel fuel that's very low in mercury instead
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.640]  of what's in the food in the water and what's being injected in people.
[04:45.640 --> 04:52.280]  So I thought we'd go over that as well. That's just some of what's coming up here today.
[04:52.280 --> 05:00.280]  And Miss USA, as usual, is pushing the NSA worship police state. So stay with us.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.740]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[05:05.740 --> 05:11.000]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.280]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight
[05:15.280 --> 05:20.240]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are we all are
[05:20.240 --> 05:25.200]  food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[05:25.200 --> 05:30.040]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[05:30.040 --> 05:34.600]  with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient dense food you can store

[06:05.600 --> 06:12.360]  has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately
[06:12.360 --> 06:19.360]  and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to
[06:19.360 --> 06:25.040]  the Hollywood media brainwashing machine. We are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas
[06:25.040 --> 06:29.640]  that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and
[06:29.640 --> 06:33.400]  testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All
[06:33.400 --> 06:37.840]  of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the
[06:37.840 --> 06:43.760]  opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war. I
[06:43.760 --> 06:48.160]  thought of another one, another plane just hit. State of Mind, because there's a war

[07:58.880 --> 08:16.280]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[08:16.280 --> 08:33.200]  the info war. Ladies and gentlemen, there is unrest all over the world from Turkey to
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.560]  Brazil against the big government and the police state. We're going to be breaking all
[08:38.560 --> 08:44.800]  of that down. The FBI director has admitted to Congress, which was already going on publicly,
[08:44.800 --> 08:51.400]  massive drone program going on spying on the American people. But he whitewashes it and
[08:51.400 --> 08:58.440]  basically says that it is no big deal. We've got Congressman Ron Paul joining us in about
[08:58.440 --> 09:05.540]  25 minutes from now. Then we have the comedian Tom Mabe, who went out with a boom microphone
[09:05.540 --> 09:09.960]  and would stick it in the middle of people's public conversations. And when they got mad,
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.440]  he said, I'm the NSA. I mean, I'm already spying on you might as well just go public.
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.400]  She's going to be popping in with us. And then Janae Gerard, one of the main plaintiffs
[09:19.400 --> 09:24.440]  who's been on before in the Supreme Court case over patenting of jeans via breast cancer
[09:24.440 --> 09:29.160]  treatments. She's going to be in the studio with us and she's a survivor of that and one
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.160]  of the main plaintiffs.
[09:30.160 --> 09:34.520]  So that's some good news. We're going to be talking to her in the last 45 minutes of the
[09:34.520 --> 09:42.120]  broadcast today or so. I just can't get over mainstream news headlines yesterday saying
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.600]  Congress to have hearings on your cable box watching and listening to you. Is it a good
[09:48.600 --> 09:56.320]  idea? It's already going on. So see, we've gone from man, that's that crazy guy 15, 16
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.440]  years ago to yeah, so we're watching you and listening to you.
[10:02.440 --> 10:06.080]  What's the big deal? I mean, it's for your safety and I've got some clips coming up in
[10:06.080 --> 10:14.120]  a moment at the Miss USA event with the winner promoting warrantless DNA taking and the other
[10:14.120 --> 10:20.600]  ones being asked about NSA saying it makes them feel safe. Please listen to my phones
[10:20.600 --> 10:22.400]  such as South Africa.
[10:22.400 --> 10:29.440]  I mean, it is just absolutely over the top and that's why they've dumbed everybody down.
[10:29.440 --> 10:32.720]  And guaranteed these people have rod holes in their brains from the fluoride and the
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.400]  mercury. We're gonna be going over all that. And when Ron Paul joins us, we're gonna look
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.480]  at dollar will collapse. That's what he said on CNBC last night. He's joining us. He said
[10:42.480 --> 10:45.640]  gold will go to infinity.
[10:45.640 --> 10:50.200]  That's his quote and beyond to quote Buzz Lightyear. He didn't say that. He said we'll
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.820]  go to infinity is the quote. But they're just gonna slowly collapse the dollar from what
[10:55.820 --> 11:00.380]  I've seen and they're doing it. I mean, inflation is just unbelievable, but you have deflation
[11:00.380 --> 11:08.160]  in wages. So it's hyper stag inflation is what we're going towards and they're now getting
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.760]  ready to blame Bernanke.
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.440]  You're seeing all the articles that he's the ultimate lame duck and that there's the big
[11:14.440 --> 11:24.240]  drama. Will Obama pump up, give the orders to Bernanke to pump up the economy more with
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.720]  the fiat currency that still causes inflation or will they slacken it on and on and on.
[11:29.720 --> 11:34.160]  And even Obama and Bernanke are just puppets, very high level puppets, but they're still
[11:34.160 --> 11:39.760]  just go for still just puppets. But that Ron Paul video and that article that I think is
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.200]  extremely newsworthy is at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanted.com. Ron Paul dollar will
[11:45.200 --> 11:49.320]  collapse gold will go to infinity.
[11:49.320 --> 11:55.120]  So that is coming up on the congressman joins us. We'll get more in depth from him. The
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.800]  former congressman, Dr. Ron Paul, kind of the omni buds on the liberty movement. Let
[11:59.800 --> 12:03.000]  me, before I get into NSA stuff, there's a bunch of big developments there. Cover this
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.840]  first out of Bloomberg.
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.960]  Now again, the average person reads this and they think, good, they're admitting it's toxicity
[12:10.960 --> 12:21.000]  in the environment. So that's a good thing, a lot of people think. But what they're doing
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.440]  at the UN and what we've caught the EPA doing testing on college students is they're artificially
[12:26.440 --> 12:32.960]  pumping in 100, 200, 300, sometimes 1000 times the particulates was a big case in North Carolina
[12:32.960 --> 12:42.480]  of this secret testing into the test subjects work spaces to then get readings to say that
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.760]  all particulates out of a combustion engine is deadly poison when most of what comes out
[12:47.760 --> 12:51.400]  now is harmless. And again, I want to move away from these technologies.
[12:51.400 --> 12:54.000]  The problem is the globalist aren't going to let us do that. They're just going to tax
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.280]  the daylights out of it. So they're spinning all of this and saying it's only diesel engines.
[13:02.280 --> 13:06.920]  But you read the study doesn't even say that that are causing us to go from one in 25,000
[13:06.920 --> 13:10.960]  in the Western world in the last 60 years with autism to one in 50.
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.120]  The article says that it's now about one in 50 and it's not over diagnosis. Folks, kids
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.720]  that they don't even call autistic, you go to a restaurant, you go to a play, you go
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.040]  somewhere, the kids look like they're walking dead, most of them now. You can try to avoid
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.360]  these poisons all day and still your kids are gonna have health problems, cuz they're
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.280]  now second generation in all this.
[13:31.280 --> 13:36.600]  Children grew up with totally dirty coal plants putting pure poison into the air for the last
[13:36.600 --> 13:42.800]  200 years, 170 or so. Now they're completely clean with scrubbers, only carbon dioxide
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.320]  and water vapor comes out. They're trying to blame that now. They have dirty ones in
[13:46.320 --> 13:50.000]  Mexico and India and China, but not here.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.880]  And I'm all for them being clean. Now they won't even tax the carbon dioxide to make
[13:54.880 --> 13:58.760]  all our industry move to China where it's dirty, where the globalists have their investments.
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.160]  But the point I'm getting at here is the particular levels are much lower than it used to be.
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.260]  You can look at the studies. I mean, I've seen photos from the 30s and 40s and 50s in
[14:07.260 --> 14:12.640]  New York and Detroit and Tokyo where the skies were black with all the stuff coming out of
[14:12.640 --> 14:13.640]  the factories.
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.960]  And people had a lot of mental illness and a lot of madness and violence because of the
[14:17.960 --> 14:23.640]  mercury and the lead in the air. It is literally, look at the studies, thousands of times lower
[14:23.640 --> 14:29.000]  than it used to be. So the claim that factory particulate and car particulate is causing
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  this is balderdash.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.560]  You can look it up. I study this so much that I look at this study and I know it's bold.
[14:36.560 --> 14:44.080]  Now they say the main thing is mercury in these kids brains and mercury in the mothers.
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.560]  Now, where do you think you're getting mercury injected directly into your blood? And why
[14:49.560 --> 14:56.840]  does it hurt the boys? Why is it, what is it, a 15 fold, 16 fold in the US? Boys ratio
[14:56.840 --> 15:00.960]  girls that are autistic girls have a thicker blood brain barrier.
[15:00.960 --> 15:04.620]  Girls are tougher. Any doctor will tell you a woman comes in with five gunshot wounds.
[15:04.620 --> 15:09.960]  She lives, a man gets it, he's dead. Men die seven years earlier on average than women.
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.320]  Men are physically stronger, but they're not as tough as women. It's a scientific fact
[15:14.320 --> 15:17.640]  known for thousands of years.
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.200]  The issue here, you chop a guy's arm off, most of the time he ends up dying and getting
[15:21.200 --> 15:25.500]  a tourniquet on it. He goes into shock. Women can have limbs severed and they'll just go
[15:25.500 --> 15:28.520]  sit down and then they'll stop bleeding because they're designed to be able to have babies
[15:28.520 --> 15:31.000]  and go through a lot more trauma.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.520]  But let's get into this article. Autism tied to air pollution, brain wiring disconnection.
[15:37.520 --> 15:41.200]  Researchers seeking the roots of autism have linked the disorder, there's thousands of
[15:41.200 --> 15:45.600]  studies on this folks, to chemicals in air pollution. And a separate study found that
[15:45.600 --> 15:51.520]  language difficulties of the disorder may be due to a disconnect in brain wiring.
[15:51.520 --> 15:56.260]  Researchers at Harvard's University Public School of Health found that pregnant women
[15:56.260 --> 16:02.840]  exposed to high levels of diesel particulates, they're doing it to them, or mercury were
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.320]  twice as likely to have an autistic child compared with peers in low pollution areas.
[16:08.320 --> 16:13.480]  The findings published today in the Environmental Health Perspectives are from the largest US
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.080]  study to examine the ties between air pollution and autism.
[16:17.080 --> 16:21.240]  One in 50 US children are not diagnosed with autism or related disorder, it goes on. It's
[16:21.240 --> 16:26.680]  soon gonna be one in 15, then one in five, and then soon half of us won't be able to
[16:26.680 --> 16:30.520]  tie our shoelaces. And then of course, we'll have to euthanize everybody. That's why they're
[16:30.520 --> 16:33.240]  now announcing, hey, let's just euthanize the autistic kids.
[16:33.240 --> 16:36.400]  Hey, all the women are all getting breast cancer? Don't find out why, just cut your
[16:36.400 --> 16:42.520]  breast off. This is how they're medicalizing everything. This is their admitted plan. Bertrand
[16:42.520 --> 16:48.280]  Russell Club of Rome, go read it, 60 years ago, 80 years ago, 100 years ago, how they
[16:48.280 --> 16:51.400]  would toxify the environment with binary weapons.
[16:51.400 --> 16:55.680]  They'll have the cure for themselves, and then suck everything out of you with treatments
[16:55.680 --> 17:01.040]  that just kill you slowly. And then as soon as they've sucked your money out of you, they've
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.280]  got it all actuated out, what treatments to do to make sure that you get every bit of
[17:05.280 --> 17:06.440]  money out of you before you die.
[17:06.440 --> 17:10.520]  And that's why they have government healthcare telling the doctors what to do to carry that
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.300]  out. But if you're an insider, I mean, look at Dick Cheney, no one lives two years with
[17:15.300 --> 17:20.920]  a bionic heart pump. I mean, he lived a record time, and then he gets somebody else's heart
[17:20.920 --> 17:23.000]  and looked great on Fox News this weekend.
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.200]  The guy's had like seven heart attacks. Poorly drinks two bottles of vodka a day, stuff like
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.720]  that in the past. Why is he still going around? Because he gets the life extension, ladies
[17:33.720 --> 17:39.240]  and gentlemen, you don't get it. Someone explain something to you, there's less particulate
[17:39.240 --> 17:44.840]  in our sky now. Actually, aluminum's up and everything else is down, aluminum and barium
[17:44.840 --> 17:49.800]  cuz they're spraying that, but everything else is way down, look it up.
[17:49.800 --> 17:53.200]  But they don't care, ladies and gentlemen, they're gonna tell you it's that, to blame
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.320]  it on that, to wonder why everybody's becoming brain damaged. You take your kid in for the
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.500]  third round of shots, 18 months, that's the average, they have a convulsion on the spot.
[18:02.500 --> 18:05.680]  You better hope they do, the cops are gonna say you shook their brain and try to take
[18:05.680 --> 18:06.680]  them from you.
[18:06.680 --> 18:10.120]  If they don't have the convulsion, they're at the hospital, and they'll still try to
[18:10.120 --> 18:13.640]  blame you there. Look at cameras and say you beat them, cuz there'll be blood on the brain
[18:13.640 --> 18:19.460]  from the autoimmune response in your boy. Just brain damages your girl, but not as bad.
[18:19.460 --> 18:22.600]  You go into the third round, most people you talk to that have autistic kids, it happens
[18:22.600 --> 18:29.380]  third round, sometimes second round. And they just can't handle it. They're giving them
[18:29.380 --> 18:34.360]  hundreds of times what an adult can handle, and they've lobotomized your child.
[18:34.360 --> 18:41.640]  Now they're saying it's mercury, now what's in the vaccines? Thimerosal, mercury, thimerosal,
[18:41.640 --> 18:49.760]  mercury. So here it is, and David Knight actually working with a libertarian investigative think
[18:49.760 --> 18:56.040]  tank before he even moved down here from North Carolina, was helping investigate this, including
[18:56.040 --> 18:57.880]  undercover type stuff.
[18:57.880 --> 19:03.560]  We've broken it on the air about secret testing on people with 100 times to 1,000 times the
[19:03.560 --> 19:12.040]  particulate level that's safe to create these false readings. To again blame Particula not
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.360]  to actually fix the environment here, to shut off our industry. So they're gonna use, we've
[19:17.360 --> 19:23.400]  already predicted this, all the brain damage to be blamed on the combustion engine.
[19:23.400 --> 19:30.740]  And I'm not saying it doesn't add to the poisoning, the GMO, the shots, the pharmacological pesticides
[19:30.740 --> 19:38.480]  in the stuff, all of it, is linked in rodent studies to autism. So that's big news there.
[19:38.480 --> 19:43.040]  Also urgent action alert, EPA about to raise allowable concentrations of glyphosate on
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.000]  food crops, edible oils, and animal feed. One part per trillion of that doubles your
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.240]  cancer, breast cancer. They're putting, in some cases, thousands of times higher in there.
[19:53.240 --> 19:57.600]  You like dying, you're gonna enjoy this. We're gonna come back, get into the whole NSA situation.

[23:58.240 --> 24:22.240]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame. Everybody
[24:22.240 --> 24:29.120]  will be treated all the same. Ladies and gentlemen, there will be a golden letter reaching down.
[24:29.120 --> 24:36.480]  The Senate bill allows 46 million illegal immigrants inside the United States. That's
[24:36.480 --> 24:42.560]  the type of news we have. This is the plan to bankrupt this country. This is the plan
[24:42.560 --> 24:51.240]  to conquer this country via divide and conquer. Before I get into the whole NSA controversy,
[24:51.240 --> 24:57.280]  I wanna play a short clip here via the Atlantic Wire from the House Intelligence Committee
[24:57.280 --> 25:07.000]  yesterday when the NSA chief was talking to the deputy FBI director and said, tell your
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.440]  boss, NSA Director Keith Alexander told FBI Director, Deputy Director, I owe him another
[25:13.440 --> 25:15.600]  friggin beer.
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.640]  Because obviously this is totally illegal, everything the NSA is doing. The FBI already
[25:19.640 --> 25:24.880]  has all the NSA stuff. They have the translators inside the NSA, like C. Bell Edmonds. They
[25:24.880 --> 25:29.880]  just wanna be able to use it in court, but all jurisprudence says it's illegal. So they're
[25:29.880 --> 25:36.440]  all up there committing crimes and it's a joke, I'm gonna buy him another friggin beer.
[25:36.440 --> 25:44.600]  Let's go ahead and play that clip, here it is. And then, hey guys, we're having an issue
[25:44.600 --> 25:51.200]  with the computer in there. We're gonna play the NSA chief clip. We had a while since that
[25:51.200 --> 26:06.960]  TriCaster locked up like that, we're gonna do this right now, here we go.
[26:06.960 --> 26:19.160]  Thank you.
[26:19.160 --> 26:23.240]  So it's all funny to these criminals, they're all criminals up there. It's all a big joke
[26:23.240 --> 26:27.000]  to them. The government ships the drugs in and then hopes you use them to put up you
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.280]  in a prison. Everybody just stop being so stupid. Stop being so naive, we're in a lot
[26:32.280 --> 26:33.280]  of trouble.
[26:33.280 --> 26:39.120]  Now, let's go to the next clip. This is an article by Kit Daniels that went up on infowars.com
[26:39.120 --> 26:51.760]  last night, if you wanna go see it. Miss USA contestants promote NSA spy grit. And here
[26:51.760 --> 27:02.760]  is one of the clips that we're going to get to here on air right now, where the Miss Alabama
[27:02.760 --> 27:08.440]  had this to say about the NSA PRISM scandal. This is what she had to say.
[27:08.440 --> 27:11.320]  Wendy Malek, your question please for Alabama.
[27:11.320 --> 27:17.640]  Government tracking and phone records has been in the news lately. Is this an invasion
[27:17.640 --> 27:22.240]  of privacy or necessary to keep our country safe? Why or why not?
[27:22.240 --> 27:28.440]  I think the society that we live in today is sad that if we go to the movies or to the
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.360]  airport or into the mall that we have to worry about our safety. So I would rather someone
[27:33.360 --> 27:40.840]  track my telephone messages and feel safe wherever I go than feel like they're encroaching
[27:40.840 --> 27:44.160]  on my privacy. Thank you.
[27:44.160 --> 27:50.520]  Yay, yay. Why then does every authoritarian state do this and the free country's not?
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.360]  Did you ever not feel safe, the government lady? The government's the number one threat
[27:54.360 --> 28:00.480]  in history. It killed 262 million people, non-military deaths, in the 20th century.
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.160]  The government is the number one danger because corrupt special interests take it over and
[28:05.160 --> 28:09.960]  create hell on earth. And by the way, they're coached on how to answer. They all answered
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.200]  like this. Remember a few years ago, one of the contestants, they said lost because she
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.700]  said, I want liberty and I want national sovereignty and I don't want open borders.
[28:19.700 --> 28:23.480]  We had her on, Miss Oklahoma. And they said, that's it, you were gonna win, but not now.
[28:23.480 --> 28:27.840]  They have them all say, I want the UN to run everything. I think we should turn our guns
[28:27.840 --> 28:33.960]  in. I think the government should spy on me. I wanna feel safe. Now, here's the lady that
[28:33.960 --> 28:41.760]  won. Here is, well, we're gonna go to her in a minute.
[28:41.760 --> 28:54.040]  Let's go to Miss Connecticut on the DNA question. Here it is.
[28:54.040 --> 28:59.280]  Judge number seven, Mo Rocca, your question, please.
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.400]  Miss Connecticut, the Supreme Court ruled that criminal suspects can be subjected to
[29:04.400 --> 29:11.200]  a police DNA test after arrest. Do you agree or disagree with this and why or why not?
[29:11.200 --> 29:16.600]  I would agree with this. I think that if somebody's being prosecuted and is committed a crime
[29:16.600 --> 29:21.080]  that's severe, that they should have a DNA test. I think there are so many crimes going
[29:21.080 --> 29:26.040]  on in this world that if that's one step closer to figuring out who has done it, I think we
[29:26.040 --> 29:27.040]  should absolutely do so.
[29:27.040 --> 29:34.640]  Did you hear that? I believe she was the winner, just hearing my article. If you're arrested,
[29:34.640 --> 29:38.280]  you've committed the crime. Did you hear her? And of course, they want your DNA so they
[29:38.280 --> 29:46.200]  can frame you. These crime labs are the centers of crime in America on record. Look it up.
[29:46.200 --> 29:49.840]  They take you in for not wearing a seat belt now.
[29:49.840 --> 30:00.680]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:09.480 --> 33:19.480]  I wondered so aimless, life filled with sin. I wouldn't let my dear savior in. Then Jesus
[33:19.480 --> 33:32.480]  came like a stranger in the night. Praise the Lord, I saw the light. I saw the light.
[33:32.480 --> 33:38.480]  I saw the light. No more darkness, no more night.

[33:45.480 --> 33:51.160]  Former Congressman Dr. Ron Paul joins us here for the next 15 minutes. And I've got a lot
[33:51.160 --> 33:58.160]  of questions for him up on InfoWars.com. We have the headline Ron Paul dollar will collapse.
[33:58.720 --> 34:05.480]  Gold will go to infinity. He said that yesterday on CNBC. I'd like him to repeat what he talked
[34:05.480 --> 34:09.800]  about and then expound on why he says we're going that direction. Congressman, thank you
[34:09.800 --> 34:10.800]  for joining us.
[34:10.800 --> 34:15.520]  Thank you. Good to be with you. Well, you know, on the gold, something I've thought
[34:15.520 --> 34:20.760]  about for a long time, I did qualify that to a degree because when they ask you on the
[34:20.760 --> 34:25.880]  air on a business station about investment, I don't get involved in that. And they wanted
[34:25.880 --> 34:28.880]  to know what gold was going to be at the end of the year. And of course, I refused to say.
[34:28.880 --> 34:34.680]  But I said on long term, all paper currencies, you know, self-destruct. That means gold could
[34:34.680 --> 34:41.680]  go to infinity and this would be very destructive. So that will come if we continue to do these
[34:41.880 --> 34:47.080]  policies. And I see no possibility at the moment of changing our policies. So the demand
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.960]  for spending and the demand for deficits are such that they will keep printing the money.
[34:51.960 --> 34:55.960]  Even today, when the Fed has an announcement, he's not going to say, oh, we're going to
[34:55.960 --> 35:02.480]  quit inflating. The question is, are we going to inflate $85 billion a month or $80 billion
[35:02.480 --> 35:09.200]  a month? So that is a course of looking for destruction of the dollar. And in many ways,
[35:09.200 --> 35:14.600]  they've accomplished a whole lot since 100 years ago. The dollar of 1913 is worth about
[35:14.600 --> 35:20.040]  two or three cents. So although it's been doing it steadily and gradually and it hasn't
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.720]  been catastrophic, we've had a lot of catastrophic events in the meantime, like Great Depression,
[35:25.720 --> 35:32.720]  the dancing war, big inflation, and all these other problems. So I don't think it looks
[35:32.760 --> 35:39.760]  good for the dollar. If gold does end up going, you know, into infinity where it has no dollar
[35:40.640 --> 35:44.520]  price, then it's very, very bad news. And people who own gold think, oh, that's great
[35:44.520 --> 35:49.880]  news, but it really isn't. It's a bad political event. That means the country and the whole
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.200]  world will be in great danger and it's the kind of thing that we would like to avert.
[35:54.200 --> 36:01.200]  Absolutely. In fact, we have a graph from 2013 right through 2011 and you can see the
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.720]  dollar's lost over 97% of its value. And so it's already really collapsed. It's just that
[36:09.720 --> 36:15.160]  we've grown up during its collapse, but now there's not much value left. I'm seeing real
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.640]  inflation everywhere, but they seem to spin it on the news and say that inflation is low.
[36:20.640 --> 36:24.280]  What do you think about the official inflation numbers?
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.800]  I don't believe them, whether they say less than 2%, 1% inflation, but then if you go
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.120]  and look at certain things that are pretty important, like the medical care costs right
[36:34.120 --> 36:41.120]  now are skyrocketing and bond prices are in a bubble. So in the various categories, there's
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.920]  a tremendous amount of inflation. But this was another thing that came up yesterday on
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.560]  the show is the definition of inflation. They generally say, what's the CPI? Well, the government
[36:51.560 --> 36:58.280]  gives a statistic. They alter it. They don't tell us the truth about the prices. And like
[36:58.280 --> 37:05.280]  housing prices are going up very rapidly now, but the CPI doesn't reflect that. So I think
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.080]  about the money supply. If the money supply is going up, you have a lot of inflation.
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.680]  Many times it will raise prices, but that is secondary to the biggest harm it does because
[37:15.680 --> 37:20.240]  it makes interest rates lower than they should be. So everybody's getting false information.
[37:20.240 --> 37:25.800]  I think we're back into an inflationary bubble in housing right now because lots of activity
[37:25.800 --> 37:32.000]  right now because interest rates are way too low. They're not market. And therefore you
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.740]  have this excessive debt accumulation, malinvestment, and for the most part, rising prices too.
[37:38.740 --> 37:44.440]  But if you look at only the CPI, people are very much misled. What you have to think about
[37:44.440 --> 37:50.200]  is the cost of living of the average person in the middle class. And free market economy
[37:50.200 --> 37:56.040]  shows us that if you destroy a currency, you do destroy the middle class. The freer the
[37:56.040 --> 38:00.720]  market is and the sound of the money, the larger the middle class. And we have been
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.920]  pretty good compared to so many other countries. We were always bragging about the largest,
[38:04.920 --> 38:10.000]  wealthiest middle class ever. That's not the case anymore. So I think we're even vulnerable
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.880]  to some of the things going on in third world nations in Brazil right now. Some people are
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.920]  doing quite well, but there's another large number of people not doing well. And we have
[38:20.920 --> 38:27.960]  a lot of people unemployed and on food stamps and productivity. We're looking for trouble
[38:27.960 --> 38:33.840]  ourselves even like what we're witnessing on the television in these third world countries.
[38:33.840 --> 38:37.440]  We could turn our country into a third world country if we're not careful.
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.440]  Absolutely. If you look at the billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the FBI director
[38:41.440 --> 38:46.560]  today admitting domestic drone operations, the government is preparing for war with the
[38:46.560 --> 38:54.280]  American people. And you see governments all over the world in this world inflationary
[38:54.280 --> 39:00.600]  spike moving to suppress their populations. Can you speak to why you think there's such
[39:00.600 --> 39:03.560]  a homeland security buildup against the American people or do you-
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.600]  Well, I do think they prepare. It's amazing how they look at these things differently.
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.480]  The government of Turkey was sympathetic to the rebels in Syria and probably with a little
[39:13.480 --> 39:19.520]  bit of pressure from us. They were helping the rebels, including the Al Qaeda. At the
[39:19.520 --> 39:24.800]  same time, oh, it couldn't happen there. Now there's a rebellion going on in Turkey that
[39:24.800 --> 39:30.080]  people are demonstrating. Oh, well, you guys now are the bad guys. So think of many countries
[39:30.080 --> 39:34.880]  we have helped support the rebels, even though it's on again, off again. One time we're supporting
[39:34.880 --> 39:39.720]  a group, then we're against them. But we generally support all this overthrow. But what if there
[39:39.720 --> 39:44.080]  are demonstrations on our streets? I mean, it's just like in Turkey. They're cracking
[39:44.080 --> 39:49.440]  down and say, well, you guys are really the bad guys. The rebels in Syria, they're good
[39:49.440 --> 39:54.960]  guys. But when it comes here, there will be no soft touch. They're going to be very, very
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.840]  tough. And they might not say that we know it's coming or they're planning it, but it's
[39:59.840 --> 40:06.040]  a contingency. And they are prepared to think that if enough people get annoyed enough to
[40:06.040 --> 40:11.560]  start demonstrating. And I know there's a lot of people very angry because there is
[40:11.560 --> 40:18.500]  this division of wealth right now. The rich get richer and those influence, they have
[40:18.500 --> 40:23.480]  influence in government and laws and part of the Federal Reserve System. They do quite
[40:23.480 --> 40:28.600]  well. But the number of people who are suffering are growing. And I think that will probably
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.000]  continue. Absolutely. It's the cronyism, the opposite of free market. And then the media,
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.720]  the dinosaur media is trying to scapegoat the free market when we have the opposite
[40:37.720 --> 40:38.720]  of that.
[40:38.720 --> 40:44.840]  Since you raised this, your son, Senator Rand Paul, came out two weeks ago and said, why
[40:44.840 --> 40:49.560]  are we funding Al-Qaeda in Syria? I said that two years ago because it was in the foreign
[40:49.560 --> 40:55.480]  press and I was the conspiracy guy. Now it's all over the news that the main force around
[40:55.480 --> 41:00.280]  60% of them are real Al-Qaeda chanting, we're gonna blow up America again.
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.200]  And my point is when I say inside job, the media spends it. I mean, why does the military
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.120]  industrial complex create Al-Qaeda, create the Taliban, fund them? Now they're funding
[41:10.120 --> 41:15.080]  this group. And then when they attack us again, they'll take my rights, your grandchildren's
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.040]  rights away. I mean, how outrageous is this that the TSA wants to stick their hands down
[41:20.040 --> 41:25.600]  our pants, Dr. Paul? But then, meanwhile, our government's funding Al-Qaeda.
[41:25.600 --> 41:32.040]  Well, they do it and of course there's a lot of money involved and the military industrial
[41:32.040 --> 41:41.040]  complex is very much involved. But there's a lot of ignorance involved too. The Al-Qaeda,
[41:41.040 --> 41:46.600]  you know, if they were serious about this, they'd ask the question, why do so many people
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.840]  want to attack us? They never ask that. They just say, we have to have this global war
[41:50.840 --> 41:55.800]  on terrorism, it's forever. And what we have to do is we have to stop it. But how do they
[41:55.800 --> 42:01.480]  stop it? By taking away our freedoms. We send kids overseas to fight wars that are unconstitutional,
[42:01.480 --> 42:07.240]  to save our constitution and also to protect our freedoms. And here at home, they're doing
[42:07.240 --> 42:13.000]  exactly opposite, but they never ask the question about why, why and what's the incentive, what's
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.440]  the motive? And of course, the motive is quite a bit different than they pretend. The motive
[42:18.440 --> 42:24.200]  for them is always, well, there's just a bunch of bad guys out there and they hate us and
[42:24.200 --> 42:28.600]  we're rich and free and they hate our freedom. And I don't buy into that. I think they're
[42:28.600 --> 42:33.320]  sick and tired of us being in their country, occupying their country and overthrowing governments
[42:33.320 --> 42:39.880]  all the time and switching, switching allegiance. And they finally get tired of it. And that's
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.400]  why we end up with this mess. Congressman Ron Paul, former Congressman,
[42:43.400 --> 42:47.960]  Dr. Paul is our guest. Can't wait to get you on in September when you launch the amazing
[42:47.960 --> 42:53.640]  as I've seen some advanced copies of it online and physical homeschooling curricula. That's
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.840]  just a revolution against this tyranny. But the two final points I want to get into with
[42:58.840 --> 43:06.520]  you here obviously is the NSA. You criticized the NSA back in 1984 on the House floor. We've
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.360]  played the clip here and said it's going to end up being big brother and pointed out what
[43:10.360 --> 43:14.280]  they were doing. Told the story of the ice cream cone. The kid goes into Baskin Robbins
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.040]  and tells his birthday to get the free ice cream cone and it ends up in a government
[43:18.040 --> 43:23.400]  database. Now it's all out in the open. You've got private companies using it for unfair
[43:23.400 --> 43:28.200]  trade advantage. That's really what it's all about from my research. And do we deserve
[43:28.200 --> 43:35.320]  an apology now, you and I and others, libertarians, Lou Rockwell being called conspiracy theorist,
[43:35.320 --> 43:41.320]  warning of the NSA. I mean, everything we've talked about is now coming out. A, do we deserve
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.520]  an apology? B, what does it signify to the awakening though, that so much has now come
[43:46.520 --> 43:50.680]  out and Congress has a 10% approval rating and mainstream media is dying?
[43:50.680 --> 43:56.040]  Well, we might deserve it, but we better not hold our breath and expect it. But you know,
[43:56.040 --> 44:01.320]  I would be quite satisfied with them just changing policy and the American people would wake up. I
[44:01.320 --> 44:05.640]  don't even care who gets the credit, but if the American people wake up and then agree with us
[44:05.640 --> 44:11.480]  and say, hey, maybe there is something to this. They've gone too far and there's a limit. But
[44:11.480 --> 44:16.760]  I'm still annoyed by the people saying that we, and there's so many, even the conservative,
[44:16.760 --> 44:23.000]  both conservative and liberal TV stations say, but I want to be safe. They are going to attack
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.920]  us. There will be 9-11. I have to give up some of my privacy. It's that kind of stuff that is bad.
[44:28.920 --> 44:34.520]  People are getting annoyed, but not enough to look at it on basis on a principle like the
[44:35.240 --> 44:42.280]  fourth amendment. I mean, this is what they have to do. So I think that under today's conditions,
[44:42.280 --> 44:47.000]  we can expect things to maybe move in our directions, but I'm not holding my breath for
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.640]  them to actually apologize to us. I played this before you came on, but
[44:51.640 --> 44:57.880]  the entire Miss USA contest, I watched a bunch of their responses. They asked about the NSA and
[44:57.880 --> 45:03.400]  things and Miss Alabama, all of them that I saw said, I want you to listen to my phone to be safe.
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.560]  What would you say to Miss Alabama? I mean, she doesn't know government's always the big threat.
[45:07.560 --> 45:11.880]  What about being safe from government? Yeah, they, they have to come around to
[45:11.880 --> 45:14.920]  the belief of the majority of American people now that our government doesn't,
[45:15.560 --> 45:21.000]  you know, tell us our tell us truth. But if they want to be safe, do they want to be safe from
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.600]  wife-beating and everything else? Governments could make us perfectly safe. If we're perfect
[45:28.600 --> 45:34.120]  slaves, you know, if you become a slave, they might feed us well, but we have no liberties
[45:34.120 --> 45:39.000]  left, but we would be safe from outsiders, but we wouldn't be safe from our own government or
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.440]  our slave owners. And yes, if that's what they want, if they're willing to give it up, they
[45:44.440 --> 45:49.800]  don't have enough respect or understanding. They think that's the only responsibility of government,
[45:49.800 --> 45:55.000]  but they never even talk about safety in the constitution. The president and the Congress
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  is supposed to protect our liberties. We're supposed to worry about our safety and security
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.040]  and how we provide for our families. But this whole thing, obsession with safety,
[46:04.040 --> 46:08.280]  but the founders understood this issue so clearly and Franklin and others would say,
[46:08.280 --> 46:14.680]  you know, if you do, you're going to end up with neither safety nor, you know, freedom.
[46:14.680 --> 46:20.600]  Yeah, you don't get, you don't get your freedom. You cannot give up. You cannot give up any of it.
[46:20.600 --> 46:25.400]  What was the idea that people are going to take care of us either physically or economically?
[46:25.400 --> 46:29.480]  Sure. You never get safety when you create a big giant government, you get tyranny. A final
[46:29.480 --> 46:35.400]  question. I agree with you that I don't like the whole border patrol thing because they only use
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.440]  it to keep Americans from getting out. That's now admitted. They use the illegals to build part of
[46:40.440 --> 46:45.560]  the border fence that was just a boondoggle for rich guys because it had like spots in it for the
[46:45.560 --> 46:51.560]  game to go through and things. So it was literally a white elephant. But if you get 15, 20, 30 million
[46:51.560 --> 46:58.520]  illegals, 46 million in the next decade here, they get to have their babies free. They get welfare
[46:58.520 --> 47:03.240]  and most of them vote to take my guns and are basically clients of the government because the
[47:03.240 --> 47:07.240]  government's there from the day they get here. Not like immigrants in the past that came here
[47:07.240 --> 47:13.000]  to work. Some of them do. I believe in immigration. I believe that we need people to, you know, add,
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.720]  you know, new ideas and blood to this country. But but at the same time, I'm really concerned
[47:17.720 --> 47:23.960]  about this amnesty bill. What's your take on it? And Rand has said that, well, if it's a good bill,
[47:23.960 --> 47:28.920]  he would support it because Obama's already done legalization by fiat, which I understand.
[47:28.920 --> 47:33.480]  But can you give us your take on it and then give us your take on what Senator Paul's saying?
[47:33.480 --> 47:42.280]  Well, I'm not for amnesty. That is giving them citizenship. But I also think that we could change
[47:42.280 --> 47:48.920]  things where workers coming back and forth would be a lot easier and that they wouldn't have to be
[47:48.920 --> 47:54.520]  criminals. But there's there's two things. I don't think automatic citizenship or amnesty or
[47:54.520 --> 48:00.840]  birthright citizenship. But the big thing is no welfare. See, I don't want to I don't want
[48:00.840 --> 48:08.440]  somebody come in here illegally, be able to get free medical care and free education at the same
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.840]  at the same time. They have the right to vote. No, I don't I don't want that. So I don't want
[48:14.840 --> 48:22.200]  the amnesty. But I also don't like the idea that we have barbed wire fences and we have machine guns
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.440]  and get. So what do we do? What would you do? What's constitutional? Because, you know,
[48:26.440 --> 48:30.360]  there's always reasonable reasons to do this. But when you look at the bill, it's like Obamacare.
[48:30.360 --> 48:34.600]  It's an open blank check. But, you know, the portion that I've been talking about the most
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.000]  and campaign for liberty has been talking about has been the national I.D. card. See,
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.440]  a lot of conservatives who want the illegals kept out are going along with this biometric
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.280]  national database. It'll be selectively enforced way too much. And it probably won't work. It's
[48:50.280 --> 48:54.600]  going to only work against it's sort of like guns. It'll work against the American. Exactly.
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.760]  We'll all have to carry the card. But the illegals won't necessarily have to have it.
[48:58.760 --> 49:04.120]  Sure. If you were in the house still. But that's what I think the biggest danger of
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.640]  that particular bill. And of course, if there's amnesty where they get voting rights and
[49:10.520 --> 49:16.200]  constant welfare, that's not a benefit to any of us. Would you vote this current bill up or down?
[49:16.840 --> 49:20.440]  Well, from what I know about it, I wouldn't have any interest at all to vote for it.
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.360]  All right. That's that's powerful. Former Congressman Ron Paul, we're very proud of the
[49:24.360 --> 49:29.560]  work you're doing and we appreciate you. I know you've got a lot of sites from what is the best
[49:29.560 --> 49:33.720]  site for us to visit all things. Ron Paul, actually, I've been using I'm going to have
[49:33.720 --> 49:39.080]  a new website that I'll use more in the near future. But, you know, going to my home page,
[49:39.080 --> 49:44.040]  I keep up with a lot of my activities on my on my Facebook page. That would be a good place to go
[49:44.040 --> 49:50.280]  right now. OK, so go to your official Facebook page on Facebook. All right. Former Congressman
[49:50.280 --> 49:54.520]  Ron Paul, thank you so much for spending time with us. OK, thank you. There he goes.
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.640]  Well, that is an important interview. Again, I love Rand. I have known Rand Paul.
[50:00.600 --> 50:02.760]  I mean, not super well. I mean, I interviewed him probably.
[50:05.160 --> 50:09.880]  Fifteen times I've been at a few events he was at, interviewed when he was running for Senate here.
[50:09.880 --> 50:14.920]  I mean, I remember back when he would campaign for his dad, his dad would always come on about
[50:14.920 --> 50:18.600]  once a month. But when his dad was first running for Congress, they'd say, hey, can you get Rand
[50:18.600 --> 50:24.920]  on? Because, you know, we're really doing a push. And so I get Rand on to raise money and promote
[50:24.920 --> 50:31.800]  Ron Paul. I know Rand well and I know he's a good guy. I've talked to him privately and stuff,
[50:31.800 --> 50:36.760]  but I mean, I just think this amnesty bill is unfair, unconstitutional and dangerous.
[50:37.400 --> 50:41.560]  And I agree with his dad. I would vote it down. And Rand's talking about voting for it.
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.960]  And I hope he's just playing politics because he's done that on some things. But
[50:45.960 --> 50:52.520]  I there you go. I mean, his dad would right now the way this is voted down. And that's why I love
[50:52.520 --> 50:56.280]  Ron Paul. He just does what's right, what's constitutional, what's fair, doesn't play
[50:56.280 --> 51:04.840]  politics. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Big business has discovered the preparedness market,

[54:17.240 --> 54:24.840]  It's up on info-wars.com. No school insurance if teachers have guns. I mean that's the type of
[54:24.840 --> 54:32.200]  persecution of gun owners and people that just want to be free. Here's what I am. You can call
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.960]  me a populist, constitutionalist, whatever you want. A libertarian, constitutionalist.
[54:38.520 --> 54:43.160]  I want to be a free human. I don't want to be domesticated. That's what slavery is.
[54:45.800 --> 54:48.840]  And this government doesn't just want to have a nanny state so it's in control.
[54:50.360 --> 54:53.640]  Do you understand they ordered, I keep talking about this since Sunday when I saw the New York
[54:53.640 --> 54:59.880]  Times it reminded me of just the hundreds of things I could talk about that nerve gas.
[55:01.640 --> 55:05.640]  There were over 200 bases in Iraq. Most of it bought from France and England
[55:05.640 --> 55:10.440]  and the US. Most of it the US but of the total there was some Russian stuff there.
[55:10.440 --> 55:12.840]  It all got videotaped by the Marines and got released in
[55:13.480 --> 55:19.240]  60 minutes of all places. This all came out a few years after and they went and videotaped
[55:19.240 --> 55:23.960]  Canvasia and all these bases. Canvasia I forget it was like the biggest chemical dump in the world.
[55:23.960 --> 55:28.680]  It was like dozens and I forget it was just giant football field underground bunkers.
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.240]  And they blew it up. There was a mushroom cloud and all the chemical weapons detectors went off.
[55:33.240 --> 55:38.120]  And rather than admit we just blew up chemical weapons so that Saddam wouldn't have them anymore
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.040]  and we wanted to cover up that it was ours. They just said never mind, take your gear off.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.320]  It's a false alarm knowing it was gonna hurt people really bad.
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.400]  And again, I just go back to that. The globalists act like they've got a plan for all this,
[55:53.400 --> 55:58.920]  collapsing society, taking control of things. But I've studied them. They're the ones lying
[55:58.920 --> 56:06.440]  to themselves. They didn't let troops use DU until 1990. They didn't let them blow up chemical dumps
[56:06.440 --> 56:11.240]  in the open until then. There's been a shift in the establishment of just,
[56:11.240 --> 56:16.120]  you know what the world, F the world basically. Kill everybody and let God sort it out.
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.160]  And I don't mean kill the enemy and let God sort it out. I mean just craziness.
[56:21.160 --> 56:26.120]  That's what I'm telling you. I used to talk to a lot of big high up insiders. They go, look,
[56:26.120 --> 56:32.040]  it's an out of control animal just like they say in the movie Nixon. And they're crazy.
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.800]  No, no, they're crazy, Alex. You see the design in it and there is a design. They're trying to
[56:37.800 --> 56:44.280]  design something. The truth is these people are nuts and they are nuts. Why would you
[56:44.280 --> 56:50.120]  blow up chemical plants, chemical dumps, and have it rain down on the troops? Some of them died that
[56:50.120 --> 56:58.200]  day. And then now it's in the news. Yeah, they got exposed to something that ate the brain stems.
[56:58.200 --> 57:04.040]  It's Cern and VX. And they still deny these people their disability. I mean, of course,
[57:04.040 --> 57:08.760]  they say the troops are the enemy after they're out. We have a government that says in all the
[57:08.760 --> 57:14.280]  manuals, the number one terror threat is veterans. Lock the government up, folks. That's a traitor
[57:14.280 --> 57:23.720]  government right there. This is naked in our face and I am sick of it. I am tired of it.
[57:23.720 --> 57:29.960]  I want to have a sane future. So they tell the media says I'm insane.
[57:29.960 --> 57:34.920]  I'm insane. They have Bloomberg and others come out and say I don't build bombs. I build
[57:34.920 --> 57:38.840]  bombers. They have other articles coming out saying I said this and that. They're coming
[57:38.840 --> 57:43.160]  after me, okay? And I'm not worried about what happens to me. I'm worried that I'm not doing
[57:43.160 --> 57:47.080]  enough on air to warn you and get all the info out. That's all I'm trying to say.
[57:47.800 --> 57:51.960]  That's all I want to do is beat these people. All I care about is my kids. All I care about
[57:51.960 --> 57:57.640]  is my wife. All I care about is your future as well. And our future is your future as well.
[57:57.640 --> 58:01.800]  All I care about is your future as well and our future together in this world. Can't see
[58:01.800 --> 58:05.960]  under and they go, that's what schmucks are like. Or there's no way he's really a good guy.
[58:05.960 --> 58:12.440]  Nobody's good. I mean, how did we get to this point of madness? Of madness? By the way,

[59:53.400 --> 59:58.600]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.600 --> 01:00:13.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:30.040]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:39.160]  We're into our number two. We just had a very important interview, newsmaking, no doubt,
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.240]  with Congressman Ron Paul, former Congressman. He said he would vote down the amnesty bill.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:49.480]  And I'm not trying to drive a wedge between him and Senator Paul, but Senator Paul is supporting
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.440]  it right now. And you just can't do it when the illegals all get even more welfare than American
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.960]  citizens. I mean, it's designed to bankrupt the country, which is what the mega banks want and
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.240]  drive down wages. And it won't help the third world. Believe me, I wish that the countries
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:11.720]  south of us were oases of freedom. Cuz people could be black, they could be white, they could
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.000]  be brown. If they were into freedom, that's where I wanna be. There was a country of green people,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.800]  and they were into freedom and being honorable, I'd be living there.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:25.400]  They could be green and have purple eyes or something. I mean, I am sick of it.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.640]  Of everything being about what you look like, it's how you act and how you behave. And let me
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.000]  tell you, there's nothing but tyranny and hell south of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.120]  And this country's collapsing, and the bankers want that. They want us to collapse, just like
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.840]  Detroit. And let me tell you, we're on that road. You like your wages going down? Well,
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.000]  just like Ross Perot said, NAFTA and GATT, he said, will create a giant sucking channel.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.800]  They're paid $37 an hour in factories in Canada. When they equalize with us,
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.320]  we're on average paid about 20. It dropped down to 25 up there. In Mexico, they're paid
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:04.840]  less than $1 an hour. You will see immediately our wages go from $25 an hour to 15 and then down.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.880]  And that will destroy the base of the economy and upward mobility.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.600]  Now, Larry, then we expand out and deal with China where they have slain labor. Larry,
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.560]  saw Larry King live, debating Al Gore, and Gore wouldn't shut up. He's like, let me speak.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.440]  Let me explain economics here. You see, cuz when you pay higher wages, when you're an upward
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.040]  economy, it doesn't matter, cuz then everybody's got more money and you spend more.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.520]  If you've got a real free economy, you want high wages, because that's actually what makes
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.920]  it get more and more complex like an ecosystem. This is economics, real economics. But if you're
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.200]  robber baron, eugenicist, who wanna hoard everything to yourself as a tool of control,
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.640]  then you want low wages. I mean, man, we're competing with Mexico, India, China,
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:54.200]  and 160 plus other third world countries. You think the CPS takes people's kids in Mexico when
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.280]  they chain them up in some areas in Mexico City while they go into work all day?
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.080]  Or where they do that with millions of kids a day in China on record? No, no, the kids
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.200]  eaten one time a day of their lucky, they're growing up chained to a pole. Their parents
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.160]  are in there working, the robots are being built to replace them right now.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.200]  There's a new trailer out for Elysium I'm gonna play later in the hour. You don't have to sit
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:22.840]  here and think about the future. 150 years from now when robots replace humans and robots are the
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:29.320]  police, how about 10 years in most of the big factories? And in 20 years, we'll be at Elysium
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.680]  level, okay? You see the trailer for that, people have seen sneak peeks, they're like,
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.600]  how did you know what was in that movie?
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:46.360]  And this movie is like what you talk about, because all the fiction is going the way of
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:52.040]  how it really is, ladies and gentlemen, okay? But they're not gonna be on space stations like
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:04:00.760]  Moonraker, they're gonna be in compact, rural and urban command centers with three levels of
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.800]  national security to get in with universities, corporations and government. And you're gonna
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:12.040]  have globally in their different actuaries, maybe 10 million people behind them, the high-tech wire,
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.960]  and they're gonna be living much longer. They're gonna have all the treatments.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:21.000]  They say this, this isn't me, and you're not gonna get it, and I'm not gonna get it. We're
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.960]  gonna get euthanized under government healthcare. Don't you people understand this? Don't you
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.720]  understand? It's all been written by them in a bookshelf full of their writings over there.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.960]  I've done reports, I've shown you where they say it, they're building a hellish world,
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:43.960]  a selfish world for themselves. This isn't a game, and I'm here, and you're out there to
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.280]  warn people. We're not gonna let them take control of human destiny with this nightmare
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:53.400]  upload they've come up with. We're gonna hack into their system, and we're gonna sabotage
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.880]  their takeover plan, and we're gonna build a better world together. Stay with us.

[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.560]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.760]  sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact that most
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.480]  of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:21.240]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.680]  bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:32.920]  the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Younggevity. The Younggevity products

[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:12.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:24.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:34.200]  All right, my friends, it is Wednesday, the 19th day of June 2013. We just had Ron Paul,
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:40.120]  former Congressman on, and that interview was just newsmaking across the board.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.280]  He said he believes the dollar will collapse and gold will, quote, go to infinity.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.400]  That's a quote, last hour with us. And he said he disagrees with the current immigration bill
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.600]  and that it's a big rip off, giving the illegal aliens all the free welfare and anchor baby status
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.760]  so he would not vote for it. And obviously, then, the question is,
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.240]  is Rand going to, who's been making noises like he will? I mean, Rand, your daddy,
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.760]  and I know you're your own man, but come on. I mean, your daddy's not just anybody.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.880]  I think it's time to not vote for this thing. And I know Obama's already done it by fiat.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:22.200]  He's a criminal. But they're talking about 46 million illegals in the next decade under this.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.400]  I mean, whoa, whoa. And again, the government's there to make them the new voting block to take
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.040]  my guns. And if they could take your guns, they're gonna take everything else. I mean, MSNBC is
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:38.920]  creepily on there saying that your kids belong to the state. And again, if I could go to Mexico
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.720]  or if I could go to Brazil or if I could go to Poland and show up and have my kids free and be
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.320]  given welfare, it might be a little different. But it's so unfair. No one else does this.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:55.240]  No one, but maybe some Northern European countries like Sweden and Denmark. And they've used that
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.560]  to bring in foreigners to then be a voting block to leverage out the indigenous population.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:05.800]  So it's a political move. I mean, we gotta get our riders. I should have all three of the riders
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.840]  that are right through that wall right there. I've got like eight riders working for us now.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:14.120]  There's three of them right through that wall. No, there's four of them. Four great riders.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.520]  Maybe they should all go back and listen to that Ron Paul interview and go different angles because
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.760]  so much what we do at infoawars.com, so much of what I do on the radio, it's my fault,
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:30.840]  we never even report on. Incredible stuff happens here on the air. And we don't even talk about it.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.400]  I mean, some stuff sensational and I don't go with it cuz it's not newsworthy. I mean,
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.360]  if it's important for liberty and sensational, then we go with it.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.280]  Cuz liberty is sensational. The globalists use sensational propaganda to dumb us down.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.920]  And they get us in a normalcy bias, a comfort zone, a bubble of just accepting. And I'm here
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:54.600]  to shake you out of it. And I'm just report on how crazy stuff is. Washington Times and several
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.920]  other publications come out and go, Congress is looking at having hearings on cable boxes
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.800]  with microphones and cameras that are watching and listening to you.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.280]  Is it good they're watching and listening to you? And people are like, Alex, we've heard you talk
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:12.840]  about this for over a decade. What's the big deal? It's finally in the news. Now is the time
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:18.520]  to talk about this. And now is the time to talk about people who have been accurate,
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:24.840]  who've told the truth. I mean, look, two years ago and then again last year, I looked it up
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:33.000]  on Google News. There was over in a one day period, now two years ago,
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.440]  a thousand articles, because it was an AP article and a bunch of others.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.760]  So they got put in newspapers everywhere. Over a thousand articles in one day,
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:50.760]  that's a major push in newspapers, saying, I'm a liar. Kurt Nemo, the writer that did the story,
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.080]  is a liar. And that Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com was a liar, that there are no domestic
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.040]  drones and that we were liars. And they used a big article Kurt wrote that Drudge linked to
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.360]  that showed Wired magazine drones over North Dakota used to arrest cattle wrestlers and
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:12.760]  police using drones here and Texas weaponizing police drones. And it was all these links and
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:19.080]  they went and found farmers complaining about the EPA harassing them if they built barns and things
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.240]  with Cessnas with EPA people, and also Department of Agriculture people in them.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.840]  We were pointing out, hey, they're already using man stuff to harass farmers. They took that and
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:38.600]  spun it like we were lying and had over 1,000 newspapers in one day run an AP article.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.400]  And it was on TV and it was in a bunch of other stuff, because Media Matters wrote the first
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.920]  thing. And people go, who cares about Media Matters? Nobody reads it. The media reads it.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.560]  It's the White House on record. They're listening right now. White House, former transition chief,
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:58.680]  George Soros, money, they're listening. And they said, come out and say Alex Jones is a liar.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:04.120]  They said we were lying, and that Matt Drudge shouldn't carry our stories,
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:09.160]  cuz they're so scared. It just credits you. He says the NSA's fine, don't link to that.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.520]  He says the street lights have cameras and microphones in them. Don't listen to him.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.640]  We're linking to the company that got the Homeland Security contract.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.400]  Don't, whatever you do, don't get radicalized. There's no two billion bullets.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.360]  There's no armored vehicles, because I'm not radical, folks. I'm radically angry,
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.520]  because I know, I do the research. I know I'm right. I know what's being built.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.800]  And so they're mad because I'm able to shock people out of their malaise,
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.840]  out of their comfort zone, because I'm shocked by it.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.080]  And I'm just an American. I'm just a free human. I thought I was just running the mill.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.560]  But I've seen it when somebody's choking. A whole restaurant stands there like parrots saying,
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.520]  call 911, till I have to physically shove people out of the way to say,
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.880]  I have to physically shove people out of the way to save the woman. And I'm not a hero.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.720]  I guarantee it. My dad one time when he was a kid saw one of his friends save somebody choking.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:09.480]  Everybody was fighting to help the man. I had CPR on swim team. I know how to do the Heimlich
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.440]  maneuver. Nowadays, people get run over all the time in the street. Nobody helps them.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.000]  A woman gets raped in Toronto in front of hundreds looking out windows watching it
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.840]  in a telecommunications building and nobody helped him. This happens all the time now because
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:30.680]  it's zombies. They're like disconnected. And the media wants to sit there and tell them,
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.320]  don't listen to him. There's nothing to be upset about. Just stay calm. Just go quietly.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.400]  Just get in the car with Ted Bundy. Get in the yellow Volkswagen. No, do not get in the car
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.840]  with the serial killing government. And that's what I'm trying to get at here is that now the
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:57.400]  FBI director comes out, testifies to Congress and says that, yes, we're using drones to spy on you.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.440]  Well, of course they are. That's what's so insulting about what media matters did,
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.920]  cuz they did it two years ago and again last year. And now their lives are even worse.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.680]  They say that I said Obama sent the tornado in Oklahoma. I never said any such thing.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.800]  And you know that, you listen. The lady said, could it be a weather weapon? And I said,
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.720]  well, they can manipulate whether there are geoengineering going on that may be causing
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.320]  it even not on purpose, but it's doing it. But I said, it's probably a real tornado.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.080]  Tornadoes are way down 60 year low. Here's USA Today.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.800]  It's probably a real tornado, but they can create bad weather.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.200]  I showed Fox AP Reuters. They take that lie about me. Now they're saying,
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.720]  and it really clicked that I should be more concerned cuz I am fearless.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.040]  And I should be more concerned when they have Bloomberg come out. In a fake investigative
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.800]  report they spent a month on trying to dig up dirt, they couldn't dig any up.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.960]  So they just say, I don't build bombs. I build bombers.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.600]  They quote the Southern Property Law Center, also White House wrote on record.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.040]  Does he have these groups so they can deny it and then not be connected,
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.800]  but they're on record funding it and running it. I mean, I should be creeped out. So I'm
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.560]  gonna ask you for your support and your prayers. I was on Mancow today and I'm friends with Mancow.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.920]  And he said on air and then during the break, he said, no, I'm not gonna get into it. But
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.920]  he's been told not to have me on his radio show anymore. And he freaked out on air and said,
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.720]  I'm gonna keep having Alex on cuz he really is a manic maniac.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.360]  I mean, he's a really smart, good guy, but he's even more of a maniac than I am.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.560]  And he just doesn't care. And he's got a big hit show coming out. It's gonna be a hit called
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:39.160]  God, Guns, and Automobiles with his brother that owns a big car dealership in Missouri.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.800]  And I know about some of the inside stuff. It's mainly just a show about having fun.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.960]  And the White House, once it's shut down and has all these White House fronts,
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.600]  media matters and others, saying it's a conspiracy show and a racist show,
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.320]  all this other baloney, basically. And the atheists want it shut down cuz the word God in it.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.840]  History Channel's not dumb. They want 13 million viewers a show instead of a million people.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.640]  Instead of a million viewers like their Bible series got.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.640]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on where they do not want popular culture out there.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.520]  They got three gun shows that were top shows, number one, two, and three on Discovery canceled.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:27.560]  By the way, I've been in meetings with Discovery, History, A&E, all of them five, six years ago.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.960]  And I told him, I said, you know what will be the number one shows?
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.320]  And I said, I don't have time to do it. You can't pay me enough money to do it cuz I've got
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.240]  an operation I've gotta run. I gotta make a lot of money to be able to run my own media operation.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.720]  And they're like, well, come do one season. If it makes a lot of money, you can make
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.000]  millions after that. I go, I need those millions now to pay for everything.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.680]  I don't keep millions, I have to spend millions. And they all agreed to me. They said, no,
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:56.520]  we know guns, we know libertarian stuff. We know Americana, John Wayne is what gets us
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:02.040]  what gets us 10 times was a quote, the ratings, but we're not allowed to. And I watched him
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:07.160]  fire the head of true TV over this when it was gone from court to true TV.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.320]  She'd been the head of the BBC division came over here and she understood that.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.120]  I'm probably saying too much. That's why I don't go to LA anymore. I don't go to their meetings.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.360]  I'm not part of it. I've got my own thing. I'm doing it here. And they're not censoring
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.240]  anything till they kill me. And they are angry, ladies and gentlemen, because they know that
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:32.680]  liberty is popular and they are upset and they can't stand it. And you've got a good old boy
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:38.120]  club up there that is committing all these crimes like NSA spying without warrants.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:44.280]  And you have the NSA director General Alexander in front of the House Intelligence Committee
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.200]  yesterday, the Atlantic wires reporting on this. And he says, tell your boss,
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.440]  NSA director Keith Alexander told FBI director, I owe him another friggin beer.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.360]  And that's because the FBI did their job. They'd be arresting all these people,
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:00.280]  but the FBI already has all this data. They just want to be able to use it in court,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:06.840]  but all jurisprudence says it's illegal. So let's play that clip. We're going to come back
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:12.280]  and play the Ron Paul clip of him talking about the NSA in 1984. And then we're going to get to
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.120]  these Miss USA pageant worshiping saying, please spy on me. Keep me safe. Let's go to that clip.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:37.960]  So there they are with a hot mic talking about how to buy your boss another beer.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:44.360]  It's all funny. By the way, none of it's for terrorism or to make sure terrorists can attack
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.400]  when they work for them. It's all to spy on you to give to select corporations, unfair trade
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.920]  advantage, all taxpayer paid for. That's why America is losing its middle class faster than

[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:33.720]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:37.880]  counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.120]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.640]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:26.680]  Yeah, that's the Foo Fighters bringing us in. They're patriots.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:33.080]  Just now breaking at Infowars.com. I'm going to cover this after our next guest leaves us
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.480]  here in the next segment. Russian cyberspace head calls for internet kill switch run by the UN.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:44.920]  And that's what cyber security is here in the West is a kill switch so they can carry out the
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:50.360]  kill switch or redirect you only to government websites or take over your phone, your smart TV,
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:55.720]  everything and program their messages where your phone will now turn on.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.600]  And it'll be President Obama in text messages and then videos.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:05.080]  I mean, that's like in Superman Man of Steel when Zod shows up and takes over the world's
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:10.040]  communications. We need to do a reenactment of that. But instead it's like, I am your leader,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.400]  Obama. The weather men are here to help. Please relocate to the local FEMA camp.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.920]  Your children belong to us. I can actually show clips where they do it. The TSA is here to stick
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:28.280]  their hands down your pants to discover huevos, rancheros. I mean, it is just over the top.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:36.280]  But then Miss USA says, I think it's actually a good idea that the NSA
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.680]  watch me to make sure I'm safe. Cuz they care about your pumpkin.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:45.000]  Is that why Zbigniew Brzezinski brags he helped put the camera rusion that killed 30% of the
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.200]  country for no reason? But that they were educated? You think the government wants to
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:57.480]  help you, sweetie pie? So stupid. Let's go ahead and go to Ron Paul warning in 1984.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.960]  He misspeaks and says 94 on the House floor about Big Brother. Here it is.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:07.000]  It's now common knowledge that federal government computers are routinely used to compare lists of
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.960]  18-year-olds who get driver's licenses with those who have registered for the draft.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:17.080]  Computer surveillance seems appropriate for 1994 and unfortunately the wave of the future.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.280]  This is in spite of the fact that social securities and health and human services computers are already
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.960]  being used to keep tabs on our 18 and 19-year-olds. A recent story revealed an imaginary person
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.760]  received a threat from the Defense Department if he did not immediately register for the draft.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:38.600]  Two brothers seven years ago signed a fictitious name on an ice cream parlor's list in order to get
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:43.880]  a free sundae. This list unbelievably found its way into the government's files and is now being
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.000]  used for monitoring our teenagers. Millions of tax dollars are spent on this type of computer
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.480]  surveillance, a disgusting procedure for a professed free society. The irony is that it's
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.280]  done by an administration that brags about its limited government philosophy and the little
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:05.400]  condemnation we hear comes from those who would involve government in every jot and tittle of our
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.960]  economic lives. Why is it that it's so difficult to defend freedom consistently across the board?
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:20.360]  All right, that is from 1984. How many years ago is that? Almost 30 years? Wow.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:27.480]  Okay, now let's go to two days ago and we did an article on this yesterday. This is
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.800]  Miss Alabama. They were all giving answers like this. We got a bunch of them on the website.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:38.680]  Miss Alabama on NSA prism scandal. This is what they're told to answer to win. I love the UN,
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.520]  turn your guns in, style me, make me feel safe. Here's the clip.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.240]  Number two, Wendy Ballack, your question please for Alabama.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.800]  Government tracking and phone records has been in the news lately.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.920]  Is this an invasion of privacy or necessary to keep our country safe?
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:03.080]  Our country. Why or why not? I think the society that we live in today, it's sad that if we go to
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.480]  the movies or to the airport or even to the mall that we have to worry about our safety.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:13.720]  So I would rather someone track my telephone messages and feel safe wherever I go than feel
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:19.960]  like they're encroaching on my privacy. That's right. Thank you. That's right. You feel,
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:27.240]  oh yeah, you feel safe, but you're not idiot. You know what her game plan is. Okay, let's go
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:33.800]  ahead and go to another one though. This is from 2007, Miss Teen USA. But if you're well spoken,
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.680]  you're disqualified. But if you're like, here it is.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.560]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the US on a world map.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:54.760]  Why do you think this is? Fluoride. I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:29:03.320]  Like Obama. Because some people out there in our nation don't have that. And I believe that our
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:11.240]  education, like such as in South Africa and Iraq, everywhere like such as. And I believe that they
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:18.920]  should, our education over here in the US should help the US or should help South Africa and should
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:25.160]  help Iraq and the Asian countries. So we will be able to build up our future for our children.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.160]  Thank you very much. Very unattractive. I'm serious. I'm not attracted to her.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.680]  I mean, I'm not attracted like a rock. I mean, it is the stupidity, the mindless TV head
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:46.040]  such as South Africa helping the US spy on me. They're all like that. Just dumber than a box
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:56.360]  of maggots. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:05.160]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us? As we've moved through
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:11.000]  history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information. Billions of dollars
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.680]  have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:25.080]  state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine. We are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:30.280]  ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:34.600]  and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness. All of this is
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:40.120]  happening so fast. You need to be ahead of the game. How to engineer the opinion of the American
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:45.800]  people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war. Oh, there's another one. Another
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:51.800]  plane just hit. State of mind, because there's a war on for your mind. Get your copy of State
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:58.920]  of Mind, the movie at Infowars.com. And remember every order at Infowarsstore.com receives a free

[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.720]  Mabe of www.TomMabe.com. Many of you obviously know who he is. A bunch of my crew are just
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.760]  incredible fans. They love all of his pranking telemarketers. We got to get him on about that
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.000]  sometime but we've got him with us. We're going to go to him here in just a moment.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.400]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, I am in this film and I am distributing it as well. It's exclusively
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:34:00.440]  available at mfallwarstore.com. It is State of Mind, The Psychology of Control. State of Mind,
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:06.600]  The Psychology of Control. The history of mind control, the present and the future,
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:14.840]  all on record with psychiatrists, psychologists, special psyops experts like Colonel Shaffer.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.040]  I'm in there, G. Edward Griffin, the list goes on and on. I mean, I saw the film and I said, wow,
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:24.920]  I want to distribute this because it was so good. So it's available at mfallwarstore.com and the
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:31.080]  first 5,000 orders which are going very, very quickly. Get The American Dream,
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:35.640]  an animated documentary film about the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers that is good for the general
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:43.320]  public. It's like South Park meets Ron Paul meets a time warp. I mean, it's really well done on DVD.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.520]  We have State of Mind on DVD and Blu-ray. You can make your choice and get the film absolutely free,
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.160]  The American Dream. And it's great to wake up your friends and family, both The American Dream free
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.520]  with your purchase of State of Mind. And when you purchase the film, it supports the broadcast.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:04.040]  I don't get government funding like NPR, MSNBC. I don't get big globalist funding. We have our
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:08.840]  sponsors, which only cover about half of what we do. Then we have the subscriptions to prisonplanet.tv
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:16.440]  and we have the products that we sell like the Propiate Water Filtration, the mfallwarstore.com,
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:23.080]  Seed Center, the best non-GMO, open pollinated heirloom seeds, widest selection, lowest price.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:27.560]  Go check it out, mfallwarstore.com. Whatever I'm into, whatever I think is high quality,
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:33.400]  whatever I researched, that's what we promote and sell at mfallwarstore.com and shopping with the
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:37.880]  good guys. Voting with your money is what allows me to hire more writers, more researchers and
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.800]  build our own media system to go head up against the globalist. And they are attacking me
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.280]  in national media and lying. I mean, when you see them say something outlandish on TV and don't show
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:53.800]  proof, know they're lying. I mean, Alex helped bomb Boston. He's behind it. Bloomberg, no proof,
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:36:00.040]  just insane. I'm pretty creeped out right now. Alex says Obama sent the tornado. I never said that.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.280]  Caller said, do they have weather weapons? And I said, yeah, here's AP. But I don't think this
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:10.280]  is weather weapons. That turns into, I say Obama did it. They are attacking me every day, folks.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:16.760]  And I bring that up because we told you drones were operating domestically. FBI director admits
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:22.040]  it. We told you the NSA was spying on everybody. And it's really about economic fraud manipulating
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.880]  the stock market. Now that's all come out, just as I told you. I told you they're putting up
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.240]  street lights to listen to you two years ago. Wired Magazine reported on it yesterday.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:35.160]  I mean, it's beyond 1984 and I'm right. And for whatever reason, with my bombast,
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:40.360]  I get through people's malaise. And that's why they're coming after us. So we need your
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.720]  support now, your prayers more than ever. Now I tell you, I saw this video a few days
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:51.640]  ago and we posted it on Infowars.com and it blew me away. Video's up on Infowars, but it's also at
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:59.080]  TomMabe.com, that's M-A-B-E, TomMabe.com. Everyone from Paul Harvey, good day, to the New York Times
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:06.680]  is proclaimed comedian Tom Mabe, a comic superhero. From tackling pesky telemarketers, junk email,
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:11.080]  bad customer service, and other topics that irk us all. Yeah, a lot of people copy him now.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:16.040]  By making audiences across America laugh over 15 years about the annoyances of modern life,
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.000]  Tom proves that it pays to think creatively. Yeah, and I love his perspective, how he stands
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.320]  up against the tyrants and control freaks. There's this one call, I should have queued that up,
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.360]  because I was listening to it the other day, where he filled out the forms to get calls about
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:35.160]  prepaid burial plots. And then the guy calls up and he goes, well, I'm gonna kill myself.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:39.560]  Well, don't kill yourself till you buy the plot and then do it. I mean, just amazing.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.800]  When it comes to thinking outside the box, he's nowhere near the box. And it just goes on from
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:51.720]  there. You can find out more at TomMabe.com. And you can check out his YouTube at YouTube.com
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:58.600]  forward slash Mabe in America. So check that out today. But the reason I wanted to get him on,
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.760]  we're going to him in a moment, is this video. Now for radio listeners, it's not as powerful,
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:07.640]  but radio listeners should go watch the video. And we aired part of it yesterday,
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.400]  because he goes around, we're gonna find out where, it looks like in a southern city,
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.040]  and sticks a boom microphone, like TV crews use, in between people's conversations.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.840]  He tries to walk up and read people's computers. We did a spoof on that two years ago with Aaron
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:26.520]  Dykes, because that's basically what they do. And he goes around and basically gets in people's
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.080]  conversations and stuff, which is incredible, because this is something I told my reporters
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.920]  months ago I wanted to do. We didn't do it, but I guess, liberty minded minds think a lot alike,
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.640]  and people get pretty upset. And then he says, well, what's the problem? You shouldn't be
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.680]  getting upset, it's the government. We're just doing this out in the open now. So here's a brief
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:57.160]  snippet of that. It's following a guy down the street with a cell phone.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.840]  By the way, we're going to do this. I want my entire crew to go out. Don't get beat up, but
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:11.400]  I wanna go out and say, what's the problem? NSA does it. I'm gonna go knock on doors and say,
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.200]  can I put a bug in your house, in your dishwasher? When they say, well, no, I'll go with the CIA
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.840]  director says he's doing it. Let's do it right now. And now the secret's out,
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.720]  we don't even bother hiding anymore. It's for your own safety.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:29.480]  The best part is when the dog attacks him. Yeah, we've been doing that for years, sir.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.800]  We haven't been asking anybody for over 20 years. We've been videotaping.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.760]  Now he's in a bathroom. Don't do that for real. Obama's not around the country.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:47.720]  Chuck Norris, Chuck Norris, Kung Fu. We're up in Korea, the karate guy, Chuck Norris.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.800]  Because he's wearing the suit. The guy believes Chuck Norris runs America.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:58.440]  People playing golf, this is genius. And I can tell this is real.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.640]  I just want the government, we did this periodically, just random people.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.440]  Don't fall in a woman here. All right, that's enough. Full video up on infowars.com and
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:12.120]  tommabe.com. We've asked the web guys to repost it to the front page as a tile
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:16.440]  so everybody can find it easy. Tom, great job. I haven't talked to you yet,
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.880]  ever on air or in person, but I'm guessing that was real. Those were real people, right?
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.520]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, they were pretty upset. Some of them had a gut sense of humor at the very end.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.040]  There's a table of four guys. Oh, that's brilliant. Because they understand the whole
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.400]  joke, pretend to be an NSA agent or whatnot. But man, Alex, thanks for having me on, I'm a big fan.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.560]  Oh, you bet. Well, I've been ranting for six, seven minutes. Wow. I mean, I just love your
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:45.240]  comedy because it's liberty minded. Tell us, for audience that doesn't know who you are,
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.800]  what led you to do this, your take on the NSA, and why the Pomeranian attacked you?
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.480]  Well, the Pomeranian is a Nazi. I can tell that right now. You can tell by the way you, no.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.040]  I've always been kind of this 90% troubleshooter, 10% troublemaker.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:07.560]  Like, we got similar minds, going after things that make people mad and kind of
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:12.760]  come up with a cause. And I never was big enough to be Seinfeld or whoever. And I said,
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:18.040]  I got a real passion for being victimized by telemarketers or the NSA or the government,
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:23.240]  whatever. I'm willing to draw attention to it with humor. And I've just been in it for like
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:31.000]  15, 20 years doing that. It's amazing. How did you get the idea to do this and describe it for
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.040]  radio listeners that can't see the video? Well, okay, everyone's up in arms about the NSA,
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:43.400]  invading our privacy, snooping around unbeknownst to us. So I thought now that the news has covered
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:48.200]  it and it's out, I wanna pretend to be a NSA agent. I'm gonna get the boom mic. I'm just
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.000]  gonna go over people who's using our cell phone and just hold it above their head.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:56.920]  And when they address me, hey, what's going on? I go, hey, I'm with the NSA. We monitor people's
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.320]  calls from time to time. Now that the secret's out, we don't even bother hiding anymore.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:07.000]  And I just did that all day just chasing people around. And wow, what a great time. And people
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.160]  got genuinely ticked off. Well, the government can just stick it. I mean, they were up. I mean,
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.560]  people don't- Well, one guy threatened to get up and kick your butt.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.960]  Oh, yeah, he wanted me to take the microphone and insert it in a certain part of my body. I mean,
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:24.120]  people are genuinely ticked off. And I'm like, guys, you've been being spied on for years and
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.120]  years and years. They've been hiding video cameras. They've been hiding microphones. They've
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:33.080]  been watching your every step. And now that I do it, you're gonna get upset. They've been doing it
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:39.480]  to you for 20 years. It's amazing now to see in the news that, yeah, your cable box is listening
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:45.160]  to you. And it's just over the top what they've done. For years about the lights and the corners,
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:49.160]  and you said Wired Magazine just finally came out in a minute that they have been listening
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:54.680]  and whatnot. Do you think now that America is waking up, the tide will start to turn,
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.920]  or will it just be, okay, now we're gonna put a microphone up your rear end?
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.520]  You know, I think they're gonna push a Britney Spears scandal on the news, and everyone's gonna
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.760]  forget about it in three days. But if we keep on drawing attention to it, maybe they'll take note.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.120]  I saw some of the YouTube comments, people are so dumbed down, they thought it was real,
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:20.440]  and that the NSA was actually out there. Yeah, the video was real, but they actually thought
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:26.120]  that I was an NSA agent. Well, you're wearing a dark suit. It must be true.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.160]  I had the dark glasses on. You can tell anyone that. I don't know if you remember a few years
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.640]  ago, there was a big telemarketing convention going on in Washington DC. I drive up in Louisville,
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.960]  and I check into the same hotel the telemarketers were staying. I found out what floors are on,
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:43.400]  what rooms they're in. At three o'clock in the morning, I start calling them,
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.920]  trying to sell them stuff. And they got so much attention that I'm hoping that this
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.800]  this spoof, this comedy gag, will do the same thing.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:57.480]  Because, in essence, you're spying on them in plain view and they're upset,
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.520]  it's even worse to be doing it covertly and it's illegal.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:06.040]  Yes, yes, it is against the law to covertly do that. And I'm doing it in the plan of admitting
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:11.800]  that I'm doing it. And you can see how people react if they only knew how much their privacy
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.040]  was being invaded. Where did you do this particular shoot? I did that in my hometown of
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:21.560]  Louisville, Kentucky, on Barstown Road, Shelbyville Road. I went to Churchill down to the bathrooms
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:26.200]  down there, snuck in down there. It was a mess of my people down there. And everything was done
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.640]  in Louisville. Good old Louisville. If you did that in maybe Dallas, Texas, you'd get that
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.960]  response, or Louisville. If you went where Mark Dice goes, I don't know if you've seen his videos,
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:40.600]  in LA, he goes, we want Nazi Germany to keep Obama safe. And we want to turn all the guns
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.920]  in and put all the tea partiers in prison. And people go, I hear you, let's put them in a FEMA
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.080]  camp. I mean, let me tell you, I don't know what's going on in LA, but it's scary.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.240]  Oh, man, we'll do a lot of pranks. We do the same pranks on the hood just to see what kind
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.600]  of different response we'll get. And it's amazing how, not just anywhere, you can go to a high fluid
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:08.680]  neighborhood or Los Angeles or whatever. And I've never done anything in Los Angeles deep in LA,
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.680]  but I would love to do that. What was the difference when you were in the hood versus
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:18.360]  some of the fancier areas there in Louisville? The hood, people really, really seem to
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:24.200]  overly, overly react. I mean, getting, you know, the physical, I had a guy pull a knife on me,
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.400]  it's on my YouTube channel. It's not that, I don't, I'm going to be careful how I wear this.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.480]  I don't want to come off racist or whatever, but in the hood, they're just really, I mean,
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.800]  you know, you're, I'm down and out already and you're making fun of me, or you're trying to
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:43.000]  spy on me, or you're trying to pull a prank on me. They're very, very upset, but I try to never,
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.920]  I'm not going to go just pee on someone to get a reaction. Every prank I do, I try to have some
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.920]  kind of purpose behind it. And to answer your question, when you do stuff like that in the hood,
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:57.960]  I mean, boy, wow, the reaction you get is amazing. Oh, absolutely. But I mean, that's good in a way,
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:03.080]  because I've noticed that people in lower income areas, period, tend to be more awake,
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.920]  but then they think, well, what can you do about it? You go in the yuppie areas
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.520]  and they're like, oh, good, then spy on me for my safety. They just think submitting is good
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.680]  because they're so gullible. But as America goes bankrupt, I think you're going to see less and
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:22.440]  less of that. I mean, what was the difference in the yuppie areas? The yuppie areas, they would
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.120]  just ignore you. They didn't like, oh, Trevor, come on, let's get out of here. You know,
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:34.840]  the best reaction, horrible man, who's a guy with a large black object, a bigger head.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:41.560]  I think that the best reaction when I did it on my redneck white trash folk,
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.040]  those guys are, they're the ones that threaten me, if you see in the video, ready to kick my ass.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:51.800]  You know, the hood people were like, you know, I hate the government. Government can stick it.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.240]  And the white trash redneck folk was ready to be like, well, that ain't right. I'm going to
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:02.600]  kick someone's ass. That ain't right. Oh, man, I tell you, it's unbelievable.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.440]  It's unbelievable. Well, if you look at it, the government sends the police after, it's the
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.600]  rednecks and the black people and stuff, just basically anybody that they think isn't buying
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:15.560]  into it. But the yuppies, I don't care what color they are, they absolutely love the tyranny.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:24.040]  And it's shocking. Looking at this as it expands, what other scandals are you upset about right now?
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:28.440]  And give us a sneak peek, unless you think it'll influence the experiment.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.520]  What are some of the other pranks you're thinking of doing? Oh, boy, we're doing a lot of stuff,
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:36.760]  good positive stuff with homeless people and trying to get the yuppies to feed them and whatnot.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:42.440]  You know, every week is a different topic, be it high gas prices. The IRS, the next prank's
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  going to be actually about the IRS. I got audited a couple years ago and the guy's like,
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.560]  Mr. Mabey claimed you spent $14,000 in hotel rooms last year, but you don't have the receipts.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:59.000]  Like, man, I got the towels and I just threw the guy for a loop. So we're gonna have fun with
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.160]  write-offs and things like that. Anything we can draw attention to and try to put a comedic spin
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.040]  to it. Well, what they do with the IRS now, six years ago, they got rulings where they go after
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.720]  the CPAs if they give you legal and lawful exemptions that all the ultra-rich use and
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.280]  get left alone. And then now the CPAs tell you, we're not gonna do that cuz we'll be liable.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:23.960]  And so basically, the real tax rate's like 60% for somebody in the middle class.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.120]  They claim it's 40, but it's not really. And they're like, don't exit your home office or
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:32.280]  we'll audit you and take the money back. And you're like, but what if I really work out of
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:40.440]  a home office? Or- I work out of, 20% of my home is my home office. And I edit video,
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.440]  I shoot out of there. And maybe they can come, if I get in trouble, maybe they come and sue
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:49.480]  TurboTax for me. People do my taxes. But they tell you work at home, it's better for the
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:54.360]  environment, but then that's the number one audit is a home office. Yeah, yeah. And my
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:49:01.560]  CPAs like, I'm not gonna do that. And I'm like, but I've got an office, I do shows out
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:08.360]  of my house, I'm on air. People still ask me, hey, what's your day job, Alex? Do people
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:13.320]  ever ask you what your day job is? And yeah, geez, ladies, I'm busy working and when I'm
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.760]  not busy working, I'm busy trying to find work. That's my whole- No, no, but you're
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.880]  a very successful nationally acclaimed comic. My whole point is family and stuff. You'll
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.440]  be like a family reunion. They're like, so Alex, you're on the radio. So what's your
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.160]  full time job? Or my biggest thing is, yeah, what do you do? What's your other job, your
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.800]  real job? I'm moving because I got plugged my thing in. And the other thing, because
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:43.320]  I'm self-employed, my siblings tend to think that I'm the guy who takes my mom to the doctor
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.920]  four times a week or I'm the guy who can go pick up the laundry or dry cleaning. But people
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:53.160]  don't realize, when you are self-employed, you have to work four times harder than a
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:58.040]  normal person. No, exactly. People that go just work at a company, clock in, clock out,
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:02.600]  they've got their job. And I'm sure it's tough, but when you're running the show, let me tell
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.760]  you, it is something. But you know what Obama said? He said you didn't build that. Hey,
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.560]  we could go out on the street and walk up to people mowing their yard, a person painting
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:18.040]  by the river, an art show. Come and tell them you didn't build that, you didn't paint that.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:23.560]  That would be a great video to do. Wow, that's a great premise. Well, I'm giving you just
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.840]  fair warning. I am gonna rip off your piece. We're gonna go out and duplicate it here in
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:31.320]  Austin. Give me about a week or two, let this one simmer a little bit. No, man, anything
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.200]  you do is great. I'm a huge fan. And when someone tweeted me and said that you had put
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.680]  me up on your side, I freaked out. Oh no, no, I was joking. If I tell my crew to do something,
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:46.360]  that's guaranteed it's not gonna happen. So it's not gonna happen. If I said do not go out
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.640]  and duplicate that, then it's guaranteed to be everywhere. I'm being sarcastic. Maybe I'm not.
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.640]  Anyways, we'll be right back. I'm gonna talk more about some of the things that Tom Mabe
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.360]  is doing and then we're gonna come back with a guest in studio. In the last two years alone,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.440]  the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US,
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:13.320]  costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:18.040]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:23.960]  affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:29.160]  not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:33.640]  availability of your food supply with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.840]  nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't

[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.800]  or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:47.480]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing

[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:16.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. I am your host,
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:21.320]  Alex Jones. The third hour is coming up. And for about 30 minutes of that hour,
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:28.280]  we're gonna have in studio, Janae Gerard, who's one of the main plaintiffs on the lawsuit
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:35.320]  against the Idaho based company that patented the genes for breast cancer.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:40.440]  And then wanted people to pay $4,000 or more to get the test that was based on their genes.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:46.360]  And the Supreme Court rightly overthrew that, ladies and gentlemen. So that will destroy
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:52.120]  progress and you can't patent what someone already owns. It's like patenting the wheel.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:58.040]  You can patent a certain type of wheel, or a wheel patch, or a wheel plug, but you can't
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:03.880]  patent the wheel, or there'd be one wheel and that was it. So we're gonna be breaking that
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:07.960]  down with her in studio. I got a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet. Suspicious deaths of
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:13.800]  journalists, Fox commentator paid $50,000 to tout stock. Let's put our guest YouTube up there,
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:19.560]  because it is just amazingly funny and provocative, youtube.com forward slash
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.720]  Mabe, M-A-B-E in America, and that's up on screen.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:27.960]  And there's just so much hilarious stuff up there. And I've invited him whenever he feels
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.760]  like it to be a contributor on Infowars Nightly News to play excerpts of what he's done and then
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.840]  direct people to his site. Because I'm a big fan of what he does. I'm a fan of what Mark
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:42.680]  Dice does. You illustrate absurdity, as Rush Limbaugh likes to say, by being absurd and
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:46.920]  showing how absurd society has gotten. That doesn't mean I agree with everything Rush
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.720]  Limbaugh says, but I agree with him on that. We have to really show how crazy society's
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:58.600]  gotten and get people out of their trance. Let me ask you this question. Tom, do you
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:04.600]  think humanity is gonna make it? Or what type of clashes do you see coming up in the future?
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.600]  What would you like to impart in closing to our viewers and listeners?
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:19.240]  Wow. What do I think humanity is in store? Who knows? I'm already pulling my kids
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:23.960]  out of public schools. I'm already pulling them out of private schools. I'm afraid what the
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:31.000]  future holds. I hate to be this big conspiracy guy, but I'm taking money out of the bank.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.920]  I'm hiding it in places. I worry about the economy. I worry about our country a lot.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:38.040]  You don't trust the foreign banks that run the government that steal
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:42.680]  85 billion a month publicly? No, I'm one of those weird ones that just don't trust them, man.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.400]  I bet you think the NSA spied on you without warrants. How are they gonna survive
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:51.080]  politically when they said none of this existed and now it's all out in the open?
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.760]  That's why it scares me. But you asked me what I'm worried. I'm worried that we can have
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:04.600]  proof. We can have video of an NSA guy spying on you. And still people will forget about it
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:10.760]  because they're gonna pull another story or another war or something to distract from the
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:16.280]  truth. And that's what scares me, that people will not wake up. Wake up. The Federal Reserve
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.440]  is not a Federal Reserve at all. They are spying on you, this and that. And we just
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:25.080]  wanna ignore it and buy our minivans and just keep on going. That scares me.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:29.320]  I agree with you. I think humanity is gonna make it, but I think we're gonna go through
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:34.120]  some serious pain. I mean, I think we're gonna make it too. But I mean, already I
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:37.400]  can tell a big difference between that and just five years ago.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:43.800]  I agree, I agree. But in the negative and the positive, it's like the best of times,
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:50.280]  worst of times. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see that, I can see that. I guess being a dad,
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:55.480]  and I just worry about the future and security. That's the biggest thing.
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:59.560]  And I'm fortunate enough to work quite a bit. I've been very lucky to be self-employed.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:04.440]  But I worry about, am I gonna have to create a career for my kids? Are they gonna be okay? I
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:08.440]  mean, even if they get their college degree- Exactly. No, no, it's once you have kids,
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.200]  it really makes you care about the future of humanity and the world they're gonna live in.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:15.800]  I don't know why all these people like Jamie Dimon can cheat the whole world and he has kids.
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:19.880]  I don't know what he... He's not gonna get away with it. Yeah, they're residuals,
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.920]  it's gonna hurt him. Huge time dividends down the road. Absolutely. Well, listen,
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:29.800]  we're really impressed with your work. And again, if people wanna visit the YouTube channel,

[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:09.480]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:32.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:40.360]  By the way, the story just went up on Infowars.com. You saw MSNBC a few months ago say in promos,
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:43.880]  your children belong to the government and the state. You've seen the California
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.280]  argue in federal courts that parents should have no, parents period should not be the
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:51.640]  guardians. It's the state now and all the perverts that work at the state.
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:59.080]  New Jersey Supreme Court. State can seek custody of a child without evidence of
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:05.720]  abuse. Look at that ruling. New Jersey has got so many good people and listeners there.
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:11.880]  We have just massive listenership. But I just see more evil and more bizarreness and more
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:17.560]  corruption out of New Jersey. I mean, it is a government. Well, it's not an armpit,
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.080]  it's something worse. It's a government rear end where they just crap all over everybody.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.080]  I'm sorry, but that's what they're doing. And it says the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled this week
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:32.600]  that authorities, not servants, they're the authorities. We do it all for your safety.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.680]  Can seek custody of a child even where there is no evidence of abuse or neglect. My goodness.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:43.160]  And in Germany, they're taking the kids of homeschoolers and Christians.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  I had lunch or breakfast with people from Denmark. I looked up their case. It's a famous
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:53.800]  case, but I've got their cards somewhere. I meant to get them on. And they're Christians that tried
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:58.440]  to homeschool, so they called them terrorists and took a bunch of their kids. I mean, it's just,
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:05.640]  the state is a cult. It's a cult, man. We're all in danger. The case involved a divorced
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.880]  Camden County mother of nine-year-old twins. 2007, she asked New Jersey Division of Child
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:14.840]  Protective Services for help, claiming she was unable to care for the girls who had psychological
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.080]  and developmental difficulties needed to be placed in residential care. Yep, your kids are
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:22.200]  so damaged from all the chemicals and biologicals in the food and water. You just give them to the
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.800]  state. In the future, they're gonna euthanize them. That's what they're moving for. By the way,
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:30.920]  you think I'm kidding. That's on record to plan. You can turn them over the division for help, but
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:36.440]  it may come with a cost, says Diane Austin, Executive Director of Statewide Parent Advocacy.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.320]  And it goes on to say that now the state will take them whenever they want.
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.480]  It could end with an award of custody to the division for at least six months,
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.160]  maybe even longer. And it just goes on. They're saying there doesn't need to be any evidence
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:52.360]  you're a bad parent. The state wants your kids. But the ruling can be used against people that
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.840]  don't want their kids taken, the article goes on. And it's just gonna get worse and worse.
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:04.280]  People go, but that's tyranny. That's right. You don't stand up, the worst people get in charge.
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.680]  And then they get replaced with people that are even more vicious and wicked and twisted
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:18.920]  and inventing new evils. They run around continually inventing new forms of wickedness.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:21.960]  There's a Bible verse. We've got to search the Bible verse.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:28.600]  Say Bible verse inventing new forms of evil or running around continually
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.360]  inventing new forms of wickedness. I want the exact quote, thanks. Let's go to a clip
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:37.480]  of the MSNBC promo that they ran hundreds of times and are still running,
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:43.720]  saying your kids belong to them. We haven't had a very collective notion of these are
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:48.360]  our children. So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.920]  to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.400]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:02.360]  investment. And the idea is, hey, don't take care of your kids. We will. Hey, most your kids got
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:09.400]  neurological disorders. We're not going to ask why that happened. We did it to him. We're going
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.160]  to we're going to take them from you. And now they're saying kill kids up to age three of
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:19.080]  their autistic. That's the Journal of Bioethics, slanders, God haters, insulin, arrogant and
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:26.280]  boastful. They invent ways of doing evil. They disobey their parents. And what was put that
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:31.720]  back up for me to give the verse Romans one thirty, ladies and gentlemen, and that's the
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:38.680]  new international version. Where's the King James? King James always says it best. But there you go,
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:47.400]  my friends. There you go. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:53.960]  evil things, disobedient to parents. Why not just get rid of the parents? The state comes to your
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:59.320]  kids and says, hey, little kid, we'll be your friend. The kids always beg later. Then it's too
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:05.720]  late. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:11.320]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:16.760]  as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.800]  was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products at info

[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:23.160]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine,

[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:27.240]  to Alex Jones. Well Harvard has come out and said guess what's causing our autism in a big national
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:34.680]  decade-long study? It's mercury. They don't say where it's coming from. They say maybe diesel
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:41.160]  fumes, oh maybe maybe something they can tax but but but never the mercury in the vaccines
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:46.440]  and here's another report technology and collective action the effect of cell phone coverage
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:54.600]  and political violence in Africa. We're going to be breaking that down coming up and here's a new
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:59.960]  ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court. The CPS can take your children with no evidence of neglect
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:04.280]  or abuse. You thought it was bad that you know they come to your house because the neighbor
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:08.120]  saw your kids playing in the backyard. You see those cases and then you invite them in
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:13.240]  and they say they see dirty plates in the sink. Of course you go to a CPS facility they're like
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:16.920]  abusing the children. There's dirt everywhere. They're locking them up in basements. That's
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:23.080]  okay though but not even a dirty plate now. We just want to take your kids disappeared off with
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:30.200]  their heads you know for their safety. Take them away. NDAA take you away. Spy on you without
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:38.440]  warrants. Why not? It's for your safety. 85 billion a month to foreign banks. Congress is
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:42.760]  told they won't be told specifically who gets it. That doesn't sound like a heist. 85 billion a
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:49.160]  month now for a year and a half. It was 40 billion a month before that. That's just one way they're
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:55.000]  stealing. Last number I saw in Bloomberg was 47 trillion in banker bailouts the last four years.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  It's really five years but we haven't got a number in a year. Gee wonder why they want
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.680]  tyranny. 47 trillion stolen. Not even our debt but everything's fine. We're gonna talk about
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:09.720]  some positive news though and it shows the fighting spirit of six plaintiffs. One of them is
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:14.760]  here in studio with us who went to the Supreme Court and won the big landmark case last week.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.480]  Then you can't patent genes and then block people from getting treatment with their own genes. We
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:25.400]  own our bodies. What does this mean to Monsanto trying to patent plant genes and virus RNA?
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:31.240]  This is a big victory for sanity as Mike Adams put it and we're going to be going over that
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:36.200]  here in a moment but first here is the new expanded breakdown trailer for the new film
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:41.960]  we are selling. The exclusive distributors right now at Infowarsstore.com. State of mind.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:49.720]  Infowarsstore.com because there's a war on for your mind. That has been my maxim since we started
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:57.720]  Infowars.com back in 1996 because there is a war on for all of our minds. Advertising is a basic
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:04.760]  form of propaganda but there are dozens of other types of even more sophisticated and most of the
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:11.240]  public is not even aware that this is happening. The new documentary film State of Mind is
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:16.760]  incredibly well done and goes over the history, goes over the crimes, goes over the things that
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:21.480]  have been committed by our government and other governments and how that system is now being
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:28.200]  deployed against us today. It is such an important documentary film and it's vital that everyone see
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:35.160]  it so that people be aware of the fact that manipulation of our psyche is indeed going on.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:41.240]  In fact this film is so important. It's so key that the general public who is sleeping see it
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:48.680]  that I'm doing something we've never done before when we offer a new film and that is offer another
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:54.680]  free film with it because it's important to know who controls the brainwashing and programming
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:12:00.920]  system in the mainstream media. The private globalist controlled Federal Reserve. The animated
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:08.280]  film An American Dream documents in a compelling but also humorous fashion how the private families
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:14.440]  that control the Federal Reserve took over our world. It's key to understand that they are using
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:19.560]  the technology of mind control to dumb down and keep the general public in the dark and that's
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:26.360]  why for a limited time when you order State of Mind the full-length documentary film at

[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:51.240]  Are we choosing our own paths, our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:13:04.840]  C.S. Lewis said when training beats education, civilization dies. We need to always be cognizant
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:10.440]  of as a free society that information can be used as a weapon. Barrier to discoveries not ignorance
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:17.160]  it's the illusion of knowledge. We are seen as nothing but biological androids. To gain control
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:24.920]  of education in America not for a philanthropic purpose but to change the thinking of the American
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:29.160]  people. From the time we're very young we're taught to you know worship authority basically
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.400]  because that's our key to survival as young children. Discover the history, the present,
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:40.680]  and the future of mind control. From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:47.320]  we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. And the CIA scientists
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:53.560]  could actually film people who had been surreptitiously dosed with LSD. There's a brain
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:14:00.280]  entrainment process that takes place. That gives the government free rein to create whatever story
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.680]  or narrative it wants to create. Whatever the public face of something is, whatever they're
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.760]  talking about publicly, there's something else over here they're probably not looking at. How to
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.480]  engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would fully endorse not only endorse
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:23.240]  but demand a war. When you watch mainline establishment television you are putting yourself
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:31.640]  in front of the barrel of a gun. Discover the history, the present, and the future of mind control.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:40.120]  Psychological warfare, brainwashing. Are we controlled and manipulated? You bet. That's mind control par

[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:36.840]  taking action Janae Girard is a hero she's one of the six plaintiffs in the last two and a half
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:42.760]  year battle against some of the biggest biotech companies out there and and they're not getting
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:48.440]  money they weren't plaintiffs for judgments she wanted to be able to get this test for breast
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:53.480]  cancer and was unable to get it and she has been basically the poster child of the person willing
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:58.840]  to work the hardest show that justice be served to America and the rest of the world and last
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:03.800]  week they had the ruling and here's the ruling right there it's the size of a good-sized town's
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:11.880]  phone book and her Facebook is Janae.Girard and Twitter JanaeGirard just twitter.com forward slash
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:20.120]  JanaeGirard and YouTube is beyond the booby trap and she joins us here today we're going to break
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:24.920]  here in a few minutes you're asked tonight we're honored to have you congratulations it shows that
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:29.800]  justice can prevail and that all is not lost to tell people in a nutshell about the case and about
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:37.080]  the ruling. Well basically this happened just recently and in you know in the supreme court
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.360]  this case went all the way up from federal to the supreme court what that means is that
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:49.240]  women everywhere will now be able to get the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer test and it won't
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:55.160]  cost thirty six hundred dollars they believe that now the monopoly is broken the test will drop to
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:02.200]  about a hundred and fifty dollars so now myriad is prevented from actually owning a part of the body
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:07.720]  so what that means for the whole US is that all the other companies that were getting ready to
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:14.840]  patent genes which was about 22 in the queue those biotech companies can't patent other parts
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:23.480]  of the body that revolve around hearing loss you know MLS eyesight so there are a bunch of medical
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:28.280]  yeah they could patent a treatment but but you can't patent the body that's right but they did
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:36.280]  so this overturns that wow it's like Monsanto's told companies okay you found our our chemicals
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:41.640]  and things in the honeybees you can't do a test we own that chemical in the bee that's right it's
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:48.360]  amazing yeah it really is one of the judges made a lot of sense when he said you can pluck a leaf
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:53.800]  off of the tree but it's still fundamentally part of the tree it's the same thing you can bring at
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:59.720]  your DNA or a piece of the DNA you know out of the body but it's still it's still part of the body
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:04.200]  that's what Monsanto's doing is they go take corn they change it then it infects everything
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:09.160]  and then when they infect your crop and it's then they come after you and the court rules it's okay
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:14.440]  because they own the judges but this is a big deal to them too yeah it really is it really is
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:19.720]  this is one of the biggest supreme court rulings positive ones i've ever seen in my lifetime
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:24.120]  i mean you've got to really feel good when that ruling came down what did it feel like
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:31.160]  i was like i was ecstatic i mean i've you know i put probably well myself and the other five
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:37.640]  plaintiffs have been a part of this for over two and a half years and we had 150 friends of the
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:44.200]  court um which was a lot of medical associations and people that wanted to block you know this
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:50.360]  genetic patenting so um it was a really big deal it was uh it was exciting to be a part of history

[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:19.880]  their genes patented and being told they couldn't test uh for a proclivity to develop certain types
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:24.120]  of cancer i mean look i could ask a lot of questions here all i can say is i don't get
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:29.480]  excited about being around a hollywood star or a sports person who i'm not already you know into
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:33.400]  or whatever just because they're famous or something to me being around somebody that
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.680]  took action did the right thing against the odds and did something for humanity that is exciting
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:45.160]  janae janae girard again is this an example to us all where should we start getting into the ruling
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:49.160]  what you went through what happened what this means i think maybe a little bit a little bit
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:53.960]  of background about you know what happened to me and why i took the test um you know i was in my
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:25:01.560]  30s and basically um what happened was i took the test after i was diagnosed to try to find out what
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:08.200]  my odds were and when you get tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene if you if you test positive for
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:14.280]  BRCA1 you're at a higher chance of a reoccurrence for breast cancer if you test positive for BRCA2
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:18.840]  then that means you're at a higher risk for not only breast cancer but ovarian cancer
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:25.240]  so when i tested positive for BRCA2 at 38 and i was divorced and i hadn't had children
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:32.040]  that meant that my biggest odds in my favor would be to go ahead and get a double mastectomy and my
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:37.960]  ovaries out well that's why i wanted the second opinion but myriad laboratory would not run the
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:44.920]  test again they they refused and so i couldn't get a second opinion so i had to make decisions
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:52.840]  very you know life felt decisions based on that one test in my 30s so that was a really really
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:58.840]  big deal there were other women in the case uh one they wouldn't accept their their her insurance
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:05.000]  so she uh she even if you have the money they won't take it i mean exactly it's just like how
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.920]  many and they've patented our genes yeah yeah yeah so it was it was just really hard because
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:16.280]  i was trying to make the best decisions for myself and you know at that time there were
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:22.440]  other companies that were able to run the test including syracuse university and but myriad
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:28.760]  would slap a cease and desist order on anybody that would run that test so um you didn't have
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:35.960]  many options also what was fresh what do they look bad now yeah the other uh terrible thing was
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:45.080]  they were the uh myriad requires you to watch a video and that video was very forceful on on you
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:50.840]  know scare tactics to try to get you to take the test so literally they play this video and it's
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:57.080]  horrible i mean it's you know it's it's definitely a scare test tactics and they sure lobbied to try
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.200]  to suppress this i brought up angela joe lee to you who i politically don't you know don't really
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.320]  like but but the larger issue is why is breast cancer exploding why is there never a discussion
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:12.440]  about that why don't we find out what's causing it to increase because the genes are there but it
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:17.880]  means when this environment changes the proclivity goes up yes part of its genes nature but most of
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:23.640]  it is environment and nurture yeah i agree with that i agree that we're not i don't think our
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:29.640]  energies are in the right direction really i mean i i you know as somebody that has people that are
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:34.680]  you know dying around them you know at young ages it's very frustrating well it's scary i've got
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.120]  daughters i've got a wife i've got a grandmother often not today she has breast cancer for like the
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:42.360]  last six seven years it's been growing slowly she they pressure her to you know do that but she
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:46.600]  looked at the numbers and talked to her older doctor and decided not to do it but you know it's
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.760]  frightening for men because we love our women and and oh you look at the graph it's going straight
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:55.480]  up my daughter's knock on wood if we don't find out what's doing this it's the glyphosate so what
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.960]  do you think's increasing the breast cancer i think it's a number of things i mean the our
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:05.400]  environment and the just our food sources um there's so many different things sedimentary
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:11.720]  lifestyle um you know there um it's just it's a number of things growth hormone in the food oh
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:20.840]  yeah yeah this phenol a estrogen mimicers oh yeah big time i think that the top um the top version
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:27.480]  the top version of tumors is zero positive over 88 percent i believe now so that that's all
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:33.640]  estrogen driven so yeah when girls are going into puberty at seven it's going to accelerate the
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:40.600]  aging of the sexual organs i mean it's well we had over 219 000 women diagnosed last year with
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.800]  breast cancer total so i mean that's a huge number yeah i was looking it's like up three thousand
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:51.720]  percent in the last 50 years yeah it's crazy well let's never discuss why it's up though i know i
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:57.480]  know so my issue is i i agree with women's right to have things removed if they want to my issue is
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:01.400]  they're only pushing that option they're not saying let's find out what's doing it
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:08.520]  i just i really believe um that big pharma plays a huge role in this and that um you know if you
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:13.560]  look at how much the oncology drugs are out there i mean some of them are over a thousand dollars
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:18.520]  a vial you know just for a 30 ml vial and if the more and more you look at it i mean that's one of
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:26.280]  the most illegal imported substances over gain right now is a illegal oncology drugs because
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:32.840]  they make more money on them so they'll cut a vial by you know a third and add sodium chloride that
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:37.640]  wouldn't give the patient a you know a reaction and so they they're bringing those across the
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:42.760]  border with a holograms that match the uh you know the incredible i want to talk about the
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:48.280]  court ruling with this hero on the other side supreme court ruling saying you own your jeans

[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:40.840]  read it read it i'm saying take it out of the water i'm saying stop these cities i'm ranting
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:44.360]  she's gonna be on the nightly news tonight to really get into detail on all this and we've got
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:49.160]  the whole supreme court ruling right here you've got the floor janae what are the other points
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:54.680]  people should know about where this is going what you think's behind it how big a deal this ruling
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:36:00.920]  is what happened behind the scenes and just how far reaching this is because they say this affects
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:07.240]  monsanto everybody this is a devastating victory that you've engaged in here it really is it
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:12.920]  affects everybody in the country um you know in the beginning it was a little bit of a difficult
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:18.520]  uphill battle to educate everybody on what this is about because no one really believed that that
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:24.200]  our u.s government allowed one company to patent part of the body but what what this means is
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:29.880]  because they declared it unconstitutional that basically means that that every other laboratory
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:38.840]  every other bio company cannot basically patent a gene and make money off of it because it is a part
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:45.720]  of the body so um it is wide reaching you know if you look at myriad for example they um they
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:51.080]  would run a hundred tests a day at thirty five hundred dollars and they banked all of our breast
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:55.960]  cancer genes since they've been in existence so i mean how does that retard research you know i
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:02.040]  mean how do we know where incidences of breast cancer are popping up you know more frequently
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:07.400]  uh it's just crazy it's crazy monsanto used that again to block investigations of what they're
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:12.600]  doing right right yeah because when you patent that gene now nobody can look at it that's right
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:16.760]  oh i tell you well talk about a cover-up i mean yeah it was why do you think the supreme court
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:21.880]  did the right thing they usually the wrong thing nowadays well we had our fingers crossed let me
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:29.400]  tell you um i think they felt uh i think honestly i think they felt a lot of pressure from um from
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:33.960]  the science community in the medical community especially and i think they want their kids to
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:39.960]  get these treatments oh yeah yeah yeah totally so i i think they were feeling a lot of pressure
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:47.160]  and um you know there is also there's a prometheus case just before this that was similar and um so
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:52.440]  you know they have to follow precedence so i you know i just really think they're feeling a lot of
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:57.400]  pressure on this one especially since they were about you know 20 to 22 genes that were in the
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:04.440]  queue to be patented so and people go hey it's a free market it's a company they didn't patent a
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:10.520]  treatment for something which would be fine we're all for you know funding whatever works they are
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:17.160]  patenting your genes my genes i agree with that um you know i'm an entrepreneur and so if they
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:22.920]  developed a system to be able to isolate a gene you could patent that you know or trademark that
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:28.840]  system that's one thing but they were literally extracting a gene and calling it theirs and so
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:33.480]  that that's the difference that'd be like if somebody dug up gold and went and patented gold
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:39.480]  and said now you can't have it i own all the gold right i mean it's just it's asinine right yeah
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:44.440]  yeah wow uh but what upset me is i've seen foreign courts and other courts had ruled
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:50.040]  they could do this so i'm glad it got struck down yeah yeah i was i was extremely excited
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:56.280]  you know um i i just it's been an uphill battle for a lot of women if this opens up the door
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.880]  for more women to be able to get you know testing done and be able to make wise decisions based on
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:08.360]  their hereditary disposition you know disposition mine happens to be where i have cancer that runs
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:14.440]  in my family so that's why i got the test originally but uh what did you decide to do after
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:19.240]  you i went ahead and got a double mastectomy and i went ahead and got an oophorectomy which is my
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:26.280]  over result i know that's a tough decision i can't say what i i would do you know my only issue is
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:31.000]  i'm concerned though because there's a double-edged sword there's other lobbies in big medical that
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.600]  are now going to use this you know to scare women that have had the test like you said their video
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:41.400]  was scary and then again it'll all be about mitigating things instead of asking because
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.920]  i understand that you're predisposed to genetics but it's other things that then turn that on
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:50.760]  and accelerate that because people have the genetics you had before and this wasn't happening
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:56.680]  anywhere near these numbers so my concern is that okay now we say we own our genes is a big victory
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:03.240]  but now they're just going to move in and make money the other way uh it's it's just i mean i
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:07.560]  want to like reverse this i don't want to find the cure which they're never going to really find
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.760]  i want to find why it's happening and stop it i agree with you i'd rather do that than throw
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:18.120]  drugs at it you know i mean let's figure out what's causing these issues and go after it i
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:23.640]  mean i've got i've got people in in my group my breast cancer group that are marathon runners that
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:28.920]  have been in shape and eating well all of their lives and like they're coming down with it you
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:34.760]  know in their 20s and 30s it's it's a total epidemic it's crazy yeah you could again there's
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.360]  different types of breast cancers obviously but three thousand percent increase in the last 50
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.600]  something years is a low number i mean some pediatric cancers are up over ten thousand
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:47.320]  percent and kids didn't used to get cancer now it's epidemic and then you go to third world
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:52.200]  countries none of them have this in the middle of nowhere i mean it's it's it's a we know it's the
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:59.320]  glyphosate's literally turn on cancer i mean it's it's amazing all the studies on that then you add
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:05.080]  in the fluoride and the toxins and the gmo well there's another problem too that people don't
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:11.480]  talk about the doctors push the tests so the doctors were pushing the myriad tests without
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:16.920]  any other options so they weren't behind changing it either oh they're making money yeah so that
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:24.840]  was a big problem it's disgusting it is it's disgusting i mean my dad you know went to medical
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:28.280]  school and they were told you're supposed to give a third of your services for free there's no
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:33.240]  government involved you just do that and now most doctors don't do that and then he's the type of
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:37.720]  minority doctor that does so he has lines around the block and then you know he tries to get
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:41.880]  clinics and people give him discounts to help poor people they just won't do it it's so cold-blooded
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:48.360]  yeah it is it is and and to think too like a number of the women that i know that were um
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:53.800]  you know trying to get the test run that didn't have insurance they're sitting around waiting
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:59.320]  to try to you know get a a grant or something like that and i mean that's ridiculous you don't have
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:03.880]  time to you know sit around and wait when you have cancer to try to make decisions i'm surprised
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:08.680]  there hasn't been a move politically to destroy the stock of that company as a political protest
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:13.240]  because you know that would be a good lesson to these these like Bayer pharmaceutical that
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:17.560]  knowingly had HIV and hepatitis and the factor eight you know hundreds of thousands of people
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:22.360]  ended up getting it and dying and then you get in trouble these companies are sick yeah these
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:28.440]  are sick people yeah they really are yep i've had first-hand experience and then if there's
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:34.600]  no charity out there or no goodwill just pure greed then the government comes in as the charity
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:38.360]  group but they're run by the same people yeah it's like there's no way out well you're gonna
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:42.680]  go to the nightly news here uh and and after you walk out of this live radio show you'll probably
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:47.240]  think oh i wish i would have covered that what else do you want to impart to people i just want
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:53.480]  people to know that um you know to stay aware and to you know to listen and really pay attention to
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:58.200]  what's going on because you know a number of people um weren't paying attention to what was
[02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:03.480]  going on in their own medical community and and they were shocked by the supreme court ruling they
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:08.760]  had no idea it was going on and so just to really stay educated about what is going on and stay on
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:13.320]  the pulse which shows like yours you know that where they can see what's going on and make a
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:19.000]  difference they can speak out and they can you know rustle feathers and create a ruckus so i
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.400]  think that's very important people people don't need to be sheeple they need to get out there and
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:28.040]  make a difference to understand the magnitude of this case i want to get briefly into some of the
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.680]  other aspects that you've talked about with the lawyers and and all the hundreds of uh amicus
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:36.920]  briefs that were brought in by medical groups and people that really want to move things forward if
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:42.200]  you patent a gene you lock down all of the research around that gene and treatments and
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:47.000]  things which again the insiders are still going to move to an offshore base like Singapore which
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  they've been doing and only use it for themselves but it's good to see progress went out you know
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:55.320]  the genies out of the bottle people that's my hope people are really going to demand progress
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.480]  and that's what's going to lead us into a cleaner industrial age you know lead us to the stars i
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:04.440]  mean that's the answer is is in the stars and that greater potential i mean that's that's what
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:09.480]  i fear not my own physical death i fear the death of the species are not reaching that incredible
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:13.960]  potential i i just have a dream for everybody else that's going to come after us like my ancestors
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:19.640]  had a dream but you have helped by taking action one of the first people to you know call for this
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:23.800]  then you don't like to brag about yourself but helping initiate a lot of this if you wouldn't
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.640]  have done this they would have probably gotten some bad case law and gone this is this is a big
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:33.640]  deal that now we can study genes and and and try to help people instead of these companies
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:39.160]  locking them down for themselves that that is it's not even about them saying we own the gene
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:45.560]  it's about saying nobody else can look at this that that is that is a war against progress it's
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:55.320]  a monopoly it's a total monopoly it's a monopoly of the human body that's a huge uh ruling yes
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:00.920]  have you had a chance to read it all yet i've read some of it you know i've read quite a bit
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:07.960]  of it a lot of its legal jargon that is a little out there but um it's pretty it's pretty amazing
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.720]  i've read the synopses and talked to some of the constitutional lawyers they say it's good
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:14.760]  yeah and i was really surprised i was looking for some sneakiness in there
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:20.440]  uh i'm telling you everybody at the supreme court and the government everybody else and the nsa
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:24.200]  you're going to destroy all our futures if you don't start doing the right thing on every front
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:31.400]  okay that's what we need to do and stop letting fat cat monopoly insiders ruin our world through
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:36.680]  fraud i'm all for profit i'm a libertarian but these people are the opposite of that
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:41.400]  they they are the problem yeah what are you talking about on the nightly news tonight janae
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:45.880]  well i just i'd like to talk about the ruling but i also like to talk a little bit about my
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:53.000]  experience and how it affected me and um and how it affects you know all women and um and just how
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.480]  excited we are and how how the change is going to come down the pipeline what that looks like
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:02.440]  yeah i don't feel like i should apologize to uh angelina joe lee but but almost seeing the press
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:06.120]  coverage of her you know you know some people saying hey she's working you might be working
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:13.240]  with these companies trying to make money i i never went there but it's almost like i get mad
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.720]  at her because some of the things she's done being a warmonger in the name of peace and pushing
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:23.400]  globalist agendas maybe she's a useful idiot but then i look at what it would take i don't think it
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:27.560]  would would be a lobbying or money issue there was no evidence of that for her to have her breasts
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:32.840]  removed i think that shows with her mother dying young at 50 something the horror a woman's going
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:37.320]  through of you're going to probably you know 90 chance or whatever get this cancer and going and
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:43.640]  doing that yeah it's it's definitely fear driven and uh and i believe it's a very personal choice
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:51.480]  you know per situation per woman to make that decision um but yeah the fear when you've got
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:56.760]  multiple you know people in your family that have been diagnosed it's uh it's pretty scary because
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:02.680]  you sometimes you can live day to day just you know dreading some people decide to get more
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:08.360]  proactive about getting their you know tests like their mammography and things like that
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:12.920]  and then some people just say well that's been linked to causing it too yeah well some people
[02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:15.800]  just say hey i don't want to deal with this i don't want to deal with the fear and this will
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:21.400]  reduce my you know my chances by a significant amount you said that they fear-mongered you know
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:26.120]  in that video that they make you watch where you get the test knowing what you know now would your
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:32.040]  decisions have been any different than now probably not i'm pretty confident in the decisions that i
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:41.000]  made i'll tell you it's it's it's it's again my wife's mother had breast cancer and she's got it
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.680]  in her family and it really is horrifying it's like a grim reaper hanging over your head that
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:53.480]  you know uh and again it's happening to men with testicular cancer other things and everybody's
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:57.320]  just dying and getting sick i mean here's the deal i've got all the documents they're doing
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:01.160]  this on purpose let me just give you the big inside scoop and it's the it's it's it's slow
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:09.080]  genocide if the nazis mowed somebody down um people learn to resist but if it's slow and then
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.560]  they make money in the whole rockefeller medical system off sucking it out of you during the
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:19.720]  process this is how they're taking over society and uh i i'm sure you've heard about the medical
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:23.640]  experiments the secret stuff the government's done you know i mean there's some well-known stuff i
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:30.200]  talk about atomic soldiers foster kids getting radiated black men syphilis the skiggy but that's
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:35.320]  nothing i mean those are horrible cases but nothing compared to larger programs like they
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:41.720]  ordered 220 something chemical weapons dumps blown up in iraq and told everybody take your mask off
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:45.640]  because i knew the detectors were going to go off they couldn't control the bureaucracy of the army
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:50.600]  but they still ordered it and tell them oh it's a false alarm and then some numbers are 50 plus
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.520]  thousand troops have died from they've done autopsies it's nerve gas now why would they
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:49:00.600]  want to do that to our troops but just why yeah i mean why would they say take your mask off
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:04.440]  why would they tell them it's safe around the world trade center you know don't worry don't
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:07.560]  wear a breathing apparatus of course i wouldn't believe the government i said at the time
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:11.800]  i i said send to a local church respirators day one people like oh shut up government says we
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.160]  don't need it why would they tell the firefighters and police it was safe
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:22.200]  because there's too many of us you see they see us as roaches and i say they're the roaches
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:27.880]  they're the roaches that would act like this and do this to people and i know what they're doing
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:33.400]  and we've just got to get over the point and realize that pediatric cancer did not exist it
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:38.680]  was like they'd fly doctors all over the country to find a kid with cancer in the 50s it's everywhere
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:43.560]  now well and i think what people don't understand instead of calling people survivors i call them
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:51.880]  veterans because the stuff that we go through is like war i mean surgery radiation chemotherapy
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:58.360]  chemotherapy they poison you within one-eighth of your body weight of death you know it's like
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:03.320]  i mean the stuff that we go through it's like it's it's unbelievable that we even have you know are
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:09.480]  able to uh to live you know mentally what we go through how about we bring them to justice

[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:17.960]  says in there says let's put stuff in the water to reduce population and sterilize people
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:26.200]  you see you're not a very nice person that's what i'm saying we have to get to the next level of
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:32.600]  horror we have to admit this program of soft kill is going on and then they also just don't care
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:37.000]  other bad stuff going on they just let it happen like our government has thrown over a hundred
