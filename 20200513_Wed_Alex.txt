[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  It is Wednesday, May 13, 2020. I am your host, Alex Jones, and I got on my knees at about
[00:15.000 --> 00:20.040]  3 a.m. this morning when I woke up and just asked God to give me the guidance and the
[00:20.040 --> 00:28.080]  direction to not get angry on air and to just calmly report this information to you as
[00:28.080 --> 00:34.360]  best I can and give you the evidence. Go to infowars.com right now. You'll see the live
[00:34.360 --> 00:46.280]  show feed title, Global Bombshell. WHO confirms vaccines are having sterilants added to them
[00:46.280 --> 00:57.120]  on a planetary scale. I have an entire folder that is only the surface of this with the
[00:57.120 --> 01:11.880]  United Nations admitting they're doing it. Now think about that. Global Bombshell, WHO
[01:11.880 --> 01:18.080]  confirms sterilants added to vaccines globally, watch live. Something of this magnitude can
[01:18.080 --> 01:26.720]  only be hidden in plain view. And I'm risking my life bringing you this information, but
[01:26.720 --> 01:34.040]  none of us have a life regardless if we don't beat this. So, please, every broadcast is
[01:34.040 --> 01:40.320]  important. I'm asking you to call everyone you know and say, listen, you need to know
[01:40.320 --> 01:45.280]  what's going to be in the vaccine you need to understand. Now, understanding my thought
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.520]  processes on this is a way for you to understand your thought processes and to get out of the
[01:50.520 --> 02:03.640]  trap. What am I talking about? Last night, I was laying in bed with a tablet and I thought
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.640]  let me go see what David Knight's up to because I didn't watch the show yesterday. And I saw
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.720]  him play a video that I meant to play that I didn't get to yesterday by a group like
[02:13.720 --> 02:19.280]  Project Veritas called GoVote in the UK. That's a credible group. Kind of left us, but they
[02:19.280 --> 02:26.600]  mean well. And they're talking about interviewing a big pharma whistleblower about HCG being
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.480]  added to vaccines to sterilize women. And then folks were all on YouTube saying, oh,
[02:31.480 --> 02:36.960]  we don't know this is true. Oh, you know, they wouldn't dare do that. And then, of course,
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.960]  this morning, the YouTube video was gone at like a half million views. Well, all I did
[02:43.960 --> 02:53.880]  was type in HCG vaccines. And I was on the UN's website saying they added to vaccines
[02:53.880 --> 02:59.800]  to sterilize people. But see, no one cares when it's totally admitted. When Bill Gates
[02:59.800 --> 03:06.200]  says he wants to depopulate. But when it's someone saying I'm going to talk to a whistleblower
[03:06.200 --> 03:12.800]  soon, because it's speculation, it becomes this, this, this golden thing that everybody
[03:12.800 --> 03:23.920]  hyperventilates over. So I got up at 3am. And I sent David Knight about 10 links or so sent
[03:23.920 --> 03:29.400]  a son about a dozen more who produces a show. And David did his own research. But here's
[03:29.400 --> 03:34.960]  the thing, we've known this since the late 80s, they've been doing this. And so there's
[03:34.960 --> 03:42.680]  that frustration that I've known so much information for so long that I just get up here and I
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.320]  tell you, yeah, there's sterilants and a lot of the vaccines. People go, oh, that's just
[03:46.320 --> 03:54.320]  Alex saying that instead of going, hey, here it is. Here's the URL on the UN website. Now,
[03:54.320 --> 03:58.240]  as soon as we point this out, Google will bury it. That's why you want to use yippie
[03:58.240 --> 04:12.280]  or something else. But it takes a lot of will to read these white papers and reports. And
[04:12.280 --> 04:20.440]  then to read Bill and Linda Gates, his name all over it, funding every damn bit of it.
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.040]  And then to read how he got thrown out of India because they caught him sterilizing people
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.840]  over there. And that was even in the London Guardian five years ago. Mainstream media's
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.480]  gone down so bad, they were always bad. They were always leftist, but now they're just
[04:33.480 --> 04:39.760]  committed to pure evil. And so we're gonna lay it out here, folks. And by the way, you're
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.480]  not going to have to be in the third world to get sterilized. They're coming to sterilize
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.800]  you. And by the way, the side effects will greatly reduce your life. Bill Gates might
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.160]  as well put a gun to your head and blow your brains out. We're not going to put up with
[04:53.160 --> 04:58.600]  his assault. This means war.
[04:58.600 --> 05:02.360]  I'm always excited about info wars life products. They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You
[05:02.360 --> 05:07.200]  love them. I love them. And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[05:07.200 --> 05:13.960]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing. The
[05:13.960 --> 05:21.560]  only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[05:21.560 --> 05:27.320]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of
[05:27.320 --> 05:33.600]  thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way. I like
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.200]  to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it, so
[05:38.200 --> 05:42.880]  spray it right in your eyes. But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.440]  as well. So this is a real innovation. I don't know why others think of coming out with a
[05:47.440 --> 05:52.400]  hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out. It smells
[05:52.400 --> 06:12.000]  great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[06:12.000 --> 06:20.360]  Lidate is May 13th. The year is 2020. 173 days out from the election that's already
[06:20.360 --> 06:25.920]  been canceled. The mail-in ballots, the ballot stuffing has already begun. The deep state
[06:25.920 --> 06:31.720]  is moving against President Trump and against the people of America and the world. It is
[06:31.720 --> 06:38.400]  now admitted that Communist China working with Bella Melinda Gates and George Soros
[06:38.400 --> 06:45.320]  with Hillary and her daughter on the board are captaining the entire takeover. I'm Alex
[06:45.320 --> 06:51.320]  Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us. I've been up since 3.15 this morning doing
[06:51.320 --> 07:00.320]  research and I was simply going back and pulling up what I already knew. But it was so much
[07:00.320 --> 07:09.840]  more horrible than I had even remembered. So I've got about four hours under my belt
[07:09.840 --> 07:14.400]  reading from the UN website, reading from the London Guardian, reading from the Bella
[07:14.400 --> 07:22.200]  Melinda Gates Foundation, what I am going to present to you at the bottom of the hour
[07:22.200 --> 07:31.760]  as studiously as I can. What have I told you the UN admits they're adding sterilants to
[07:31.760 --> 07:46.760]  vaccines across the world, around the globe. And again, I've known all this for 25 years,
[07:46.760 --> 07:57.520]  26 years. But I only now actually went back and read it in the context of what they're
[07:57.520 --> 08:04.920]  coming at us with. Bill Gates walked up to you with a 357 magnum and shoved it into your
[08:04.920 --> 08:09.920]  temple and pulled the trigger and fired a projectile through your skull and blew your
[08:09.920 --> 08:16.480]  brains all over the wall. He'd go to prison for that. But if he got you through pressure
[08:16.480 --> 08:22.720]  and through intimidation and through hostage taking, through siege, to go into Stockholm
[08:22.720 --> 08:29.800]  syndrome, mass Stockholm syndrome and got you to take the shot yourself, even though
[08:29.800 --> 08:34.480]  he's now telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people. And Fauci says it might hurt
[08:34.480 --> 08:41.800]  a lot of people. Well, that, you know, is the end game. That's why I said we've got
[08:41.800 --> 08:51.720]  to really soup it up, jazz it up, ramp it up. So it works on old people and on the young.
[08:51.720 --> 08:59.160]  But when you soup them up, when you ramp them up with adjuvants, that's called an autoimmune
[08:59.160 --> 09:05.120]  response. You know, a bee stings an adjuvant. That's why if you take a vaccine and just
[09:05.120 --> 09:15.480]  so happen, they've got studies get stung by a bee the same day, you usually die. Bee stings
[09:15.480 --> 09:22.520]  an adjuvant. Why do you think there's suddenly all over the news saying this vaccine's going
[09:22.520 --> 09:25.840]  to hurt you real bad? But see if you want to get your job back or travel, you got to
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.240]  take it because they're not going to be able to hide the fact that a lot of folks are going
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.240]  to die. A lot of folks are going to get paralyzed. There are two people in this building who
[09:36.240 --> 09:44.400]  lost their children to vaccines and they admitted the vaccines killed them. So they're not going
[09:44.400 --> 09:51.000]  to give you some weak soft kill this time. You're going to get hurt real bad. And they're
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.800]  going to say, well, it's for the global good. Because they can't hide it anymore, ladies
[09:57.800 --> 10:03.600]  and gentlemen. That's why Gates came out and said, yeah, vaccines really don't work for
[10:03.600 --> 10:12.720]  the flu. He said, because there's not enough adjuvant in it. No. You have to guess the
[10:12.720 --> 10:18.280]  exact flu mutation for it to work. And it's never worked because the flu mutates thousands
[10:18.280 --> 10:26.020]  of times a year. Same thing with the coronavirus. So how could he patent it? Release a biological
[10:26.020 --> 10:34.400]  weapon version that is a souped up cold. But not much. It's like a 350 horsepower car.
[10:34.400 --> 10:41.880]  You put a supercharger on it, pushes up to 450. It's not like a Dodge Red Eye Hellcat
[10:41.880 --> 10:52.880]  with 800 plus horsepower. But it's a it's a souped up baby. So some are out there saying,
[10:52.880 --> 10:59.760]  oh, it doesn't exist as total hoax. No, it's they own it. They made it Fauci and Gates
[10:59.760 --> 11:08.680]  and the chai comms made it. And by the way, it's in the news today. The usual suspects.
[11:08.680 --> 11:16.040]  The damn Clinton Foundation is involved. Of course they are. Contact tracing group funded
[11:16.040 --> 11:20.280]  by Soros and Gates has Chelsea Clinton on the board. Gee, why'd you think Bill Clinton
[11:20.280 --> 11:24.160]  came out and his foundation two weeks ago and announced we need millions of people with
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.800]  federal funding to go around and make sure you've been contact traced? Oh, and it gets
[11:29.800 --> 11:40.040]  better. Turns out Apple and Roids as they announced two weeks ago have unified when it
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.320]  comes to tracking and have put the app to contact trace on your phone, whether you like
[11:45.320 --> 11:56.760]  it or not. And when you turn it off, they turn it back on. And guess who runs it? Oh,
[11:56.760 --> 12:03.080]  I forgot the World Health Organization and it's administered by the Bill and the Gates
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.880]  Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. And of course media matters and all the other
[12:07.880 --> 12:15.480]  criminal organizations will now have access to your phone in live time, just like Microsoft
[12:15.480 --> 12:21.320]  with the neocons set up news guard and election guard, where private corporations and intelligence
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.480]  agencies are in your phone, live time and your election. This is a total technocracy takeover.
[12:28.040 --> 12:37.240]  This is a military takeover of our military of the cloud of the satellites of all the phones
[12:37.240 --> 12:45.720]  of all the devices of everything. And the technocrats are all one group. Apple, Google,
[12:45.720 --> 12:51.880]  Facebook, Twitter, they're all one unified criminal syndicate. And if anybody wants to
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.040]  save America, not that our government's perfect, but this is the time for government to get involved
[12:56.040 --> 13:02.040]  because the major corporations are the global government. They're not libertarian. They're
[13:02.040 --> 13:08.920]  not free market. They're vertical integrators and their operating system and in game goal
[13:08.920 --> 13:15.400]  is depopulation. And when you get around rich people, really rich ones, the types that don't
[13:15.400 --> 13:23.560]  show it off, they'll always start signaling to you. And they're usually quote liberals that
[13:23.560 --> 13:29.320]  they don't like brown people. And when you explain to them that you're a Christian and
[13:29.960 --> 13:33.960]  you might not like it that brown people been turned into an enemy against you by the left,
[13:33.960 --> 13:39.240]  you don't want to kill them. And you'd like to be their brother. And then they hate your
[13:39.240 --> 13:48.120]  guts from that point on. And Bill Gates wants to exterminate almost everyone. Okay. So they
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.480]  learned with Hitler that people fight tanks, but they don't fight dudes in pink sweaters.
[13:55.240 --> 14:02.040]  Now, India threw his ass out. And so did Pakistan. They figured out what was going on. And look,
[14:02.040 --> 14:08.440]  I get it. There are a lot of folks in India, man. But do you really want to sign on to sterilizing
[14:08.440 --> 14:13.800]  them? And you know, Bill Gates has his angle. He has, you can see it from his perspective until
[14:13.800 --> 14:20.680]  you realize that they're after everybody. High IQ, low IQ, they're poisoning everyone. And they
[14:20.680 --> 14:26.840]  believe in a post human era, merging with machines and they're crazy. And I've been really researching
[14:26.840 --> 14:32.600]  Bill Gates for years, but I've been researching him in more depth and he is completely insane.
[14:32.600 --> 14:39.960]  And that's why he is the science officer on the committee. And there is a global committee.
[14:42.680 --> 14:49.240]  It has rotating members, just like a Politburo. And there are 12 of them.
[14:51.400 --> 14:57.800]  And I know who at least eight of them are. And this information is the most secret information
[14:57.800 --> 15:04.280]  on the planet. And so I commit myself into God's hands, bringing this information out. And I'm
[15:04.280 --> 15:10.760]  not being dramatic, ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows that. But you need to understand that this
[15:10.760 --> 15:18.200]  is not theories. This is not games. This is dead on dead on what's going on. Remember what I told
[15:18.200 --> 15:23.400]  you the last three months? And for years before that, but intensely every day for three months,
[15:23.400 --> 15:29.640]  four months, I've told you since late January that they release a small bio simulant that does
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.320]  kill people a few million globally. Then once they practice the lockdown, then they'll hit you with
[15:35.320 --> 15:40.440]  something that kills hundreds of millions next. They'll claim terrorists did it. And then big bio
[15:40.440 --> 15:45.640]  weapon attack comes after that. If we buy into it and submit, they'll do it the next year. If we
[15:45.640 --> 15:51.400]  resist five years, but most of you will be dead within five years if we don't turn this around.
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.600]  You understand? Now the clock is ticking. Get ready. They're coming for you and your family.
[15:56.600 --> 16:01.720]  Vitamin mineral fusion is one of our best selling products. It wasn't always that way.
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.760]  We hardly ever promoted it. We first launched it a few years ago, but people slowly began to try it
[16:06.760 --> 16:11.880]  and almost everyone that orders it reorders it. That's why we're offering it right now
[16:11.880 --> 16:18.920]  at m4slife.com at 50% off even though we're about to sell out because I want people who've been on
[16:18.920 --> 16:23.160]  the fence, who've heard us talk about it, who've read some of the reviews to experience it for
[16:23.160 --> 16:27.480]  yourself. And this is important. It's not just all the key vitamins and minerals you need. It's
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.920]  also got amino acids that are known to help you absorb more of this into your body. And that's
[16:32.920 --> 16:38.760]  really important for folks that are older because a lot of people don't absorb vitamins and minerals
[16:38.760 --> 16:45.160]  in pill form or caplet form, but they get a higher absorption rate when it's liquid. So this powdered
[16:45.160 --> 16:50.520]  formula goes great into water, into other juices. It's good for adults. It's good for children.
[16:50.520 --> 16:55.560]  Take advantage of this super sale that's about to end at m4slife.com today with Vitamin Mineral
[16:55.560 --> 17:04.120]  Fusion. We are 170 days out from the 2020 election. It is a referendum of national sovereignty against
[17:04.120 --> 17:09.480]  localism. And Obama, Hillary, and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow
[17:09.480 --> 17:15.160]  President Trump's election, and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.640]  Now they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression,
[17:19.640 --> 17:24.840]  while China's already been open for business for more than a month. This is an ongoing globalist
[17:24.840 --> 17:30.040]  attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy, and hope that we won't recognize that it
[17:30.040 --> 17:35.480]  is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump. They know their
[17:35.480 --> 17:40.920]  crimes are coming out. They know the chickens are coming home to roost. So now they're panicking and
[17:40.920 --> 17:46.520]  trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from
[17:46.520 --> 17:54.040]  COVID-19. The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hopes and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[17:54.040 --> 18:18.600]  So get out there and expose this fraud. Welcome back. I'm your host, Alex Jones. This is an
[18:18.600 --> 18:23.240]  emergency transmission coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[18:23.240 --> 18:30.200]  Now you remember back in November and December, I commissioned one of the crew here, one of the
[18:30.200 --> 18:36.920]  graphic artists, to create an image of an astronaut standing in a national park with
[18:36.920 --> 18:43.560]  forests around him. And I explained that if you look at the image we had made that there's all
[18:43.560 --> 18:49.960]  this, what looks like pollen in the air. And I said the archetypal image that I see in 2020
[18:49.960 --> 19:00.840]  is a future where humans can't live in their own environment where the earth is made to be so toxic
[19:00.840 --> 19:07.480]  to us that we have to go into bubbles or into spacesuits. That's the enemy's plan. Now you can
[19:07.480 --> 19:14.840]  call that psychic but it's beyond that. It's an imprint of all the millions of data points you get
[19:14.840 --> 19:22.360]  and then being able to integrate that together to understand the signals you're getting.
[19:23.720 --> 19:26.680]  And that's one of the versions they made with the space shuttle. There's another version that
[19:26.680 --> 19:32.280]  has all the toxins, all the biological systems in the air that have been released on the earth
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.000]  to make it impossible for humans to live on the planet so that we then have to go into the globalist
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.760]  corporate system and into these artificial bubbles, the bubble cities, the bubble suits,
[19:42.760 --> 19:48.760]  and now it's all over the news. Oh, cool rocking spacesuits that you're going to wear to go out
[19:48.760 --> 19:54.680]  to clubs now. And it's the idea that humans are bad, humans are evil. You can't trust anyone,
[19:54.680 --> 19:59.480]  any virus, any bacteria is bad. Even though if you don't have viruses, bacteria, you get sick and die.
[19:59.480 --> 20:04.680]  That's known germ theory that's been proven. But let's look at this article. If we can pull up
[20:04.680 --> 20:15.560]  the info wars.com article. That's from 1962. Life in 2022. Image depicted everyone trapped
[20:15.560 --> 20:24.680]  in pods. So no one gets sick. Now, if you look into Isaac Asimov and all those guys,
[20:24.680 --> 20:27.480]  they were actually programming the public for what was coming in the future.
[20:28.440 --> 20:32.920]  Arthur C. Clark and others admitted that and Arthur C. Clark basically said childhoods end
[20:32.920 --> 20:36.120]  is an allegory for what he believes human evolution will be like.
[20:39.480 --> 20:47.960]  Well, in 1977, DARPA created a classified report saying the end war under the Carnegie
[20:47.960 --> 20:52.920]  and Ford and Rockefeller endowment, the only way to end war would be to take humans out of their
[20:52.920 --> 20:59.880]  environment completely and basically make sexless humans that were manufactured in factories or
[20:59.880 --> 21:06.840]  get rid of humans altogether or put people in pods with virtual reality jacked into their brain
[21:07.880 --> 21:12.920]  for the rest of their life and having a simulation run by a AI computer
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.920]  so that it could control the environment and end war that way. You may have heard of that.
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.800]  They then made a movie out of it called The Matrix. And again, Philip K. Dick before he died
[21:23.800 --> 21:31.320]  had had some of his books stolen and he was in the San Francisco area at the time in the 60s
[21:31.320 --> 21:37.160]  and 70s hanging out with people that were involved in these DARPA projects. Some of the same people
[21:37.160 --> 21:41.080]  worked in some projects that later I learned about when I was a child because some of them visited
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.200]  the house and were openly talking about some of it in front of me. So again, this is a real
[21:46.200 --> 21:51.960]  science cult, okay, in San Francisco, one of the most powerful groups on the planet. And they've
[21:51.960 --> 21:56.920]  come up with this whole thing. So now, officially in China, they have plastic bubbles. In fact,
[21:56.920 --> 22:02.280]  I sent that to one of the producers to Daria. It's in your tweet. It actually sent it to you last
[22:02.280 --> 22:12.360]  night about 3am. It shows that the Chinese children now in bubbles. And so you're being shown this
[22:12.360 --> 22:18.280]  that humans are so bad. Humans aren't just bad for the earth. Humans are so toxic and so diseased
[22:18.280 --> 22:26.360]  that we can't even touch each other. Well, prisoners in a medium security prison can shake
[22:26.360 --> 22:30.600]  hands or lift weights together or pat each other on the back or pray together at chapel.
[22:31.960 --> 22:37.080]  But now you're living like someone that lives in a supermax. Yeah, there it is in China. They're
[22:37.080 --> 22:43.880]  proposing these, these pods, but there's actual photos of the kids now in the schools
[22:43.880 --> 22:49.960]  and they put plastic bubbles up around the children. We're live now. We'll add it in post
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.640]  to the rebroadcast, but
[22:55.560 --> 22:59.880]  they're teaching you that you're alien. They're teaching you that you're bad. They're teaching
[22:59.880 --> 23:04.200]  you that you can't exist. And they're teaching you that you're obsolete, that you're what,
[23:04.200 --> 23:11.960]  what's the word for it? That you are non essential. And you're scared. Everyone's wearing the mask
[23:11.960 --> 23:16.840]  and no one can go to a job. And oh, sorry, it's only 15 days to bend the curve, make sure the
[23:16.840 --> 23:20.680]  hospitals aren't overwhelmed. And now it's, oh, it's two months, three months, six months,
[23:20.680 --> 23:23.800]  and Fauci now says, sorry, there's not going to be school next year either.
[23:25.880 --> 23:31.560]  And then the cowards or the uninformed, they lead us now. The sheep that run off the cliff
[23:31.560 --> 23:35.080]  are our leaders like, yeah, you're not open in that school. My kid's not going to your,
[23:35.080 --> 23:39.480]  but we're not going, you're not open to that mall. I'm going to sue you. Oh, and the meat packers,
[23:39.480 --> 23:44.280]  no one's died in a meat packing plant. Thousands and thousands tested, you know, 300 at one plant,
[23:44.280 --> 23:50.440]  all have COVID. None of them got sick because it's a fake test, folks. That's why they're like
[23:50.440 --> 23:54.920]  testing, testing, testing to show we have the most cases. And all it is is really old people dying.
[23:55.640 --> 24:02.520]  95% of the people dying are above the age of 75. All the others are have serious cancer,
[24:02.520 --> 24:09.480]  heart failure, deformities. I mean, they're, they're in wheelchairs, they're quadriplegics. And then
[24:09.480 --> 24:13.560]  they just say COVID when they die, because they get a big fat, juicy check. And look, I know
[24:14.120 --> 24:19.640]  all of you already know that. But if we don't get the word out and expose it, they got all the
[24:19.640 --> 24:24.120]  censorship in place before they did this. They were going to do this when Hillary got in. You
[24:24.120 --> 24:28.680]  think Hillary's global initiative with Chelsea on the board of this just cooked up contact tracing
[24:28.680 --> 24:35.160]  and all this money and the force inoculations in the last three months, all this was preplanned,
[24:35.160 --> 24:40.600]  all this was pre-prepared. And I'll cover it next segment. And now Apple and Google,
[24:41.560 --> 24:49.000]  that have over 90% of the phones in the West all decided two weeks ago, oh, we have an agreement
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.680]  now that we're going to have in our operating systems, a joint system with each other to track
[24:52.680 --> 24:57.720]  everywhere you go, whether you like it or not. And we're giving it to law enforcement and the WHO,
[24:57.720 --> 25:03.880]  that's in the news today, the WHO. And guess who runs it? Guess who's going to run it? The global
[25:03.880 --> 25:12.760]  initiative, Bill Clinton's in your phone. And Mr. Redd is daughter, Webster Hubble's daughter.
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.520]  Look at this contact tracing group funded by Soros and Gates has Chelsea Clinton on board,
[25:18.520 --> 25:24.520]  NationalFileinandForwards.com. But Muslims for progress say they love it and want virtual systems.
[25:24.520 --> 25:28.920]  Oh, busted contract pricing data, sent to the WHO and law enforcement,
[25:29.560 --> 25:36.440]  used to quarantine people, come and grab them. And China says, oh, there were five cases in Wuhan.
[25:37.800 --> 25:46.280]  Oh, you'd not leave your house now. So now we are all we care about either China say second
[25:46.280 --> 25:51.480]  wave calm. They're all open for business, but we can't. Sweden's communist now. So they stay open.
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.760]  They don't because once they've conquered you, it's okay. Yeah, there's some of them. There it is.
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.320]  They're the kids in the bubbles in China. I'm going to go to break and I'm just going to tell you
[26:01.320 --> 26:07.640]  this right now. I tried to hold this back. And I thought that we could get people in the government
[26:07.640 --> 26:11.880]  to actually look into this and not want to go down this road. But the public is so cowardly and so
[26:11.880 --> 26:18.440]  into being slaves, that it's avalanche into mass hysteria. And thank God, Trump now understands
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.640]  this and it's bucking it. But if you don't have storeable foods and if you don't have a bug out
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.200]  point with your family, I don't care if it's five acres of middle of nowhere, you're insane because
[26:31.400 --> 26:37.320]  the new world order is here. And if you're in a city, you're crazy. That's all I'm saying.
[26:37.960 --> 26:42.360]  We have storeable food ready to ship out to you at info or store.com almost no one else does or
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.760]  they're lying to you or it's crap. We have high quality food at info or store.com and it funds
[26:46.760 --> 26:51.240]  our operation. The last 25 years, it's something you need on that checklist. Don't wait any more,
[26:51.240 --> 26:54.200]  get it today and we have huge sales that in this weekend running right now.
[26:55.560 --> 27:01.160]  The United States is not communist China. We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[27:01.160 --> 27:06.840]  We don't blow up churches. We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs. But all over
[27:06.840 --> 27:14.360]  the news, we see the UN billable indicates WHO mainstream corporate media raising communist China
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.320]  for their response. And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their
[27:19.320 --> 27:24.120]  houses and has robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that. And on top of it,
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.920]  cities like San Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say Chinese virus. Well,
[27:28.920 --> 27:34.440]  now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus. These people are out of control control
[27:34.440 --> 27:39.320]  freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal
[27:39.320 --> 27:44.920]  activities and are exposing them in their power grab. The resistance lives at band.video and
[27:44.920 --> 27:50.360]  info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able
[27:50.360 --> 27:57.560]  to defeat their operation that much quicker. What info wars has been able to do thanks to your
[27:57.560 --> 28:03.880]  support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[28:03.880 --> 28:11.480]  This is the battle for the future of humanity. And now open world government is being established
[28:12.120 --> 28:19.000]  with an end game to depopulate the planet. Now the internal operations of the globalist
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.760]  are being externalized. You must decide which side you're on. Living in denial,
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.720]  having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery,
[28:29.720 --> 28:35.160]  destruction and finally death. And this is a spiritual death. We're talking about
[28:35.160 --> 28:42.360]  not just a physical death. The delusions must end now. Info wars was correct about it all.
[28:42.360 --> 28:46.760]  And we have come so far by exposing the enemy. Most people that are aware of the new order
[28:46.760 --> 29:00.360]  decided to join it out of fear. They are truly fools. We must fight this or lose our souls.
[29:16.760 --> 29:22.840]  I want you to get DNA force plus. I want you to experience x2. I want you to get real red pill
[29:22.840 --> 29:30.200]  and real red pill plus. They're all in stock right now and they're 30 to 60% off. More than 20

[29:57.880 --> 30:00.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:00.600 --> 30:17.160]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. You're listening to us on local AM and FM stations.
[30:17.160 --> 30:21.320]  Please thank them. Please spread the word about those stations and please become a sponsor or
[30:21.320 --> 30:26.520]  support their sponsors now more than ever. So many stations pick us up at night. They get good
[30:26.520 --> 30:30.920]  ratings. People support the show. They call and they thank the station. They get a couple sponsors.
[30:30.920 --> 30:35.480]  They put us on weekdays. We get top ratings for them and we change the country in the world
[30:35.480 --> 30:41.080]  and defeat the globalist and something's happening. A lot of new radio and TV stations are picking up
[30:41.080 --> 30:46.040]  the show because I get people used to tuning in and say this guy's completely off his rocker.
[30:47.080 --> 30:51.000]  They're planning a world government and forced inoculations and they're going to have pedophiles
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.600]  come to the schools and the kids will be made to sit in their lap even though they're crying.
[30:54.600 --> 30:57.880]  Now that's 2020.
[31:01.000 --> 31:05.000]  Those of us that aren't in the evil don't understand it because we're not evil.
[31:06.600 --> 31:11.560]  We're centers. We're falling but we're not pointed towards evil. We don't like it. We don't
[31:11.560 --> 31:17.960]  worship it. We don't enjoy it. Well if you're not like the globalist you've got a blind spot
[31:17.960 --> 31:24.520]  and I'm here to tell you folks when I discovered all this stuff hiding in plain view I couldn't
[31:24.520 --> 31:31.240]  believe it and I just say thank god my parents were into history and had a lot of history books
[31:31.240 --> 31:36.760]  laying around because like I told you I like comic books and science fiction and sports stuff when I
[31:36.760 --> 31:45.000]  was a kid until I started reading history books when I was about eight and I got addicted because
[31:45.000 --> 31:54.520]  this was real this stuff really went on and it was way cooler than the stuff in science fiction and
[31:54.520 --> 31:58.760]  then I realized that my ancestors had been part of it my grandfathers have been part of it
[32:00.840 --> 32:06.600]  and then it got even cooler and then I realized I was part of it and I wasn't just some passive
[32:06.600 --> 32:13.320]  thing I was living in a real world that had real consequences. All right you know I said I'd get
[32:13.320 --> 32:15.640]  into this news this segment and I'm not doing this to build it up
[32:19.800 --> 32:25.560]  but it's so momentous that I have to get my brain completely focused to be able to do this
[32:26.120 --> 32:29.720]  and during the break I was doing some work at taking care of some things and I got distracted
[32:29.720 --> 32:34.440]  not nobody's bad coming in here I told him to but I was I was busy doing some work so I'm gonna
[32:34.440 --> 32:44.280]  have to do it next segment get back in the zone but here's what I'm trying to get at for folks you
[32:44.280 --> 32:51.000]  can't pretend like you're part of the power structure you're not and even Bill Gates and Lord
[32:51.000 --> 33:00.280]  Rothschild and these individuals are not in charge they are slaves and that's a whole
[33:00.280 --> 33:08.760]  another subject how tortured they are how nightmarish their lives are I spent about an hour yesterday
[33:11.480 --> 33:17.560]  watching Bill Gates videos and videos where he doesn't want to be there
[33:19.160 --> 33:24.920]  and where it's not scripted and I had some of the guys go around and dig around for raw footage
[33:24.920 --> 33:30.520]  of him and man it's exactly what I knew I'd find he looks like he is totally depressed
[33:31.080 --> 33:33.880]  and absolutely being tortured in these videos
[33:36.920 --> 33:44.040]  and he is just disgusted with everybody he hates everybody and he is completely nasty and he is
[33:44.040 --> 33:55.480]  driven he is a haunted tortured possessed man
[34:01.400 --> 34:05.480]  it's avatar folks the the the bad guys are jacking in
[34:05.480 --> 34:16.200]  and everybody knows that deep down and when billy boy is not doing bad stuff
[34:21.800 --> 34:22.680]  he's not alive
[34:25.800 --> 34:32.200]  these things only live to kill what does the bible say kill steal and destroy
[34:32.200 --> 34:39.560]  and they build the world to be as nasty and ugly and horrible and stupid and they create a giant
[34:39.560 --> 34:47.720]  population to get the rest of the population who's enlightened and who is good to sign on to
[34:47.720 --> 34:55.000]  exterminating the dumb down third world for survival and that's how they trick us into making the
[34:55.000 --> 35:02.600]  deal with evil so I know why bill gates does what he does I understand how he was indoctrinated
[35:02.600 --> 35:05.400]  how he was brought into the scientific dictatorship at a young age
[35:07.640 --> 35:11.640]  and
[35:12.840 --> 35:15.880]  I just want everybody to know who serves satan that
[35:18.120 --> 35:21.720]  most of you are low level and so you think it's fun you think you're part of the winning team
[35:21.720 --> 35:30.760]  you're part of the losing team and for those of you that still have it forfeited your chance
[35:30.760 --> 35:37.000]  you need to turn back now you need to ask the holy spirit to come into you I pass the fake
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.120]  churches all that's designed to make you turn away from god and you need to really ask for the
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.560]  cavalry to come because it's the only hope you have for eternity you do not want to join the
[35:47.560 --> 35:53.240]  satan it's madness all right um
[35:57.240 --> 36:00.760]  like I said I am particularly prepared for today's show and
[36:05.400 --> 36:09.160]  I'm the one telling David Knight not to kill himself but doing five six hours of preparation
[36:09.160 --> 36:11.320]  every day for his show and I've done that much myself today
[36:11.320 --> 36:21.480]  and man it's all just totally come together it's exactly how we analyzed it but not a surprise
[36:21.480 --> 36:27.560]  we're following their operation but they are really planning to execute this thing to the hilt so
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.360]  I had really hoped they'd back down I'd really hope that it was all just a bunch of crazy
[36:34.360 --> 36:39.640]  eugenicists trying to one up each other but they're gonna they're gonna carry this out so
[36:39.640 --> 36:44.920]  um you better start getting ready to decide what you're gonna do folks and it's gonna get really
[36:44.920 --> 36:50.040]  bad they're gonna carry out false flags and blame it on us and it's gonna be nasty but
[36:51.400 --> 36:57.000]  just thank god and your lucky stars that you for whatever reason are awake and aware and have
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.400]  a relationship with god the living god because these guys worship the god of death
[37:01.400 --> 37:08.680]  I mean I'm really ashamed of myself
[37:13.480 --> 37:19.320]  when I saw Bill Clinton come out for armies of contact tracers and all the police state things
[37:19.320 --> 37:23.880]  that means and grabbing children out of mother's arms why didn't I go look it up
[37:26.280 --> 37:29.720]  and find out they're running the whole damn thing and making money off of it and getting
[37:29.720 --> 37:33.800]  taxpayer money well sure enough here it is
[37:38.120 --> 37:45.080]  it's always worse than we even thought it's just so naked it's so out in the open it's so ridiculous
[37:45.720 --> 37:49.240]  but that's how evil works it's like all the denial is over
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.040]  and add the little cherry on top facebook run by the same group the gates runs
[37:56.040 --> 38:01.560]  and deletes michigan anti-lockdown group with 380,000 members
[38:03.720 --> 38:08.840]  they're telling americans you can't organize and say you believe you're essential and that your
[38:08.840 --> 38:14.040]  business is essential only walmart and target are you know i will never shop at walmart or
[38:14.040 --> 38:18.760]  target again i still don't do it very often sometimes it's convenient i will never this is war
[38:18.760 --> 38:25.080]  folks you have to 100 cut yourself off from all these people and all these groups and and these
[38:25.080 --> 38:29.640]  big globalist corporations that are anti god anti-family they're waging war against us we
[38:29.640 --> 38:33.800]  have to totally cut them off they're they're trying to cut you off and bankrupt you

[41:23.160 --> 41:27.320]  not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the council in front of relations

[41:33.720 --> 41:41.080]  build a planet and beyond based on humans or humans by humans not a world where the establishment
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.640]  hate themselves project their hate onto us and decide we're gonna have a post human world

[41:51.560 --> 41:59.320]  and pro god feudalism in the ancient world from asia to europe from africa to latin america was
[41:59.320 --> 42:05.240]  the most common form of government you had a ruling class the nobility of the king and queen sitting
[42:05.240 --> 42:12.840]  on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control in fact
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.800]  in most cultures they call the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more
[42:17.800 --> 42:24.520]  shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving level they were so
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.480]  busy trying to survive they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite well now all the
[42:29.480 --> 42:34.600]  big google owners and the rockefellers and the Rothschilds the jeff bezos is the world they're
[42:34.600 --> 42:41.000]  sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  laughing at you shut down going bankrupt in the third world starving to death their religion
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.080]  is power and control and they are pressing that advantage against us we must break free from these

[44:30.040 --> 44:32.680]  entire destiny of humanity hangs in the balance
[44:32.680 --> 44:45.320]  i fell down the route at all more than 30 years ago i know many of you are just now waking up
[44:45.320 --> 44:53.640]  many of you were awake before i was born but now we're gonna have to choose which direction we go
[44:54.520 --> 44:56.440]  because we have reached the fork in the road
[44:56.440 --> 45:04.040]  now i'm just going to show you right now
[45:06.520 --> 45:11.640]  18 documents i'm just going to read the headlines and tell you where they came from
[45:14.440 --> 45:23.080]  and then i'm going to explain to you that this is one one thousandth is my estimation
[45:23.080 --> 45:30.120]  of what is publicly available now remember chuck todd came out and said bill bar the ag
[45:30.120 --> 45:35.160]  said he doesn't care about rule of law in an interview then they played an edited tape with
[45:35.160 --> 45:46.920]  junk cuts in the actual tape in the same sentence he said i believe in the rule of law
[45:46.920 --> 45:55.000]  so remember the criminal nature of the people we're talking about because all of this is public
[45:55.000 --> 46:02.360]  at an academic level just like the plan to feminize boys with chemicals that i told you
[46:02.360 --> 46:08.040]  about 20 years ago and now you see it's going operational so when they deny all this remember
[46:08.040 --> 46:14.360]  that's just a tactic to bypass them getting put in handcuffs in computers they call it a slow
[46:14.360 --> 46:20.520]  laurus attack where they don't even try to hack your machine they put their hand out
[46:21.160 --> 46:24.680]  their machine puts its hand out and then you keep trying to shake it they go
[46:24.680 --> 46:29.000]  and comb their hair and then you do it like an idiot over and over again and it uses up the
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.800]  resources of the computer they make your computer interface with them it's a very simple attack
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.240]  but it's also a very very successful attack well that's what they do we're like hey you say you
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.400]  want to sterilize people and bring in the world government no we don't hey well here's where you
[46:43.400 --> 46:54.040]  say it right here not even say that they gaslight you so understand this is literally one one thousandth
[46:54.040 --> 47:03.160]  of what because i looked it up there were tens of thousands of hits with vaccine birth control
[47:03.160 --> 47:10.280]  vaccine sterile and it was exactly what the project veritas style group in the uk said
[47:10.280 --> 47:16.360]  oh we're going to interview a guy at a big pharma company that says they're adding hcg to the vaccine
[47:16.360 --> 47:21.720]  to sterilize people in the current one and that group's like we don't know if it's true but this
[47:21.720 --> 47:28.760]  guy does work there high level well it's a big sensation oh my god an unnamed person says it
[47:28.760 --> 47:44.440]  you can type in hcg vaccine and you will get 1985 test with Fauci of course NIH Fauci
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.800]  adding that hormone so that a woman thinks she's pregnant all the time it's a pregnancy
[47:53.800 --> 48:03.240]  hormone and so you can never get pregnant because your body attacks with antibodies hcg well where
[48:03.240 --> 48:14.120]  do you think hcg gets released from it gets released and commanded from the brain and the ovaries
[48:15.160 --> 48:21.960]  the brain and the testicles and so it attacks your body and that's in the literature so they
[48:21.960 --> 48:25.080]  don't just sterilize you they give you a debilitating disease
[48:27.960 --> 48:28.680]  isn't that nice
[48:32.040 --> 48:39.960]  so imagine if if you got caught putting poison in your neighbor's milk you go to prison for 20 years
[48:41.720 --> 48:45.400]  if they didn't even die just if you got caught doing it they died maybe maybe alive in prison
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.520]  because it's premeditated we don't like premeditated evil one thing you get to fight with your
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.120]  you know a guy's cheating on your wife with your wife and you get the fist fight and you
[48:54.120 --> 48:57.880]  know you knock him down he hits his head he dies you might serve two years because you were pissed
[48:57.880 --> 49:04.360]  and you had a reason to do it and you didn't mean to kill him but if you go over and you put
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.680]  antifreeze in your neighbor's lemonade that happens you know that's one of the ways women
[49:08.680 --> 49:12.920]  like to kill folks you're gonna you're gonna get the death penalty jack because we don't like people
[49:12.920 --> 49:18.920]  that creep around doing that's how cowards do it is they they jack it into things but see antifreeze
[49:18.920 --> 49:23.480]  will make your kidney shut down in a couple days couple don't no no no we do it with a vaccine where
[49:23.480 --> 49:29.720]  it kills you in a decade or so and there's all these new diseases and nobody knows why and it's
[49:29.720 --> 49:39.720]  all right here so the clock is ticking on mr. jones so i just want listeners understand that i've
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.040]  made the decision to go whole hog against these people but i'm begging you for my sake your
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.760]  sake our children say do whatever you have to get this out okay so let's start getting into it
[49:48.760 --> 49:56.440]  let me just show you headlines over at headshot please this is from the nih.gov birth control
[49:56.440 --> 50:05.240]  vaccine is on the horizon for family planning this is from many years ago it's here now
[50:07.560 --> 50:14.520]  anti fertility vaccines how they work cell.com trends in immunology
[50:14.520 --> 50:20.040]  unwanted sterilization eugenics programs the united states pbs

[50:28.360 --> 50:33.800]  india mass sterilization women forcing the camps say relatives one and guardian you know who funds
[50:33.800 --> 50:42.760]  the camps oh you may have heard him he likes to wear pink sweaters india cuts some funding ties
[50:42.760 --> 50:50.440]  with the gates foundation Reuters that was years ago because they caught him doing what they do
[50:50.440 --> 50:58.680]  that sterilizing fertility regulating and immunotherapeutic vaccines reaching human trials

[52:11.480 --> 52:16.440]  because i'm in the human race so i don't want you sterilized but your raza they didn't tell you
[52:16.440 --> 52:21.400]  because they're communists and they're killing your ass they you'll never hear raza tell you

[53:07.000 --> 53:11.240]  but they went oh but the government when they tested and found it we weren't doing it we were
[53:11.240 --> 53:17.240]  doing it the un website says in kenya and then they noticed that the women didn't just get sterilized
[53:17.240 --> 53:29.880]  they got real sick because the body starts attacking their ovaries and they went it snubs
[53:29.880 --> 53:36.840]  they went africa doesn't have good labs oh the black people don't know how to test for it even
[53:36.840 --> 53:41.720]  though they're the ones that called it out not people in america but the black people figured
[53:41.720 --> 53:50.680]  it out oh but they're so stupid right how sick is that at least the africans know what's going on
[53:50.680 --> 53:55.880]  well all you elitist whites wander around like idiots going along with this and and kind of

[54:27.080 --> 54:32.200]  coveted 19 tests are fake but again he's a black guy the liberals say like oh you know oh can't

[55:06.280 --> 55:11.960]  never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[55:12.680 --> 55:17.320]  just like the history book show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[55:17.320 --> 55:23.080]  and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their people
[55:23.080 --> 55:29.000]  sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.600]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage

[57:13.720 --> 57:16.680]  i'm gonna talk about something important here and then i'm gonna get back into what i was covering
[57:17.320 --> 57:21.560]  and actually lay out what what's happening and why they're doing it and the fact that unless you
[57:21.560 --> 57:30.520]  actually address these people head on they don't respect you and now is as good a time as any to
[57:30.520 --> 57:37.560]  have a message to donald trump and a message to bill gates and and i respect bill gates and i respect
[57:37.560 --> 57:42.840]  president trump because they're both very intense focused uh dedicated individuals
[57:45.160 --> 57:51.000]  and so i don't want to say i kind of choke when trying to address them it's not that it's that i
[57:51.000 --> 57:58.360]  know they'll watch it and you know i i need to measure my words very very carefully
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.760]  because i don't say these things to be braggadocious or act powerful i i i want them to know and i
[58:06.760 --> 58:11.720]  want i want gates to know that he's he's gonna pay
[58:11.720 --> 58:19.160]  pay and and not at my hands but nevertheless it needs to be said
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.080]  and and and the playing it is something like that's so dangerous that i'm like a moth to
[58:25.080 --> 58:29.240]  flame i get very excited when i start doing the things that the spirit wants me to do
[58:31.960 --> 58:37.320]  and so i have to control myself and i've promised to be very calm and focused today
[58:37.320 --> 58:42.520]  and i'm going to be calm and i'm going to be focused and i'm going to be a good boy
[58:44.120 --> 58:48.840]  that said let me cut a three-minute ad right now live on air that we can run or we're

[59:48.360 --> 59:51.560]  which they're threatening to do right now i can't i'm not ready to get into it right now but it's
[59:51.560 --> 59:59.240]  very serious because i know there's nothing there if i sell out that's a form of living death but i
[59:59.240 --> 1:00:09.720]  do want to be as effective as i can in this time and and so please don't shop at the big box stores
[1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:16.280]  if you can help it support info wars and get products that are really amazing while you still
[1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:22.520]  can and one thing we have a giant glut of because i love to design t-shirts and some are crappy and
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:28.680]  some are awesome i i design most of them which is the problem which is also the solution go to
[1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:33.880]  infowarstore.com and and get the limited edition shirts or and you know get the classic shirts

[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.960]  dimensional word of mouth and things you wear and things you do cyberspace is going to be totally
[1:00:43.960 --> 1:00:50.760]  ai controlled and also realize that we're running a special that's got to end absolutely by monday
[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:54.760]  or tuesday i said you know five six days left because a bunch of these products are very close
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:59.480]  to selling out and then i've got to sit there and decide which products we're going to reorder
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:03.240]  we've discontinued five or six products even though they were decent sellers just because
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:07.960]  things are so serious uh and the supply chain's broken down so bad that it's very hard to even
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:12.280]  get the ingredients for the products now so we've just discontinued five products that were good
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:19.800]  sellers i'm involved you know in the in the whole supply chain and i know how serious it is so get

[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:31.080]  still can at infowarstore.com because the enemy's moving very very fast now this is a lightning
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:35.880]  war they've been building up to this but now this is their full assault and they've been telegraphing
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:39.960]  that they're going to release a real bio weapon very soon to try to quiet their critics oh you
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:45.560]  thought covid wasn't bad how about covid 2020 and and then and then it'll actually wipe out millions
[1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:53.880]  and uh i don't just smell that coming i see it coming so get ready now i don't have to tell you
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:58.440]  that we are in the most important point in human history the globalists have taken the gloves off
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:03.720]  and they've taken the mask off and they're like yeah you're taking implantable chips yeah we're
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:10.840]  in the pedophilia yeah we're in the world government yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential we are
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:16.040]  shutting your ass down yeah we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:20.920]  in industry anymore you're going to be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:25.720]  that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:32.440]  your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:37.240]  we have to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding you were
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:42.440]  right and understanding i was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:48.360]  while you still can now is the time for action now is the time for you to shine and be the paul
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:03:04.280]  reveres you know you are
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:11.720]  folks i'm gonna tell you these next four months
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:23.640]  are going to be a veritable war like we have not seen the american left the democrat party
[1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:34.600]  is going to do its best to keep this economy shut down to extend and expand that shutdown
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:45.800]  and blow up their own country's jobs just to ensure that trump loses but here's the thing
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:56.040]  about that let's let's let's do a little hypothetical let's say this continues as it is
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  and let's say that more and more red states open up and the economy in these states
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:09.160]  starts to return and revive the blue states stay locked down these are populous places
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:18.840]  new york massachusetts california so they stay locked down offered express purpose of canceling
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:26.520]  out the increase created by the red states the economic activity that will happen to the red
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:31.720]  states going back to work the blue state governors are going to try to cancel it out by keeping their
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:39.240]  people at home they're going to wreck the economy their objective is to wreck the economy get rid
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:51.560]  of trump so let's say that well hard as it is to imagine let's say they succeed let's let's imagine
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:05:00.520]  they do this they keep the economy in such bad shape that trump is sent packing what do they
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:10.200]  expect when that's all over they expect us just to forget it they expect all these red state people
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:15.480]  oh well nice fair fight you guys great to see you we'll see you in the next election put all of it
[1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:23.880]  aside and try to all just get along again what what do they expect is going to happen with this
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:30.360]  effort of theirs to ruin the u.s economy do they think people are just going to sit by and let it
[1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:39.240]  happen and i'm telling you that they do these are the same people at past tax increases on the rich
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:45.480]  and then end up shocked that the rich find a way around it so here they're going to be engaged
[1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:52.440]  these blue state governors and the entire democrat party and by the way we predicted this year we
[1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:57.400]  predicted that it wouldn't be long before the democrats would start blaming trump
[1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:02.840]  for the rotten economy because of the way he's handled the virus
[1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:13.160]  virus the whole rush limbaugh hour is at info wars dot com you know that states
[1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:16.040]  your donors call me they go hey we like how you play rush clips sometimes but you know
[1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:21.880]  aren't you in competition with him no i'm not in competition with rush limbaugh i pray for rush
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:28.040]  limbaugh every time i see him in the news last week around the table we all joined hands my wife and
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:31.400]  rex was over visiting he's already moved out we all joined hands and prayed for rush limbaugh
[1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:36.600]  oh god we don't need to lose him you know he's had problems he didn't have all the answers nobody's
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:42.280]  perfect but he's he's a great guy he means well and he's got so many listeners 20 plus million
[1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:47.560]  a week we need him please god don't let him die it is such a bad omen that he's fighting for his
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:52.040]  life he's a tough guy but he they told him he's got late-stage lung cancer and um
[1:06:52.040 --> 1:07:00.920]  um oh makes me sick oh god you know when they're really shutting everybody down man you
[1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:06.440]  you because i always see other you know james will keep some amazing but it's kind of like wow
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:11.240]  i wish i got that big story but that was like five years ago now i'm just like oh good please
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:18.920]  fight him hard oh it is it's purity now in that things are so serious all the crap to the wayside
[1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:25.320]  i mean like i said yesterday i was never a big hollywood fan i wasn't enamored with hollywood stars
[1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:33.240]  but now i can't stand them but you think about so many people still are enslaved by this i am
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:41.000]  enamored by people that tell the truth and stand up for what's right but there's also a paradigm
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.960]  there in that people that have done incredibly good things and have all this goodness in the bank
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:50.200]  that even when they go sideways i have trouble being mad at them like matt drudge
[1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:56.200]  that drudge had incredible courage to boost info wars and get trump elected and everything else and
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:01.800]  you know i i even know what happened with drudge hell i knew two years ago before it happened i
[1:08:02.360 --> 1:08:05.400]  it would be a huge story if i told everybody what happened with drudge but i'm not gonna do it
[1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:07.240]  because of loyalty
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:21.160]  but matt drudge's fuel in the tank is going down there'll be a certain point
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:26.920]  where i won't break any confidences but where i have to do what i have to do
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:34.760]  watching jack possovic give bill gates a blowjob is hard for me to put up with
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:41.240]  it because i like jack possovic so see there's that personal thing about that like somebody you
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:43.560]  like that you admire stabs you in the back
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:49.320]  it's not hatred it's disgust
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:09:01.800]  oh god help us please god help
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:06.920]  it's so horrible it's all so horrible
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:15.160]  i told you i was gonna be nice to them i'm not gonna blow up and i'm gonna do it
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:21.880]  i'm gonna hold it together but i'll tell you my big problem
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:30.600]  is that i'm not gonna do anything violent because they've got it all set up to make
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:37.400]  themselves the victims but coming at you with a deadly vaccine they're admitting is gonna kill
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:45.240]  a bunch of people and make hundreds of thousands sick and the fact that they cooked it up in
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:51.640]  wuhan and china with wow it behaves dictates what we do that's a fate worth the death
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:10:01.080]  and so i don't want listeners to do anything offensively because the enemy has killed common
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:19.640]  sense and will turn it into a heyday but my brain cannot be turned off and my brain is saying son
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:24.520]  you claim you're this guy that does the right thing and you're not a coward
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:31.240]  people are coming to inject you on purpose to sterilize you and your family
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:38.200]  and all these media people are going along with it and and and they just keep looking for a fight
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:45.640]  they just keep they just keep asking for it man and so i just say to the the president and the
[1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:52.040]  justice department the pentagon do your goddamn job excuse my french i love god but i mean it do your
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:59.080]  job get these people off our backs man get them off my back
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:03.960]  or your weather
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:14.120]  everybody smells the death and we're going down this rat hole into hell
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:21.400]  well everybody knows you can go to the squalor in calcutta or the squalor in
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:24.840]  nigeria or wherever and look at all the starving kids and go hey we gotta fix this
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:30.200]  but that's how evil gets you oh we gotta we gotta we gotta sterilize these people but it
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:35.640]  doesn't stop there does no we gotta teach our sons how to how to take drugs and cut their
[1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:41.400]  testicles off and we gotta worship the devil and we gotta no no no they help create these problems
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:45.240]  and then they point at them and say we need to kill these people to fix this problem they're not
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:50.920]  even trying to do that they're not trying to fix the problem they like killing people
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:56.760]  they like playing god well let me tell you what happens to people that play god
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:08.040]  you know what happens right because here's the thing i don't want to play god i don't want to be
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:15.080]  god i've seen the him of god's garment was enough
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.200]  i just want to do what god says and i can tell all you people that serve satan and think you've
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:28.840]  got some utopia coming everything you do to these poor people like god said about the children
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:33.240]  we talk about poor people dumb people retarded people he said you've done to me and i'm gonna
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:39.000]  i'm gonna hurt you bad so just remember there's a god in this universe and he's gonna tear you apart
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.280]  it's not me he's gonna do it god he's gonna god is gonna give you everything you did to these children
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:50.760]  a trillion times over and there'll be no mercy so you remember that Fauci and bill gates it took
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:56.360]  hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:02.840]  every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:07.800]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:12.920]  the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:20.120]  they're not going to have medical ID cards force inoculations we are now in a giant dystopia
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:26.600]  but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:31.800]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:37.400]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:42.520]  your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already starve to death tens of
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:47.240]  millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have destroyed

[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:25.880]  so
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:42.680]  there's been a plan from the beginning and it's been done before i should open the phones up i
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:49.560]  should take your calls you know i don't know what i should do i remember when i was a kid
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:56.440]  when i was young in dallas and when a new movie came out they had spotlights up at night
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:03.400]  at a movie premiere or when a new car dealership opened or when they had a new car
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:07.800]  they'd have spotlights and you knew wow go to that
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:16.280]  and so that's what i'm trying to get at here is i just want spotlights in the air kind of like
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:22.040]  you know we're shooting the spotlight up for batman
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:38.600]  the united nations has run trials in india in peru in brazil in mexico in pakistan
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:49.720]  in nigeria a bunch of other put hundreds of countries like you can go read it on the un
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:55.640]  website oh yeah we did a test we paid the women ten dollars sometimes they paid them fifty dollars
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:16:59.640]  to get sterilized by a damn shot
[1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:09.800]  and they actually say in the articles they go oh it's much better than just cutting out their
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:17.720]  uterus or their ovaries bs you know what it does do a woman to cut their ovaries or uterus out
[1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:19.240]  it's it's not a walk in the park
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:30.200]  i've seen it in women in my family it's not fun do you know what they when they created auto
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:36.600]  immune response to your ovaries what that's like your white blood cells start eating your body
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:44.520]  that's what i mean it's like it's like when you're smart there's a thousand trillion data points
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:51.880]  that just go it's like ah this isn't but for bill gates he's like there are too many people so
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:57.160]  we put hcg in the tetanus shot and it sterilizes them
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:04.120]  waterboarding is nicer because that's just done once like where's the where's the bomb
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:09.240]  where's the enemy and that's bad enough some woman goes and goes yeah she wants ten dollars for a
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:18.120]  kid back at the hut she goes oh they get and they give her this shot and then her white blood cells
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:27.160]  start eating her body and by the way they eat everything that's got the hormone in it so they
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:34.920]  start eating the inside of the uterus endometriosis i had nightmares reading this yesterday it starts
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:41.160]  eating the ovaries imagine a horror movie where you like release a rat like creature and it
[1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:46.280]  crimes up a woman and eats her ovaries you'd be like that alien must die but as long as it's a shot
[1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:51.640]  it's like oh bill gates has got a big sweater on it's like oh yeah ladies how's it going i'm not
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:59.320]  gonna rape you i'm just gonna eat your uterus and your ovaries how's that sound people like hey you

[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:13.480]  nicer to shoot those women in the back of the head and bill's like yeah i agree with you we can't get
[1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:24.120]  away with that so you give them an agonizing life you jerks you pieces of crap i don't even have
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:33.560]  words to describe these people and like i'm up here not covering this because i'm a hero alex thank
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:42.440]  you oh you're thank me psychotics are running around doing this and it's some noble thing to
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:55.000]  fight it i'm not noble ladies and gentlemen i'm not stupid you think psychos like this if you study
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:02.120]  psychotics like this they their target's not poor starving people that have had low diets their whole
[1:20:02.120 --> 1:20:05.800]  life so their brain mass is small so you can look at them and go oh look they're dumb yeah because
[1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:17.160]  they've been starving that's not their target their target's you just like the lockdown you're
[1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:24.120]  the producer they want control of you your competition to them and if you study psychotics
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:35.880]  low functioning psychotics high functioning psychotics idiot savant psychotics they go out
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:43.000]  and kill people a lot of times just to mess with the cops and send them letters telling them you
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  can't catch me i'm superior to you the whole thing is about how they're better than everybody
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:58.360]  and how they're gonna get us you think these things want the poor africans no they want you
[1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:07.560]  they want you and they want you to buy into wink wink yeah there's too many of those indians
[1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:13.080]  yeah there's too many of those average yeah yeah yeah there's too many of them let's just get rid of
[1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:21.880]  her and once you do that once you engage in human sacrifice because that's what this is
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:28.120]  they've got you because then the hedge of protection is lifted
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:41.800]  and now you're in the room with the planet killers we're supposed to be leading the human race to
[1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:48.680]  the next level we're supposed to be empowering everybody we're supposed to turn these continents
[1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:56.760]  into paradises we could do it but instead we're leading humanity into death and into destruction
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:04.680]  the pentagon put out a report today saying the collapse of the third world tens of millions
[1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:08.920]  already starving to death will create a global depression and will collapse our borders
[1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:14.760]  because that's the truth and i'm not glorifying the pentagon but at least it was born in bread
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:21.480]  supposedly for america and has a mission to free the captives at least the name is on the building
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:27.480]  says that it's been influenced by evil it's got problems but let me tell you big tech is now
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:34.200]  ten times more powerful than our intelligence agencies in our pentagon
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:38.920]  so we're all taught by google that the intelligence agencies are what's bad and
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:43.560]  the pentagon what's bad oh my god they're like angels compared to these globalists
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.040]  there's not much time for the president and the pentagon to do what must be done
[1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:55.320]  and decapitate the leadership of the globalist operation politically or however is seen fit
[1:22:55.320 --> 1:23:01.720]  i will back it america will back it we need to take control of big tech now with executive action
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:07.080]  or there's no hope and i don't get up here on air and say things like that to act powerful
[1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:14.040]  and authoritarian we're burning down the ship's going down the whole damn planet's going down by
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:23.960]  design you think getting up here at hitting the sos you know use the nuclear weapons i don't mean
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:33.400]  literally the nuclear option it's because we're down to that moment the games are over it's us
[1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:39.560]  for them decapitate the chicon agents decapitate the deep staters now or we're all going down
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:45.480]  it's not my job citizens shouldn't do this but those that are known dead to rights
[1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:52.440]  president trump execute the america that we've known and loved the america that was the land of
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:57.960]  the free home of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is about
[1:23:57.960 --> 1:24:03.960]  domesticating us shutting us down and making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:08.600]  the depression is going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to even
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:13.400]  turn back trump tried to stop it but the mainstream media working with the tricoms blocked it that's
[1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:19.480]  why you and myself everybody else has to get prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:24.280]  it's about the economic chaos it's going to be unleashed for the next six months to a year get
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:29.240]  your high-quality swarble foods and for sure calm they're available again before a limited time the
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:35.720]  food supply is running out there are major shortages this is a globalist siege a globalist
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:41.720]  lockdown globalist terrorism but we the people the patriots have to be prepared we've already been
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:45.400]  proven right about prepping so far we'll get ready to be really proven right get your swarble
[1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:53.400]  foods now at infowarstore.com the united states is not communist china we don't have three million
[1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:59.240]  people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and
[1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:06.040]  sell their organs but all over the news we see the un billable indigates who mainstream corporate
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:12.200]  media praising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:16.920]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:22.120]  that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:33.080]  control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:39.000]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at band.video
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:44.600]  and infowarstore.com spread those links and jam it down the censor's throats and then we'll be able
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:53.000]  to defeat their operation that much quicker we are 170 days out from the 2020 election it is a
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:59.480]  referendum of national sovereignty against globalism and obama hillary and the deep state have been
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:05.080]  caught attempting to overthrow president trump's election and they've been caught in two separate
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:10.280]  coup attempts against the president now they've been pushing covet 19 shut down the economy and
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:15.400]  created depression well china's already been open for business for more than a month this is an
[1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:21.000]  ongoing globalist attempt to punish the american people wreck our economy and hope that we won't
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.680]  recognize that it is they the new world order that have orchestrated this and not president trump
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:32.040]  they know their crimes are coming out they know the chickens are coming home to roost so now they're
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:37.720]  panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:45.160]  safe from covet 19 the entire covet 19 system is a giant hopes and must be exposed if america has
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:27:05.160]  any hope so get out there and expose this fraud you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:24.840]  you can hear it all right folks i'm gonna open the phones up and take your calls i got a bunch
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:31.640]  of clips i haven't gotten to a lot of huge news to cover but at the end of the first hour i i
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:38.760]  i covered all the mainline admissions that the un since the 1980s has been testing
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:45.160]  sterilants inside vaccines in many cases on unwitting third world populations and so all
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:53.800]  the rumors about them adding hcg to the vaccines are absolutely true it's another big report we're
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:28:00.520]  going to get to in a few minutes that is obama gate all roads lead to weiner's laptop that's
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:08.280]  actually on the list in fact we'll just go to that right now let me give folks the number there on
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:15.560]  the list so they know where it is it's clip seven and it's obama gate all roads lead to weiner's
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:21.000]  laptop maybe i should just quit and shut the show down seriously maybe maybe that's like the the
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:27.800]  mic drop here because everybody's just gotten comfortable with living under this evil
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:35.080]  do they don't want to get up here and talk about some murdering kingpin like bill gates all day
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.200]  and have them try to shut us down constantly you think this is a damn game you think it's a joke
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:45.400]  this is not a game this isn't all the other cowards and all the other followers and all
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:29:05.160]  the other BS this is the real world seriously this is a real world this is where the buck stops
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:11.960]  people need to come out of their trance they need to get out of the trance the television and the
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:18.680]  media creates they need to get back to what's basic maybe i should just leave for a month
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:24.360]  maybe that's the answer i just leave for a month and just let everybody do whatever they want
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:33.480]  because i'm not pissed at anybody it's i can't sit here with stacks of un reports on their own
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:39.560]  website how they're shooting kenyans up sterilize them and then turn on snopes and they go it doesn't
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:44.120]  exist i mean those are damn criminals those are our enemies
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:52.600]  why don't other people have fire them
[1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:03.240]  why is the fight going out of us that's a big question when did it happen how did it happen
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:13.320]  oh not having fighting you means you're compliant i mean i know so many men who were like six one
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:18.520]  six four big badass men but they like think it's a they think it's like powerful to grovel the
[1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:22.600]  girlfriend and act all passive and weak it's like it's a virtue because everyone patched them on the
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:28.360]  head dude you're being primed for destruction you're supposed to be a leader but you're not a leader
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:33.640]  but you could be five feet tall and a woman or five feet tall and a man if you want freedom and
[1:30:33.640 --> 1:30:41.960]  justice you're a leader act like it complying with this thing doesn't empower anybody it's death
[1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:49.960]  and i'm just trying to figure out how to not comply with it i mean i got a good idea how to
[1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:58.440]  fight it in the third dimension and that's really the quandary like how long do you wait
[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:13.080]  god almighty
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:17.400]  ah john britain
[1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:28.760]  john britain we are coming for you john britain let's go to this report we'll come back with
[1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:33.480]  phone calls and eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven seven eight nine
[1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:40.040]  two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine alex here's the report we've all been saying
[1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:47.320]  it for years all roads lead to obama what was once speculation of the obvious has sent the lunatic
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:52.120]  left scrambling it's so disappointing to look at what we're seeing from right-wing media these days
[1:31:52.120 --> 1:31:57.960]  where there's such an obsession with the deep state and these revelations about the russia probe
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:01.720]  and the decision about michael flinn they're treating the michael flinn story like it's a
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:06.680]  bigger deal than the deaths of 2000 americans a day you know there are all kinds of conspiracy
[1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:11.960]  theories about how he was entrapped the fbi just didn't do anything wrong here so i think that's
[1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:16.680]  important because there are a lot of sort of conspiracy theories they all work together and
[1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:21.720]  you know the fox news people in the white house fuel these sort of rumors do they send these around
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:26.120]  with fax machines they come up with these conspiracy theories and they send around on fax machines
[1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:30.040]  they should just knock it off and realize that their ridiculous conspiracy theories are going to be
[1:32:30.040 --> 1:32:37.960]  knocked down stop stop with the conspiracy theories when history looks back on this decision how do
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:42.360]  you think it will be written well history is written by the winner so it largely depends on
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:49.320]  on uh who's writing the history i was struck peggy by the cynicism of the answer it's a correct
[1:32:49.320 --> 1:32:54.360]  answer but he's the attorney general he didn't make the case that he was upholding the rule of law
[1:32:54.360 --> 1:33:01.240]  when history looks back on this decision how do you think it will be written well history is written
[1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:07.480]  by the winner so it largely depends on on uh who's writing the history but i think a fair history
[1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:14.440]  would say it was a it was a good decision because it it appealed the rule of law the news uh over
[1:33:14.440 --> 1:33:24.760]  the last 24 hours i think has been somewhat downplayed about uh the justice department dropping charges
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:33.960]  against michael flinn and the fact that there is no precedent that anybody can find for uh
[1:33:33.960 --> 1:33:41.240]  someone who's been charged with perjury getting off scout free that's the kind of stuff where you
[1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:49.000]  you begin to get worried that basic not just institutional norms but our basic understanding
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:56.920]  of of rule of law is uh is a risk he says and if you don't do it i will and then later says i've
[1:33:56.920 --> 1:34:02.760]  got my pen and my phone and if you don't act i will those who agree with the president's policies
[1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:08.280]  can sit back and say well i don't need to enter into tough negotiations about what needs to be done
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:15.160]  to enforce the law or to reform the law and instead i'll just wait for the president act
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:19.320]  the rule was not before the government could do something we must find some not completely
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:24.520]  absurd interpretation of existing law that allows us to do it but actually looking to the law first
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:28.280]  figure out what does the law say objectively and then figuring out whether you could do it what you
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:32.760]  could do not playing not putting the car before the horse so to speak a release of real evidence
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:38.680]  from the department of justice tying obama to the coup of the next administration had always
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:46.040]  been slowly seeping out those texts totally candid unvarnished uh have just raised an awful
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:50.840]  lot of questions republican senator ron johnson's government oversight committee released an
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:56.520]  interim report including the fbi text messages that draw new connections to president obama
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:02.280]  in september 2016 two months after the fbi closed the clinton email case and two months into the
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:09.080]  bureau's russia probe then fbi agent peter struck text fbi lawyer lisa page using bureau's shorthand
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:15.000]  talking points for director komie page replies yes because potas wants to know everything we are
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.360]  doing that potas of course is barack obama while the coronavirus intensity played cover for the
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:28.760]  scandal in april of 2020 the doj released this telling email saying we need to discuss what
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:35.320]  happens if the department of justice directs us or directly tells us the potas or anyone else about
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:42.040]  the redacted specifically with regards to what we do directly with him i think it will be very
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:48.840]  difficult not to do some sort of overt step with him a defensive briefing or interview under light
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:55.320]  defensive briefing pretext unless white house specifically directs us not to these directives
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:36:01.400]  would later become the basis for what is now general michael flin's exoneration and now
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:06.680]  richard grinnell the acting director of national intelligence moved to declassify information
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:11.800]  about the obama administration officials who were behind the unmasking of michael flin and
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:17.400]  their names could soon be made public fox news confirmed that a new round of documents is expected
[1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:24.760]  and the unmasking concerns events between the november 2016 election and inauguration day 2017
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:29.640]  but beyond the political sinkhole that the obama knights have found themselves standing on there
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:35.240]  is a far more sinister element to ripping the band aid off of this scandalous power play for the
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:41.080]  ages and that can be found in the laptop of disgraced politician anthony wiener right so
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:46.920]  james comey our total report at band on video john valer right back with your phone call stay with
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:52.920]  us vitamin mineral fusion is one of our best selling products it wasn't always that way we
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:58.040]  hardly ever promoted we first launched it a few years ago but people slowly began to try it and
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:04.040]  almost everyone that orders it reorders it that's why we're offering it right now at info wars life
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:10.760]  dot com at 50 off even though we're about to sell out because i want people who've been on the fence
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:14.760]  who've heard us talk about it who've read some of the reviews to experience it for yourself and this
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:20.280]  is important it's not just all the key vitamins and minerals you need it's also got amino acids
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:24.840]  that are known to help you absorb more of this into your body and that's really important for
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:31.560]  folks that are older because a lot of people don't absorb vitamins and minerals in pill form or
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:37.640]  capitol form but they get a higher absorption rate when it's liquid so this powdered formula goes great
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:42.520]  into water into other juices it's good for adults it's good for children take advantage of this
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.000]  super sale that's about to end at info wars life dot com today with vitamin mineral fusion
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:53.320]  the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:59.880]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.920]  and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer the
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:12.040]  shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:16.040]  that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's important to be a
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:21.560]  prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:27.880]  so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:33.880]  continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen because
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:39.160]  we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:44.600]  scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time to
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:52.600]  stop the denial and realize what's really happening make a friend with death it's the same so old
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:59.720]  that no one knows who first said it every culture has their own way of memorializing that simple
[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:05.160]  statement but you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization and the death of the
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:12.120]  human species the moment of truth is now here we are facing the post-human era and i've been
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:18.360]  warning you for many years they would use a global viral crisis to click put us in the cage and then
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:27.080]  roll out the robot takeover this is just the beta test china is moving out of beta and into operational
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:33.960]  control in just a few years we will be under full globalist control forced inoculations total
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:41.080]  surveillance we're all being taught that we are obsolete the term they use is non-essential this
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:49.000]  is not some dystopian novel this is reality this is the new world order this is satanism i'm cutting

[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:32.680]  have to end the sale on most items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close

[1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:14.760]  know undermining freedom undermining checks and balances destroys us all but you're evil
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:27.080]  so you only think one step i i get it it's checkers brain not 3d chess i don't know if
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:36.440]  trump's playing 3d chess but i know i am and 3d chess is truthful it's right out the open
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:40.760]  that tells you where you are where you're going and where you're gonna be in the end
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:45.160]  as a beginning so
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:53.400]  there's evil in the universe but there's also the real mccoy
[1:44:53.400 --> 1:45:01.800]  and you out there listening you know you love god you love freedom you care about people and
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:07.480]  and you're smart well you're the real mccoy so don't let anybody ever tell you you're not the
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:14.440]  real mccoy anybody tells you that is either stupid or working for the bad guys all right

[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:25.560]  we're going to everybody right now just in ohio you're on the air
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:31.800]  how you doing i am uh fit to be tied my friend how are you done
[1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:41.080]  i feel as stressed as you found and i'm sure you know because of how much more responsibility
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:46.440]  and knowledge you have than i i'm sure that my stress isn't uh my stress level isn't anything
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:53.560]  near yours but just on a personal note i mean i am you know as long as it can get i feel um
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:46:03.240]  so real quick i just wanted to fill a couple things out there i have so i am a pro trump person
[1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:10.760]  from 2016 i'm from appalachia i feel that most of my area uh was pro trump however
[1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:18.600]  however in the recent year or more i mean it has become quite clear to myself at least that
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:25.080]  i can't name anything that he has done for the common man i mean the federal government's become
[1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:30.360]  larger uh everybody likes to bring up the stock market well that's if you already had money um
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:38.600]  you know i i just can't i i have turned and unfortunately in this two-party system um it
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:42.760]  makes me sound like i'm at the other side and i'm not for the other side uh but i have turned
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:48.520]  against trump at this point hey uh no i get it brother listen trump inherited a collapsing system
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:55.880]  and china was pumping trillions a month into their system so trump said we'll beat him with that
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:47:01.080]  because he kind of inherited a collapse already but i totally get what you're saying and i and i
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:08.680]  understand it and and i you know i i give what you're saying a hundred percent um but just very
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:13.880]  basic very basic things i mean i was a i actually called you i believe it's well the very basic
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:19.160]  stuff is why does it trump stop big tech censorship why doesn't he stop election meddling why does he
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:24.520]  stop microsoft running the election why doesn't he no i i mean i i i mean i get what you're saying
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:31.400]  yeah well um so i i'd call it at the end of march i had mentioned to you about the small pig cloning
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:38.200]  laboratory outside of bahia university in the middle of nowhere and uh but um anyhow i
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:46.040]  so i have been a microbiologist for years and i i i worked for nine major uh respiratory
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:54.680]  viruses or working vaccine research for years and so what do you make of what's currently going on to
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:48:04.040]  myself uh myself and six others have wrote uh co-wrote a letter to the governor of ohio
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:10.600]  as well as jim jordan and i i mean we just pointed out the basics and this is kind of what
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:18.120]  i was touching on with trump um just the basics of immunology um the basics of science is what i
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:26.280]  would call um and you know myself and uh the so i don't work in the vaccine research anymore i
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:33.000]  actually moved more into chemistry and uh i manage a chemical lab um but my friends that are still
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.040]  working for one of the companies that actually contracted to make some of these testing kits
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.000]  i've been in contact with them they will not text uh they will not do anything except speak on the
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:49.960]  phone with me um because they're scared to death to lose their job um but yeah just the
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:58.440]  i don't understand why this isn't being called out where everybody's putting hope in a vaccine
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:04.760]  but to my knowledge and to others' knowledges uh in my field we've never had a successful
[1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:11.320]  respiratory vaccine well that's well known yeah they're yeah exactly there's no pneumonia vaccine
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:16.360]  and we're just being told so obviously it's the carrier for something much bigger and
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:20.440]  bill gate says it's going to be the sterilant so how does he think he's going to get away
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.440]  with that that's what i mean they're just doing it they're like we're saving the earth from the
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:30.200]  humans there's too many people let's just do it and and if he wasn't having such glee like
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:35.160]  ah everyone's going to die saying he wasn't so excited about it i can go okay well
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:44.040]  there's a basic sickness to all this i i agree and i believe so i'm a hundred percent on board
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:53.720]  with the idea that americans or maybe this is everywhere uh in the uh called the developed
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:50:00.840]  countries but i think we are so desensitized and so dumb on so many levels and then the those of us
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:07.160]  that have knowledge um we and i know this from a friend from mexico a friend from cuba um
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:14.360]  they were willing to put up with about whatever to maintain their standard of living
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:20.360]  and i feel like that's what we have here as long as people yeah that's it humanity is asleep and is
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:25.080]  sold out and is now about to have everything taken from it and by the time they figure out

[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:13.160]  living in denial having mass dot com syndrome learned help us will only deliver you into misery
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:18.680]  destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:25.880]  not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all
[1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:30.040]  we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new world
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:36.440]  order decide to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls

[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:13.320]  books show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt and evil and turned
[1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:20.200]  away from god they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:25.960]  and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again today
[1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:33.480]  compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided to fight

[2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:17.720]  end of our elaborate plans the end all right we're back live i'm gonna go to your phone calls it was
[2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:23.480]  a special guest coming up on the hour in studio the owner of a yippie one of the freer search
[2:00:23.480 --> 2:00:27.560]  engines out there to talk about what's happening so i want to go to your calls here in just a
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:35.560]  moment but i want to talk about fauci right now fauci said back in late january that covid 19
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:42.120]  wasn't a threat because they were planning to say trump didn't respond properly we we got that right
[2:00:42.920 --> 2:00:47.000]  and then when trump tried to block china flying flights in fauci tried to block him
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.640]  and he flew people that were infected in to create the hysteria so he's a deep stator and
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:57.880]  trump more and more a sidelining fauci understands that they're going to count every death now
[2:00:57.880 --> 2:01:03.560]  heart attack cancer as covid 19 and you heard the caller earlier that works the medical field
[2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:09.800]  that there it's never been a respiratory virus vaccine it doesn't exist there's too many viruses
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:14.120]  so there's something a lot bigger behind this whole deal and we showed you the
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  un documents where they're adding sterilized the vaccines so these issues are so magnificently huge
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:23.960]  if you don't get upset about them we're almost helping the enemy covering these topics like
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:28.680]  they're no big deal we're actually conditioning you to accept it unless you get fundamentally
[2:01:28.680 --> 2:01:35.880]  pissed and motivated to say no to it so here's fauci saying it's not a major threat a few months
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:45.160]  ago and then we'll cut to fauci saying no guarantee vaccine is gonna work why is he doing that i'll
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:50.360]  explain a moment bottom line we don't have to worry about this one right
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:57.640]  people are trying to blame president trump uh half the country even certainly the media
[2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:03.320]  blame trump blame trump why doesn't he just listen to dr fauci and we want to show you what
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:09.080]  dr fauci was saying in the earliest stages of this situation overall is this something to
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:14.440]  worry about or not what are you thinking in terms of this virus spreading here in the united states
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:20.200]  well those people were probably at a very low risk uh and how many people are coming from Wuhan
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:28.440]  china to the united states on a daily basis you know that yeah about 75 000 per year oh total
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:35.080]  yeah okay so uh manageable numbers um bottom line we don't have to worry about this one right
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:41.880]  well i you know obviously you need to take it seriously and do the kinds of things that the
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:48.840]  cdc and the department of homeland security are doing but this is not a major threat for the people
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:53.640]  in the united states and this is not something that the citizens of the united states right now
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:59.560]  should be worried about fabulous no i am glad to hear that um probably should have established
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:06.600]  that much earlier on if adam schiff has his way there will be some sort of 9 11 style investigation
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:11.320]  into all this at some point well the first person they should talk to is dr fauci and what he told
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:16.440]  the president when he told the president if he was telling him that i think we know the whole
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:22.040]  story and it might just be a great big waste of time a couple of things that i think are inherent
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:28.360]  in all vaccine development first of all there's no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:33.400]  to be effective as you well know because we've discussed this many times in the past and you
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:37.880]  can have everything you think that's in place and you don't induce the kind of immune response that
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:43.320]  turns out to be protective and durably protected so one the big unknown is it will be effective
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:49.800]  given the way the body responds to viruses of this type i'm cautiously optimistic that we will
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:55.240]  with one of the candidates get an efficacy signal the other thing that's an unknown that's of concern
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:04:01.080]  but we'll be able to get around that by doing the tests properly is that do you get an enhancement
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:07.080]  effect namely there have been a number of vaccines to in particular dengue and respiratory
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:13.960]  syncytial virus when the vaccine induces a suboptimal response and when a person gets exposed
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:19.480]  they actually have an enhanced pathogenesis of the disease which is always worrisome so we want
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:28.440]  to make sure that that doesn't happen those here's the big takeaway up until december of 2019 they
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.400]  said there are no side effects vaccines are totally healthy and it's safe and effective they've never
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:40.120]  had one problem even though there's been a hundred years of crises and death and secret payouts and
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:44.760]  multi-billion dollar funds and you know secret experimentation and injecting black people with
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:50.680]  cephalos and i mean they're just like there's no problem now they're like oh yeah it's gonna kill
[2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:55.880]  some people causing problems may not work because they know they failed to cover it up that's why
[2:04:55.880 --> 2:05:00.600]  i was like is the u n good now they came out and said vaccines are killing people and don't work i was
[2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:05.000]  like you're like you don't leave your house till you take it and it may kill you they're just like
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:09.960]  okay we're not going to have the debate about whether it hurts you now okay causes autism okay
[2:05:09.960 --> 2:05:16.440]  causes cancer okay it sterilizes you you want to leave your house you're going to take it because
[2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:20.840]  they know when they do this in mass is going to cause incredible bad reactions and death so
[2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:28.840]  the bill among the gates foundation with the clinton's run the global system with apple and
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:35.080]  google on your phones that's in the news today tracking you the clinton's are tracking you and
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:41.320]  if you were around somebody that had covered you're being taken to a FEMA camp but listen we're
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:45.960]  not taking you know it's not a police state or anything it's just that you were around somebody
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:51.880]  had covered all right i had to send somebody to arrest you all right now you see how it works
[2:05:52.760 --> 2:05:56.200]  kelsey is on the board she looks like webster obel
[2:05:58.520 --> 2:06:01.480]  they just can't stop pushing because we put up with them every time
[2:06:01.480 --> 2:06:07.240]  Nick in new york you're on the air thanks for holding that
[2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:12.280]  good afternoon outlets thanks for taking my call i'm not going to ask how you're doing
[2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:17.080]  because i already know how you're doing i wanted to uh offer up an idea i think that one of the
[2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:23.400]  things that we're looking at definitively in this new paradigm shift that you've been talking about
[2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:29.480]  for so many years and that we're at the crust we're right here now this is where we're at um for many
[2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:39.400]  years uh the internet the platforms on the internet have been built with um mechanisms and things
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:45.960]  which for for the large you know for a large portion you know is just not very friendly
[2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:52.920]  or they're they're they're not hospitable to uh nationalistic uh conservatives yeah the internet
[2:06:52.920 --> 2:07:00.200]  is a giant electronic straight jacket of slavery exactly exactly so i think that one of the things
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:05.400]  and the first call that you had on uh it was interesting because you know his his thing is
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:10.440]  he was stressed he doesn't he doesn't have the information that you and many others have now
[2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:15.720]  this is a this is i mean this is huge this thing is so so big that how do you know this is the
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:20.600]  takeover this is the assault it's here now it's like the enemy assault in the castle it's here
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:28.120]  it's not like probes or it's not like frontline people uh scouts this is the big attack that is
[2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:35.320]  100 correct so as i see it and i want to give a quick picture if i can uh we we ourselves here on
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:39.240]  the nationalistic front or on the you know those who want to conserve conservatives who want to
[2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:44.600]  conserve yeah those that don't want to post human future exactly exactly those that aren't psychotic
[2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:51.560]  crazy people correct but we're coming to we're finding ourselves more and more coming to the
[2:07:51.560 --> 2:07:57.720]  merovingian of control the people who are the traffickers of information the people who control
[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:04.600]  all these things and so basically the scumbags that want to play god exactly we're seeing ourselves
[2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:10.520]  right now uh in in as you say the pope you know the post you know the post economy versus the new
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:16.120]  digital economy and the question is how do we bring these two things together what is the
[2:08:16.120 --> 2:08:20.120]  well they're telling you you do what we say or you don't have access to the digital economy
[2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:26.680]  because it was always oh be a service economy but now that's obsolete that's not essential so now
[2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:32.200]  it's digital economy and you've got to submit and the first sacrament is chopping your son's balls
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:38.760]  off and putting them in a dress yeah exactly 100 correct that's the first offering is a human
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:44.920]  sacrifice of your son i i agree with that i'm not disagreeing i say i agree no i mean that's what
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:50.920]  this is we're we're right back where we were exactly but now the question becomes for us
[2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:55.560]  sitting at home in these lockdowns as we're seeing this thing play out which you've been
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:09:01.480]  speaking about for many many years uh you know unfolding itself and we're seeing this and we'll
[2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:06.120]  come we have to make a choice because that's what it comes down to is yeah no i agree and the choice
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:12.360]  is here and we've also got to call god down through us into the earth we have to literally we have to
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:18.600]  call on christ right now let me ask you this quick question i do you believe that there is any
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:26.360]  possibility of of of us having a president in this platform without actually having to go
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:31.240]  to some kind of of war over this because we're talking about no sir we're gonna be completely
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:35.000]  taking off everything and then they're gonna start starving us to death and they're gonna send
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:39.480]  robots to kill us but at that point their whole system is going to be collapsing their people
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:43.640]  will be desperately trying to serve it more and more to prop it up and then the whole thing's going
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:49.080]  to go down i was talking to my wife tonight and i was saying our economy slowing down and shutting
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:54.120]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot and then it
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:59.640]  finally dies she said well yeah when i grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in
[2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:04.600]  the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:10.440]  had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around gibbering talking nonsense for
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:16.440]  about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well that's what's gonna happen with our economy it is
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:22.760]  in cardiac arrest this has been done by design and the un the chai comms the mainstream media
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:28.520]  orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed so remember the depression that's
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:35.480]  coming and the third world collapse is all on the un on billa melinda gates on obama on hillary

[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:13.560]  about that place even your emotions haven't let go look we told you three months ago they were
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:18.520]  going to lock the economy down and when you have that they wouldn't allow it to reopen in blue states
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:26.920]  in blue cities it's a strike it's a it's a form of protest because they bankrupt things they think
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:37.080]  we're all gonna pay for it that's why now it's childhoods end all the games are over everything
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:46.200]  we warned of is now confirmed our worst-case scenario turned out to be a positive outcome analysis
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:49.960]  if anything it was worse than we said
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:54.280]  and so now
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:12:58.840]  between you and i in eternity
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:09.240]  we now have to decide as men and as women what we're gonna do before god and everybody else
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:17.720]  wow it's all real it's all happening world government mark of the beast the whole thing
[2:13:20.120 --> 2:13:23.960]  wow amazing
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.160]  i wouldn't fear beelzebub if i was you
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:38.600]  because the devil can kill your body but i'd fear you cut off from god if i was you and i
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:43.080]  think you all know that and that's why they hate this audience because you're not an audience
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:47.400]  you're a group of activists you know i haven't hit this yet i have a guest coming to the studio
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:53.640]  with us but i won't take calls for days i've been to cover this stock home syndrome i talk a lot
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:58.600]  about it but what is stock home syndrome and what is learned helplessness because they go

[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:11.320]  phone calls though austin in illinois you're on the air go ahead alex thank you so much for taking
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:17.800]  my call let's get right into it i'm reporting from what i like to call the california of the midwest
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:23.640]  the state of illinois alex we don't know when things are going to go back to normal we have jb
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:29.960]  pritzker our governor on twitter talking about how the only way that we can cross into the final phase
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:35.880]  of restoring our state is with a vaccine alex this is not conspiracy this is straight oh no
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:40.760]  they're telling you your job never comes back you never you have no life till bill gates put
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:47.720]  something in your body yes sir that's correct and also he does state that at any time they can just
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:52.360]  pull these restrictions back move us back into phase three back oh yeah no it's called martial law
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:56.840]  brother yeah we woke it up inside of it they've been planning it for a long time they finally
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:02.520]  we were struggling free from them so they said hey implement the operation that's right alex and right
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:08.840]  now governor pritzker does not seem churches as an essential service so we currently uh the pools
[2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:13.080]  are closed but you know what to do i mean nothing against illinois a lot of great people exodus
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:18.120]  we have to go to the free zones you have i mean i'm gonna leave austin i've already began to sell
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:24.600]  my house i already mortgaged it i'm leaving i i mean i it's just you must leave babelon you must
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:30.280]  leave egypt that's correct but unfortunately the state of illinois has been completely weaponized
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:35.560]  and it's just unfortunate i've been out of work for about two months now sheltering in place
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:41.000]  doing uh what the people of our of the church and the local community think is virtuous but alex
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:45.800]  the book of second timothy says that god has not given us a spirit of fear but one of love
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:52.200]  power in a sound mind and i've just urged the people of illinois to wake up to to vote with
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:56.840]  your dollar alex we can no longer go to our local grocery stores without wearing a mask we are
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:01.960]  it's all it's all slavery this is the martial law plan they didn't use terrorists as the excuse
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:06.840]  they didn't use no it this is this is their ace card god bless you i appreciate your call

[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:34.040]  governor whitmer going after second amendment there's another protest going on up at the capital
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:37.800]  that's right canada announced they're banning all semi-auto now she wants your guns too
[2:16:38.840 --> 2:16:42.920]  he's uh she's saying that if anybody shows up at this protest you know she got with the state police
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:47.960]  and said anybody shows up with a gun you know arrest them and then you got the barber up in
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:56.200]  owasso you know the oh they're just begging for a war they're just begging for a war and you know
[2:16:56.200 --> 2:17:01.800]  what i was saying the you know the barber up in owasso that opened up you know the judge dismissed
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:06.280]  the case but the state still went after him and took his license away from him today so he can't
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:11.800]  even operate now police officers that have refused to arrest people that run their own restaurants
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:16.520]  or own barber shops they're being fired i mean you know i say you throw out the god the mayor
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:23.160]  and you make that police officer them the mayor that's what we need is pro human common sense people
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:28.680]  exactly and it's sad to see that nobody in michigan's waking up to it everybody's just all
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:33.160]  oh yeah you know well that's because they were living on the fumes of what forebearers fought
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:38.840]  and died for people fought by the millions had died for what we got and we're just pissing all over
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:43.800]  it you're up and you know and i know you're not pissing on it brother neither am i but
[2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:51.640]  all these idiots have no idea what due process cost eight hundred years of war brother for that
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:58.280]  eight hundred years millions dead millions dead for that that alone the right of the jury millions
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:06.440]  dead in england they had 14 wars over that brother they had wars were 10 20 of the men died
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:12.840]  just for free speech and we just piss on it like it's a joke exactly man it's a shame that
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:16.200]  everybody's just forgetting their constitutional rights and just bowing down there's the difference
[2:18:16.200 --> 2:18:19.960]  those men lived under slavery's why they were ready to die for it so let me tell you there's
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:25.880]  going to be a storm my friend there's going to be the opposite end of this and i and i here's the
[2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:31.000]  problem taking out globalists is like stepping on dog crap i don't even want to i don't want to
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:37.320]  destroy them but they just keep summoning the whirlwind you understand brother yeah i understand
[2:18:37.320 --> 2:18:41.320]  completely man i appreciate everything you do brother well look they think we're idiots and
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:45.160]  they think of a civil war starts we're going to go out and kill the cops the cops on average are
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:50.200]  awake as the public i don't want to kill anybody but when the globalists start to fight
[2:18:53.640 --> 2:18:58.280]  it's globalist that's why most of them have already high-tailed out of the country
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:05.480]  so i appreciate your call my friend all right let's go ahead and talk to george in
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:10.760]  canadian we'll go to med and others george you're on the air go ahead hi alex um i i think we should
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:16.040]  take the the battle where they have the weakest points and where they congregate people anyway
[2:19:16.040 --> 2:19:22.520]  take them to the to walmarts take them whatever bullhorn them hand out papers put put flyers on
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:28.360]  every single car and say look we're gonna have a prayer in front of the personal home of every
[2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:34.840]  governor we're coming in peace the first time the second time we're going after every bureaucrat
[2:19:34.840 --> 2:19:40.600]  and putting up putting going to their homes that we know where locally they live and tell look
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:45.000]  we want you to resign if you're you're going to go along with this because you gave up a
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:51.720]  oath to the constitution if you do not resign we will find a way to put you all off your job and
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:58.680]  lose your pension forever because you cannot follow these illegal orders against the people
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:04.440]  if you feel feel this way you can either resign or we can we can fire and think about george the
[2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:11.240]  globalists are involved in open siege against us and now admitting it's to punish us for trump
[2:20:11.240 --> 2:20:18.840]  this is all americans should unify against this exactly and and and the bottom line is
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:26.520]  why don't people realize why did why did obama come after trump so bad could it possibly be that
[2:20:26.520 --> 2:20:33.400]  he questioned his his uh his uh birth certificate could it possibly be the person who basically
[2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:39.160]  couldn't find the birth certificate uh in hawaii dropped out of the sky and the hearings could
[2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:43.560]  never be held no you're right all roads lead to obama may he burn in hell i don't like coming
[2:20:43.560 --> 2:20:47.720]  to you every day on the radio and tv stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you
[2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:52.600]  all these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:59.480]  true we were warning everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:03.240]  put a fence around it if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can
[2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:07.720]  hit their head and drown people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well
[2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:11.800]  ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world
[2:21:11.800 --> 2:21:17.960]  and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:22.920]  it they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:28.280]  they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy
[2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:33.800]  i know all this sounds insane when i was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because
[2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:39.160]  it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't the case but they're really our evil psychopaths
[2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:44.760]  in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them i've hunted a lot of big game
[2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:51.880]  at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk could say 600 yards even if
[2:21:51.880 --> 2:21:58.280]  you hit them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe a hundred yards they've got that
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:03.000]  adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all of a sudden they
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:09.880]  slow down they realize what's happened they fall over and they die then you go bag them and haul
[2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:15.720]  them back in well that's what's gonna happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:22.520]  numbers show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:27.640]  long horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over
[2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:32.440]  100 million dead according to you and i believe their numbers because it's the very un that's
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:36.840]  orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists had thought it was their
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:40.520]  revolution to get rid of trump you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something
[2:22:40.520 --> 2:22:46.840]  better than what hitler did holem block has really been a sleeper product for us we got it in a few
[2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:53.000]  years ago it's an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs they discovered this more
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:58.600]  than 30 years ago in france that if you ate quail eggs from a certain type of quail uh that it had
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:03.720]  an antihistamine effect and people saw their allergies and seasonal discomfort knocked way
[2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:10.120]  way down well now this is available in the united states it's proprietary it has rave reviews it's
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:15.000]  a product that i never even really promote but that people keep reordering and has become a best
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:20.600]  seller we're very close to selling out holem block right now it'll take eight weeks to get more in
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:25.960]  but despite that i'm going to sell it at 50 off until it sells out so for those of you that have
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:31.000]  never ordered it and been on the fence that have seasonal discomfort experience holem block for
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:38.360]  yourself right now at m4warstore.com for 50% off holem block i want people that haven't tried it
[2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:42.120]  to try it for themselves so it's the lowest price ever even though it's selling out
[2:23:45.800 --> 2:23:48.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:55.560 --> 2:24:00.520]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:07.560]  all right well heads up yippie dot com and i'm glad he came to austin before he flies off another
[2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:13.160]  meeting rich rambel is a really active fellow you know i'm not going to read his long bio here but
[2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:19.000]  he's done a great job helping info wars get the truth out he actually stood up a few years ago a
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:25.240]  public service announcement yippie ceo rich rambel a large twitter ceo jack dorsi and
[2:24:25.240 --> 2:24:28.680]  b o d for free speech censorship of conservative users and disturbing
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:33.880]  content not for stop down now it's out in the open that they are going after basically every
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:38.840]  free nationalist every conservative medical doctors that come out and expose covet nineteen
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:43.800]  is overblown i mean the censorship has now just become across the board and i'm a big fan of
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:48.200]  trump but i have to say i'm really mad that he hasn't taken action i get these are quote free
[2:24:48.200 --> 2:24:53.880]  companies but these are utilities and in live time they're surveilling people forget the censorship
[2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:59.480]  they're surveilling to be able to censor well you know alex i agree with some of that what i think
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:04.760]  that trump is doing is allowing the deep state to become to come out not only at the government
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:09.560]  dc level but now we're seeing it to the state city and county level you're saying it's 3d checks
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:14.520]  he's got it he's treat it's about to be checkmate okay well and you've got the floor it's all run
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:18.440]  on forever and i'll let you talk tell us about yippie dot com tell us about what you're doing
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:22.280]  tell us what you think's really happening you're a smart guy well i mean so uh you know i have
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:26.200]  i've been ranklin's been on your show many times he works with me and my company um you know we are
[2:25:26.200 --> 2:25:30.920]  a data intelligence company open source intelligence company we um we basically know what's going on
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:35.560]  in real time by following you know major news events and things are having all over the world
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:41.320]  and we culminate all this information we're able to derive points of interest let's call them and
[2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:48.360]  abilities to locate targets of opportunity as well as understanding what the flow of information is
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:53.640]  sending whether it's true or misinformation because even if you're getting a tiny sample
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:57.560]  but google gets it's still a snapshot of what's happening correct so that intel's amazing it's
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:02.040]  amazing so what makes you start yippie dot com so uh actually i was like the old google i could
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:05.480]  actually go there and actually find real stuff yeah yeah what's that's not like it's taylor for
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:09.240]  panther it's either just kind of a good snapshot it's just a highly advanced search engine much
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:13.480]  more advanced than what google is we run multiple different algorithms at the same time unweighted
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:17.640]  unbiased didn't google break themselves the last two years it doesn't even work anymore it's like
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:22.440]  a fraud it's like a it's just a it's like a phone book where the only globalists get listed well
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:29.080]  yeah so i think that uh the whole premise of google now is to exploit information and push up
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:33.240]  what's relevant to them and to their ideals to the top and not what really is true and honest
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:37.800]  information so instead of human intelligence the old google is what we liked went to the top
[2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:41.640]  what was about two three years ago they totally changed correct so i mean they went they went
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:46.280]  off the they went off the reservation uh right when about trump was elected uh they went totally
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:51.240]  blitzkrieg against you and and every other conservative voice that's out there um they started
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:56.920]  underweighting uh sources in their in their master index meaning that if you want to go look for a
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:01.160]  news relevant story and use the rat taxonomy and you're the one that had the best story
[2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:05.320]  you never show up in the top results because they've underweighted you so your so your search results
[2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:10.200]  going to end up on page 25 when it should be on page one they put the quote authoritative stuff
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:17.000]  you got it which means bill clinton hillary clinton you got it perfect well said but so so so but
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.800]  you started yippie before that what was the mention of yippie so it was to provide a conservative
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:27.960]  unbiased uh relationship to uh information sorry about that now we're just moving your
[2:27:27.960 --> 2:27:33.080]  mic in front of you go ahead great and uh to do it in a way that it promoted you know good ethics
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:36.840]  and information right we want everybody to be able to look at the same information so yippie's
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:41.800]  very unbiased uh we you know we don't control our algorithms we let it let we let it have what we
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:46.840]  call free will algorithm right it goes and creates the information and it stacks it and it puts
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:52.040]  and google knew that that was what was power turn loose human intelligence into the internet instead of
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:27:56.600]  bureaucrats pre-programming well human intelligence a little bit different human intelligence more of
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:28:00.920]  you and i face-to-face uh open source intelligence is what google was really used for by the federal
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:05.960]  government then they turned in a bit the hand that made them the u.s. government made google google
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:09.800]  turned on the u.s. government they turned on everybody by the way because they think they're
[2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:14.600]  more powerful than it exactly explain that to people like ink you tell all of it what founded
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:21.160]  google yeah so ink you tell us a company that basically uses cia money to fund new operations
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:25.320]  you know our government is very very good at bringing new technologies to light but what
[2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:29.640]  happens is these technologies get real big and then they get corrupted into the cabal right we
[2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:33.640]  both know where the cabal is and those and then those sources and those people become multi-
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:37.800]  billionaires and they say well screw my country i'm more of a globalist now and i want to do with
[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:43.960]  the world once and not not giving the right precedence to the information and the relevancy
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:51.720]  of who made them which is us made all of them wow i've been asking a lot of questions but you're
[2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:56.120]  a smart guy on the inside of all this where would you where would you say we are in the fight right
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:01.320]  now for human liberty this seems like we're getting our ass i think we're in revelation i think we're
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:06.520]  in six six revelation six two i think the white horse is running i think the corona the crown
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:10.280]  virus is the crown given to the white horse rider and they're out conquering and to conquer
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:15.240]  i'm a born again christian and i totally believe that you're correct in your assumptions of where
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:19.240]  we are in the world right now and that uh people need to get right with christ soon because this
[2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:26.520]  is going to turn bad soon can you feel the evil i feel it daily and i and i and i feel the presence
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:31.320]  constantly and uh you know yippie has always been about doing the right thing right and uh
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:35.480]  you know being a christian ceo that's turned the cabal down i've been approached by chinese
[2:29:35.480 --> 2:29:40.200]  intelligence russian intelligence every single intelligent major intelligences tried to recruit me
[2:29:40.200 --> 2:29:44.360]  and my technology to go work for a fellow the average person out there thinks that that i mean
[2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:48.200]  let me tell you when you're actually influential you're a thinker you constantly get approached
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:54.440]  correct yep i have been uh and i've stayed loyal to my country uh china made a very very big run at
[2:29:54.440 --> 2:29:59.000]  me uh actually seeds turn will make you a crazy rich american and i turned them down
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:05.640]  well you've got the floor i could ask questions all day but we've got the ceo of yippie.com here
[2:30:05.640 --> 2:30:11.400]  with us uh for me i know it's choose your own adventure i mean revelation's fulfilling but i
[2:30:11.400 --> 2:30:16.920]  i i know it's gonna happen but we could almost go another route where it's not as bad we could
[2:30:16.920 --> 2:30:20.840]  yep and i think the united states can get through this you know europe's done right now
[2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:24.840]  they're they're finished uh their economies are completely broken so the only way that
[2:30:24.840 --> 2:30:28.120]  we're gonna get through this is through a god chosen president like trump
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:34.360]  who is playing 3d chess at a level of of superiority that no one else can even get to like
[2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:40.440]  they're so mad because he's so smart and with we're able to control our own destiny which meaning
[2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:44.680]  we got to get out these deep staters in the city the county in the state level we got to vote them
[2:30:44.680 --> 2:30:49.160]  out this time so that trump can do what he needs to do and we've got to turn our manufacturing
[2:30:49.160 --> 2:30:54.600]  capabilities inside and be able to put the people who are out of work the 15 to 25 percent of small
[2:30:54.600 --> 2:31:00.120]  businesses that are going to be gone in the next 90 to 180 days right and turn that into a win by
[2:31:00.120 --> 2:31:04.920]  turning on the same charm that happened in the greatest generation the world war two generation
[2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:09.480]  and to be able to take ourselves into a manufacturing sprint and dominate the world well you just
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:15.640]  said it they think when americans lose everything we're gonna bow like hitler started bombing
[2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:21.320]  britain and the civilian targets that turned them against hitler as long as americans know it's a
[2:31:21.320 --> 2:31:25.320]  globalist thing doing it to them they're gonna go with america they don't care if they're starving
[2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:29.800]  but how do we get that message to them well i think you know um we need to we know that i think
[2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:34.520]  the trump administration is working on something about a made a made in the usa task force needs
[2:31:34.520 --> 2:31:38.680]  to be spun up very very quickly i know most of your products are made in the usa i think all of
[2:31:38.680 --> 2:31:42.920]  my children made in the usa none of the none of the supplements are from china yeah yeah so i mean
[2:31:42.920 --> 2:31:47.160]  what we have to do is we got to turn into ourselves and which by the way is hard like any drugs or
[2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:52.040]  supplements it's like 90% china yeah oh i mean we have people like we we have to pay three times
[2:31:52.040 --> 2:31:56.280]  more just haven't made america a lot of it's made in canada we just it just it doesn't exist it's
[2:31:56.280 --> 2:32:00.200]  like you have to go pay people to do it here wait but you know what you're getting you know what
[2:32:00.200 --> 2:32:03.720]  you're getting is pure you know you're getting the right stuff so and that's why you that's nothing
[2:32:03.720 --> 2:32:09.880]  nothing from china passes the test yep it's all toxic well how about the kn95 the kn95 brouhaha
[2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:13.320]  now they got all these millions of kn95s coming in the country and they're finding out they're
[2:32:13.320 --> 2:32:17.960]  defective right there's three or four manufacturers like why can't china ever deliver something that
[2:32:17.960 --> 2:32:24.120]  works because they lie they liars they're a country of liars they're governmental liars
[2:32:24.120 --> 2:32:29.480]  that's what they do and they buy everybody that's what they do they're not about making anything
[2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:34.040]  they don't develop anything they just buy the leadership off and they steal it that's what they
[2:32:34.040 --> 2:32:39.080]  do and they approached me about doing the same thing they approached me about turning on my own
[2:32:39.080 --> 2:32:44.520]  country and offered a lot of money let's talk about when we come back look at reddit people say oh
[2:32:44.520 --> 2:32:50.840]  china bought a steak no 500 million bought it bought it and and then suddenly it was they literally
[2:32:50.840 --> 2:32:55.880]  i'm not i'm not saying i'm a victim but i'd like to eat communists come over and say we're gonna kill
[2:32:55.880 --> 2:33:01.160]  you and your children and they've got cameras and as soon as i go fu it's on the news jones attacks

[2:33:05.640 --> 2:33:10.440]  russia that failed no folks the communists are more powerful than they've ever been in this country
[2:33:10.440 --> 2:33:15.800]  and they follow a creed and they believe they're about to overturn the government and overturn
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:21.480]  everything and and i got news for them and i don't have some tough guy mentality here i'm just

[2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:34.200]  ass people like kripke per Pelosi up there who says she wants three trillion dollars more i think

[2:35:58.280 --> 2:36:03.320]  nightmarish collapse for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep

[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:17.320]  now in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:22.200]  place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:28.360]  constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:33.560]  shut your business down shut your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:37.880]  starve to death tens of millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues

[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:52.200]  dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended
[2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:59.480]  and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the middle indigates foundation in full control
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:06.520]  many will submit through fear others will be bought off but in the end the globalists admit
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:12.760]  they're building a post-human world and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:21.400]  very quickly into its in game submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:28.120]  generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:35.480]  experiencing this this is your dignity your soul your future being poured inside out this is a
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:41.400]  scientific dictatorship to in full control of humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip
[2:37:45.320 --> 2:37:51.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:51.400 --> 2:37:53.400]  you
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:09.400]  my eyes are blind but i can see boy is that true you'd better believe it
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:17.560]  my eyes are blind but i can see the sunlight no longer sets me free
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:26.600]  rich rinnell of yippie.com's here and i noticed the ceo of it it's one of the biggest alternative
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:31.240]  websites search engines i'm like let's talk about yippie and he's like no i don't want to talk about
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:36.200]  yippie let's talk about the revolution against the globalists which is exactly we do it here
[2:38:36.200 --> 2:38:40.920]  so so but but i mean you're a smart guy and and of course you know your your chief councils are
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:45.160]  really great patriot and works with general flinn notice for people that don't know i have
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:49.560]  general flinn's coin for you right here by the way beautiful i appreciate that a good patriotic
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:53.640]  america defense intelligence the army standing up for america army's not perfect but it's not a
[2:38:53.640 --> 2:39:03.800]  chi-com traders we have a situation here where judges for those that don't know when prosecutors
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:10.120]  drop cases judges are supposedly these non-biased arbiters of the defense of the prosecution the
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:15.640]  federal judge says we're continuing the prosecution when they released manifold who was well-rooted
[2:39:15.640 --> 2:39:22.360]  they're making i mean these people are doing things never before done so first of all general flinn
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:28.840]  was stuck up with a handgun to his head by comey holding up mike flinn jr a very fair and honest
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:35.240]  guy i mean i love little little little mikey and uh i uh i think the world of that family um what they
[2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:41.800]  did to him was the most corrupt thing that i've ever witnessed and to a three star general it's
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:46.840]  unheard of like this is something that's never happened to mafia tactics it's mafia it's it's
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:53.320]  it's ob it's obama uh i'm saying me in defense post they've already gone after my dad to get
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:59.000]  at me my dad just said whatever mike you know but that's what they do now yes absolutely i mean
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.040]  they said your son's going to prison how many times have you been intimidated
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:09.720]  over the last 15 years i'm kind of retarded the opposite of that attack attacked right but yeah
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:13.800]  when they try to intimidate i just it doesn't work i thought i'm even a tough guy i'm kind of i
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:18.200]  what i'm saying is i when they try to intimidate me i go in the attack but no i agree most people
[2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:21.960]  they go hey we're gonna put your son in prison yeah unless you plead guilty it's like the manly thing
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:29.160]  well hopefully and he just and and mike jr just had travis his grandson so they had him right so
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:32.760]  they're basically take they're gonna they're talking about putting mike jr in jail as well
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:36.360]  so they're talking about taking not only the general but we're gonna put your son in prison
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:40.040]  too for some no that's what i mean he held his son hostage absolutely just like the old roman
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:43.800]  emperors exactly and with the new grandchild they knew they had him right because what's
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:49.000]  flin going to do flin's a patriot flin's a great father and he took a bullet for his family is
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:56.040]  what he did but he recovered the wound has recovered and it's about in this and brian stelter and all
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:41:02.680]  them are so and obama is so upset like their intimidation is failing um so i mean if if
[2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:07.640]  hillary clinton wins flin flin this isn't the thing never happened to flin right flin would
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:10.920]  flin would have never become the national security advisor i think flin would have just
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:15.240]  stayed on as a three star and he got his fourth star um i'd like to call for the president to
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:19.960]  to give flin his fourth star flin deserves his fourth star for what no i agree instead of like
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:24.520]  being ashamed of the attack give him the award give him the presidential medal of freedom and
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  give him his fourth star i mean you should start a hashtag no i agree rub it in their face exactly
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:32.040]  give him his fourth star because he does deserve that he does and and i don't hear anybody that's
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:35.080]  talking about it so i want to be the first one to talk about it give flin his fourth well you
[2:41:35.080 --> 2:41:41.320]  know tucker hurlson covered it on like it was monday night flin's like okay russia's a declining
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:46.280]  power okay great then give us a problem blow them up china's the threat that was the real crime
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:53.320]  yes 100 so i mean and we got fauci there's reports that i can't testify to him but you know fauci's
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:57.480]  in bed with the china was a chinese agent is a chinese agent and and and the whole corona virus
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:02.120]  itself could have i'm just going to say could have to protect myself from from from legalities
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:07.960]  but could have been created by fauci in conjunction with the chinese government well he funded the
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:14.360]  the corona virus research there correct so at the end of the day i'm you said it and but i'm
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:19.320]  and i'm concurring with you i believe that you're correct well that's my problem with trump trump's
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:25.160]  really smart when he faces each problem but his background research and i get like he doesn't
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:28.840]  even think nih is going to be political but then of course that's like the groups that made the
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:34.440]  run at him correct well i mean so trump has got trump is fighting off like 15 different battles
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:39.560]  at the same time um i think that we have to give him a just a little bit more time i know everybody
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:43.560]  wants to see comey swinging from a rope everybody wants to eat page truck and all the rest no i agree
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:49.000]  i've got two or three battles not 15 like him and i'm going crazy yeah and i'm 46 and you and i
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:54.840]  have not dealt we've dealt with intimidation we've dealt with attacks in person eyeball to eyeball
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:42:59.000]  where we were maybe even pull our guns i've had it on the streets where i've been intimidated on the
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:03.960]  streets about don't go in that direction i said screw you the bottom line is this he's taken it
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:08.360]  all on you and i aren't dealing with anything compared to what he's been dealing with no i agree
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:13.480]  anybody every time i get pissed at trump i go i couldn't do what he does yes yeah and i know
[2:43:13.480 --> 2:43:17.800]  president trump is not a bad ass though he is a bad ass he is a billy bad ass
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:23.480]  providence look at god gave us that uh by i said this i think was tamilly interviewed me
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:30.520]  back a few months back absolutely trump was ordained by god to be our king right now and that is
[2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:35.480]  his translates all the way down to his family i got all the pro all the prayer
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:40.520]  about hundreds of years like providence did that well i mean we went from a luciferian scumbag
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:44.680]  like obama right and hillary clinton's they're all luciferians right they're all luciferians
[2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:49.960]  you know joe biden's a pedophile known pedophile right he's been he with he went and served uh he
[2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:54.680]  did uh in 1980s he went to uh counseling for pedophilia literally we get the deliverer but do
[2:43:54.680 --> 2:43:59.560]  we accept him yeah and and now we have another one so we have big mic we have obama you got
[2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:05.800]  biden hillary you got the whole soup of luciferians directly connected to the cabal over in europe
[2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:10.040]  and to all the things that you've been doing for the last 15 to 20 years in an astounding
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:13.800]  creative by the way your greatest achievement i think just of what you did it brought me to you
[2:44:13.800 --> 2:44:19.160]  was the bill de berg thing that was just off the rictor scale that was the best best journalism
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:26.920]  i've seen ever well i appreciate the support but i my big thing is what are we supposed to do next
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:32.280]  i'm always like angry that like get out we got to get out we got to get out of our houses we got
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:37.320]  to stop being afraid we got to start trusting in trump we got to start trusting in god exactly
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:42.040]  trumps like a lion surrounded by hyenas correct and we're like going hey you want to bite that hyena
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:46.440]  and you want to know we've got to get out there and support him we got we have to and it's 100
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:52.440]  percent if we don't support him we don't vote out the like i said he just rooted out all of the deep
[2:44:52.440 --> 2:44:57.480]  staters in every state down the city thousand of them just signed the letters senator paul said
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:03.480]  saying we we support coming and don't want that's an enemy's list they just listed themselves i mean
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:08.440]  we have the hit list you know this was old russia we'd probably uh take up arms and go take care of
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:13.000]  them ourselves but this isn't the 1867s cowboy days good for good it's good for them that it
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:18.840]  isn't because a lot of them will be dead well that's the thing is they keep using our our our our
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:24.200]  culture and our chivalry as weakness against us because we don't want to be like that but
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:30.280]  they're bringing the game where we'll win that game i mean i mean i can imagine a moral man
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:34.040]  does versus an evil man i think the people in michigan already showed that they're willing to
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:39.080]  stand up with arms in fact i want to ask how did that happen without the michigan intelligence
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:43.240]  intelligence or their or their their bureau investigation understand that a bunch of people
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:49.560]  were heading down to the to the uh capital with guns to tell them that they want their state reopened
[2:45:50.680 --> 2:45:55.720]  how did that happen how did they get that far nobody asked that question well and that's the
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:46:01.880]  thing is nobody we don't want to kill anybody no no no no but when you shut economy off what
[2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:06.680]  do they think's gonna happen they're idiots i you know if they don't because the competent people
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:11.960]  in america know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich they know how to fix a carburetor
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:16.040]  they know how to plant crops they know how to go to work they know how to pay their taxes and they
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:24.840]  know how to sustain an attack the leftists have no like once you get a a patriot on the rampage
[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:31.160]  they don't stop no i mean they go on and on and on and on i don't think they realize like what
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:36.280]  they're conjuring it's it's the resilient and it's it's general flinn's uh calling card is the
[2:46:36.280 --> 2:46:40.440]  resilient patriots that's what it is and we're not going to stop i mean there's plenty there's not a
[2:46:40.440 --> 2:46:44.920]  lot of guys in tech like me that actually are christian and and and read the bible and actually
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:50.840]  believe and are born again and baptized you know almost all of them are either you know converted
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:56.040]  to muslim or they are they're part of the luciferian yeah what's up with that we're
[2:46:56.040 --> 2:47:01.560]  so many weird like you'll have like big tech gay dude who's a muslim yeah islam will kill him well
[2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:05.160]  what is that well i mean hey let's let's let's let's put the problem we're talking about you know
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:11.160]  ugly tech people let's talk about sundar how did sundar why why is roger stone sundar bachai yeah
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:18.600]  why is why is roger stone about to go to prison when when all he did was just a little bull at
[2:47:18.600 --> 2:47:24.040]  bs with the congress but sundar went in front of him and lied he said he don't track any users
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:30.360]  he lied his that's like santa claus doesn't wear a red outfit yeah exactly sundar lied
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:38.920]  Trump should ring up sundar and pardon stone immediately i agree with that so so let me ask
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:45.960]  you this the head of ip dot com when we come back what happens if the globalists win i don't do this
[2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:51.640]  to be a fear porn person they're very close to winning what happens if the average person doesn't
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:56.760]  realize how important they are and doesn't get politically active involved because you can get
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:01.400]  censored on facebook and twitter and you know all that all day long but they can't stop you going
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:07.160]  to a city council meeting or a county commissioner meeting or a state house meeting or nancy polosi
[2:48:07.160 --> 2:48:13.800]  going to some event if you simply get motivated like we did with bill clinton's a rapist remember
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:18.360]  that they were saying trump was a rapist we're like well hey you you settle rape cases if you
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:25.480]  decide to get best attack action there's nothing on earth can stop you so everybody calls me up
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:31.080]  saying jones do this jones do that i'm telling this audience of activists you are the resistance
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:39.080]  this is the end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:47.240]  of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:54.680]  because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children
[2:48:54.680 --> 2:49:00.360]  never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:05.720]  just like the history books show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:11.480]  and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their people
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:17.400]  sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:25.000]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:30.360]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:37.800]  and your prayers the united states is not communist china we don't have three million
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:43.640]  people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:50.440]  sell their organs but all over the news we see the un available indicates who mainstream corporate
[2:49:50.440 --> 2:49:56.600]  media praising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:50:01.320]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:06.520]  that and on top of it cities like san antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:17.400]  control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:23.320]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:28.920]  and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:44.840]  to defeat their operation that much quicker you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:04.840]  rich grandville is our guest yippie dot com he's the head of it john rubber force come up about

[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:12.920]  that taking out a dem and the other one i'm working with also is chris cox for bikers for
[2:52:12.920 --> 2:52:18.440]  trump i mean he's another guy he's in uh charleston uh district one the biggest district the most
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:23.880]  populist district and anyone that's in the charleston hilton head uh mount pleasant area get out
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:29.160]  there and support chris cox get out because he needs big tech is suppressing speech because we're
[2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:35.320]  powerful yes you're 100 correct and i'm not just like oh we want to be powerful conservatives and
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:41.000]  christians we're all reserved i get it the time for being reserved is over hold on a minute when
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:45.400]  did when did being a christian man you're a pussy i don't remember i don't recall that i remember
[2:52:45.400 --> 2:52:49.400]  called christian soldiers right i don't recall that we have to get stepped on and kicked on
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:55.560]  onward christian soldiers marching into war with the cross of jesus yeah so when where does it say
[2:52:55.560 --> 2:53:00.920]  where people go all across the jesus well what are you gonna believe in folks pedophilia islam the
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:07.160]  new world order big tech god luciferianism hey what made america folks jesus did christ christ
[2:53:07.160 --> 2:53:12.680]  you better believe it so uh you know where does it say uh uh in the bible that you know we're to
[2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:18.280]  uh forgive and forget it doesn't say that we're not to forget and when well it also doesn't say
[2:53:18.280 --> 2:53:23.880]  they shall not kill it says they'll show not murder murder murder means kill an innocent person
[2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:28.040]  damn go bibles about kill people trying to kill you i think that i think there's plenty of uh
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:33.000]  well let me look look at the saven legion the greatest roman legion of all time right uh never
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:37.880]  lost the battle and went and the caesar said go kill these christians and they decided to martyr
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:43.560]  themselves so when you have the banner of christ in front of you you're unstoppable and they know
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:47.320]  that why do they fear christ so much because literally the satanists all of them fear christ
[2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:52.040]  because they're luciferians they worship this they worship the they're they they worship the
[2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:57.160]  and what i'm saying is if christ is bs then why are they so upset by it exactly well hey if they're
[2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:05.480]  following lucifer then christ must be real as well right so there's your double-edged sword and that's
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:10.360]  the way god designed it you have your choice you can go with the light or you can go with the darkness
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:17.480]  choose but you know i've had spiritual experiences i know god's real but now to see it all manifesting
[2:54:17.480 --> 2:54:23.800]  is like there's gonna be it's gonna be so clear at the end you're gonna you're gonna decide people
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:29.560]  think you're over the top i think you're right on the line you're exactly walking the line
[2:54:29.560 --> 2:54:36.120]  perfectly you are not overstating you are being honest and the true christian and i and i admire
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:41.240]  you that's what i try to do but then i'm like the truth is so fantastic although it is well i mean
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:46.360]  it it's it's not that fantastic if you have a little bit of a brain in your head and you're able
[2:54:46.360 --> 2:54:51.720]  to understand the messages i mean the revelation 12 sign happened in in september of 2017 follow
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:57.640]  the moon triads follow this so what is the left gonna do as it's like all manifesting um they're
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:02.120]  gonna do exactly what the luciferian cult wants to do they're gonna fight everything that's good
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:05.960]  and they're gonna bring darkness to the world and we all know in the end that's what's gonna happen
[2:55:05.960 --> 2:55:11.960]  right but then christ is gonna step in and with on a come down to the good news is it ends it ends
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:15.960]  and it ends good for those who believe it's gonna end great and for those who don't well you know
[2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:21.960]  you made your choice i don't know how you read revelation and then look at it happening and like
[2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:27.960]  not know this is like a defined transmission we're here we're i mean this is real folks this is like
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:35.880]  i and i and i agree with alex 100 percent stay right there yippie dot com we'll be right back stay
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:44.120]  with us we'll talk about what's coming next the panic that has been orchestrated by the global
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:51.000]  corporatist media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:56.200]  already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:56:03.240]  understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown
[2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:08.520]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we always said
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:13.160]  it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to
[2:56:13.160 --> 2:56:19.880]  make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember
[2:56:19.880 --> 2:56:25.560]  how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:31.240]  they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[2:56:31.240 --> 2:56:36.600]  dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:48.040]  scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening big brother mainstream media
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:56.200]  government cover-up you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com

[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:39.960]  want freedom permanent shutdown i i think we're i think this is going to be a i think there's
[2:58:39.960 --> 2:58:44.600]  another head fake coming uh you know i know from coming oh yeah phase two wave two well it's already
[2:58:44.600 --> 2:58:50.040]  started in china so that wave has already started in china uh the e is done you know ivan and i
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:55.480]  have privy to information that probably most people don't get to go here it's so there's a
[2:58:55.480 --> 2:59:00.360]  second wave coming so by the way as you know i'm not a violent person i'm not some guy that talks
[2:59:00.360 --> 2:59:07.480]  about big fancy things big tech is bigger than our government it's bigger than tech it acts as a
[2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:13.800]  government we need trump and the pentagon to take over big tech that they financed and created
[2:59:13.800 --> 2:59:18.600]  and i'm not a big government guy we're in such a crisis well they just look at this look at this
[2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:26.280]  dick this jerk i mean it needs to stop man they're in chicom coordination shutting us down
[2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:33.800]  they're gonna starve us to death i say send in the green berets i i i i'm serious we can we
[2:59:33.800 --> 2:59:40.040]  can't turn our forces on americans but what we can do is they're not americans man by birth they are
[2:59:40.040 --> 2:59:45.480]  so okay so we're gonna let them work with the chicoms and piss all of us unfortunately uh i've
[2:59:45.480 --> 2:59:49.080]  had the same conversation that's not something that we can do anything about but here's what we
[2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:53.320]  can do right here's there's something so we're just gonna let these people i have the articles
[2:59:53.320 --> 2:59:57.960]  right here they're giving our dad of china and the clintons and they're spying on americans
[2:59:57.960 --> 3:00:03.160]  they shut the economy down on purpose i mean german bombers in world war two couldn't even strike us
[3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:09.560]  they're shutting us down like bombers blowing up our power plants it's you if you knew if we nuked
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:15.960]  if let's say the russians nuked for morbid la chicago in new york it would be far less damaging
[3:00:15.960 --> 3:00:20.360]  to our economy than what just happened exactly so like we should pay the russians to do that that's
[3:00:20.360 --> 3:00:29.320]  a good idea actually can i put in place nuke that's a joke go ahead i can't handle this so i mean
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:33.240]  people need to get out and start recognizing that this this this coronavirus you got a better chance
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:37.400]  to get in the car accident dying than contracting coronavirus right this is fear no but that's what
[3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:45.000]  i'm saying is we're going into cardiac arrest we are in cardiac arrest yeah we're already there
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:49.160]  i like i said i've just i just went to five major markets and and i don't know how many i drove
[3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:55.160]  through rural areas just to survey what's going on i did it too it's bad i mean it's really really
[3:00:55.160 --> 3:00:59.560]  really bad so there's no way to sure coat this and trump's trying to open stuff up and like oh
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:06.120]  fowl she says we're all dead fowl she's been proven to be a fraud fowl she is a fraud period fowl she
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:10.760]  needs to be gone but trump is letting him do what he's got to do because he's has to have that other
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:16.120]  voice i think trump's got to play here on fowl she and i and i and i and i'm gonna say with high
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:22.520]  probability trump knows fowl she's in bed with the chinese oh of course but member two months ago
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:30.520]  we're like day 61 oh 15 days 15 freaking years brother yeah i'm with you i'm 100 i mean listen
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:35.480]  alex you you're you're on you're on point with 99 percent of what you bring to the mark to bring
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:39.720]  to the airway so you know i'm not going to bring anything that you haven't said all i'm going to
[3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:44.680]  tell people is that i'm going to give them another viewpoint from a guy who you know speaks in very
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:50.840]  big circles privately with very high power individuals we're in big trouble we got to fix it
[3:01:50.840 --> 3:01:56.760]  believe me uh believe me i'm not up here like telling trump to freaking kill these people for no
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:00.920]  reason i mean i'm not saying kill them you know what i mean like politically kill them i mean
[3:02:00.920 --> 3:02:06.280]  we're in like crashing burn stuff right now the plane is the the plane the plane is already
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.920]  crashed right not not everybody's burned up yet but the plane is already crashed okay so
[3:02:14.200 --> 3:02:19.880]  what do we the people do then you better you better you better pray you need to be pray without
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:27.000]  ceasing pray without ceasing exactly because the average person thinks oh this is like every
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:33.480]  other no no no folks it took hundreds of years to build us up to this point decades of progress has
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:43.320]  been blown up already and six seven trillion dollars of of of gdp on that evaporated new trends
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:48.120]  21 days it takes to make a trend 21 days of the greatest economy that ever was the greatest
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:53.000]  president ever we ever had has been destroyed now we have to rebuild because they told us
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:58.680]  i think that's why trump needs a level and say i believed in you you believe in me here's who the
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:03.400]  enemy is they did it and americans will totally get it and they don't care they could starve to death
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:08.120]  they'll be with trump but he's got to tell him who did it instead they're telling him oh trump did
[3:03:08.120 --> 3:03:12.600]  this trump's the reason you're going bankrupt yeah well i i you know what i i i i know a lot of
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:18.120]  dems i spoke to him i don't think anyone i'm not only only people that watch mad cow might be that
[3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:24.280]  stupid but at the end of the day um trump is gonna trump's gonna come out of this we're gonna come
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:30.120]  out of this but we're gonna need to we're gonna all gonna have to pray i agree but i'm not a vindictive
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:36.600]  person but when you're under military economic attack i want action i mean i i mean i'm not just
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:42.920]  i'm anti-police state folks but when you're under shotgun attack to wreck everybody's i mean
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:47.240]  starved to death i don't know what i'm supposed to do at this point let the us ic do their job
[3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:53.080]  and let's let general flinn is a key piece of this when when when because he saw the shotgun
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:58.600]  attack he's flinn knows where all the bodies are buried okay he knows what's going on let's let let's

[3:06:52.760 --> 3:07:00.840]  and now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet now the
[3:07:00.840 --> 3:07:07.560]  internal operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide which side you're on
[3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:14.040]  living in denial having mastocco syndrome learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery
[3:07:14.040 --> 3:07:20.280]  destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a
[3:07:20.280 --> 3:07:27.320]  physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all and we have come
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:32.360]  so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new order decided to join it out of
[3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:37.320]  fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls

[3:08:51.320 --> 3:08:58.440]  burrows this is not optional viewing this is mandatory viewing because as everybody knows
[3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:06.120]  what bill gates and his psychopathic warriors are intending is to vaccinate everybody on earth
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:11.160]  that's what they want the comments that i'm going to make on the film clips you're going to see
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:18.040]  in the next minutes here are my comments they are not part of the film that's two
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:28.920]  but you're going to see clips from the film do not go anywhere watch these clips
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:37.320]  there is no vaccine that is safe there never was there never is there never will be
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:45.880]  period i've explained this in thousands and thousands of words for the last 35 years over
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:53.480]  and over again and i will keep explaining it and we are under many guns here and one of the
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:59.880]  biggest if not the biggest is the poisonous vaccine that they are directing our way that
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:08.440]  they are trying to bring to market as we speak that's two is a film directed by brian burrows
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:14.760]  produced by polytomy which went around the country interviewing the parents and the children
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:23.720]  during vaccine damage vaccine destroyed the real story the real truth not in the labs not in the
[3:10:23.720 --> 3:10:34.360]  studies not anywhere except in reality do not leave your screen until i don't know when
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:40.840]  stay with me all right let's run clip one right now
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:48.440]  so rabbi looked like he was hit by a bus um rabbi from that moment on had a stunned look
[3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:55.960]  on his face uh if you asked or said his name he still acted deaf and and acted like he couldn't
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:11:02.120]  hear although they did have normal hearing i had it all tested but um he lost his happiness this is
[3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:09.240]  a first um first year picture first birthday three months after the shot three months after
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:18.120]  the shot they were no longer engaged in anything or anyone they lost their smiles they they just
[3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:25.400]  were um in their own little separate worlds they never held hands again they never looked at each
[3:11:25.400 --> 3:11:41.000]  other again all right that's the first clip do not try to contact me and ask me which vaccine
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:51.400]  was this i'm talking about i am talking about all vaccine all the time toxic chemical
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:59.480]  many germs laden directly injected into the body bypassing the normal channels of the immune system
[3:12:00.120 --> 3:12:08.680]  destroying live that's what i'm talking about these live destroy what you just saw
[3:12:11.240 --> 3:12:17.640]  this is not something scripted this is not something that was put together as fiction this
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:27.320]  is real this is one story among the many many many endless numbers of stories the vax two film crew
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:34.760]  have a gigantic bus they have gone around the country they have talked to people directly
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:44.520]  and they have filmed them and this is what you're seeing play clip two well colton was a
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:56.200]  13-year-old healthy strong boy he loved baseball motorcycle anything that has to do with an adrenaline
[3:12:56.200 --> 3:13:03.080]  rush he was going to go to scout camp for scout camp you have to have a physical so we went to
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:08.600]  the doctor's office and the doctor said hey he's the age that uh you should get the hpv vaccine
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:17.800]  i said okay how come well it can help prevent uh cancer uh and even if he's not promiscuous
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:23.560]  he can still give it to his wife when he gets married i said oh that sounds like a pretty good
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:32.920]  thing then so he was administered the the vaccine and um on the third round uh two weeks after he
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:38.760]  started having a really bad neck ache uh the next day he he went motorcycle riding with his dad
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:47.560]  and that day he came home he was hell starting to feel nauseous really sore neck
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:13:55.800]  he didn't feel good he went to bed and the next day i checked on him he still didn't want to get
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:14:02.840]  out of bed i just thought man you're just really weak and exhausted and uh that evening uh when he
[3:14:02.840 --> 3:14:08.920]  sat up to take a drink of water he says mom can you can you give that to me in my left hand i can't
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:14.280]  use my right arm very good it's like it's weak and he tried to lift up and all of a sudden he
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:19.800]  just flopped back and his his head just hit the pillow and i went i do you have spinal mening
[3:14:19.800 --> 3:14:25.960]  guidance you know was my first like really bad fear so my husband took him in to instacare
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:33.080]  monday morning february 17th 2014 holding his head for him because he couldn't get out of bed
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:39.800]  the paralysis just went down down down after the first four five days uh where he was completely
[3:14:39.800 --> 3:14:47.480]  paralyzed from the neck down had no movement at all well give me your eyebrow you were doing
[3:14:47.480 --> 3:14:57.640]  them better than that other night there you go show me yes show me yes show me no yeah but you
[3:14:57.640 --> 3:15:03.400]  have to have this breathing apparatus with you the whole time yeah it's like it's about 15 pounds
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:10.280]  i always have to have someone with me to carry it it's a literal volume change for him the whole
[3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:16.680]  time watching this box on his side with this hose going into his throat breathing from the
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:22.680]  and then he could speak waiting for that breath to come from that box
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:28.840]  and it was a realization that changed my life forever i remember staring at this and watching
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:40.520]  this seemed to be going and watching this box and thinking we say we got rid of the iron lung
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:48.760]  vax to the film it's not optional you have to watch it everybody has to watch it
[3:15:49.880 --> 3:15:55.560]  everybody has to sit through it it's nothing compared to the suffering of the parents
[3:15:55.560 --> 3:16:03.080]  and the children the direct effect of vaccine they may say to you the doctors oh this was a
[3:16:03.080 --> 3:16:08.440]  coincidental occurrence by magic something just fell out of the sky at the very moment
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:14.680]  we vaccinated your child a genetic this that the other thing they lie they lie they lie

[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:27.800]  what this film the faxed to is showing you directly directly this is not only something
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:32.840]  that you should watch in the privacy of your own home this is something you should get everybody to
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:42.920]  watch everybody to watch all over the world 100 times over and over because it's only by mass
[3:20:42.920 --> 3:20:52.360]  refusal to take these vaccines and especially but not exclusively when and if this gigantic
[3:20:52.360 --> 3:21:00.920]  coven 19 hoax of a poisonous vaccine comes down the pipeline at you and me and everybody else
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:08.760]  it's the same mass refusal is the only option to throw back
[3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:18.600]  what are you going to call them the psychopathic killer that's just a kind phrase
[3:21:20.440 --> 3:21:27.720]  sitting here playing clips from vax to directed by brian burrows a film
[3:21:27.720 --> 3:21:35.640]  like nobody has ever made before you're just getting hints of what's there
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:43.560]  play the next clip so she had a baseline physical but it was also the same day she
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:52.120]  got her second vaccination of garter cell the doctor detected a heart arrhythmia
[3:21:52.120 --> 3:22:01.560]  in all of her 20 years there had never been any heart arrhythmia she never had any symptoms
[3:22:01.560 --> 3:22:08.120]  or any indication of any difficulty no one in the family ever had a heart problem so we were
[3:22:08.120 --> 3:22:13.400]  really surprised i started having severe leg pain i couldn't move i couldn't get a bad bed
[3:22:13.400 --> 3:22:19.160]  cannot move my arms um my leg joints would feel like like my leg was about to come out
[3:22:19.160 --> 3:22:25.320]  and it would be in like excruciating pain moments where i couldn't move my legs she just
[3:22:25.320 --> 3:22:30.040]  matter of fact he says i can't walk i'm like what are you talking about she's like my legs don't
[3:22:30.040 --> 3:22:36.040]  work her legs in particular her really really bad her hips and her knee joints were very very
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:42.280]  painful it would be like feeling paralyzed sometimes it was one leg sometimes it was both legs and
[3:22:42.280 --> 3:22:52.840]  that was it he never regained his ability to fully walk um we would go out he he would walk
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:59.000]  very very little and i would see his legs just start to collapse like an accordion she had
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:05.560]  lost the ability to walk she couldn't see very well her vision was doubled i'm blurred she couldn't
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:14.600]  read anymore she began to regress she became like a nine-year-old child
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:22.600]  just a sample of one vaccine
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:27.000]  i don't know what can you say
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:36.280]  this is happening all over the world it's been happening all over the world for a long time
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:46.680]  obviously they cover up the damage they do everything they can they control the media
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:54.920]  they control the public health services they control the little sociopaths walking around
[3:23:54.920 --> 3:24:01.800]  with their pronouncements taking over governments locking down people preparing them for this
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:11.400]  preparing them for this a destroyed and ripped apart planet
[3:24:15.640 --> 3:24:17.080]  it's only the refusal
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:24.200]  it's only the complete refusal under any circumstances whatsoever
[3:24:26.600 --> 3:24:34.360]  to knuckle under and take these vaccines that's going to save us because the liars are going to
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:39.800]  keep lying the people who are destroying lives are just going to keep destroying the lives
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:48.840]  they don't care they make themselves blind they pretend they fake
[3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:57.960]  they construct whole structures of science to explain their mission of destruction
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:05.960]  and the doctors go along but increasingly the doctors are beginning not to go along because
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:13.560]  they're conscious are being awakened some of them were dragged along to see this film
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:22.760]  backs to and made to sit there strap yourself in buddy watch what you're doing
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:31.560]  watch the effect it really has you see that on the screen it says backs to stop what you're doing
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:37.560]  stop what you're thinking at the moment in all of the distractions that surround us
[3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:48.520]  and just focus on this okay please just slow down your dreddling enough to take in what this is about
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:53.720]  it's about
[3:25:53.720 --> 3:25:59.880]  how the ongoing destruction of human life
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:07.640]  by the next good after all the struggles and fights and we thought she was finally getting a little
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:14.280]  better she went to sleep she wasn't feeling good during the day and i went into check on her
[3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:21.160]  and she looked like she was very still she was in her bed and she had passed away and i tried to
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:30.680]  remember that she was gone i loved her so much i would have given my love to her she was such a good
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:38.600]  kid and her mom made a bad choice the last hug i gave her i was standing on the step hugging her
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:45.880]  and i wanted her to stay longer just to know mom i'm you know i want to get back to school okay i'll
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:55.880]  see you in a couple weeks um but in the interim the police came to our door one night so i said
[3:26:55.880 --> 3:27:04.200]  to them is this about my daughter and they said yes and i said was she in that accident they said no
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:11.800]  they said they found her dead in her bed at school and that they didn't know what happened
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:27.720]  and so you know i don't know if anyone's ever had somebody
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:52.680]  i think if there was one vaccine that should be eliminated out of the schedule immediately
[3:27:52.680 --> 3:27:58.280]  and there would be no absolutely no ramifications no problems with diseases cropping up and people
[3:27:58.280 --> 3:28:01.160]  dying that one that vaccine has to go
[3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:17.080]  yeah my comment they all have to go they always have had to go they always will have to go
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:25.080]  so
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:33.000]  people around the country just started showing up when the bus the backs to film

[3:31:42.360 --> 3:31:47.320]  but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning
[3:31:47.320 --> 3:31:53.560]  everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:57.720]  if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and drown
[3:31:57.720 --> 3:32:02.040]  people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen this is
[3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:07.480]  the death of the third world the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century warfare
[3:32:07.480 --> 3:32:13.000]  carried out by the globalists and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:17.640]  save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can
[3:32:17.640 --> 3:32:23.880]  dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy i know all this sounds insane when i was talking
[3:32:23.880 --> 3:32:29.880]  about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't
[3:32:29.880 --> 3:32:34.600]  the case but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:40.600]  got to stop them vitamin mineral fusion is one of our best-selling products it wasn't always that
[3:32:40.600 --> 3:32:46.280]  way we hardly ever promoted we first launched a few years ago but people slowly began to try it
[3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:51.400]  and almost everyone that orders it reorders it that's why we're offering it right now
[3:32:51.400 --> 3:32:57.960]  at info wars life dot com at 50 off even though we're about to sell out because i want people
[3:32:57.960 --> 3:33:01.960]  who've been on the fence who've heard us talk about it who've read some of the reviews to
[3:33:01.960 --> 3:33:06.200]  experience it for yourself and this is important it's not just all the key vitamins and minerals
[3:33:06.200 --> 3:33:11.960]  you need it's also got amino acids that are known to help you absorb more of this into your body
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:17.320]  and that's really important for folks that are older because a lot of people don't absorb vitamins
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:23.880]  and minerals in pill form or caplet form but they get a higher absorption rate when it's liquid
[3:33:23.880 --> 3:33:28.920]  so this powdered formula goes great into water into other juices it's good for adults it's good
[3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:34.040]  for children take advantage of this super sale that's about to end at info wars life dot com

[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:25.800]  friends said to me responsible parents think they're being responsible by vaccinating their
[3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:33.480]  children yeah because they're listening to doctors who have been brainwashed to the hill
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:42.360]  feeding them propaganda and asked as science they claim oh yes very safe very effective
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:47.400]  just watch these clips as you've been watching the clips you see how safe and effective this is
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:55.720]  pull it to the brain that's how safe that's how effective and this again
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:35:07.800]  then COVID-19 crazy bill gates oh we can end the lockdown so we have the vaccine
[3:35:08.360 --> 3:35:12.840]  he funds the world health organization he funds big media he funds everybody in site
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:18.440]  buys off half the planet with his money so that he can vaccinate every human on earth
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:27.640]  no uh uh uh vaxxed two play the next clip
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:37.080]  so tell us some your point of view well that does suck like not being able to buy sports anymore
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:45.240]  yeah because i did i did do a lot of sports he's my favorite
[3:35:49.640 --> 3:35:55.720]  you're hosting a sports team at the same time with me yeah i have to set the sideline
[3:35:56.280 --> 3:35:57.240]  to watch everybody
[3:36:00.520 --> 3:36:06.840]  getting used to it so it's not as bad anymore the one thing about colton is he does always smile
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:14.600]  and you know he's he's an awesome kid that way he doesn't complain he we're good huh
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:46.600]  so
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:37:00.600]  what do you think of that
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:08.360]  what we're faced with
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:12.360]  thousands million
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:15.400]  facing what you just saw
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:24.760]  that's the truth nothing in the medical journals is the truth nothing the doctor
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:34.200]  say is the truth nothing that the public health officers running around say is the truth
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:41.640]  they're all brainwashed well they couldn't all be lying yeah they were all lying
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:44.680]  it happens
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:54.360]  but how could they all be lying because they're all brainwashed by something called medical
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:38:05.000]  school there's another part which in backs to the film that you don't see here we don't have to quit
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:11.560]  but you see doctors doctors who have stopped vaccinating talking about their medical school
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:17.160]  training and they say well what if you know what did you learn about vaccines nothing
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:25.480]  we're told they were safe and effective we were told how to implement the recommended
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:34.520]  schedule of vaccine which when you think about it it's about as difficult as you know screwing
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:43.880]  in a light bulb but all of the training about the germs and the viruses and the bacteria and
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:49.640]  the diseases and the infection and this and that and that and that and that and how we have to stop
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:57.560]  it and whatever whatever that's the brainwashing that's the brainwashing
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:05.880]  so they ignore all the historians and the analysts who say guess what the decline of all the so-called
[3:39:05.880 --> 3:39:12.040]  infectious diseases historically happened a because of better nutrition and b because of
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:20.840]  increased sanitation and nothing to do with anything medical and nothing to do with rockfeller
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:29.080]  medicine or any other kind of medicine it had to do with improvements in basic living
[3:39:33.080 --> 3:39:36.680]  but what about all the diseases have been eliminated by vaccines because that's the
[3:39:36.680 --> 3:39:44.040]  evidence that's the proof that it works and so forth and so on no it's not let's take measles
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:49.960]  in a couple of minutes that I have remaining how do you recognize measles the spots the fever
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:56.840]  etc oh he's got measles okay where do those spots come from do you think they come from an acute
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:06.040]  inflammatory reaction of the body of the immune system to the presence of something other than
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:14.120]  the body and when that powerful powerful listen to me inflammatory reaction occurs
[3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:22.600]  that produces the spots so if you give a vaccine or we're going to eliminate
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:29.480]  basal pressure and you reduce the power of the immune system which happens when you give the
[3:40:29.480 --> 3:40:40.840]  vaccine that acute very powerful natural reflex of the body that inflammatory reaction is damp
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:47.960]  and damp and damp and below the ability to respond and so you don't see the spots and so
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:53.560]  all of the public health analysts say well we eliminated the disease no you haven't you're
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:41:03.320]  destroying the body there are no studies that are done in the mainstream believe me that are aimed
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:10.600]  at saying well in the so-called cases of people who've been inoculated against measles etc etc
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:19.320]  what is their general health from that point on who cares whether the spots have been eliminated
[3:41:19.320 --> 3:41:28.840]  that's irrelevant the so-called science you would say is a complete joke except for what
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:35.320]  you've been watching here from that's two for the last 45 minutes and that's just the beginning
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:39.720]  of what this film records and reports
[3:41:39.720 --> 3:41:51.320]  we should be thanking our lucky stars that these people have the courage to go out there and do
[3:41:51.320 --> 3:42:01.240]  this Brian Burroughs Polly Tommy all the others connected to the film you'll see them you watch
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:08.760]  this because it's going to change your life don't get back to me and say well I already knew this
[3:42:08.760 --> 3:42:14.840]  I already knew all this information there's knowing and there's knowing and there's deeper
[3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:26.200]  knowing and there's deeper knowing just watch it make other people watch it strap them down
[3:42:27.240 --> 3:42:30.120]  strap your doctor down if you have a doctor
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:39.720]  this is what they should be showing in emergency rooms and icu's the doctors and nurses day and
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:47.240]  night day and night in airports in hospitals everywhere just show this film over and over
[3:42:47.240 --> 3:42:54.280]  and over a hundred thousand times to everybody everywhere liquor stores seven elevens at three
[3:42:54.280 --> 3:43:01.800]  o'clock in the morning I don't care wherever airport train stations bus stations and the world
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:07.560]  would never be the same after that because the truth would come out the truth that is spoken
[3:43:07.560 --> 3:43:13.720]  by the parents and by the children by the people who are affected
[3:43:13.720 --> 3:43:26.920]  they're the people trust they were there are there will be there for the rest of their lives
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:29.560]  with what these vaccines have caused
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:42.760]  so yeah I know all about it okay so congratulations you get a gold star on the blackboard
[3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:49.480]  from the teacher you know all about vaccines and vaccinations you don't know this unless you've
[3:43:49.480 --> 3:43:57.080]  been there unless it happened to you or your family and in the remaining seconds here just
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:13.000]  think about what this does to rip basic families all over the world all over the world vaccinations
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:20.520]  thank you to vaccine too watch the film thank you to the infowars crew for making this possible
[3:44:20.520 --> 3:44:27.800]  so John map report see you next time
