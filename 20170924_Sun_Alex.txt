[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[00:11.520 --> 00:15.320]  You've got more NFL teams where the entire teams are refusing to even come out during
[00:15.320 --> 00:16.880]  the national anthem.
[00:16.880 --> 00:21.000]  Next level psychological warfare, I'll break it all down in the next segment as well as
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.200]  North Korea saying at the UN yesterday that they are preparing to preemptively strike
[00:26.200 --> 00:30.160]  the United States first and said it was inevitable.
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.560]  That gives Trump and anybody else that wants to attack North Korea the green light, whether
[00:34.560 --> 00:36.560]  it be Japan or South Korea.
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.520]  This is a new escalation, but here's part of my breakdown from yesterday.
[00:40.520 --> 00:45.080]  We'll come back from break and give you the rest of the story.
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.320]  There really aren't words to describe how powerful and how important this simple statement
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.840]  is that you are about to see.
[00:52.840 --> 00:59.280]  When you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, just say
[00:59.280 --> 01:08.680]  get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired, he's fired.
[01:08.680 --> 01:15.880]  Now the NFL, the players association groups, all of them are flipping out right now because
[01:15.880 --> 01:19.680]  they're part of the Hollywood, part of the globalist, part of the big media elite that's
[01:19.680 --> 01:25.200]  been bullying and pissing on the American people and telling everybody they're racist
[01:25.200 --> 01:30.880]  and telling everybody they're bad and telling them to accept globalism and socialism and
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.600]  communism and just give up all our rights or we're going to bully you and call you racist
[01:36.600 --> 01:39.240]  like Tom Brokaw called me with no evidence.
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.000]  And people, not just white folks, but everybody I know is just sick of it.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.120]  They know it's political bullying, it's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.480]  So why is this so important?
[01:49.480 --> 01:51.800]  Why am I so excited?
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.040]  Because the power of the boycott, it's why every major authoritarian system seeks to
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.440]  get rid of free market even though they know it creates wealth and invention and it's the
[02:00.440 --> 02:04.080]  best system because it's not good for elites.
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.480]  Look at North Korea, look at Venezuela, they want full control.
[02:07.480 --> 02:09.000]  They don't want you to have choices.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.680]  They don't want you to have a free market to have power through boycotts or through voting
[02:14.680 --> 02:16.320]  with your dollars.
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.760]  So Trump's saying you want to bitch a complaint and turn every NFL event into a big pity party
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.920]  and claim blacks are more oppressed than they've ever been and all this other crap when these
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.000]  are some of the most rich and powerful black folks out there, hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.600]  in many cases of peace.
[02:31.600 --> 02:35.280]  This is all George Soros funded and people are boycotting it and there's record low
[02:35.280 --> 02:38.440]  ratings and record low attendance.
[02:38.440 --> 02:42.800]  So Trump's pointing out your power and that's why even Fox News and the NFL commissioner
[02:42.800 --> 02:49.440]  are like, this is terrible, this is disrespectful, hating America and hating the flag and hijacking
[02:49.440 --> 02:53.880]  sporting events that folks just want to tune in and watch for political bullying.
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.200]  That's okay.
[02:55.200 --> 02:59.560]  But the president's saying, hey, owners, it's your company, you don't have people's political
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.480]  speeches during your event that they're paid to go play in, not give their political views.
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.800]  I mean, it's fine to get players $50,000 fines for doing ridiculous celebrations, they say,
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.000]  oh my God, put down America, work for George Soros, try to bully the country, try to pull
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  a spectacle off.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.680]  Oh, no, don't fire them and these other idiots are suing.
[03:20.680 --> 03:24.560]  Kaepernick's out on the NFL because he's a loser and had two horrible seasons.
[03:24.560 --> 03:28.360]  He's a loser, little, little titty baby.
[03:28.360 --> 03:30.080]  And that's all this stuff is.
[03:30.080 --> 03:33.800]  And so he's saying, it's okay to have America, it's okay to have our country, it's okay
[03:33.800 --> 03:39.520]  to love our nation, but they want to teach you to hate your nation and America is waking
[03:39.520 --> 03:40.520]  up from this.
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.840]  And that's why Trump's statements are so incredibly powerful, is that he's letting
[03:44.840 --> 03:50.600]  you know you have the power to stop watching this, you have the power to leave.
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.360]  They've been using sports to control people since ancient Rome and ancient Greece and
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.680]  ancient Japan.
[03:56.680 --> 03:59.960]  And so I'm against it overall because it becomes a distraction, it becomes what takes
[03:59.960 --> 04:04.080]  up most men's lives, instead of being fathers, instead of being politically involved, instead
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.080]  of having quality time with their children and going out camping or tubing or fishing
[04:09.080 --> 04:10.080]  or hunting.
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.720]  It's all just about watching other people bloated, steroid head, drug addicts, swell
[04:15.720 --> 04:16.720]  brass.
[04:16.720 --> 04:24.440]  So I say, F the NFL, F the globalist, I'm so glad the thug, punk, politico, chairman
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.520]  of the NFL, the NFL commissioner has come out and slapped America in the face and said,
[04:29.520 --> 04:36.000]  we're bad for not wanting to watch them wipe their asses with the American flag every time.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.600]  And so they just picked a fight with the president and the American people, they're gonna lose
[04:40.600 --> 04:43.640]  just like mainstream media is collapsing, just like Hollywood's collapsing.
[04:43.640 --> 04:46.320]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the whole thing is collapsing.
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.160]  When you think NFL, think dirt bag, Hollywood.
[04:49.160 --> 04:56.400]  When you think MSNBC think Hollywood disconnected, arrogant elites that openly hate you.

[06:18.400 --> 06:39.440]  Star-spangled banner, flutters in the wind, and it's got Hollywood and the NFL and all
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.840]  the other people that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars a piece really pissed
[06:43.840 --> 06:49.320]  and butthurt because their religion is hating America.
[06:49.320 --> 06:56.320]  The last month I've seen countless so-called Hollywood stars.
[06:56.320 --> 07:02.960]  They'll call a dog catcher in LA a star, they'll call LeBron James a superstar, he's a super
[07:02.960 --> 07:11.600]  punk, out calling our president a bum, another narcissistic mental patient calling himself
[07:11.600 --> 07:20.400]  the Lord and all this other crap, big tattoos all over him, how he's God, what a sick joke.
[07:20.400 --> 07:28.640]  And I am so pleased to see record low viewership for the NBA as well as the National Basketball
[07:28.640 --> 07:36.240]  League, the NFL, the National Baseball League, you name it because these are nothing but
[07:36.240 --> 07:46.520]  paid shills of the very same criminal dirtbag combine that owns Hollywood and their power
[07:46.520 --> 07:52.560]  is waning and they know they don't have that firm grip around America's neck anymore and
[07:52.560 --> 07:59.200]  they push total race war funded by that piece of garbage George Soros and that hadn't worked
[07:59.200 --> 08:02.800]  so they're going full tilt right now.
[08:02.800 --> 08:10.600]  They are balls to the walls in an attempt to bully us back into submission or if you
[08:10.600 --> 08:16.160]  know the famous saying love it or leave it and I know the American flags been used for
[08:16.160 --> 08:23.200]  some wars that were wrong and has been used for even globalist operations but now the
[08:23.200 --> 08:28.480]  very globalist themselves are trying to get rid of the American flag and the bill of rights
[08:28.480 --> 08:34.720]  and constitution so we hate our own culture and accept globalism that is designed to be
[08:34.720 --> 08:36.560]  evil.
[08:36.560 --> 08:41.160]  America was the idea of freedom and just that idea changed the world.
[08:41.160 --> 08:43.840]  We were exceptional.
[08:43.840 --> 08:46.520]  We did produce the greatest freedom.
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.600]  We did develop the ideas of the West and science and technology and open free societies, something
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.640]  nobody else did and now the globalists use our strength, our goodness, our altruism,
[08:57.640 --> 09:03.480]  our openness against us knowing we have a conscience to bully us into submission, to
[09:03.480 --> 09:09.760]  blackmail us, to attack us until there's no end to what we won't give into once we start
[09:09.760 --> 09:16.640]  bowing, once we start stepping, once we start fetching, when they say jump we say how high
[09:16.640 --> 09:27.480]  and all these controlled, I'm not going to say a cuss word, all of these idiots that
[09:27.480 --> 09:37.280]  are dominating and controlling the airwaves with their America hate garbage are 110 percent
[09:37.280 --> 09:46.320]  bought and paid for and it just shows you how desperate they are to maintain control
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.760]  over the American people and it shows how brazen they are to not think this wouldn't
[09:51.760 --> 10:02.160]  back up into a blowback and blow up in their face.
[10:02.160 --> 10:11.080]  It's so incredible though that to a man as of this live broadcast at 410 central, there
[10:11.080 --> 10:18.760]  isn't one, there isn't two, there isn't three, there isn't four, there's at least five teams
[10:18.760 --> 10:23.560]  where everyone took a knee or locked arms and refused to put their hand over their heart
[10:23.560 --> 10:33.440]  or stayed in their locker rooms and NFL owners coming out to the president and saying we're
[10:33.440 --> 10:41.120]  not going to be bullied by you, we're going to stand strong against racism.
[10:41.120 --> 10:49.600]  So notice now racism is the American flag, all evil in the world is personified by it
[10:49.600 --> 10:57.360]  and you get all these spoiled rotten little brats coddled, getting out there with their
[10:57.360 --> 11:03.280]  sports managers and the coaches and all these other politically correct cowards could grandstand
[11:03.280 --> 11:09.800]  and bitch at the country that produced the game and has the fans and the people and the
[11:09.800 --> 11:18.400]  system to pay them on average five million dollars a year.
[11:18.400 --> 11:25.320]  Some people paid twenty million dollars a year, some people like that loser Kaepernick
[11:25.320 --> 11:31.600]  is worth hundreds of millions of dollars but it gets worse and we have the video of this
[11:31.600 --> 11:41.360]  up on infowars.com, Fox News has it, NFL players kneel during Anthem but it gets better in
[11:41.360 --> 11:48.840]  an exhibition game but stand for God save the queen in London, they would stand and
[11:48.840 --> 11:52.560]  put their hands on their hearts even though you're not supposed to do that when you're
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.360]  in somebody else's country, you're supposed to stand for their Anthem like at the Olympics
[11:57.360 --> 12:02.040]  but if it's not your country you don't put your hand over your heart but they stood
[12:02.040 --> 12:08.840]  and had no etiquette, no mind, no nothing and put their hands on their hearts for God
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.840]  save the queen.
[12:11.840 --> 12:28.840]  So the players all kneeled or locked arms, a bunch of spoiled, roid head, brat babies
[12:28.840 --> 12:32.560]  but then oh God save the queen, let's be politically correct that's another country
[12:32.560 --> 12:38.840]  and at the end you see them stand up as they play the God save the queen, keep it rolling.
[12:38.840 --> 12:54.040]  Several more, it's the entire team kneeling down, the coaches all the cowards bullied
[12:54.040 --> 13:01.720]  by MSM and the owners have said do this, they're part of the Hollywood elite that wants to
[13:01.720 --> 13:14.360]  break the American people's will in massive peer pressure, we're going to hit pause there,
[13:14.360 --> 13:20.040]  go to the game when they go to the God save the queen, they start God save the queen and
[13:20.040 --> 13:26.640]  you see them as we analyze this NFL garbage here for fair use because they'll try to claim
[13:26.640 --> 13:32.880]  all copyright you're showing the NFL, yes we're showing the enemy of America, NFL equals
[13:32.880 --> 13:43.200]  Hollywood, NFL equals Madonna, NFL equals Hillary, NFL equals ISIS, NFL equals everything
[13:43.200 --> 13:50.480]  that hates America, the NFL is a disgusting spoiled rotten group from the degenerate owners
[13:50.480 --> 13:56.360]  to the coaches to the players to all the filth that watches it and loves it and gives away
[13:56.360 --> 14:02.520]  their life watching a bunch of narcissistic drug addict steroid heads just like you all
[14:02.520 --> 14:10.320]  worship Lance Armstrong, what a disgusting, filthy, degenerate, pathetic, mindless excuse
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.640]  and you know what I love, I told you 20 years ago the NFL was pure propaganda, now it's
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.880]  all anti-gun, all anti-family, all anti-Christian with the ads, they want to accept ads that
[14:19.880 --> 14:28.680]  aren't and it's all just a weapon to destroy this country, Hollywood, MSNBC, CBS, ABC,
[14:28.680 --> 14:38.440]  the sports shows, all of it is just force fed garbage and it's all going straight down
[14:38.440 --> 14:43.360]  in the ratings while the UFC it just doesn't get political, it's going straight up, people
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.680]  are sick of the lecturing, they've developed allergies to it but oh the NFL and it's big
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.640]  Hollywood owners, they don't know what to do, America's pulling free of their bullying,
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.560]  pulling free of their control, they don't know what to do, so what are they going to
[14:57.560 --> 15:02.560]  do, they're going to double and triple down, here's the article, see the full video up
[15:02.560 --> 15:09.880]  on infowars.com, NFL players kneel during the national anthem but stand for God save
[15:09.880 --> 15:20.840]  the queen, we had a war 245 years ago with her great great great great great great great
[15:20.840 --> 15:29.800]  great granddaddy, to start this country and the song is about the British bombarding our
[15:29.800 --> 15:36.840]  bases and hitting forts with 100 plus ships cannons through the night and the base didn't
[15:36.840 --> 15:41.400]  give up and thank God when they got up in the morning the flag was shot to hell but it was
[15:41.400 --> 15:49.080]  still there and so the pure satanic desecration in the UK to worship the whore clean and piss
[15:49.080 --> 15:54.640]  all over the red white and blue, the NFL's committed suicide, I love it.
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.720]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature
[16:03.720 --> 16:09.400]  to detoxify the body, that's why I'm introducing z shield, toxic metal and chemical defense

[18:56.200 --> 19:00.080]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[19:00.080 --> 19:04.680]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children, the artificial particulates

[20:05.920 --> 20:12.520]  During this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government
[20:12.520 --> 20:16.520]  is the problem.
[20:16.520 --> 20:21.640]  From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be
[20:21.640 --> 20:28.880]  managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for,
[20:28.880 --> 20:32.240]  by and of the people.
[20:32.240 --> 20:42.440]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[20:42.440 --> 21:00.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, there is supposedly nothing in this country,
[21:00.080 --> 21:05.560]  more Americana than the national football league.
[21:05.560 --> 21:14.000]  The old saying is as American as mom, baseball and apple pie, but baseball is faded and it's
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.840]  now as American as mom, football and apple pie.
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.240]  But you know, I always said mom isn't American, mom's just mom.
[21:25.240 --> 21:29.360]  There's moms all over the world, there's dads and they're great people.
[21:29.360 --> 21:35.320]  And baseball and football isn't America, and apple pie isn't America.
[21:35.320 --> 21:39.840]  America's the bill of rights, the constitution, due process, the common person being able
[21:39.840 --> 21:45.400]  to go out and open a business without a bunch of regulations, it's the renaissance.
[21:45.400 --> 21:50.560]  It's the flower of western culture and society.
[21:50.560 --> 22:01.880]  And ladies and gentlemen, as we all fell asleep watching the false America that was the NFL,
[22:01.880 --> 22:11.560]  they slowly removed more and more of the Americana symbols, the logos, the signets, the standards,
[22:11.560 --> 22:15.520]  the iconography.
[22:15.520 --> 22:22.280]  And under Obama, it's gone from one person kneeling to 10 people kneeling to now every
[22:22.280 --> 22:31.160]  major team that played today, every player, but one, and that's what is just coming up,
[22:31.160 --> 22:35.800]  kneeled or put their hands together and the coaches and the assistants and all of them
[22:35.800 --> 22:46.520]  did it in a giant act of evil, because the owners said do it, the head of the NFL came
[22:46.520 --> 22:55.240]  out against the president last night and said you disrespect the NFL, Trump said you're
[22:55.240 --> 23:01.600]  disrespecting America and they said buddy, that's gone, that's bad, that's evil.
[23:01.600 --> 23:08.880]  What matters is the NFL and you disrespected us, that's a quote, and so they ordered their
[23:08.880 --> 23:13.840]  little paid Royd heads, they're arrogant, I mean I've been around a lot of Hollywood
[23:13.840 --> 23:17.640]  stars and they're arrogant douchebags, let me tell you, NFL football players on average
[23:17.640 --> 23:25.440]  are the most trashy, narcissistic, arrogant, stupid idiots waiting to have their heart
[23:25.440 --> 23:32.160]  attacks at age 50 and die on average, they're losers, they're drug addicts, they're failures,
[23:32.160 --> 23:39.480]  they're the most un-American trash on earth as I've always told you, it's not the Tom
[23:39.480 --> 23:46.000]  Landry that my grandfather played football with at UT or the Tom Landry that went to
[23:46.000 --> 23:51.600]  the Army Air Corps just like my grandpa did, now those were Americans, these modern football
[23:51.600 --> 23:56.680]  players are the scum of the earth, whether they be black or white, doesn't matter who
[23:56.680 --> 24:05.440]  they are, they're snot-nosed punks on average making five million dollars a year, living
[24:05.440 --> 24:11.080]  like kings and they're pissed at America and then they go to England for an exhibition
[24:11.080 --> 24:21.400]  game, footage is on Fox News, it's on infowars.com, the Baltimore Ravens, the Jacksonville Jaguars
[24:21.400 --> 24:30.080]  in a London exhibition game, kneeled for that, we just played it earlier and then stood
[24:30.080 --> 24:39.760]  and rose for God Save the Queen when the Star-Spangled Banner is a song about a base in a real war
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.440]  on the East Coast under bombardment by more than a hundred ships in memory serves, pull
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.920]  me up the story of the Star-Spangled Banner, I'll get the folks, I know it's a whole fleet
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.760]  of British ships lined up and hammered that fort all night long and not only did the fort
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.960]  stand in the morning, the flag was still up there and it was miraculous because nobody
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.640]  had ever seen anything like that, those were hardened troops in that base who'd already
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.640]  been to the French and Indian war and a bunch of other wars and they'd seen nothing like
[25:08.640 --> 25:19.600]  it because most of the fort had collapsed, a big concrete fort, imagine the desecration,
[25:19.600 --> 25:27.280]  imagine the arrogance, imagine they get huge fines if somebody spikes a football or does
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.040]  whatever but oh you want to go piss on America, oh it's just your protest and then the president
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.120]  has his speech and he says you're disrespecting America, he's not stopping your speech, he's
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.680]  saying you're disrespecting America and that's a private team and you work for that team
[25:42.680 --> 25:47.240]  and if you want to do that on the job in front of the fans and split this cut around the
[25:47.240 --> 25:54.840]  middle that's fine, you go do it, you're fired and the response was owners across the board
[25:54.840 --> 26:01.560]  except the patriots of course, it's figure it, it's just art imitates life doesn't it,
[26:01.560 --> 26:10.160]  start typal, they think they can break your will but they're just like Hollywood, just
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.160]  like they took over all the late night comedy shows, made them political, they've taken
[26:13.160 --> 26:16.840]  all over the news shows, made them political, all the big HBO shows, made them political,
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.280]  they've made everything political now in an attempt to create a false reality to force
[26:21.280 --> 26:27.800]  you in to a matrix but it's not working and we reject all the spoiled rotten thugs like
[26:27.800 --> 26:34.120]  Kaepernick and others with pleasure, the NFL the last four years of this has seen a decline
[26:34.120 --> 26:42.040]  on average of half of their ratings on pre-playoff games and something like 25% on playoffs, the
[26:42.040 --> 26:48.800]  Super Bowl's down, their advertising's down and people in the seats are down and I love
[26:48.800 --> 26:55.200]  it, just keep showing us how much you hate this country because the old saying is if
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.280]  you love England so much, which I'm not against England, but get your ass over there and if
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.880]  you love North Korea so much as we have Bill Maher and all these Hollywood people praising
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.560]  him and saying please come be our president, oh what come put everybody in slave dungeons,
[27:09.560 --> 27:15.600]  have forced labor camps, I mean they're actually promoting Kim Jong-un over Trump, so we're
[27:15.600 --> 27:23.160]  going to go out to break with something really beautiful from 1991, Whitney Houston, beautiful
[27:23.160 --> 27:32.240]  voice, beautiful soul, imagine how far we've come since 1991, 25 years ago, 26 years ago,
[27:32.240 --> 28:01.240]  imagine how far we've fallen, this is dirty and bad in America, here it is.
[28:01.240 --> 28:24.080]  oh
[28:24.080 --> 28:44.640]  But if they had their way, they'd just band it all together.
[28:44.640 --> 28:48.920]  The truth through the night that our flag was still there, and the Republic is still
[28:48.920 --> 28:51.960]  here and is awakening, and that's why the globalists are panicking.
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.560]  December 23rd, 1776.
[28:57.560 --> 29:00.080]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[29:00.080 --> 29:04.280]  The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel in this crisis shrink from the service
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.560]  of their country, but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and
[29:09.560 --> 29:10.560]  woman.
[29:10.560 --> 29:14.600]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that
[29:14.600 --> 29:17.600]  the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.560]  When we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly, it is dearness only that gives everything
[29:22.560 --> 29:23.560]  its value.
[29:23.560 --> 29:28.320]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.160]  if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[29:32.160 --> 29:36.920]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only
[29:36.920 --> 29:43.240]  to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever, and if being bound in that matter is not slavery,
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.960]  then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth.
[29:45.960 --> 29:52.680]  When the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God, Thomas Paine,
[29:52.680 --> 29:54.800]  the American Crisis.

[31:05.160 --> 31:09.200]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[31:09.200 --> 31:13.560]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[31:13.560 --> 31:18.880]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[31:56.280 --> 32:01.280]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information, and in the
[32:01.280 --> 32:05.840]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[32:05.840 --> 32:11.360]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[32:11.360 --> 32:17.160]  had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[32:17.160 --> 32:22.480]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing, and so I set out to develop
[32:22.480 --> 32:29.000]  caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.680]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[32:34.680 --> 32:39.680]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results, and we're expanding
[32:39.680 --> 32:45.320]  in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.

[32:50.320 --> 33:19.960]  at InfoWarsLife.com, or by calling toll-free, CRIPLE-A2533139.
[33:20.320 --> 33:29.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[33:29.640 --> 33:36.640]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.640 --> 33:41.160]  I've always been honest with our listeners, I've always been honest with the deep state,
[33:41.160 --> 33:48.040]  who I know has actually a lot of good people in it, the Pentagon, Special Forces, Command,
[33:48.040 --> 33:53.160]  JSOC, all the different groups, that globalism means the death of prosperity, the death of
[33:53.160 --> 33:59.120]  freedom, and a really, really horrible system of oppression for everybody.
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.320]  And so as we approach this world government, you're going to have a chance to decide which
[34:03.320 --> 34:05.240]  side you're on.
[34:05.240 --> 34:10.040]  And if I would have told listeners, which I did 20 years ago, that there'd be a time
[34:10.040 --> 34:14.440]  when they were protesting the National Anthem and claiming America was racist and evil and
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.400]  should be overthrown and should be merged into an unelected private corporate world
[34:18.400 --> 34:22.320]  government, people would tell me that I was crazy.
[34:22.320 --> 34:24.320]  But why didn't I still tell them?
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.080]  Because I knew they would remember, and when it came true, then they would remember and
[34:30.080 --> 34:32.760]  then I would have the credibility.
[34:32.760 --> 34:37.920]  And that's why InfoWars has so much credibility right now, is because we've been telling
[34:37.920 --> 34:42.800]  it like it is and laying out the hard facts way before others will do it, because we're
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.800]  willing to be criticized up front.
[34:46.800 --> 34:51.440]  And not because we're heroes, but because we understand going along, playing it safe
[34:51.440 --> 34:57.360]  is what gets countries and civilizations totally and completely enslaved.
[34:57.360 --> 35:01.760]  There's a dramatic story, and there's video of this.
[35:01.760 --> 35:09.680]  It's up on newswars.com and infowars.com right now with the Steelers and the Bears, the Pittsburgh
[35:09.680 --> 35:16.960]  Steelers and the Chicago Bears, and both teams refused to have their people come out on the
[35:16.960 --> 35:17.960]  field.
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.800]  Same thing with the Seahawks and the Titans, and a bunch of other teams.
[35:21.800 --> 35:23.640]  This is just incredible.
[35:23.640 --> 35:33.360]  And one player who's an Army veteran, Alejandro Villanueva, is that correct?
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.040]  I finally got a name right, great.
[35:36.040 --> 35:42.280]  That patriot, he refused, despite all of the team pressure and the owner's pressure and
[35:42.280 --> 35:48.840]  all the cowardly coaches and all the other scum, he refused to be part of it.
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.320]  It was the Steelers that did it, to be clear, the Bears didn't.
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.400]  It was the Seahawks and the Titans all remained.
[35:55.400 --> 35:58.080]  It was the Steelers, very, very shameful.
[35:58.080 --> 36:00.640]  And he refused to be part of it, despite all that.
[36:00.640 --> 36:04.200]  And again, I get, hey, we're a free country, you don't have to go put your hand over your
[36:04.200 --> 36:05.520]  heart for the national anthem.
[36:05.520 --> 36:07.120]  I know America's not perfect.
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.480]  The point is, why now?
[36:08.480 --> 36:09.960]  Why are they hyping this all?
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.480]  Why are they pushing this?
[36:11.480 --> 36:13.560]  And it's very simple.
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.680]  It's globalism.
[36:18.680 --> 36:22.800]  Globalism, they've announced in the EU, I saw this 10 years ago in the BBC, they reported
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.600]  it with a straight face, oh, teams having national names is too nationalistic and causes
[36:28.600 --> 36:29.720]  racism.
[36:29.720 --> 36:36.240]  So the EU is recommending that all national teams, for things like football, soccer and
[36:36.240 --> 36:43.080]  other sports, no longer have names like the Spanish team or the French team or the Greek
[36:43.080 --> 36:44.080]  team.
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.960]  And then this year, they're announcing that that's just the way it is and the EU is ordering
[36:49.960 --> 36:52.200]  the teams to change their names.
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.200]  Because so you can't have any pride to have a Spanish team or the German team or the Dutch
[36:58.200 --> 37:03.360]  team or the Nigerian team or the Mexican team.
[37:03.360 --> 37:10.560]  That's where globalism is moving, where even countries are dirty words.
[37:10.560 --> 37:13.280]  And then what do we trade out once we get rid of our countries?
[37:13.280 --> 37:20.240]  Our vote, having some say, not that it's perfect, having some culture, now it's just some multinational
[37:20.240 --> 37:28.720]  secret TPP runs things and is exempt from taxes and regulations.
[37:28.720 --> 37:36.800]  And now, take a stand, not a knee has started a hashtag, and one of the big non-provisant
[37:36.800 --> 37:41.200]  supports Trump is coming out and the battles join folks, say what you want about Trump.
[37:41.200 --> 37:47.960]  He understands if we don't have a country and we don't have sovereignty and we don't
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.960]  have a basic culture that's Americana, low taxes, private property, right to practice
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.440]  religion or not, then we're not America.
[37:55.440 --> 37:57.000]  That's what made it special.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.480]  And they've got a big left-wing attack on Trump going with hashtags and stuff that,
[38:01.480 --> 38:07.600]  oh, look, he betrayed conservatives because he said that he's going to try to rework DACA
[38:07.600 --> 38:10.960]  where people that have been here decades and do have jobs and do have degrees and who
[38:10.960 --> 38:13.720]  aren't criminals to get a green card and stay.
[38:13.720 --> 38:15.960]  That's what he said during the campaign.
[38:15.960 --> 38:19.160]  The media misrepresented what Trump said he was going to do.
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.520]  He said, I'm going to kill DACA because Obama just signed it.
[38:22.520 --> 38:23.520]  You can't do that.
[38:23.520 --> 38:27.520]  And I'm going to send it back to Congress and if we can get a bill where people that
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.640]  aren't criminals who have it committed other crimes other than being brought here when
[38:31.640 --> 38:33.800]  they're little kids, then you can stay.
[38:33.800 --> 38:34.800]  He always said that.
[38:34.800 --> 38:36.560]  I always told you he was going to say that.
[38:36.560 --> 38:39.200]  People go, oh, Alex, you sold out.
[38:39.200 --> 38:40.200]  So it's Trump bull.
[38:40.200 --> 38:41.200]  He killed TPP.
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.720]  He killed the carbon tax, 69% reduction in illegals coming across the border.
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.720]  It's on and on and on.
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.400]  The globalists all hating the corrupt Vatican, the corrupt Saudi Arabians, the corrupt EU,
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.320]  corrupt Hollywood, the corrupt NFL, hell, every group you can imagine, the big telecoms,
[38:56.320 --> 39:03.840]  the big mega massive Googles and Facebooks that own slave factories that have monopolies.
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.680]  Every stinking criminal group is against the president and you can't obviously see what's
[39:09.680 --> 39:16.000]  going on and then a bunch of overpaid, spoiled, rotten, drug addict babies.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.480]  Oh yeah, the NFL, they're on cocaine.
[39:18.480 --> 39:19.480]  You name it.
[39:19.480 --> 39:28.040]  Not just steroids, drugs, just a filthy, disgusting, anti-American group of scum.
[39:28.040 --> 39:33.320]  You know, when they're not having torturing dogs to death or beating hookers up or snorting
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.720]  cocaine and shooting up heroin, they're out there bitching that they're in America and
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.000]  they've only got $200 million in the bank.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Oh, and I love it.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.640]  The National Baseball League has had some idiot come out and kneel.
[39:45.640 --> 39:48.800]  That's going to cause the chain reaction as they make him a superstar.
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.000]  Good, dive in faster baseball, dive in faster football, because you've all been in postures
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.520]  in the last hundred years convincing America that you were America.
[39:59.520 --> 40:01.520]  Lewis and Clark were America.
[40:01.520 --> 40:04.920]  George Washington was America.
[40:04.920 --> 40:08.240]  The first people to go into space were America.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.240]  They were human beings.
[40:09.240 --> 40:10.800]  He was like the first person in space was a Russian.
[40:10.800 --> 40:16.560]  It's all part of invention and science and technology, not watching a bunch of spoiled
[40:16.560 --> 40:20.840]  brats and simulated combat, fighting with each other.
[40:20.840 --> 40:27.720]  Who was the lady that was always flying around the world and ended up disappearing?
[40:27.720 --> 40:28.720]  Amelia Earhart.
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.840]  She's America.
[40:29.840 --> 40:34.000]  Or George Washington Carver and all his inventions was America.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.000]  Or just anybody that strives and builds and stands up for independent success.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.640]  Anybody, no matter what color you are or where you came from, you become an American and
[40:44.640 --> 40:50.200]  you're successful with your family, your life, or literature, or art, or inventions, whatever
[40:50.200 --> 40:51.200]  it is.
[40:51.200 --> 40:52.560]  You're an American.
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.720]  You come here to be left alone to be able to do it, not have some big political correct
[40:56.720 --> 40:59.400]  government telling you how to live your life.
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.760]  So I'm so angry today I can hardly even do the show because I read these headlines and
[41:05.760 --> 41:14.720]  I watch the videos and it says Seahawks Titans Remain in Locker Room for Anthem to Protest
[41:14.720 --> 41:15.720]  Injustice.
[41:15.720 --> 41:22.160]  Injustice, we've got the lowest level of injustice of any major country in the world.
[41:22.160 --> 41:23.640]  Good God.
[41:23.640 --> 41:29.000]  NFL players kneel during Anthem stand for God Save the Queen.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.520]  The imagery of that is just incredible.
[41:32.520 --> 41:38.480]  Steelers stay in locker room during National Anthem as 100 NFL players protest.
[41:38.480 --> 41:40.080]  And then meanwhile, oh, where are they?
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.600]  How about they take a knee until America does something about making women wear the hijab
[41:44.600 --> 41:47.440]  or sexual mutilation going on in America and all over the world?
[41:47.440 --> 41:48.440]  Oh, no, no.
[41:48.440 --> 41:50.120]  You wouldn't take a knee for anything real.
[41:50.120 --> 41:56.640]  Just the big corrupt, scared little politically correct team owners that get together with
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.520]  Homeland Security with Obama and decide to run this whole race war narrative to use the
[42:01.520 --> 42:02.520]  NFL to take control.
[42:02.520 --> 42:09.040]  If you watch the NFL ads, the stuff the NFL host push, the anti-gun garbage, the anti-parent
[42:09.040 --> 42:10.040]  garbage.
[42:10.040 --> 42:13.280]  Remember a few father's days, they had a bunch of ads they allowed to run.
[42:13.280 --> 42:15.880]  Every ad was anti-father, how you don't need a father.
[42:15.880 --> 42:20.480]  I mean, this is the enemy of the country because it's the perfect Trojan horse.
[42:20.480 --> 42:22.760]  It's the NFL.
[42:22.760 --> 42:28.120]  The NFL in national sports is the perfect Trojan horse that they wrap up as America
[42:28.120 --> 42:34.520]  to then actually be the poison pill we eat, thinking it's good food, a nice piece of chocolate
[42:34.520 --> 42:41.160]  cake, a nice piece of strawberry cake, and it's poison, unbelievable.
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.080]  So a Democrat Congresswoman called for all NFL players to kneel on Sunday while it basically
[42:45.080 --> 42:47.440]  happened against white supremacy.
[42:47.440 --> 42:48.440]  Yeah.
[42:48.440 --> 42:52.320]  Man, I tell you, NFL, it's good to watch you destroy yourselves.
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.320]  Good job, scum.

[46:54.600 --> 47:16.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.400]  Well, no fans left, that's what the NFL stands for, and look, I played football, I was okay
[47:28.400 --> 47:34.720]  at it, but I did sit there in high school and watch people worship folks that were on
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.520]  the football team, and I thought it was just stupid, so I quit playing football even though
[47:39.520 --> 47:40.520]  I was doing okay at it.
[47:40.520 --> 47:41.520]  I just thought it was sick.
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.240]  It's kind of like all these folks that set up these little charity events, they'll have
[47:45.240 --> 47:48.840]  some celebrity at it, everybody dresses up and feels like they're a celebrity, and you
[47:48.840 --> 47:51.640]  can even pay folks come out with paparazzi and take photos of these.
[47:51.640 --> 47:52.640]  You can feel like you're paparazzi.
[47:52.640 --> 47:55.400]  I mean, Hollywood's collapsed.
[47:55.400 --> 48:01.640]  The whole celebrity system is a joke that was artificially created by Edward Bernays,
[48:01.640 --> 48:06.200]  the father of modern propaganda, to screw the public up.
[48:06.200 --> 48:11.640]  The American system was about admiring the common hard work in person.
[48:11.640 --> 48:17.280]  The striver, the builder, and those that went up against the system.
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.320]  That's what America's about, not worshiping George Clooney and Hillary Clinton and Michael
[48:22.320 --> 48:24.640]  Moore and all these dirtbags.
[48:24.640 --> 48:29.960]  So I've gotten so angry that I've hardly been able to even do the broadcast there, because
[48:29.960 --> 48:35.120]  I mean, let me tell you, when you get two NFL teams to go to an exhibition game in London,
[48:35.120 --> 48:40.040]  and they won't stand for the Star Spangled Banner, but they stand for God Save the Queen,
[48:40.040 --> 48:51.840]  the song is about a war with the British Empire, right at the start of the war, in 1776.
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.400]  And then I think about how different America has been, how good it's been compared to other
[48:56.400 --> 48:59.480]  systems, and the globalists have already taken the world over, they've already taken
[48:59.480 --> 49:02.520]  over the Internet, they've already taken over everything, and the last thing I do is just
[49:02.520 --> 49:04.120]  get America out of the way.
[49:04.120 --> 49:07.440]  They've already used the U.S. to help build their system, and they want to flush it, and
[49:07.440 --> 49:11.560]  Trump comes along and says, no, and then they've got Bill Maher, in fact, let's play that
[49:11.560 --> 49:12.560]  clip next.
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.800]  Then I'll play Trump, the evil that he said that's got the player saying, yow, dare, he
[49:17.800 --> 49:20.560]  goes, you're disrespecting America.
[49:20.560 --> 49:22.760]  So I say, I'm not going to watch you.
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.000]  Well, you disrespect us, and they all then are buttered, how dare you speak back to us
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.360]  when people pay all this money to go to a football game that we all grandstand, because
[49:31.360 --> 49:37.600]  we're only making $15 million a year, and we're all oppressed, and we only get 20 steroid
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.800]  shots a week, and we only live in $50 million houses and have helicopters, and screw you,
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.680]  middle America, and screw you, white people that pay our salaries and voted for Obama,
[49:47.680 --> 49:50.480]  you're all scum, we hate you.
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.400]  That's the quotes here by Democrat Congresswoman, that it's white supremacy, kneel against
[49:55.400 --> 49:56.400]  it.
[49:56.400 --> 49:57.400]  What?
[49:57.400 --> 49:58.400]  I get it.
[49:58.400 --> 49:59.400]  America's so bad.
[49:59.400 --> 50:00.920]  Go to North Korea.
[50:00.920 --> 50:02.680]  Go to Venezuela.
[50:02.680 --> 50:03.680]  Just get out.
[50:03.680 --> 50:04.680]  No, no.
[50:04.680 --> 50:05.680]  You're not going to get out.
[50:05.680 --> 50:12.640]  You're going to sit here making $10, $15, $20 million a year, bitching, I get it.
[50:12.640 --> 50:17.640]  I've never seen anything like it, but it's what historians tell us when you get a decadence
[50:17.640 --> 50:24.160]  country that's been based on free market and been based on being strong, it produces children
[50:24.160 --> 50:28.960]  and grandchildren and grandchildren that are the most snot-nosed, spoiled, rotten scum,
[50:28.960 --> 50:32.080]  and they always hate their mama.
[50:32.080 --> 50:37.680]  You got the NFL players hanging off, imagine America's a bitch, a dog, okay?
[50:37.680 --> 50:42.720]  That's just a scientific name for a female dog, and you got all the NFL players fatter
[50:42.720 --> 50:45.120]  than pigs hanging off mama's breast.
[50:45.120 --> 50:51.640]  I mean, some of these puppies are bigger than mama, and they're saying, I hate this mama.
[50:51.640 --> 50:56.800]  They walk over and kick her in the nose and stomp on her tail, and mama just sits there
[50:56.800 --> 50:59.400]  and they go, mama's weak.
[50:59.400 --> 51:02.360]  Let's just go over and bite mama's ears.
[51:02.360 --> 51:03.360]  Mama just lets them.
[51:03.360 --> 51:07.320]  They say, well, we're not getting enough attention then.
[51:07.320 --> 51:13.560]  Hollywood and MSNBC tells us to get even more mad because of the undisputed racism in America.
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.600]  Yeah, 3,000 plus black shot in Chicago every year, 95% of them by blacks.
[51:18.600 --> 51:19.680]  Let's not talk about that.
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.440]  Let's just bitch and moan and complain and buy a bunch of propaganda all day and kill
[51:24.440 --> 51:25.440]  the NFL.
[51:25.440 --> 51:30.080]  Let me tell you something, within three more years, you'll have 20% of what you used to
[51:30.080 --> 51:31.080]  have.
[51:31.080 --> 51:32.080]  I love it.
[51:32.080 --> 51:35.240]  You're going to wonder why you're just like baseball or anything else.
[51:35.240 --> 51:37.480]  Just kill that sport, man.
[51:37.480 --> 51:42.760]  They're trying to use that sport because folks know that Americans love it.
[51:42.760 --> 51:47.800]  The globalists know you love the NFL, so they poison the hell out of it hoping you'll swallow
[51:47.800 --> 51:50.600]  it, but America is vomiting that crap out.
[51:50.600 --> 51:56.200]  And Stevie Wonder kneels in apparent support of peaceful protesters, oh, peaceful protesters
[51:56.200 --> 51:59.720]  that it says, bunch of hijackers.
[51:59.720 --> 52:02.640]  You are peaceful, peacefully hating America.
[52:02.640 --> 52:03.720]  We hate you.
[52:03.720 --> 52:04.720]  We get it.
[52:04.720 --> 52:05.720]  Good.
[52:05.720 --> 52:06.720]  We're not going to spend money with you.
[52:06.720 --> 52:12.760]  And you're like, oh my gosh, white supremacism, give me the money.
[52:12.760 --> 52:17.240]  So here's Bill Maher monologue talking about daughter, which means old and seen all like
[52:17.240 --> 52:20.360]  Nancy Pelosi's a daughter.
[52:20.360 --> 52:26.280]  Bill Maher monologue says Trump is a daughter and that he loved what Kim Jong-un said.
[52:26.280 --> 52:32.160]  Kim Jong-un, just since he's been in since 2009, the estimates killed three million
[52:32.160 --> 52:33.280]  of his people.
[52:33.280 --> 52:40.800]  His daddy they estimate from the time that his father died in 1994, killed something
[52:40.800 --> 52:45.120]  like 15 million, but daddy killed even more.
[52:45.120 --> 52:46.120]  But it's okay.
[52:46.120 --> 52:47.120]  It's okay.
[52:47.120 --> 52:49.360]  They don't have power in most of the country and people are slaves.
[52:49.360 --> 52:50.360]  It's not America.
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.040]  So it's sexy to love North Korea.
[52:55.040 --> 52:59.400]  It's sexy to hate America.
[52:59.400 --> 53:03.360]  That's just public executions of friends and family, but if you get into the slave camps
[53:03.360 --> 53:06.560]  and the deaths and all the unrecorded stuff, it's in the millions and the starving to death
[53:06.560 --> 53:10.200]  and cutting the food off, but it's okay.
[53:10.200 --> 53:17.720]  Even as AIDS looked like they have anorexia, but here's this little fat guy, literal vampire,
[53:17.720 --> 53:24.120]  a little tick, but doesn't matter, Bill Maher loves it because see Trump's bad because he
[53:24.120 --> 53:28.240]  got four trillion in the stock market and got the jobs up and tried to take care of
[53:28.240 --> 53:30.200]  the troops and secured the borders.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.480]  It's Trump that's bad.
[53:31.480 --> 53:35.640]  Here's Bill Maher reading off a teleprompter, another delicate genius.
[53:35.640 --> 53:43.760]  Trump and Kim Jong-un, fat man and little boy, as I said, they are stewing again and
[53:43.760 --> 53:51.920]  men, I love Kim, he called Trump a doderd, which is one of those words that people have
[53:51.920 --> 54:03.200]  stopped using like presidential, daughter, a doderd dumbass, doddering, someone doddering
[54:03.200 --> 54:04.200]  is a doderd.
[54:04.200 --> 54:09.560]  It's from Shakespeare and Mr. President, if you're watching, Shakespeare was a guy
[54:09.560 --> 54:19.880]  a long time ago, let's make everyone feel intellectual, hi, I'm Bill Maher, we've had
[54:19.880 --> 54:24.920]  all week for writers to come out with me and read off a teleprompter, and then we've got
[54:24.920 --> 54:31.280]  a studio audience that thinks I'm really cool, let me tell you about Shakespeare, he was
[54:31.280 --> 54:35.600]  a guy for open free society that would hate someone like you, Bill Maher.
[54:35.600 --> 54:46.600]  You see, because Shakespeare was somebody that wanted to renaissance, and you people
[54:46.600 --> 54:53.000]  are trying to hold one back, Donald Trump's come out and warned that Kim Jong-un won't
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.840]  be around much longer, I haven't gotten to that yet, that's coming up in the first 20
[54:56.840 --> 55:01.360]  minutes, we have a special guest joining us, North Korea says Donald Trump's rocket man
[55:01.360 --> 55:09.900]  jive means missile attacks on U.S. mainland inevitable, and U.S. B-2 bombers flew right
[55:09.900 --> 55:16.520]  across the border with North Korea and simulated nuclear attacks, but that's okay, we've got
[55:16.520 --> 55:24.560]  the NFL and Hollywood and even Fox News half the time now, all lined up threatening America
[55:24.560 --> 55:30.560]  and we've got Hollywood and the rest of them praising it and loving it, to see we've been
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.880]  the slaves of Hollywood and the slaves of the cult of the NFL and slaves to professional
[55:36.880 --> 55:42.520]  sports and slaves to this cult of personality, in North Korea they worship Kim Jong-un, here
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.680]  we worship bloated steroid head thug punks that can hardly even talk, they want a bitch
[55:47.680 --> 55:57.200]  about America but won't get the hell out of America, look at Floyd Mayweather he understands
[55:57.200 --> 56:04.240]  it, Floyd Mayweather thinks about all this NFL grandstanding, well he said it's a bunch
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.600]  of people jumped on a bandwagon to hate Trump because the establishment doesn't like him,
[56:10.600 --> 56:16.840]  never heard Trump was racist till he got into the presidency, Mayweather gets it, but all
[56:16.840 --> 56:20.960]  these other jackasses don't, all the thug players and I mean they're all thugs, the
[56:20.960 --> 56:25.440]  white ones are the worst, I've been around them, the biggest dumbest stupidest idiots
[56:25.440 --> 56:32.120]  that want to be celebrities that think they're cool, they are just a curse on this country,
[56:32.120 --> 56:41.240]  oh my, I mean NFL players are just the biggest jokes I've ever been around, they are just
[56:41.240 --> 56:51.680]  the scum of the earth and thank God they're showing their real colors against this country,
[56:51.680 --> 57:04.160]  now before I go any further, I'm just gonna spend a minute on this, because Amazon doubled
[57:04.160 --> 57:09.760]  prices during all the earthquakes and hurricanes that we've seen, now they got volcanoes going
[57:09.760 --> 57:15.360]  off in Mexico by the way, pray for those folks, we're cutting the cost of high quality

[57:49.360 --> 57:53.920]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[57:53.920 --> 57:59.440]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[57:59.440 --> 58:05.240]  had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[58:05.240 --> 58:10.560]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing and so I set out to develop
[58:10.560 --> 58:17.080]  Caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood

[59:42.800 --> 59:44.160]  War.
[59:44.160 --> 01:00:06.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, you are listening to an info wars dot com front
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:19.600]  line report, it's Alex Jones So we have North Korea threatening to preemptively
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.760]  strike the United States and now saying an attack is coming and is inevitable at the
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:31.080]  United Nations yesterday, oh yeah they were doing speeches Saturday, North Korea postponed
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:37.000]  this Friday speech, waited until Saturday and said we're going to preemptively attack you,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  it's inevitable.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  Of course the United States is going to respond to that.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.560]  That's the mental illness, the megalomania, you've been around like some guy starting
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.600]  to fight with you and you know you can kick his ass but he thinks he's invincible, kind
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.440]  of like in Monty Python the night that goes neat, even though his arms and legs are cut
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.520]  off, he still keeps marching forward and I guess they think China and Russia are going
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:04.200]  to come in on their side, I guess they think the United States will blink, just like Harry
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:11.840]  Truman did in 1953 not letting Douglas MacArthur drop atomic bombs on them but they're the
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.440]  ones starting it, they're the ones firing missiles over Japan, they're the ones putting
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.640]  this rhetoric out and then meanwhile the big story is they've gone from four or five years
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:31.280]  ago, one player, Kaepernick, Bozo the Clown, wanting to be a little movie star and wanting
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.400]  to make Hollywood like him, saying whites are racist and whites are bad and America's
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:41.200]  bad even though white saviors as he'd call them, raised him and even though he's got
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.000]  $200 million, just from the NFL I looked it up, it's like $200 million from the NFL,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.240]  made it $60 million from sponsors, I mean $260 million, this is a horrible country and
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.200]  the predominantly white fans coming and watching you play and the whites that elected Trump
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.840]  screw you racist and of course this is all meant to divide America, it's social engineering
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.720]  by the globalist to make whites racist, you know what whites are is lazy candy ass politically
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:15.440]  correct trash, there's not much worse in this country than white people who get to the other
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.200]  day, they're the ones all saying white people are the devil, they're the ones that came
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.640]  up with this race baiting to make everybody racist, I don't want to give an anti-white
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.040]  rant but if you want one I got one because I've been watching who's leading all this
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.920]  and they're a bunch of sociopaths and I'm sick of them, excuse me, let's go ahead and
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.160]  go to the president and hear this, wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:43.120]  somebody disrespects our flag, does they get that son of a bitch off the field right now
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:48.880]  get that son of a bitch off the fricking field, you can go do it outside of the street, just
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.900]  be another roid head so stupid you can't even wipe your fat ass, god I'm sick of you
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:59.720]  Phil, oh you make me want to throw up, what the hell, you got silver spoons hanging out
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:07.480]  your mouth, there's no other country like this you dumb son of a bitches, what the hell's
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.440]  your fricking problem, the globalists want to blow it up because it's got a middle class
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.720]  and once they blow up the middle class there's nothing left you dumb son of a bitch, you
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:23.400]  know, some owner's going to do that, he's going to say that guy that disrespects our
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:30.720]  flag, he's fired and that owner, they don't know it, they don't know it, their friends
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.600]  are mine many of them, they don't know it, they'll be the most popular person for a
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.480]  while, if you don't like the damn flag get out, because that's a total disrespect of
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.640]  our heritage, if I was in Mexico and they had the anthem I'd stand up for it, what is
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.520]  all this disrespect crap, I'm sick of it, if I was in Germany and they had it I'd stand
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:55.920]  up for it, we have freedoms and we have freedoms, and these are Americans pissing on it, and
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:06.280]  we have the freedom to say F you scum, we, I swear to god I'm at war with the NFL, massively,
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.680]  the NFL ratings are down massively, thank god I love it, it happens to be that they
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.600]  like watching what's happening on, oh it's true, they know there's a real war for the
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:20.040]  country now, exactly, not some simulated combat crap with a bunch of Royd heads, because you
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:26.400]  know today if you hit too hard, right, they hit too hard, 15 yards throw him out of the
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.040]  game, they had that last week, well you know why the NFL, Trump's smart here, I'm going
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.720]  to come back up and talk about this, you know why the NFL actually rolled over politically
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.280]  six years ago, because of the concussions, and they know the government's going to come
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.020]  after them if they're not political lap dogs, so that's why they sold out, they got black
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:45.480]  mailed you dumb assholes, excuse me, I'm really, folks I'm not doing that on purpose, maybe
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.560]  I shouldn't be on air right now, because I'm so pissed I can barely be on air right now.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.360]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.640]  Well political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.720]  uses to control public opinion, by controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.360]  to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.240]  also influences others in ripple effect, this is how the power elite and the government
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.720]  stay in power, they use psychological manipulation, they turn the public into obedient sheeple
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:21.520]  and over time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception, but how does political
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.800]  correctness and other deliberate deceptions work, well first the establishment saturates
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.480]  mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.160]  culture and is accepted as truth, such as global warming for example, then the establishment
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.640]  suppresses any counter arguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.920]  racists, or in the case of man made climate change, climate deniers, you can learn more
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.560]  about this tyranny over the minds of men at infoworse.com, prismplanet.tv and our YouTube

[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:20.600]  He never gives up, he's alex jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas, worldwide.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:34.480]  I'm going to go to North Korea in a moment, but let me give you the secret to why the
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:40.400]  NFL has gone from being an americana mainstay, and this country's official religion is football,
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:47.400]  but it's friday night lights, saturday night lights, sunday night lights, all of it, it
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.000]  has been turned into a political brainwashing system, where remember when hank williams
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:01.360]  jr just went on fox news and said obama was anti-american and he was fired, fired off
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:07.480]  monday night football, just like that, and that was the beginning, and once the NFL
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:14.200]  gave in to that, oh, you've got concussions from high school, from car wrecks, from college,
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:20.040]  of course, you're gladiators, that's why you're paid 20 million dollars a year.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.920]  What do you think race car drivers are?
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.440]  People know folks are risking their lives, quite friendly, that's what humans do and
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.240]  we admire that, and that's part of being human, you take that away, it's like taking
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:37.960]  gravity away, the muscles, the heart, it all falls apart, danger is the ether in which
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.600]  we swim.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:48.040]  So what happened, you go back about six years ago, they had the obama justice department
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:54.920]  circling around the NFL, because they'd been meeting with the attorney general at the time,
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.440]  who'd met with hollywood and met with the big tv producers, they met on c-span and he
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.200]  said i want you to promise to literally brainwash, this is a quote we can play the video, i want
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.960]  you to promise to brainwash the american people against guns, don't just do it once a week,
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:17.000]  do it every episode, every day, constantly, that's your directive, or we're gonna investigate
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.640]  you for fake rating scandals, we're gonna investigate you for fake ad revenue, we're
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.040]  gonna investigate you for all sorts of stuff, but as long as you play ball, we're gonna
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040]  be nice.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:32.240]  They used to send jagger hoover's people in to hollywood and they didn't do just what
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.560]  he wanted, he'd have them shut down, and that's how it began, hollywood's totally controlled,
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:44.120]  it's declassified, admit it, it is admitted that before obama left, they ordered every
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:50.200]  media outlet in the country, fiction and nonfiction, HBO, comedy central, all the nightly shows
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.040]  to attack alex jones, and that's why every program has a character that supposedly alex
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.520]  jones, the person says horrible things i never said, to demonize the straw man, that was
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:08.160]  a directive, in many cases there's even government grants to pay for it, but they didn't have
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:14.120]  the nfl, and americans were like well the owners tend to be conservative and still it's pro
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.360]  military and pro america and it was still a big corrupt spectacle, it's gotten more
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:26.000]  and more decadent and i couldn't stand it and most of you couldn't stand it, but then
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.760]  it got to a point where oh my gosh, trayvon martin, so folks are taking a knee even though
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.240]  four black witnesses said that he attacked zemberman, and i think zemberman did some
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.800]  weird stuff, i'm sure there's some white people who shoot some black folks don't deserve
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.760]  it, but zemberman doesn't look too white to me, and nine out of ten attacks on blacks
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.840]  are by blacks, it's actually like 97%, 95 in some areas, the point is those statistics
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:58.480]  are facts, and i'm sad that's happening, i go around lobbying against black abortion,
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.200]  51% of blacks never get born, i go out and protest at the abortion clinics with a bunch
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.960]  of black ladies that are going in, not because i'm some hero, i don't want to kill babies,
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.200]  i'm not doing it to virtue signal, i'm doing it because i care, because the saint evil
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.600]  force trying to kill them wants to kill me, but it doesn't mean a bunch of hyped up black
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.600]  folks taught to hate me, it doesn't mean i'm going to roll over to you and kiss your ass,
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.840]  it ain't going to happen, i'm going to straight shoot you, you're getting that straight shooting
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.040]  right now, if you want straight shooting this is the place, you want a bunch of bull, go
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:34.240]  someplace else and be an idiot, excuse me, the black people on average aren't our problems,
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.080]  let me tell you who Han shows all this political correct crap, it's white people, and they
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.920]  do it because they know the average black, hispanic or white person wants to get along
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.080]  and wants to be nice, and so they can add on to political correctness any political garbage
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:56.400]  they want, like being nice and not being racist is the engine, is the 18 wheeler tractor, but
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.120]  the trailer is all the other BS we sign on to, the whole agenda, support obama carrier
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.720]  racist, it was written by republican fat cats to triple prices, doesn't matter they call
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.240]  you a racist, i remember when i was fighting obama carrier they go, well alex jones is
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:16.360]  deeply racist, there was no proof they just said it, that was five years ago, and that's
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:22.520]  the script, i don't want everybody screwed over so i'm a bad guy, but it didn't work,
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.960]  so now they got to increase the bullying, so they go and they worship the players, they
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.600]  give them all the support and they do all this stuff and the owners come out and say
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.240]  yeah, have all these major teams stay in the locker room, don't come out in the national
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:42.320]  anthem, because again, america is bad itself, it's an act of bullying, and most people doing
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.760]  it are steroid head morons, every white player, every black player, i guess there's one hispanic
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:56.320]  player that stood for the anthem, that's what this has been turned into, ladies and
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.680]  gentlemen, is a giant exercise in brainwashing, and what's happened is, the big secret they
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.160]  don't want you to know, i saw it back at the time, the justice department went into the
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:13.760]  nfl and they said, you listen here six years ago, they said, you run a gladiatorial sport,
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.960]  and the average person that plays in your league ends up being dead at about 50-55 years
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.880]  old, and they've got all sorts of problems, and we're going to shut you down unless you
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.280]  become wholly owned subsidiaries of our system, and the owners went, you're right, i don't
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.000]  want these liabilities, and i don't want the justice department leading this, and i want
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.160]  you to tell your federal judges to shut this down, see my memory served right, it's 53-59,
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:50.240]  average that, what did i say, 55, my brain's still working, so these are men, they make
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.920]  the decision to do that, you ban dangerous sports, you ban dangerous events, you ban
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:00.640]  rock climbing, you ban skydiving, you ban boxing, baby, that's what we've always done,
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.280]  none of us are getting out of this alive, the nanny state's meant to shut down normal
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:13.720]  human activity and normal striving, but the nfl became a cupped group, and they were
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:19.000]  blackmailed into becoming political, and i mean it, and once they took over five and
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.680]  a half, six years ago, it was boom, suddenly every ad, because they approved the ads, remember
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.200]  they would refuse conservative or christian ads, but they'd run ads where five ads in
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:33.920]  a row were anti-father on father's day, the next week it'd be nothing but anti-gun ads,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:41.240]  and it was just hollywood, and the big media, and the big google tech giants, just all gangin'
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.920]  up, it doesn't mean america's perfect, doesn't mean we didn't have wounded knee, doesn't
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.920]  mean we don't have a bad past, everybody's got a bad past, but we had something called
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:57.720]  free market and striving that was truly liberal, and the globalists want that shut down more
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:03.880]  than anything, let's back trump's statement, i wanna place the first 30 seconds, or you
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.200]  got free space to wherever you want, but if you're working for a company, and you're doing
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.360]  something out there, and then they can find you for spiking the football, but they can't
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.920]  find you or kick you out for saying i hate america, listen if you hate it so much, get
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.480]  out, you gotta write to get out, you gotta write to criticize stuff going wrong in the
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:27.240]  country, but when you say it's fundamentally bad, and you won't stand for the anthem in
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:35.440]  london, for your own country, but you'll stand for god save the queen, you are disgraceful
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:43.000]  trash, but hey, i can't blame you, you grew up in the modern society, but i know this,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.440]  you haven't gotten any of my money in 20 years, i'm smart, i used to go watch delt's cowboy
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:56.600]  games grow up as a kid, but again, my grandfather was basically, i mean tom lander used to call
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.040]  him almost every sunday, they'd pray over the phone, so i grew up america, america's
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.000]  team, tom lander, it was okay back then, but still, it wasn't really america, tom lander
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.760]  and the delt's cowboy wasn't really america folks, john wane wasn't america, he was an
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  actor, not putting down john wane, this country is, and who we are, what we stand for, all
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.160]  of us are america, and i'm not gonna sit here while the nfl steals that legacy anymore,
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.720]  here's the clip as we go to break, when you love to see one of these nfl owners, when
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.640]  somebody disrespects our flag, just say get that son of a bitch off the field right now,
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:44.120]  out, he's fired, he's fired, can you imagine what tom lander would do, if one, if the team,
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.760]  he'd say there's no game, and if they fired tom lander, he'd be gone right there, he'll

[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.760]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry, our ancestors would hear the
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:04.920]  drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense,
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:11.320]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.880]  of their own, air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.560]  quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.960]  our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death, I personally counter

[01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:12.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:22.600]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war, all right, again the
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:27.000]  globalists want to break national sovereignty because they want to absolutely destroy any
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.920]  nation state, they want total planetary corporate dominance, they're committing incredible crimes
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.240]  across the globe, they're doing horrible things continually, they're funding dictators,
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.540]  suicide net laced factories, you know the apple owns where they have suicide nets in
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:46.280]  the stairways and around the buildings because it's so horrible and people are committing
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:53.120]  suicide, they're building a very very nasty world and now they've gotten spoiled rotten
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:21:00.000]  decadent NFL on this whole race war bandwagon when America elected a black president to
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.800]  use that to drive a wedge into the country and along comes Trump saying let's unify
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:10.120]  the nation around free market and around jobs and around a future and he delivers in his
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:16.800]  first eight months to a great extent and Hollywood howls with anger, sides with North Korea,
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:22.120]  I want to talk about this in this segment with Shepard Ambulus and then we're going
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:29.360]  to come back into his big story for intelhub.com or intelihub.com that was linked on drudgereport.com
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:34.440]  Friday and Saturday and got over a million readers just on our site alone, though the
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.840]  comments have been not broken on info wars but you can't see the number of comments
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.360]  but they're all there, we're getting that fixed right now but I've noticed a theme
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:49.080]  where Satanists admit but also Islamists that they like to take over Christian churches
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:54.840]  and then conduct their rituals inside of them that adds to the blasphemy and so now at a
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.760]  major Catholic church in London they did a big satanic ritual that was in the British
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:04.880]  news but broke here, we have photos and video of that showing them doing the rituals calling
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:11.320]  it a fashion show inside the church, so this just shows the whole degradation and decadence
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:17.080]  that goes on, the headline is Illuminati themed fashion show held at London Catholic Church,
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.840]  we'll talk to Shepard Ambulus about that in the next segment but first I want to go to
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:25.080]  Shepard a great investigative journalist, broke him so many big stories at intelhub.com
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:31.520]  and info wars.com, I wanted to ask him just overall we haven't talked to probably a year
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.960]  on the phone, we've both been busy but I've been working with Shepard for like more than
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:44.720]  10 years off and on, broken a lot of big stories, Shepard where would you call the demarcation
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.880]  line we're in right now in this fight against globalism, there's a huge awakening happening
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:55.560]  but a huge counter strike by globalists where Trump is, getting a lot done, going sideways
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.480]  a little but the enemies only attack more because the things he's saying are so powerful
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:06.120]  and so damaging to their brainwashing, I mean this is an amazing time, so instead of getting
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.360]  into your big story up front let's do it in the next segment, what do you make of the
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.640]  NFL, what do you make of North Korea, what do you make of Hollywood, hundreds of so-called
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:24.800]  stars siding with Kim Jong-un who makes Hitler you know look compassionate, I mean it's just,
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.000]  it's so crazy to see the split where so many people awake of every race, color and creed
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.600]  all humans with red blood, to see Trump trying to unify us around the flag, trying to take
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:38.520]  the American flag back from globalists and use it as a symbol of good again and to watch
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.080]  them so pissed, what is this, you're a smart guy, I don't just patronize you, you're in
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.560]  a tuned fella, what does your gut tell you about where we really are Shepard?
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:55.600]  We're in an absolute turning point Alex, it's do or die right now, if people don't push
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.760]  right now harder than ever to stand up for themselves, to stand up for their rights,
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:10.760]  for freedom, just for what's right, for good and not evil, if people don't make a major
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:16.200]  push or concerted effort right now and come together while they're all trying to divide
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.200]  us right now you know, they're doing all the race baiting you know just at every turning
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:28.200]  point, the Russian investigation is everything they can do to break up people's concentration,
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:37.240]  to break up their mindset, their thought pattern, their whole entire thought process mixed with
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:45.400]  all the 3G interference that we got coming through the air, the air, oh Shepard I was
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:51.120]  about to add what you say is so key, cancer rates massively up, diabetes massively up,
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.320]  it's all electromagnetic, the chemicals, all of it, and now the media spun it, I said
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.360]  Jimmy Kimmel, stop blaming healthcare for what happened to your son, learn why birth
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.360]  defects including congenital heart defects are way up, I have the news articles here,
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.040]  they said that I made fun of him and his wife and blamed them, I didn't blame them, I said
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.360]  Kimmel do some good, show why birth defects are skyrocketing, that's coming up as well.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:21.640]  Well look, these telecommunications giants, they want to now go from 3G to 5G and they
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:28.600]  want to have the whole entire system done by 2020, 2023, something like that, so they're
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:35.000]  making a major push to, is what they have to do Alex, they actually have to, the whole
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.320]  entire 3G infrastructure is used with for 5G, they literally have to upgrade, not even upgrade,
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.200]  they have to replace and change out the entire infrastructure.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:52.480]  Now let's be clear, they know all of it is giving us cancer, and we have our own documents,
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.200]  Shepard, it's by design, what is their master plan?
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:01.800]  Well they've, one that had a elite on the project that's basically heading us up, you
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.360]  know, he openly admitted, I don't know his name, but he openly admitted that this is
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.960]  going to generate, you know, trillions and trillions of dollars, this is a new industry,
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.960]  they don't care, he said it's all about the money, it's all about the money.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.560]  For folks who don't know, it's mainstream Washington Post scientific reports that even
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.440]  3G vibrates DNA, causing it to break accelerating cancer.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.200]  This is, well, and not only do they want to have faster internet speeds than this and
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.920]  that, but people can just feed it back.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:39.080]  But it's okay, look at the LA Times, it's 5G technology dangerous, early data shows
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:44.240]  a slight increase of tumors in male rats, exposed to cell phone radiation, they knew
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:51.160]  back in the beginning, oh yeah, you can almost feel it in the air, imagine when there's basically
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.960]  barbecued splits, you go around town, you go anywhere, you go anywhere, 3G Shepard in
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:02.480]  major German and Chinese studies causes massive deformities in first generation aphids and
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.480]  fruit flies.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.280]  Well they're going to start popping these incentives up, literally like, like, you know,
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:13.960]  100, 200 feet away from your apartment complex, your home, school yard, they're already pretty
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.880]  much everywhere, you know, while you're pumping gas, you're getting radiated, I mean, we're
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:24.640]  talking about high level, and here's the deal, that's why I got you on, you're always
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.320]  given to this subject and I knew it, get into the Satanism, the globalists believe they're
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.520]  channeling an interdimensional being that has told them that they kill the majority of
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.800]  us, they'll be given Godhood and secret technology.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:42.280]  Now humans have already basically built little G image of God, super tech, we are at the threshold
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.400]  of demigod status, just with our technology, the globalists do not intend for us to get
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.320]  that Shepard, and whether people believe in Satan or not, this is the plan, we are being
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320]  exterminated.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.600]  Well they want to, they want to keep the God like power for themselves, they want to be
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:02.840]  able to control all the weather on the planet, use it as a weapon and want to use it to control.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:07.000]  I don't know if you've ever heard of a game, it's like an old video game back in the day,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.080]  when I was a kid I used to play this called Popular, and what you could do is essentially
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.360]  play like your God, you can create your own colonies and, you know, create droughts, star
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360]  race and famine, all this stuff.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:26.720]  This is what these globalists are doing, a lot of very wealthy people, they're engaging
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:31.360]  in these activities where they seek these God like powers, they now have these God like
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:38.880]  powers, they're now testing on these God like powers, using them in ways that you could
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880]  never imagine.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:43.800]  That's right, Shepard and Amulus, stay there, and now they desecrate the American flag in
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:50.320]  London while worshiping the Queen at the NFL, stay with us.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.340]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:59.440]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.520]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.840]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.160]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend, discover
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:19.560]  and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:31.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.840]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.200]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed,

[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.280]  Well so does he.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:27.280]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:35.240]  So the LA Times, The Washington Post, they all report cell phones do give you brain cancer.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:40.320]  Now those articles always come out and then later they go oh but maybe it's questionable.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:48.000]  Well brain tumors are way up, sperm counts are way down, we're dying and the facts are
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  that these are high powered microwave relay systems and now they're going to 5G.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.440]  Here's some of the articles, is 5G technology dangerous?
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:03.320]  Even early data shows a slight increase, this is a slight though, in male rats exposed to
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.600]  cell phone radiation but that's just a little bit of it.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.160]  Not all the different systems.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:15.200]  The bottom line, they know this is going on so the reason I raised that is Shepard Ambulance
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:22.200]  investigative reporter that allows us to post this great work at infowars.com with intelhub.com
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:28.040]  found public info just this week on major British TV and print, not giving it any attention
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.280]  here in the West, they were having at a big Catholic church an Illuminati satanic themed
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.960]  event that looked just like Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:39.400]  Now if you understand black magic, whether you believe in the devil or not, you want
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.080]  to do it in front of everyone throwing it in their face and much of Satanism is about
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:50.120]  desecrating, holy artifacts are doing it in a church and then you notice they look like
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:56.240]  clowns, they're kind of dressing clown outfits, if you go back to ancient Greece and Babylon
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.680]  and Egypt, that's where clowns first come from.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.240]  You can search into the history of clowns, people will dress with white makeup and red
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.640]  outfits or red hair and then they'll add like big, big, big, larger mouths when they would
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.120]  do the human sacrifices to terrorize the children they were killing.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.720]  So Shepard Ambulus, while you talk, next time you can get via Skype, we'd love to have
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.320]  you back on your own phone right now, we're going to go through Illuminati themed fashion
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.560]  show held at London Catholic Church, walk us through who did it, what they were doing
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.800]  and just how this is part of this new trend of churches running things out to Satanists.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:38.440]  Alex, it's unbelievable, just like you said, Delara Fendi Congluse, she's a Turkish designer,
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:45.200]  she was putting on a show for London Fashion Week last Monday where she revealed her Spring
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.920]  Summer 2018 collection.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:55.640]  It's basically all demon-esque, vampire-esque, Tim Burton, Nightmare Before Christmas style,
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:03.280]  you know, it's almost mixed with like that Italian metal band Le Tunicoyle look.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.000]  All of the models, they were pretty average looking, had their faces painted up, very
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  pale, very beautiful.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.760]  Yeah, what they are is ugly, weak, nobody's trying to look like it, the clown, and they're
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.480]  all really begging to have their necks broken.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.080]  Well, when they act like the average person is going to wear this, I mean, you're really
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:25.120]  not going to see anyone in this type of attire except for like a Rihanna, maybe a K.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.760]  Well, no, this is the classic attire of war when you torture children to death.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.360]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.480]  Before this came out a week ago, I said they wear these outfits from our research during
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:36.280]  the Satanism.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:43.200]  It literally resembles, you know, total Satanism, the devil, the altar at this church of course
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.400]  had twin Masonic killers, the big D, you know, the Masonic logo.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.040]  And I want to be clear, I'm not defending Masonry, but it's just a mystery school going
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.160]  back to when colleges were secret because you couldn't just get into them and give up
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.400]  the knowledge.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.800]  But Masonry in the last 400 years was somewhat Christian, it got taken over, George Washington
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.800]  wrote about it.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:08.760]  When you're mixing in Masonic iconography into the Satanism, they're telling you we've
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.640]  conquered the whole Masonic system as well.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.720]  They're telling you we've conquered the Masonic Lodge.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.000]  So where are the Masons saying no to this?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.040]  See, they're not because they've been conquered.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.040]  Well, exactly.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:28.520]  And to Lara, the designer, she went on Instagram and posted a, you know, some of these images
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.880]  of her models, but she posted an image of the altar, which she titled Seven Sisters of
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:42.440]  the Inherited Sun, and also put a little phrase in there, summoning seance of 21 souls of
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.440]  society.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:51.640]  This was all done at the St. Andrews Holdborn Church in Holdborn, Paris, in London.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:56.840]  The church is a denomination of the Church of England, Alex, and its churchmanship is
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:03.000]  listed as modern Catholic, which basically bleeds over into Anglo-Catholic or angelic
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  and...
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Sure.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.560]  And we've got major churches, both Protestant and Catholic, worldwide condemning the Pope.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.600]  I've got that in my stack, pointing out that he is literally a totally apostate.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.880]  He can be another religion if he wants, but he is not a Christian.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.480]  He is not a Catholic.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:25.120]  Well, and I even got trolled, of course, by Catholics who are trying to claim this church
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:29.640]  as a Catholic, and they're trying to say, it's just straight up angelic, but, you know,
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:35.040]  you can go look at the listings for yourself on Wikipedia and the London Guardian and all
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  that.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:44.000]  But, you know, to hold this, essentially, it's a black mass disguised as a fashion show
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:53.120]  in this church in London, right out in the open, it can only be a push to normalize Satanism.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.400]  Well, obviously, if you read Satanic Bibles and deeper Satanic texts, and some of the
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.400]  stuff you can even find in bookstores that I've read over the years, it says you want
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.960]  to do it in a church for maximum effect.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.640]  That's what real Satanism is, is torture a little kid to death while they beg for mommy
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:13.760]  in a church.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:18.720]  Right out, right out in the open, right out in front of everyone, of course, then everyone
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.720]  sees these Hollywood types, these...
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.360]  It's like Bohemian Grove, tell you it's not really a child, and the word is sometimes
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360]  it is.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.440]  Well, yeah, and then they glorify it in Hollywood and all this fashion, and then that trickles
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:40.960]  down into society, and to society, and apparently it's pretty much decimated in the last several
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:41.960]  years.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.840]  Why do you think they're coming out in the open so much?
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.360]  I see it as a sign of weakness because they know that life force of humanity, as you just
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.080]  common sense, is struggling against this culture of death.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.320]  It is, I couldn't have said it better myself, Alex, it's exactly that.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:04.960]  It's a total sign of weakness, they're scared, so there's nowhere else for them to go, they've
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:10.400]  tried to confront everything they can, they're trying to confront Trump on every level.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.640]  They're basically to the point where they're going to fabricate evidence or something just
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:16.640]  to get them out.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.600]  They're going to do, they're basically going to go above and beyond, they're not going
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:26.160]  to stop, and it's a total sign of weakness, they know they've lost, they're going down
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:32.760]  so they're not going to go down without a fight.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.040]  What do you expect to happen next?
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.600]  I mean, notice the globalists have deep state ties in North Korea, the globalists put China
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.000]  in power, they've got him challenging Trump as well, threatening a preemptive strike on
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.520]  America having his ambassador say yesterday, yet at the UN, an attack on America is inevitable,
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.400]  an attack on the mainland preemptively is inevitable.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:55.760]  If I point a gun at you, Shepard, and I say it's inevitable, I'm going to pull a trigger
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.080]  and blow your head off, Shepard, I'm not doing that literally, but if I did, you would ever
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.600]  right to shoot me because I've got a gun pointed at your head saying I'm going to kill you,
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  Shepard.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:10.000]  Absolutely, you know, and it's just more, well, what they're doing too is they're ramping
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.200]  all this up and it's going to come to a turning point.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:18.880]  They recently warned residents in Hawaii like, look, you guys better be prepared because
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.880]  something might happen.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:26.640]  That was bulletin went out for the month of September and it was a message from the president
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.680]  to the residents of Hawaii and it said, get ready, you know, this could go down.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:37.400]  It was dated the month of September, you know, so we might be, I mean, like how many days
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.200]  do we have left in September?
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:46.960]  You know, I mean, we could be counting down to who knows what, but I mean, surely this
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:55.280]  guy, he's coming out, he's posturing, he's on a mission to get these rockets, you know,
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.800]  going so that they can hit the mainland.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.080]  What he wants to do ultimately probably is just use this leverage to take a look, you
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:09.120]  know, we've achieved this, you know, we're now considered kind of a superpower.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.240]  Look what we can do now.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.960]  Now we have some bargaining leverage on the table at the UN, but, but, you know, do you
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.600]  give this guy as the Trump administration, do you give this guy the chance to gain that
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.600]  leverage on you?
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.080]  If all he's done is go around pushing his way around with his people, pushing his way
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.080]  around with the U.S.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:36.120]  And again, he's the little hereditary ruler over tens of millions of slaves, and Hollywood's
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.280]  praising him saying, please come here, come young, we'll trade you, let Trump run your
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.960]  country, come run us.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.960]  What?
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.400]  I mean, that just shows Hollywood is beyond redemption.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:50.600]  They are our mortal enemies, literally.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.700]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.200]  to detoxify the body.
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.080]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.600]  It's made in the USA.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.520]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.360]  the body and it supports the infomer.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.640]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.120]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.800]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.800]  get.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.040]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:40.240]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:43.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.280]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.

[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:26.120]  to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know like what
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.760]  you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.560]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value

[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.960]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.960]  They take the most uncool people.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.960]  They put them on a pedestal.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.960]  They teach us to worship them. Hollywood.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.960]  The NFL.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.960]  All of them.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.960]  To make you feel like you haven't attained anything.
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.960]  You attained something not being them.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.960]  Thank God we're not the NFL trash.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.960]  Until the present day.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:37.960]  Lined from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:42.960]  And the Resistance is this.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  Pediatric cancers are up now 15,000%.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.960]  I keep saying 10,000. It's well above 15,000.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  There's clearly some evil force running globalism that's poisoning and killing us on purpose.
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.960]  And just doing horrible things.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.960]  They've got the NFL everywhere.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.960]  With like multiple teams not even coming out on the field hating the American flag.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.960]  As if they got something better to replace it with.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.960]  And it's all funded by globalists.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:15.960]  To replace it with shadowy world government that's tax exempt.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:21.960]  You got North Korea saying we will nuke you first. Let's go.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.960]  Total mental illness with like a beast woodchuck saying it.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.960]  Meanwhile, you've got top auditor claims Vatican axed him for probing illegal activity.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  That's out of Yahoo News Reuters.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.960]  Here's another one. Conservative Roman Catholic theologians accused Pope of spreading heresy.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:45.960]  Hell, he says I'm disgusted by Europe's Christian roots. What?
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960]  He's certainly a hypocrite.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.960]  He says we need to bring in millions more North Africans into Italy every year.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.960]  But that's a big wall around this house.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:57.960]  He's a globalist operative. They use their sex operatives. Pedophile rings.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.960]  They control the Vatican. That's even in the Guardian. They put him in.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.960]  His adjunct. He turned over a hundred little boys and kidnap rings.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:13.960]  Now, whether he uses the boys to get control or whether he likes to in by Bennett or not, he's a pedophile god.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.960]  Oh, we're in deep trouble.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:23.960]  The symbol of Americana, which always said it's dangerous to make the NFL the symbol of Americana because they can take that over.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:32.960]  They did and they now piss on the American flag and it major churches in England.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  They have open satanic rituals and they put it on television.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.960]  Shepherd Ambulus investigative reporter for intel hub dot com.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.960]  The stories on news wars dot com and drudge report dot com.
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960]  People can make jokes about this.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.960]  But when I go out to these events and cover this, these occultists take their Satanism.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.960]  Very, very serious and they're in to not caring.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.960]  They see the fact that we have a conscience and care as a weakness.
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.960]  So they use political correctness to manipulate us as a big joke.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:09.960]  That's why we have to recognize political correctness as a fraud and lie and truly be good people and reject this fraud.
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:14.960]  They use our morals against the shepherd. How do we transcend that?
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:22.960]  Well, just with perseverance and persistence and it's going to be hard.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:28.960]  Their whole goal is to essentially turn us into a mindless race of worker bees.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:30.960]  Sexless and they admit that sexless.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.960]  Yes, sexless.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.960]  Top it off. Exactly.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.960]  And they essentially want to transform us.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.960]  I mean, I said worker bees, but basically they want to turn us into gray aliens.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:43.960]  You know, just these total.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.960]  No, I totally agree.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.960]  If you go back to Huxley, his brother ran the UN in 32 in 1961.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:50.960]  He wrote brave new world revisits.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.960]  He said, listen, you're all going to be four feet tall, gray-skinned, not male or female.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:55.960]  No one will know who you are.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960]  And he goes, watch, we're going to do it.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.960]  And first we'll break up your families and they're doing it.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.960]  Well, and everyone turning into a snowflake.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.960]  You know, when I was a kid, we were out riding our dirt bikes, you know, jumping, jumps, breaking bones.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:09.960]  Breaking our bones.
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:10.960]  You do that now.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:11.960]  They take your kids.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:15.960]  Yeah. And so, you know, no one, no one can do anything.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.960]  You got to sit behind a computer terminal.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.960]  You know, your, your muscles waste away.
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.960]  You're already in the matrix.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:26.960]  Toxic lighting, everything's withering everyone away.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:27.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:34.960]  They picked with the new approved UN light bulbs, the exact frequency to cause seizures and brain damage.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:35.960]  That's even mainstream news.
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.960]  And they're in every office building in America, everyone's homes.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:54.960]  You know, virtually everywhere you go, you're just under constant attack, whether it's propaganda or whether it's a physical attack from electronics and radiation.
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:55.960]  And here's the big secret.
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.960]  They've got us racially fighting.
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.960]  We're all humans over stupid made up 100 people killed by cops.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:03.960]  Here's something you expose bad police.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.960]  We've all done that.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:08.960]  But till you pull back the statistics, it's like, yeah, there's revenue generating.
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:09.960]  Bad cops.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960]  Great.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.960]  Put them in prison.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.960]  But to claim that a couple hundred dead black people a year is the number one issue.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:20.960]  When, when half the blacks, four or five million a year get aborted and blacks kill, you know, hundreds of thousands of each other a year.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.960]  Why are they obsessing on 200 and something a year?
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:27.960]  It's because they want to divide us all because globalists are killing everybody.
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:34.960]  They want us fighting with each other while the big telecoms, while the big Googles roll in with the AI takeover.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.960]  Well, you used to talk about this a lot. It's like the order out of chaos.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:44.960]  And, and you know, they're really, I mean, look, you were, I was listening to you talk about this 15 years ago.
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:54.960]  And now they're to the point to where they've, they've just about castrated society to the point to where they're ready to do this massive takeover.
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:55.960]  Trump was a fluke.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:57.960]  He got into the presidency.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960]  He's more than that.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.960]  God, not the Trump's perfect.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.960]  And I'm not new on either.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.960]  God will always give you a final chance.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:07.960]  You get reprieves because this God's a just God.
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.960]  Trump's like a final chance.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.960]  Absolutely. I agree.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:17.960]  So, you know, we're, we're in, we're basically in the thick of it right now.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.960]  And, and, you know, a lot of people are not even paying attention right now.
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:38.960]  How is that at, at, you know, a way more unprecedented rate than ever. No one is paying attention. And if they are paying attention, they're getting distracted by all of the wrong things and they're sitting there in fighting.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:49.960]  And they don't know as soon as the world government's in, as soon as AI is in full control, the globalists have all said in their white papers, because they have to warn us up front, they're going to release the bio weapon shepherd.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:55.960]  And the big question in the Pentagon is, will the race, who's going to launch race specific first?
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:59.960]  Mm hmm. Well, they, you know, and they're ready to do it.
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:02.960]  They've already prepped the mass graves for everyone.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:11.960]  I mean, virtually every military cemetery in every state, every, even regular some of the areas now are put in those burial vaults that we talked about on our show before.
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:24.960]  You know, they're laying the groundwork they put in pandemic preparedness plan and all of these, essentially, if you really read in the pandemic preparedness plan, each state has one, it's not like a federal thing.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:30.960]  And they see it as an emergency surgery to cut off the human bloom that they see as a parasite hurting the earth.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  The problem is the globalists are the one creating GMO, all the globalist technology stuff that's hurting the planet.
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:42.960]  So they're claimed that they're going to exterminate us for the greater good. That's only for lower level minions.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.960]  The real operation of you study it is to overwrite the whole planet.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.960]  That's why they don't care because they're racing to Godhead.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.960]  They're racing to the new singularity of being a new God.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:55:03.960]  They don't care if it destroys everything because they believe in the race only who gets their first matters, who kills, who cares if you destroy the planet, as long as you're still willing to be the conscious Godhead.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:10.960]  As if God would let them achieve Godhead by doing something this selfish shepherd. That's the whole point.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.960]  Yeah, no, no, really. I mean, that's the gist of it.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:22.960]  And it's amazing the depth that these people go to and how far, you know, I mean, it's their legacy.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:32.960]  It's their, you know, they've built their families, their bloodlines, their knowledge, their database that they've hidden from the general public.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:40.960]  Their secret knowledge, their, you know, anything they know about, you know, the rock fillers went around and they...
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:43.960]  And all of it is bet against our spirit, our instinct and God.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.960]  Because all God does is give us a spirit and free will. That's all it is.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.960]  The truth versus all these fancy lies. It's up to us to choose it.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:57.960]  Shepherd, come back on this week for a full hour via Skype. I love you. I appreciate you. Intelhub.com. Thank you, sir.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.960]  Thanks, my friend.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.960]  That guy's so on target. That's why I'm not afraid of dying.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:08.960]  I'm afraid of how weak I am that I'm not going to be strong enough to give my contribution to beat these people.
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.960]  Because God, they're so bad. I mean, if you got brown skin, I love you.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.960]  If you got white skin, I love you. I don't give a rat's butt about that.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.960]  I care about your soul, but I understand a lot of you have been brainwashed by my enemy, so I still got to fight you.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:37.960]  Man, the vampires got to get broke. I'm not a violent person, but the vampires, the sociopaths, the child molesters, the psychopaths, I want to hurt them bad.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.960]  I want to get, I'd like to get in a ring with them with a battle axe and say, here's your battle axe, you son of a piece of garbage.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:50.960]  You fatherless goat. Pick up the damn weapon. Let's see who's, they already know they're weak. That's the thing.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.960]  But good men lay down. That's why evil is allowed to rise just briefly because we need to fund the operation.
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:00.960]  We got storeable foods, the highest quality, 50% off. I've never done it before.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:06.960]  I'm cutting prices because I'm not going to do like Amazon, that devil, that demon, that monopoly runner.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.960]  I'm going to cover tomorrow during a weekday show. Visa's does 50% off, but it's got to end soon.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.960]  I'm a high quality, my paid for supply and a bunch of other specials as well, but that's all I got to say.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:20.960]  You're funding us and you're getting things you need, so make the commitment today to financially support us.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.960]  But to me, this is all metaphysical. It's all about defeating these vampires.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:28.960]  But frankly, it's all about getting my hands around their necks.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.960]  That's what this whole operation is about. And you tell me, we got our hands around their necks.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:37.960]  But when you pray for us and when you take action, it gives us more power to squeeze.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:49.960]  Their eyes are bulging out.
