[00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:11.429]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.671]  You've got more NFL teams where the entire teams are refusing to even come out during the national anthem.
[00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:18.352]  Next level psychological warfare.
[00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:29.037]  I'll break it all down in the next segment as well as North Korea saying at the UN yesterday that they are preparing to preemptively strike the United States first and said it was inevitable.
[00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:36.492]  That gives Trump and anybody else that wants to attack North Korea the green light, whether it be Japan or South Korea.
[00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:37.893]  This is a new escalation.
[00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:40.433]  But here's part of my breakdown from yesterday.
[00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:44.954]  We'll come back from break and give you the rest of the story.
[00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:53.256]  There really aren't words to describe how powerful and how important this simple statement is that you are about to see.
[00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:58.417]  Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag
[00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:02.605]  Get that son of a bitch off the field right now!
[00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:02.946]  Out!
[00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.348]  He's fired!
[00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:08.651]  He's fired!
[00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:14.156]  Now, the NFL, the Players Association groups, all of them are flipping out right now.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:39.173]  Because they're part of the Hollywood, part of the globalists, part of the big media elite that's been bullying and pissing on the American people, and telling everybody they're racist, and telling everybody they're bad, and telling them to accept globalism, and socialism, and communism, and just give up all our rights, or we're gonna bully you and call you racist, like Tom Brokaw has called me with no evidence.
[00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:43.496]  And people, not just white folks, but everybody I know is just sick of it.
[00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:46.377]  They know it's political bullying.
[00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.077]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:49.477]  So why is this so important?
[00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:51.578]  Why am I so excited?
[00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.198]  Because the power of the boycott.
[00:01:53.198 --> 00:02:03.941]  It's why every major authoritarian system seeks to get rid of free market, even though they know it creates wealth and invention, and it's the best system, because it's not good for elites.
[00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:04.661]  Look at North Korea.
[00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:05.661]  Look at Venezuela.
[00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:07.442]  They want full control.
[00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.942]  They don't want you to have choices.
[00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:12.723]  They don't want you to have a free market to have power through boycotts.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.261]  Or through voting with your dollars.
[00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:25.665]  So Trump's saying you want to bitch and complain and turn every NFL event into a big pity party and claim blacks are more oppressed than they've ever been and all this other crap?
[00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:31.488]  When these are some of the most rich and powerful black folks out there, hundreds of millions of dollars, in many cases a piece?
[00:02:31.488 --> 00:02:37.311]  This is all George Soros funded and people are boycotting it and there's record low ratings and record low attendance.
[00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:43.999]  So Trump's pointing out your power and that's why even Fox News and the NFL Commissioner are like, this is terrible!
[00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.481]  This is disrespectful!
[00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:53.752]  Hating America and hating the flag and hijacking sporting events that folks just want to tune in and watch for political bullying.
[00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:54.333]  That's okay!
[00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:58.697]  But the president's saying, hey, owners, it's your company.
[00:02:58.697 --> 00:03:04.101]  You don't like people's political speeches during your event that they're paid to go play in, not give their political views?
[00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:16.271]  I mean, it's fine to give players $50,000 fines for doing ridiculous celebrations, they say, but oh my God, put down America, work for George Soros, try to bully the country, try to pull a spectacle off.
[00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.251]  No, don't fire him.
[00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.314]  Kaepernick and these other idiots are suing.
[00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:24.415]  Kaepernick's out of the NFL because he's a loser and had two horrible seasons.
[00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:28.277]  He's a loser little, little titty baby.
[00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:30.037]  And that's all this stuff is.
[00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:32.258]  And so he's saying it's okay to have America.
[00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:33.499]  It's okay to have our country.
[00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.959]  It's okay to love our nation.
[00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.600]  But they want to teach you to hate your nation.
[00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.157]  And America is waking up from this and that's why Trump's statements are so incredibly powerful.
[00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:48.283]  Is that he's letting you know you have the power to stop watching this.
[00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:50.525]  You have the power to leave.
[00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:55.071]  They've been using sports to control people since ancient Rome and ancient Greece and ancient Japan.
[00:03:56.624 --> 00:03:59.307]  And so I'm against it overall because it becomes a distraction.
[00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:09.980]  It becomes what takes up most men's lives instead of being fathers, instead of being politically involved, instead of having quality time with their children and going out camping or tubing or fishing or hunting.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.048]  It's all just about watching other people bloated, steroid head, drug addict, spoiled brats.
[00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:19.729]  So I say F the NFL, F the globalists.
[00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:34.976]  I'm so glad the thug, punk, politico chairman of the NFL, the NFL commissioner, has come out and slapped America in the face and said we're bad for not wanting to watch them wipe their asses with the American flag every time.
[00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:40.644]  And so they just picked a fight with the President, and the American people, they're gonna lose.
[00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:43.707]  Just like mainstream media is collapsing, just like Hollywood's collapsing.
[00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:46.270]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the whole thing is collapsing.
[00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.633]  When you think NFL, think dirtbag Hollywood.
[00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:55.099]  When you think MSNBC, think Hollywood-disconnected, arrogant elites that openly hate you.
[00:04:56.354 --> 00:05:00.316]  Refresh your breath with Emerix Essentials Organic Mouthwash.

[00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:28.843]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:31.826]  Star Spangled Banner flutters in the wind.
[00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:50.213]  And it's got Hollywood and the NFL and all the other people that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars a piece really pissed and butthurt because their religion is hating America.
[00:06:50.213 --> 00:06:57.575]  The last month I've seen countless so-called Hollywood stars.
[00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:00.316]  They'll call a dog catcher in LA a star.
[00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:02.476]  They'll call LeBron James a superstar.
[00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:04.377]  He's a super punk.
[00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:05.897]  Outcalling our president a bum.
[00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:14.623]  Another narcissistic mental patient calling himself, you know, the Lord and all this other crap.
[00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:17.126]  Big tattoos all over him, how he's God.
[00:07:17.126 --> 00:07:20.328]  What a sick joke.
[00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:33.300]  And I am so pleased to see record low viewership for the NBA, as well as the National Basketball League, the NFL, the National Baseball League, you name it.
[00:07:34.332 --> 00:07:41.842]  Because these are nothing but paid shills of the very same criminal dirtbag combine.
[00:07:44.158 --> 00:07:45.799]  That owns Hollywood.
[00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.400]  And their power is waning.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.464]  And they know they don't have that firm grip around America's neck anymore.
[00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:54.806]  And they've pushed total race war.
[00:07:54.806 --> 00:07:57.928]  Funded by that piece of garbage George Soros.
[00:07:57.928 --> 00:07:59.270]  And that hadn't worked.
[00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.772]  So they're going full tilt right now.
[00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:06.755]  They are balls to the walls!
[00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:09.657]  In an attempt to bully us back into submission.
[00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:12.800]  Of course, you know the famous saying, love it or leave it.
[00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:22.465]  And I know the American flag's been used for some wars that were wrong and has been used for even globalist operations.
[00:08:22.465 --> 00:08:36.131]  But now the very globalists themselves are trying to get rid of the American flag and the Bill of Rights and Constitution so we hate our own culture and accept globalism that is designed to be evil.
[00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:41.113]  America was the idea of freedom and just that idea changed the world.
[00:08:41.113 --> 00:08:42.194]  We were exceptional.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.463]  We did produce the greatest freedom.
[00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:52.431]  We did develop the ideas of the West and science and technology and open free societies, something nobody else did.
[00:08:53.735 --> 00:09:13.933]  And now the globalists use our strength, our goodness, our altruism, our openness against us, knowing we have a conscience to bully us into submission, to blackmail us, to attack us, until there's no end to what we won't give in to once we start bowing, once we start stepping, once we start fetching.
[00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:16.696]  When they say jump, we say how high.
[00:09:16.696 --> 00:09:18.137]  And all these controlled
[00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:23.307]  I'm not going to say a cuss word.
[00:09:23.307 --> 00:09:39.844]  All of these idiots that are dominating and controlling the airwaves with their America hate garbage are 110% bought and paid for.
[00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:43.047]  And it just shows you how desperate they are
[00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:47.611]  To maintain control over the American people.
[00:09:47.611 --> 00:10:02.061]  And it shows how brazen they are to not think this wouldn't back up into a blowback and blow up in their face.
[00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:08.985]  It's so incredible, though, that to a man, as of this live broadcast at 410 Central,
[00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.172]  There isn't one, there isn't two, there isn't three, there isn't four.
[00:10:14.172 --> 00:10:26.722]  There's at least five teams where everyone took a knee or locked arms and refused to put their hand over their heart or stayed in their locker rooms.
[00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:41.046]  And NFL owners coming out to the President and saying, we're not going to be bullied by you, we're going to stand strong against racism.
[00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:45.047]  So notice now, racism is the American flag.
[00:10:45.047 --> 00:10:49.509]  All evil in the world is personified by it.
[00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:54.490]  And you get all these spoiled, rotten little brats, coddled,
[00:10:56.502 --> 00:11:16.113]  Getting out there with their sports managers and the coaches and all these other politically correct cowards could grandstand and bitch at the country that produced the game and has the fans and the people and the system to pay them on average five million dollars a year.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.783]  Some people paid 20 million dollars a year.
[00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:28.987]  Some people like that loser Kaepernick is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:11:28.987 --> 00:11:30.167]  But it gets worse.
[00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.328]  And we have the video of this.
[00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:34.290]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.551]  Fox News has it.
[00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:39.293]  NFL players kneel during anthem
[00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:42.919]  But it gets better than an exhibition game.
[00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:46.981]  But stand for God save the Queen in London.
[00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:53.925]  They would stand and put their hands on their hearts, even though you're not supposed to do that when you're in somebody else's country.
[00:11:53.925 --> 00:11:57.446]  You're supposed to stand for their anthem like at the Olympics.
[00:11:57.446 --> 00:12:00.668]  But if it's not your country, you don't put your hand over your heart.
[00:12:00.668 --> 00:12:04.390]  But they stood and had no etiquette, no mind, no nothing.
[00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:10.434]  And put their hands on their hearts for God save the Queen.
[00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:27.646]  So the players all kneeled or locked arms, a bunch of spoiled, roid head, brat babies.
[00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:32.570]  But then, oh, God save the Queen, let's be politically correct, that's another country.
[00:12:34.314 --> 00:12:36.081]  And at the end you see them stand up as they play the...
[00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:37.967]  God save the Queen.
[00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:38.748]  Keep it rolling.
[00:12:38.748 --> 00:12:43.350]  Today, as you can see in this one game alone, several more choosing to do that.
[00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.171]  This all started back in 2016.
[00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:47.932]  Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers.
[00:12:47.932 --> 00:12:48.812]  Several more.
[00:12:48.812 --> 00:12:51.413]  It's the entire team kneeling down.
[00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:53.675]  The coaches, all the cowards.
[00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:55.615]  Bullied by MSM.
[00:12:55.615 --> 00:12:57.997]  And the owners have said, do this.
[00:12:57.997 --> 00:13:05.400]  They're part of the Hollywood elite that wants to break the American people's will in massive peer pressure.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.241]  You will see a change take place fast.
[00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:10.501]  Fire the players or suspend them.
[00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:12.982]  So the players' response on your screens now.
[00:13:12.982 --> 00:13:14.322]  We're going to hit pause there.
[00:13:14.322 --> 00:13:16.163]  Go to the end when they go to the God Save the Queen.
[00:13:16.163 --> 00:13:24.985]  The only reason it cuts off right then is they start God Save the Queen and you see them as we analyze this NFL garbage here for fair use.
[00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:27.425]  Because they'll try to claim all copyright.
[00:13:27.425 --> 00:13:28.206]  You're showing the NFL.
[00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:30.746]  Yes, we're showing the enemy of America.
[00:13:30.746 --> 00:13:32.927]  NFL equals
[00:13:34.718 --> 00:13:35.479]  Hollywood.
[00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:37.580]  NFL equals Madonna.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.281]  NFL equals Hillary.
[00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:41.763]  NFL equals ISIS.
[00:13:41.763 --> 00:13:44.705]  NFL equals everything that hates America.
[00:13:44.705 --> 00:14:00.055]  The NFL is a disgusting, spoiled, rotten group from the degenerate owners to the coaches to the players to all the filth that watches it and loves it and gives away their life watching a bunch of narcissistic drug addict
[00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:04.180]  Steroid heads, just like you all worshipped Lance Armstrong.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:10.423]  What a disgusting, filthy, degenerate, pathetic, mindless excuse.
[00:14:10.423 --> 00:14:11.724]  And you know what I love?
[00:14:11.724 --> 00:14:14.345]  I told you 20 years ago the NFL was pure propaganda.
[00:14:14.345 --> 00:14:18.648]  Now it's all anti-gun, all anti-family, all anti-Christian with the ads.
[00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:20.789]  They won't even accept ads that aren't.
[00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:24.171]  And it's all just a weapon to destroy this country!
[00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:34.110]  Hollywood, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, the sports shows, all of it is just force-fed garbage.
[00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.352]  And it's all going straight down.
[00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:42.023]  In the ratings, all the UFC, it just doesn't get political?
[00:14:42.023 --> 00:14:43.024]  It's going straight up.
[00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:45.005]  People are sick of the lecturing.
[00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:47.045]  They've developed allergies to it.
[00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:51.627]  But oh, the NFL and its big Hollywood owners, they don't know what to do.
[00:14:51.627 --> 00:14:55.108]  America's pulling free of their bullying, pulling free of their control.
[00:14:55.108 --> 00:14:56.909]  They don't know what to do.
[00:14:56.909 --> 00:14:57.689]  So what are they going to do?
[00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.050]  They're going to double and triple down.
[00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.371]  Here's the article, see the full video.
[00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:11.150]  Up on InfoWars.com, NFL players kneel during the National Anthem, but stand for God save the Queen.
[00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:22.601]  We had a war 245 years ago with her great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaddy.
[00:15:25.205 --> 00:15:37.754]  To start this country, and the song is about the British bombarding our bases and hitting forts with a hundred plus ships' cannons through the night, and the base didn't give up.
[00:15:37.754 --> 00:15:42.717]  And thank God when they got up in the morning, the flag was shot to hell, but it was still there!
[00:15:42.717 --> 00:15:51.543]  And so the pure satanic desecration in the UK to worship the Whore Queen and piss all over the red, white, and blue.
[00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:53.765]  The NFL's committed suicide!
[00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:54.285]  I love it!
[00:15:54.505 --> 00:16:05.090]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.151]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:10.033]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:11.513]  It's made in the USA.
[00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.635]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:18.336]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:20.417]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:16:20.417 --> 00:16:30.121]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:42.425]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:46.934]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:50.241]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.

[00:18:56.109 --> 00:18:57.989]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:00.010]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.930]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:08.991]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:18.173]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:19:18.173 --> 00:19:23.034]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:19:23.274 --> 00:19:25.697]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:33.725]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:34.826]  The general public doesn't.
[00:19:35.914 --> 00:19:39.855]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:43.436]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:19:43.436 --> 00:19:50.138]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:57.841]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at mfullworthstore.com.
[00:19:57.841 --> 00:20:00.982]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:11.876]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:16.400]  Government is the problem.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:24.107]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:20:24.107 --> 00:20:31.233]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:20:32.153 --> 00:20:34.274]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.274 --> 00:20:36.235]  Because there is a war on.
[00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.616]  For your mind.
[00:20:38.616 --> 00:20:39.796]  Hello me.
[00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:42.257]  Meet the real me.
[00:20:42.257 --> 00:20:48.840]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.721]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:52.721 --> 00:21:01.345]  There is supposedly nothing in this country more Americana
[00:21:02.145 --> 00:21:05.527]  Then the National Football League.
[00:21:05.527 --> 00:21:12.090]  The old saying is, as American as mom, baseball, and apple pie.
[00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:19.754]  But baseball has faded and it's now, as American as mom, football, and apple pie.
[00:21:19.754 --> 00:21:25.137]  But you know, I always said, mom isn't American, mom's just mom.
[00:21:25.137 --> 00:21:26.597]  There's moms all over the world.
[00:21:26.597 --> 00:21:29.219]  There's dads, and they're great people.
[00:21:29.219 --> 00:21:31.420]  And baseball and football isn't America.
[00:21:32.731 --> 00:21:34.952]  An apple pie in America.
[00:21:34.952 --> 00:21:43.798]  America's the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, due process, the common person being able to go out and open a business without a bunch of regulations.
[00:21:43.798 --> 00:21:45.339]  It's the Renaissance.
[00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:50.543]  It's the flower of Western culture and society.
[00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:58.668]  And ladies and gentlemen, as we all fell asleep watching the false America,
[00:22:00.247 --> 00:22:01.808]  That was the NFL.
[00:22:01.808 --> 00:22:15.373]  They slowly removed more and more of the Americana symbols, the logos, the signets, the standards, the iconography.
[00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:28.079]  And under Obama, it's gone from one person kneeling, to ten people kneeling, to now every major team that played today, every player, but one, and that footage is coming up,
[00:22:30.734 --> 00:22:39.558]  Kneeled or put their hands together and the coaches and the assistants and all of them did it in a giant act of evil.
[00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:42.759]  Because the owners said do it.
[00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:50.522]  The head of the NFL came out against the president last night.
[00:22:51.553 --> 00:22:54.356]  and said you disrespect the NFL.
[00:22:54.356 --> 00:22:57.218]  Trump said you're disrespecting America.
[00:22:57.218 --> 00:22:59.340]  And they said, buddy, that's gone.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.381]  That's bad.
[00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:01.482]  That's evil.
[00:23:01.482 --> 00:23:03.564]  What matters is the NFL.
[00:23:03.564 --> 00:23:05.966]  And you disrespected us.
[00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:07.287]  That's a quote.
[00:23:07.287 --> 00:23:11.071]  And so they ordered their little paid right hands.
[00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:11.852]  They're arrogant.
[00:23:12.807 --> 00:23:15.368]  I mean, I've been around a lot of Hollywood stars and they're arrogant douchebags.
[00:23:15.368 --> 00:23:27.535]  Let me tell you, NFL football players on average are the most trashy, narcissistic, arrogant, stupid idiots waiting to have their heart attacks at age 50 and die on average.
[00:23:27.535 --> 00:23:29.736]  They're losers.
[00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:31.277]  They're drug addicts.
[00:23:31.277 --> 00:23:32.057]  They're failures.
[00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:38.101]  They're the most un-American trash on earth, as I've always told you.
[00:23:38.101 --> 00:23:40.142]  It's not the Tom Landry.
[00:23:41.089 --> 00:23:44.851]  That my grandfather played football with at UT.
[00:23:44.851 --> 00:23:48.092]  Or the Tom Landry that went to the Army Air Corps, just like my grandpa did.
[00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:49.893]  No, those were Americans.
[00:23:49.893 --> 00:23:58.918]  These modern football players are the scum of the earth, whether they be black or white, doesn't matter who they are, they're snot-nosed punks.
[00:24:01.357 --> 00:24:08.803]  On average making five million dollars a year, living like kings, and they're pissed at America.
[00:24:08.803 --> 00:24:13.286]  And then they go to England for an exhibition game.
[00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:19.110]  Footage is on Fox News, on Infowars.com.
[00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:24.754]  The Baltimore Ravens and the Jacksonville Jaguars in a London exhibition game.
[00:24:26.408 --> 00:24:44.152]  Kneeled for that, we just played it earlier, and then stood and rose for God Save the Queen when the Star Spangled Banner is a song about a base in a real war on the East Coast under bombardment by more than a hundred ships.
[00:24:44.392 --> 00:24:45.352]  If memory serves.
[00:24:45.352 --> 00:24:47.633]  Pull me up the story of the Star-Spangled Banner.
[00:24:47.633 --> 00:24:48.174]  I'll give it to folks.
[00:24:48.174 --> 00:24:53.876]  I know it was a whole fleet of British ships lined up and hammered that fort all night long.
[00:24:53.876 --> 00:24:59.358]  And not only did the fort stand, in the morning the flag was still up there and it was miraculous.
[00:24:59.358 --> 00:25:02.320]  Because nobody had ever seen anything like that.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:10.203]  Those were hardened troops in that base who'd already been through the French and Indian War and a bunch of other wars and they'd seen nothing like it.
[00:25:10.203 --> 00:25:11.703]  Because most of the fort had collapsed.
[00:25:11.703 --> 00:25:12.784]  A big concrete fort.
[00:25:17.183 --> 00:25:19.129]  Imagine the desecration!
[00:25:19.129 --> 00:25:20.774]  Imagine the arrogance!
[00:25:20.774 --> 00:25:21.496]  Imagine!
[00:25:21.496 --> 00:25:22.600]  They get huge fines!
[00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:28.117]  If somebody spikes a football or does whatever.
[00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:30.699]  But, oh, you want to go piss on America?
[00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:32.199]  Oh, it's just your protest.
[00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:36.702]  And then the President has his speech, and he says you're disrespecting America.
[00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.003]  He's not stopping your speech.
[00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:48.329]  He's saying you're disrespecting America, and that's a private team, and you work for that team, and if you want to do that on the job, in front of the fans, and split this country in the middle, that's fine!
[00:25:48.329 --> 00:25:49.890]  You go do it, you're fired!
[00:25:52.711 --> 00:26:01.467]  And the response was, owners across the board except the Patriots, of course, figure it, it's just, it's just, art imitates life, doesn't it?
[00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:02.048]  It's archetypal.
[00:26:07.614 --> 00:26:10.016]  Think they can break your will, but they're just like Hollywood.
[00:26:10.016 --> 00:26:12.897]  Just like they took over all the late-night comedy shows, made them political.
[00:26:12.897 --> 00:26:15.039]  They've taken all over the news shows, made them political.
[00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.760]  All the big HBO shows made them political.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:24.125]  They've made everything political now in an attempt to create a false reality to force you into a matrix, but it's not working.
[00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:31.289]  And we reject all the spoiled, rotten thugs like Kaepernick and others with pleasure.
[00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:36.533]  The NFL, the last four years of this, has seen a decline on average of half of their ratings.
[00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:39.193]  On pre-playoff games.
[00:26:39.193 --> 00:26:41.997]  And something like 25% on playoffs.
[00:26:41.997 --> 00:26:43.539]  The Super Bowl's down.
[00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:45.622]  Their advertising's down.
[00:26:45.622 --> 00:26:47.485]  And people in the seats are down.
[00:26:47.485 --> 00:26:49.588]  And I love it!
[00:26:49.588 --> 00:26:52.732]  Just keep showing us how much you hate this country!
[00:26:53.643 --> 00:26:59.129]  Because the old saying is, if you love England so much, which I'm not against England, but get your ass over there.
[00:26:59.129 --> 00:27:06.937]  And if you love North Korea so much, as we have Bill Maher and all these Hollywood people praising him and saying, please come be our president.
[00:27:06.937 --> 00:27:09.459]  Oh, what, come put everybody in slave dungeons?
[00:27:09.459 --> 00:27:10.560]  Have forced labor camps?
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.984]  I mean, they're actually promoting Kim Jong-un over Trump!
[00:27:17.995 --> 00:27:20.697]  So we're going to go out to break with something really beautiful from 1991.
[00:27:20.697 --> 00:27:25.300]  Whitney Houston, beautiful voice, beautiful soul.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:31.825]  Imagine how far we've come since 1991, 25 years ago, 26 years ago.
[00:27:31.825 --> 00:27:33.786]  Imagine how far we've fallen.
[00:27:33.786 --> 00:27:37.248]  This is dirty and bad in America.
[00:27:37.248 --> 00:27:37.689]  Here it is.
[00:28:07.176 --> 00:28:07.516]  I think.
[00:28:39.673 --> 00:28:44.597]  But if they had their way, they'd just ban it all together.
[00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:52.403]  The truth through the night, that our flag was still there, and the Republic is still here, and is awakening, and that's why the globalists are panicking.
[00:28:52.403 --> 00:28:52.883]  We'll be back.
[00:28:52.883 --> 00:28:53.364]  Stay with us.
[00:28:54.574 --> 00:28:56.035]  December 23rd, 1776.
[00:28:56.035 --> 00:29:00.019]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:05.043]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:09.827]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[00:29:09.827 --> 00:29:12.469]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:14.211]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[00:29:14.451 --> 00:29:17.452]  That the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[00:29:17.452 --> 00:29:20.493]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:23.453]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[00:29:23.453 --> 00:29:26.594]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[00:29:26.594 --> 00:29:32.176]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[00:29:32.176 --> 00:29:32.496]  Britain.
[00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:40.542]  With an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right, not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[00:29:40.542 --> 00:29:45.806]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[00:29:45.806 --> 00:29:51.690]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.692]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.

[00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:13.507]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:13.507 --> 00:31:18.191]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.215]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:22.978 --> 00:33:29.459]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:36.621]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.161]  I've always been honest with our listeners.
[00:33:39.161 --> 00:33:44.123]  I've always been honest with the deep state, who I know has actually a lot of good people in it.
[00:33:44.123 --> 00:33:45.783]  The Pentagon, Special Forces.
[00:33:47.543 --> 00:33:59.026]  Command, JSOC, all the different groups, that globalism means the death of prosperity, the death of freedom, and a really, really horrible system of oppression for everybody.
[00:33:59.026 --> 00:34:04.008]  And so as we approach this world government, you're going to have a chance to decide which side you're on.
[00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:22.223]  And if I would have told listeners, which I did 20 years ago, that there'd be a time when they were protesting the National Anthem and claiming America was racist and evil and should be overthrown and should be merged into an unelected private corporate world government, people would tell me that I was crazy!
[00:34:22.223 --> 00:34:24.105]  But why didn't I still tell them?
[00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:26.446]  Because I knew they would remember.
[00:34:26.446 --> 00:34:31.370]  And when it came true, then they would remember and then I would have the credibility.
[00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.982]  And that's why Infowars has so much credibility right now.
[00:34:35.982 --> 00:34:42.267]  It's because we've been telling it like it is and laying out the hard facts way before others will do it.
[00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:46.750]  Because we're willing to be criticized up front.
[00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:57.219]  And not because we're heroes, but because we understand going along playing it safe is what gets countries and civilizations totally and completely enslaved.
[00:34:57.219 --> 00:34:58.400]  There's a dramatic story
[00:35:00.677 --> 00:35:01.678]  And there's video of this.
[00:35:01.678 --> 00:35:09.244]  It's up on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com right now with the Steelers and the Bears.
[00:35:09.244 --> 00:35:11.926]  The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Chicago Bears.
[00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:17.830]  And both teams refused to have their people come out on the field.
[00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.753]  Same thing with the Seahawks and the Titans.
[00:35:20.753 --> 00:35:21.733]  And a bunch of other teams.
[00:35:21.733 --> 00:35:23.535]  This is just incredible.
[00:35:23.535 --> 00:35:28.619]  And one player who's an Army veteran, Alejandro
[00:35:30.922 --> 00:35:33.424]  Villanueva, is that correct?
[00:35:33.424 --> 00:35:34.725]  I finally got a name right?
[00:35:34.725 --> 00:35:35.746]  Great.
[00:35:35.746 --> 00:35:48.898]  That patriot, he refused, despite all of the team pressure, and the owner's pressure, and all the cowardly coaches, and all the other scum, he refused to be part of it.
[00:35:48.898 --> 00:35:50.519]  It was the Steelers that did it.
[00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:52.361]  To be clear, the Bears didn't.
[00:35:52.361 --> 00:35:55.423]  It was the Seahawks and the Titans all remained.
[00:35:55.423 --> 00:35:56.224]  It was the Steelers.
[00:35:56.224 --> 00:35:57.005]  Very, very shameful.
[00:35:58.038 --> 00:36:00.600]  And he refused to be part of it, despite all that.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.644]  And again, I get, hey, we're a free country, you don't have to go put your hand over your heart for the National Anthem.
[00:36:05.644 --> 00:36:07.105]  And I know America's not perfect.
[00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:08.406]  The point is, why now?
[00:36:08.406 --> 00:36:09.907]  Why are they hyping this all?
[00:36:09.907 --> 00:36:11.008]  Why are they pushing this?
[00:36:11.008 --> 00:36:13.530]  And it's very simple.
[00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:18.053]  It's globalism.
[00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:18.834]  Globalism.
[00:36:18.834 --> 00:36:23.517]  They've announced in the EU, I saw this ten years ago in the BBC, they reported it with a straight face.
[00:36:25.424 --> 00:36:43.814]  Teams having national names is too nationalistic and causes racism, so the EU is recommending that all national teams, for things like football, soccer, and other sports, no longer have names like the Spanish team, or the French team, or the Greek team.
[00:36:43.814 --> 00:36:51.398]  And then this year, they're announcing that that's just the way it is, and the EU is ordering the teams to change their names.
[00:36:53.490 --> 00:37:03.153]  Because you can't have any pride to have a Spanish team, or the German team, or the Dutch team, or the Nigerian team, or the Mexican team.
[00:37:03.153 --> 00:37:10.455]  That's where globalism is moving, where even countries are dirty words.
[00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:13.216]  And then what do we trade out once we get rid of our countries?
[00:37:13.216 --> 00:37:14.937]  Our vote?
[00:37:14.937 --> 00:37:16.857]  Having some say, not that it's perfect?
[00:37:16.857 --> 00:37:18.418]  Having some culture?
[00:37:18.418 --> 00:37:22.279]  Now it's just some multinational secret TPP runs things?
[00:37:23.362 --> 00:37:28.646]  And is exempt from taxes and regulations?
[00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:35.370]  And now, take a stand, not a knee, has started a hashtag.
[00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.812]  And one of the big non-profits that supports Trump is coming out.
[00:37:38.812 --> 00:37:39.973]  The battle's joined, folks.
[00:37:39.973 --> 00:37:41.134]  Say what you want about Trump.
[00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:43.696]  He understands, if we don't have a country,
[00:37:45.393 --> 00:37:47.534]  And we don't have sovereignty?
[00:37:47.534 --> 00:37:54.016]  And we don't have a basic culture that's Americana, low taxes, private property, right to practice religion or not?
[00:37:54.016 --> 00:37:55.257]  Then we're not America!
[00:37:55.257 --> 00:37:56.857]  That's what made us special!
[00:37:56.857 --> 00:38:04.360]  And they've got a big left-wing attack on Trump going with hashtags and stuff that, oh look, he betrayed conservatives because he said,
[00:38:05.529 --> 00:38:13.514]  That he's going to try to rework DACA for people that have been here decades and do have jobs and do have degrees and who aren't criminals to get a green card and stay.
[00:38:13.514 --> 00:38:15.915]  That's what he said during the campaign.
[00:38:15.915 --> 00:38:19.177]  The media misrepresented what Trump said he was going to do.
[00:38:19.177 --> 00:38:22.459]  He said, I'm going to kill DACA because Obama just signed it.
[00:38:22.459 --> 00:38:23.420]  You can't do that.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.820]  And I'm going to send it back to Congress.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.701]  And if we can get a bill.
[00:38:26.923 --> 00:38:33.767]  Where people that aren't criminals, who haven't committed other crimes, other than being brought here when they're little kids, then you can stay!
[00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:34.868]  He always said that!
[00:38:34.868 --> 00:38:36.689]  I always told you he was going to say that!
[00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:39.091]  People go, oh Alex, you sold out!
[00:38:39.091 --> 00:38:39.791]  And so has Trump.
[00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:40.091]  Bull.
[00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:41.052]  He killed TPP.
[00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.973]  He killed the carbon tax.
[00:38:42.973 --> 00:38:45.575]  69% reduction in illegals coming across the border.
[00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:46.435]  Just on and on and on.
[00:38:46.435 --> 00:38:47.976]  The globalists all hate him.
[00:38:47.976 --> 00:38:48.897]  The corrupt Vatican.
[00:38:48.897 --> 00:38:50.098]  The corrupt Saudi Arabians.
[00:38:50.098 --> 00:38:51.138]  The corrupt EU.
[00:38:51.138 --> 00:38:51.919]  Corrupt Hollywood.
[00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:53.280]  The corrupt NFL.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.141]  Hell, every group you can imagine.
[00:38:55.141 --> 00:39:03.647]  The big telecoms, the big mega-massive Googles and Facebooks that own slave factories, that have monopolies.
[00:39:03.647 --> 00:39:10.451]  Every stinking criminal group is against the President and you can't obviously see what's going on?
[00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:14.614]  And then a bunch of overpaid, spoiled, rotten, drug addict babies?
[00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:17.122]  Oh yeah, the NFL.
[00:39:17.122 --> 00:39:27.951]  They're on cocaine, you name it, not just steroids, drugs, just a filthy, disgusting, anti-American group of scum.
[00:39:27.951 --> 00:39:41.262]  You know, when they're not having, uh, torturing dogs to death or beating hookers up or snorting cocaine and, you know, shooting up heroin, they're out there bitching that they're in America and they've only got $200 million in the bank.
[00:39:41.262 --> 00:39:43.264]  Oh, and I love it, the National Baseball League.
[00:39:43.464 --> 00:39:45.484]  Has had some idiot come out and kneel.
[00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:48.385]  That's going to cause the chain reaction as they make him a superstar.
[00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:49.025]  Good!
[00:39:49.025 --> 00:39:51.086]  Die even faster, baseball!
[00:39:51.086 --> 00:39:52.866]  Die even faster, football!
[00:39:52.866 --> 00:39:59.547]  Because you've all been imposters in the last hundred years, convincing America that you are America!
[00:39:59.547 --> 00:40:01.528]  Lewis and Clark were America.
[00:40:01.528 --> 00:40:04.888]  George Washington was America.
[00:40:04.888 --> 00:40:07.109]  The first people to go into space were America.
[00:40:08.203 --> 00:40:08.883]  They were human beings.
[00:40:08.883 --> 00:40:10.744]  It's like the first person in space was a Russian.
[00:40:10.744 --> 00:40:14.765]  It's all part of invention and science and technology.
[00:40:14.765 --> 00:40:22.187]  Not watching a bunch of spoiled brats in simulated combat fighting with each other.
[00:40:22.187 --> 00:40:26.468]  Who's the lady that was always flying around the world and ended up disappearing?
[00:40:27.748 --> 00:40:29.789]  Amelia Earhart, she's America.
[00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:33.970]  Or George Washington Carver and all his inventions was America.
[00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:40.572]  Or just anybody that strives and builds and stands up for independent success.
[00:40:40.572 --> 00:40:51.115]  Anybody, no matter what color you are or where you came from, you become an American and you're successful with your family, your life, or literature, or art, or inventions, whatever it is.
[00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:51.895]  You're an American!
[00:40:52.515 --> 00:41:00.736]  You come here to be left alone to be able to do it, not have some big political correct government telling you how to live your life.
[00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:02.657]  I'm so angry today I can hardly even do the show.
[00:41:02.657 --> 00:41:16.859]  Because I read these headlines and I watch the videos and it says Seahawks Titans remain in locker room for anthem to protest injustice.
[00:41:16.859 --> 00:41:17.959]  Injustice?
[00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:21.320]  We've got the lowest level of injustice of any major country in the world.
[00:41:22.076 --> 00:41:24.597]  Good God!
[00:41:24.597 --> 00:41:26.858]  NFL players kneel during anthem.
[00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:28.980]  Stand for God Save the Queen.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.201]  The imagery of that is just incredible.
[00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:37.124]  Steelers stay in locker room during national anthem as 100 NFL players protest.
[00:41:38.419 --> 00:41:40.020]  And then meanwhile, oh, where are they?
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:47.487]  How about they take a knee until America does something about making women wear the hijab or sexual mutilation going on in America and all over the world?
[00:41:47.487 --> 00:41:48.207]  Oh, no, no.
[00:41:48.207 --> 00:41:49.969]  You wouldn't take a knee for anything real.
[00:41:49.969 --> 00:41:54.032]  Just the big, corrupt, scared little, politically correct...
[00:41:54.893 --> 00:42:02.720]  Team owners that get together with Homeland Security, with Obama, and decide to run this whole race war narrative to use the NFL to take control.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.541]  Have you watched the NFL ads?
[00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:06.523]  The stuff the NFL hosts push?
[00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.124]  The anti-gun garbage?
[00:42:08.124 --> 00:42:09.765]  The anti-parent garbage?
[00:42:09.765 --> 00:42:11.407]  Remember a few Father's Days?
[00:42:11.407 --> 00:42:13.108]  They had a bunch of ads they allowed to run.
[00:42:13.108 --> 00:42:14.729]  Every ad was anti-father.
[00:42:14.729 --> 00:42:15.970]  How you don't need a father?
[00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.372]  I mean, this is the enemy of the country!
[00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:20.374]  Because it's the perfect Trojan horse.
[00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:21.375]  It's the NFL.
[00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:37.780]  The NFL and national sports is the perfect Trojan horse that they wrap up as America to then actually be the poison pill we eat thinking it's good food, a nice piece of chocolate cake, a nice piece of strawberry cake, and it's poison!

[00:46:58.069 --> 00:47:00.711]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.783 --> 00:47:19.848]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:19.848 --> 00:47:22.171]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:23.892]  Well, no fans left.
[00:47:23.892 --> 00:47:25.895]  That's what the NFL stands for.
[00:47:25.895 --> 00:47:27.116]  And, look, I played football.
[00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:30.760]  I was okay at it.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:36.447]  But I did sit there in high school and watch people worship folks that were on the football team, and I thought it was just stupid.
[00:47:38.138 --> 00:47:40.659]  So I quit playing football even though I was doing okay at it.
[00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:42.159]  I just thought it was sick.
[00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:53.262]  It's kind of like all these folks that set up these little charity events and they'll have some celebrity at it and everybody dresses up and feels like they're a celebrity and you can even pay folks to come out with paparazzi and take photos of you so you can feel like you're paparazzi.
[00:47:53.262 --> 00:47:55.362]  I mean, Hollywood's collapsed.
[00:47:55.362 --> 00:48:03.444]  The whole celebrity system's a joke that was artificially created by Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda.
[00:48:04.295 --> 00:48:06.156]  To screw the public up.
[00:48:06.156 --> 00:48:11.617]  The American system was about admiring the common, hard-working person.
[00:48:11.617 --> 00:48:14.939]  The striver, the builder.
[00:48:14.939 --> 00:48:17.159]  And those that went up against the system.
[00:48:17.159 --> 00:48:25.922]  That's what America's about, not worshipping George Clooney and Hillary Clinton and Michael Moore and all these dirtbags.
[00:48:25.922 --> 00:48:33.725]  So I've gotten so angry that I've hardly been able to even do the broadcast today because, I mean, let me tell you, when you get two NFL teams to go to an exhibition game in London,
[00:48:34.983 --> 00:48:39.967]  And they won't stand for the Star Spangled Banner, but they stand for God Save the Queen.
[00:48:39.967 --> 00:48:42.409]  The song is about a war with the British Empire.
[00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:48.694]  Right at the start of the war in 1776.
[00:48:51.627 --> 00:48:56.888]  And then I think about how different America has been, how good it's been compared to other systems.
[00:48:56.888 --> 00:48:58.909]  And the globalists have already taken the world over.
[00:48:58.909 --> 00:49:00.109]  They've already taken over the Internet.
[00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:01.469]  They've already taken over everything.
[00:49:01.469 --> 00:49:04.010]  And the last thing they've got to do is just get America out of the way.
[00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.150]  They've already used the U.S.
[00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.350]  to help build their system, and they want to flush it.
[00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.571]  And Trump comes along and says no.
[00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:10.891]  And then they've got Bill Maher.
[00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:12.892]  In fact, let's play that clip next.
[00:49:12.892 --> 00:49:14.292]  Then I'll play Trump.
[00:49:14.292 --> 00:49:19.333]  The evil that he said that's got the players saying, how dare he goes, you're disrespecting America.
[00:49:20.475 --> 00:49:22.035]  So I say I'm not gonna watch you.
[00:49:22.035 --> 00:49:26.016]  Well, you disrespect us, and they all then are buttered.
[00:49:26.016 --> 00:49:47.541]  How dare you speak back to us when people pay all this money to go to a football game that we all grandstand because we're only making, you know, $15 million a year, and we're all oppressed, and, you know, we only get 20 steroid shots a week, and we only live in $50 million houses and have helicopters, and screw you, middle America, and screw you, white people that pay our salaries and voted for Obama.
[00:49:47.541 --> 00:49:48.661]  You're all scum!
[00:49:48.661 --> 00:49:49.261]  We hate you!
[00:49:50.336 --> 00:49:53.438]  That's the quotes here by a Democrat Congresswoman.
[00:49:53.438 --> 00:49:54.658]  It's white supremacy.
[00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.619]  Kneel against it.
[00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:56.720]  What?
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.280]  I get it.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.881]  America's so bad.
[00:49:58.881 --> 00:50:00.862]  Go to North Korea.
[00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:02.523]  Go to Venezuela.
[00:50:02.523 --> 00:50:03.643]  Just get out.
[00:50:03.643 --> 00:50:04.204]  No, no.
[00:50:04.204 --> 00:50:05.284]  You're not going to get out.
[00:50:05.284 --> 00:50:09.727]  You're going to sit here making $10, $15, $20 million a year bitching.
[00:50:09.727 --> 00:50:10.187]  I get it.
[00:50:12.694 --> 00:50:16.395]  I've never seen anything like it, but it's what historians tell us.
[00:50:16.395 --> 00:50:32.001]  When you get a decadent country that's been based on free market and been based on being strong, it produces children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren that are the most snot-nosed, spoiled, rotten scum, and they always hate their mama!
[00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:37.043]  You got the NFL players hanging off, imagine America's a bitch, a dog.
[00:50:38.149 --> 00:50:38.930]  Okay?
[00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:40.831]  That's just a scientific name for a female dog.
[00:50:40.831 --> 00:50:45.174]  And you got all the NFL players, fattered and pigs, hanging off Mama's breast.
[00:50:45.174 --> 00:50:48.817]  I mean, some of these puppies are bigger than Mama.
[00:50:48.817 --> 00:50:51.579]  And they're saying, I hate this Mama!
[00:50:51.579 --> 00:50:59.305]  They walk over and kick her in the nose and stomp on her tail and Mama just sits there and they go, Mama's weak!
[00:50:59.305 --> 00:51:02.187]  Let's just go over and bite Mama's ears!
[00:51:02.187 --> 00:51:04.328]  Mama just lets them.
[00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:06.070]  They say, well we're not getting enough attention then.
[00:51:07.216 --> 00:51:13.261]  Hollywood and MSNBC tells us to get even more mad because of the undisputed racism in America.
[00:51:13.261 --> 00:51:16.503]  Yeah, 3,000 plus blacks shot in Chicago every year.
[00:51:16.503 --> 00:51:18.485]  95% of them by blacks.
[00:51:18.485 --> 00:51:19.566]  Let's not talk about that.
[00:51:19.566 --> 00:51:24.830]  Let's just bitch and moan and complain and buy a bunch of propaganda all day and kill the NFL.
[00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:25.911]  Let me tell you something.
[00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:30.617]  Within three more years, you'll have 20% of what you used to have.
[00:51:30.617 --> 00:51:31.817]  I love it.
[00:51:31.817 --> 00:51:35.039]  You're going to wonder why you're just like baseball or anything else.
[00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:37.380]  Just kill that sport, man.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.501]  They're trying to use that sport because folks know
[00:51:41.623 --> 00:51:42.683]  That Americans love it.
[00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:50.508]  The globalists know you love the NFL, so they poison the hell out of it, hoping you'll swallow it, but America is vomiting that crap out.
[00:51:50.508 --> 00:51:54.671]  And Stevie Wonder kneels in apparent support of peaceful protesters.
[00:51:54.671 --> 00:51:58.013]  Oh, peaceful protesters, the news says.
[00:51:58.013 --> 00:51:59.634]  Bunch of hijackers.
[00:51:59.634 --> 00:52:01.095]  You are peaceful.
[00:52:01.095 --> 00:52:02.576]  Peacefully hating America.
[00:52:02.576 --> 00:52:03.677]  We hate you.
[00:52:03.677 --> 00:52:04.658]  We get it.
[00:52:04.658 --> 00:52:05.298]  Good.
[00:52:05.298 --> 00:52:06.599]  We're not going to spend money with you.
[00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:09.461]  And you're like, oh my gosh, white supremacism, give me the money.
[00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:20.256]  So here's Bill Maher, monologue, talking about daughtered, which means old and senile, like Nancy Pelosi's a daughter.
[00:52:20.256 --> 00:52:26.140]  Bill Maher, monologue, says Trump is a daughter, and that he loved what Kim Jong-un said.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:33.145]  Kim Jong-un, just since he's been in, since 2009, they estimate has killed three million of his people.
[00:52:33.145 --> 00:52:36.167]  His daddy, they estimate, from the time that his father died in 1994,
[00:52:40.353 --> 00:52:42.594]  Killed something like 15 million?
[00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:45.015]  But Daddy killed even more.
[00:52:45.015 --> 00:52:46.355]  But it's okay.
[00:52:46.355 --> 00:52:49.256]  It's okay they don't have power in most of the country and people are slaves.
[00:52:49.256 --> 00:52:54.979]  It's not America so it's sexy to hate, to love North Korea.
[00:52:54.979 --> 00:52:59.280]  It's sexy to hate America.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.101]  That's just public executions of friends and family.
[00:53:02.101 --> 00:53:08.284]  But if you get into the slave camps and the deaths and all the unrecorded stuff, it's in the millions and the starving to death and cutting the food off, but it's okay.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.961]  Even his aides look like they have anorexia.
[00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:18.742]  But here's this little fat guy, literal vampire, a little tick.
[00:53:18.742 --> 00:53:22.563]  But doesn't matter, Bill Maher loves it.
[00:53:22.563 --> 00:53:30.144]  Because see, Trump's bad because he got $4 trillion in the stock market and got the jobs up and tried to take care of the troops and secure the borders.
[00:53:30.144 --> 00:53:31.364]  It's Trump that's bad.
[00:53:31.364 --> 00:53:34.665]  Here's Bill Maher reading off a teleprompter, another delicate genius.
[00:53:35.396 --> 00:53:43.682]  Trump and Kim Jong-un, fat man and little boy, as I say, they are shooting again.
[00:53:43.682 --> 00:53:47.545]  I love Kim.
[00:53:47.545 --> 00:53:55.191]  He called Trump a dotard, which is one of those words that people have stopped using, like presidential.
[00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:57.813]  Dotard.
[00:53:57.813 --> 00:54:00.175]  A dotard, dumbass.
[00:54:00.175 --> 00:54:02.437]  Dotard.
[00:54:02.437 --> 00:54:03.898]  Someone dotarding is a dotard.
[00:54:04.933 --> 00:54:08.635]  It's from Shakespeare, and Mr. President, if you're watching... From Shakespeare?
[00:54:08.635 --> 00:54:13.519]  Shakespeare was a guy a long time ago.
[00:54:13.519 --> 00:54:17.202]  Let's make everyone feel intellectual.
[00:54:17.202 --> 00:54:19.664]  Hi, I'm Bill Maher.
[00:54:19.664 --> 00:54:23.847]  We've had all week for writers to come out with me and read off a teleprompter.
[00:54:23.847 --> 00:54:27.250]  And then we've got a studio audience that thinks I'm really cool.
[00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.612]  Let me tell you about Shakespeare.
[00:54:31.121 --> 00:54:39.088]  He was a guy for Open Free Society that would hate someone like you, Bill Maher.
[00:54:39.088 --> 00:54:46.073]  You see, Shakespeare... ...was somebody that wanted a renaissance.
[00:54:46.073 --> 00:54:47.715]  And you people are trying to hold one back.
[00:54:50.285 --> 00:54:54.027]  Donald Trump's come out and warned that Kim Jong-un won't be around much longer.
[00:54:54.027 --> 00:54:55.628]  I haven't gotten to that yet.
[00:54:55.628 --> 00:54:56.909]  That's coming up in the first 20 minutes.
[00:54:56.909 --> 00:54:59.030]  We have a special guest joining us.
[00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:03.733]  North Korea says Donald Trump's Rocketman jibe means missile attacks on U.S.
[00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:07.475]  mainland inevitable.
[00:55:07.475 --> 00:55:08.416]  And U.S.
[00:55:08.416 --> 00:55:13.179]  B-2 bombers flew right across the border with North Korea and simulated nuclear attacks.
[00:55:15.452 --> 00:55:29.256]  But that's okay, we've got the NFL, and Hollywood, and even Fox News half the time now, all lined up, threatening America, and we've got Hollywood and the rest of them praising it, and loving it.
[00:55:29.256 --> 00:55:37.239]  Because see, we've been the slaves of Hollywood, and the slaves of the cult of the NFL, and slaves to professional sports.
[00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:39.280]  Look at Floyd Mayweather, he understands it.
[00:56:00.077 --> 00:56:02.860]  I wonder what Floyd Mayweather thinks about all this NFL grandstanding.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:10.470]  Well, he said it's a bunch of people jumped on a bandwagon to hate Trump because the establishment doesn't like him.
[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.755]  Never heard Trump was racist until he got into the presidency.
[00:56:14.755 --> 00:56:15.436]  Mayweather gets it.
[00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.591]  All these other jackasses don't.
[00:56:18.591 --> 00:56:22.895]  All the thug players, and I mean they're all thugs, the white ones are the worst, I've been around them.
[00:56:22.895 --> 00:56:27.879]  The biggest, dumbest, stupidest idiots that want to be celebrities, that think they're cool.
[00:56:27.879 --> 00:56:32.282]  They are just a curse on this country.
[00:56:32.282 --> 00:56:33.643]  Oh!
[00:56:33.643 --> 00:56:40.488]  Oh my, I mean NFL players are just the biggest jokes I've ever been around.
[00:56:40.488 --> 00:56:43.711]  They are just the scum of the earth.
[00:56:43.711 --> 00:56:45.232]  And thank God they're showing
[00:56:48.729 --> 00:56:53.371]  They're real colors against this country.
[00:56:53.371 --> 00:57:02.794]  Now before I go any further, I'm just going to spend a minute on this.
[00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:06.876]  Because Amazon doubled prices during all the earthquakes and hurricanes that we've seen.
[00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:11.758]  Now they got volcanoes going off in Mexico, by the way.
[00:57:11.758 --> 00:57:12.438]  Pray for those folks.
[00:57:13.422 --> 00:57:17.723]  We're cutting the cost of high-quality storable foods by 50%.
[00:57:17.723 --> 00:57:19.284]  This has got to end in the next few days.
[00:57:19.284 --> 00:57:24.445]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslunch.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:24.445 --> 00:57:31.167]  And we've got a lot of other great products that are discounted as well.

[00:57:32.548 --> 00:57:34.688]  Your purchase funds this operation.
[00:57:34.688 --> 00:57:35.869]  Second hour coming up.
[00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:39.970]  They're now conducting satanic rituals in public in London inside
[00:57:41.892 --> 00:57:43.933]  Catholic cathedrals, we got video of that.
[00:57:58.763 --> 00:58:02.086]  In many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:58:02.086 --> 00:58:08.732]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:58:08.732 --> 00:58:17.920]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.101]  We're good to go.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:53.083]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:58:53.083 --> 00:59:06.308]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:59:07.248 --> 00:59:19.134]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:59:19.134 --> 00:59:25.097]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:59:34.865 --> 00:59:48.055]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:59:48.055 --> 00:59:50.658]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:08.058]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:08.058 --> 01:00:09.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:26.828]  So, we have North Korea threatening to preemptively strike the United States and now saying an attack is coming and is inevitable at the United Nations yesterday.
[01:00:26.828 --> 01:00:30.251]  Oh yeah, they were doing speeches Saturday.
[01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:36.995]  North Korea postponed its Friday speech, waited until Saturday and said, we're going to preemptively attack you, it's inevitable.
[01:00:36.995 --> 01:00:38.636]  Of course, the United States is going to respond to that.
[01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.170]  That's the mental illness, the megalomania.
[01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:48.432]  You've been around, like, some guy starting to fight with you, and he's... and you know you can kick his ass, but he thinks he's invincible.
[01:00:48.432 --> 01:00:50.512]  Kind of like in Monty Python, the knight that goes neat.
[01:00:50.512 --> 01:00:56.973]  Even though his arms and legs are cut off, he still keeps marching forward.
[01:00:56.973 --> 01:00:59.574]  And I guess they think China and Russia are going to come in on their side.
[01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:02.554]  I guess they think the United States will blink.
[01:01:02.554 --> 01:01:05.215]  Just like Harry Truman did in 1953, not letting
[01:01:07.612 --> 01:01:11.433]  Douglas MacArthur would drop atomic bombs on them.
[01:01:11.433 --> 01:01:12.614]  But they're the ones starting it.
[01:01:12.614 --> 01:01:14.795]  They're the ones firing missiles over Japan.
[01:01:14.795 --> 01:01:17.896]  They're the ones putting this rhetoric out.
[01:01:17.896 --> 01:01:36.603]  And then meanwhile, the big story is, they've gone from four or five years ago, one player, Kaepernick, Bozo the Clown, wanting to be a little movie star and wanting to make Hollywood like him, saying whites are racist and whites are bad and America's bad, even though white
[01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:48.055]  Saviors, as he'd call them, raised him, and even though he's got $200 million, just from the NFL, I looked it up, it's like $200 million from the NFL, estimated $60 million from sponsors.
[01:01:48.055 --> 01:01:52.176]  I mean, $260 million, this is a horrible country!
[01:01:52.176 --> 01:02:01.199]  And the predominantly white fans coming and watching you play, and the whites that elected Trump, screw you, racists!
[01:02:01.199 --> 01:02:05.321]  And of course, this is all meant to divide America and social engineering by the globalists, to make whites racist.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.864]  No, what whites are is lazy, candy-ass, politically correct trash.
[01:02:12.864 --> 01:02:16.826]  Like, there's not much worse in this country than white people, you get to the end of the day.
[01:02:16.826 --> 01:02:18.467]  They're the ones all saying white people are the devil.
[01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:21.369]  They're the ones that came up with this race baiting to make everybody racist.
[01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:29.975]  I don't want to give an anti-white rant, but if you want one, I got one, because I've been watching who's leading all this, and they're a bunch of sociopaths, and I'm sick of them!
[01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:31.816]  Excuse me, let's go ahead and go to the President, here it is.
[01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:43.170]  Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out.
[01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:43.670]  He's fired.
[01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:46.032]  Get that son of a bitch off the frickin' field.
[01:02:46.032 --> 01:02:46.473]  He's fired!
[01:02:46.473 --> 01:02:48.775]  He can go do it outside on the street.
[01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:50.276]  Just be another Roydhead.
[01:02:50.276 --> 01:02:53.098]  So stupid you can't even wipe your fat ass!
[01:02:53.098 --> 01:02:55.120]  God, I'm sick of you filth!
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.802]  Oh, you make me want to throw up!
[01:02:56.802 --> 01:02:57.762]  What the hell?
[01:02:57.762 --> 01:03:00.425]  You got silver spoons hanging out your mouth, you...
[01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.888]  There's no other country like this, you dumb son-of-a-bitches!
[01:03:06.888 --> 01:03:09.551]  What the hell's your frickin' problem?
[01:03:09.551 --> 01:03:12.534]  The globalists want to blow it up because it's got a middle class!
[01:03:12.534 --> 01:03:16.658]  And once they blow up the middle class, there's nothing left, you dumb son-of-a-bitch!
[01:03:16.658 --> 01:03:21.122]  You know, some owner's gonna do that.
[01:03:21.122 --> 01:03:25.547]  He's gonna say, that guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired.
[01:03:26.841 --> 01:03:29.762]  And that owner, they don't know it.
[01:03:29.762 --> 01:03:30.282]  They don't know it.
[01:03:30.282 --> 01:03:32.443]  They're friends of mine, many of them.
[01:03:32.443 --> 01:03:32.903]  They don't know it.
[01:03:32.903 --> 01:03:34.664]  They'll be the most popular person for a week.
[01:03:34.664 --> 01:03:36.925]  If you don't like the damn flag, get out!
[01:03:36.925 --> 01:03:41.187]  Because that's a total disrespect of our heritage.
[01:03:41.187 --> 01:03:44.428]  If I was in Mexico and they had the anthem, I'd stand up for it.
[01:03:44.428 --> 01:03:46.088]  What is all this disrespect crap?
[01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:46.909]  I'm sick of it!
[01:03:46.909 --> 01:03:49.990]  If I was in Germany and they had it, I'd stand up for it.
[01:03:51.004 --> 01:03:52.645]  We have freedoms and we have freedoms.
[01:03:52.645 --> 01:03:55.628]  And these are Americans pissing on it!
[01:03:55.628 --> 01:03:58.390]  And we have the freedom to say F you scum.
[01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:01.813]  We, I swear to God, I'm at war with the NFL.
[01:04:01.813 --> 01:04:04.355]  Massively.
[01:04:04.355 --> 01:04:06.237]  Massively.
[01:04:06.237 --> 01:04:07.998]  The NFL ratings are down massively.
[01:04:07.998 --> 01:04:09.019]  Thank God, I love it.
[01:04:09.019 --> 01:04:12.062]  Another reason happens to be that they like watching what's happening on
[01:04:13.254 --> 01:04:13.615]  Oh, it's true.
[01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:15.157]  They know there's a real war for the country now.
[01:04:15.157 --> 01:04:15.838]  Exactly.
[01:04:15.838 --> 01:04:19.625]  Not some simulated combat crap with a bunch of roid heads.
[01:04:19.625 --> 01:04:22.590]  Because, you know, today if you hit too hard, right?
[01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.895]  If they hit too hard, 15 yards throw him out of the game.
[01:04:26.673 --> 01:04:27.433]  They had that last week.
[01:04:27.433 --> 01:04:29.614]  Well, you know why the NFL... Trump's smart here.
[01:04:29.614 --> 01:04:31.015]  When we come back, I'm talking about this.
[01:04:31.015 --> 01:04:33.596]  You know why the NFL actually rolled over politically six years ago?
[01:04:33.596 --> 01:04:35.057]  Because of the concussions.
[01:04:35.057 --> 01:04:38.279]  And they know the government's going to come after them if they're not political lapdogs.
[01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:39.459]  So that's why they sold out.
[01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.720]  They got blackmailed, you dumb assholes.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.061]  Excuse me.
[01:04:43.061 --> 01:04:45.302]  I'm really... Folks, I'm not doing that on purpose.
[01:04:45.302 --> 01:04:46.843]  Maybe I shouldn't be on air right now.
[01:04:46.843 --> 01:04:48.904]  Because I'm so pissed, I can barely be on air right now.
[01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:55.270]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[01:04:55.270 --> 01:05:01.434]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[01:05:01.434 --> 01:05:10.380]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.042]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:16.885]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[01:05:16.885 --> 01:05:20.588]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[01:05:20.588 --> 01:05:23.990]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:32.537]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[01:05:32.537 --> 01:05:34.018]  Such as global warming, for example.
[01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:43.387]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[01:05:43.387 --> 01:05:49.893]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[01:05:49.893 --> 01:05:51.094]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:05.813]  He never gives up.
[01:06:05.813 --> 01:06:12.117]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[01:06:12.117 --> 01:06:19.822]  I'm gonna get to North Korea in a moment, but let me give you the secret.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:47.351]  To why the NFL has gone from being an Americana mainstay, and this country's official religion is football, whether it's Friday Night Lights, Saturday Night Lights, Sunday Night Lights, all of it.
[01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:53.415]  It has been turned into a political brainwashing system where, remember when Hank Williams Jr.
[01:06:53.415 --> 01:06:57.337]  just went on Fox News and said Obama was anti-American?
[01:06:57.337 --> 01:06:58.338]  And he was fired!
[01:07:00.595 --> 01:07:05.416]  Fired off Monday Night Football just like that.
[01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:06.697]  And that was the beginning.
[01:07:06.697 --> 01:07:14.178]  And once the NFL gave in to that, oh, you've got concussions from high school, from car wrecks, from college.
[01:07:14.178 --> 01:07:15.599]  Of course, you're gladiators.
[01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:19.920]  That's why you're paid $20 million a year.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.701]  What do you think race car drivers are?
[01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:24.361]  People know folks are risking their lives.
[01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:28.914]  Quite frankly, that's what humans do, and we admire that.
[01:07:28.914 --> 01:07:29.875]  That's part of being human.
[01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:33.177]  You take that away, it's like taking gravity away.
[01:07:33.177 --> 01:07:35.339]  The muscles, the heart, it all falls apart.
[01:07:35.339 --> 01:07:39.542]  Danger is the ether in which we swim.
[01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:42.604]  So, what happened?
[01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:49.649]  You go back about six years ago, they had the Obama Justice Department circling around the NFL.
[01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:54.032]  Because they'd been meeting with the Attorney General at the time.
[01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:57.997]  Who'd met with Hollywood and met with the big TV producers.
[01:07:57.997 --> 01:07:59.038]  They met on C-SPAN.
[01:07:59.038 --> 01:08:02.320]  And he said, I want you to promise to literally brainwash.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.961]  This is a quote, we can play the video.
[01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:07.623]  I want you to promise to brainwash the American people against guns.
[01:08:07.623 --> 01:08:08.924]  Don't just do it once a week.
[01:08:08.924 --> 01:08:11.686]  Do it every episode, every day, constantly.
[01:08:11.686 --> 01:08:16.128]  That's your directive.
[01:08:16.128 --> 01:08:18.550]  Or we're going to investigate you for fake rating scandals.
[01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:21.272]  We're going to investigate you for fake ad revenue.
[01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:28.336]  We're going to investigate you for all sorts of stuff, but as long as you play ball, we're going to be nice.
[01:08:28.336 --> 01:08:33.841]  They used to send J. Edgar Hoover's people in to Hollywood, and if they didn't do just what he wanted, he'd have them shut down.
[01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:34.821]  And that's how it began.
[01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:36.383]  Hollywood's totally controlled.
[01:08:36.383 --> 01:08:40.006]  That's declassified, admit it.
[01:08:40.006 --> 01:08:51.335]  It is admitted that before Obama left, they ordered every media outlet in the country, fiction and non-fiction, HBO, Comedy Central, all the nightly shows to attack Alex Jones.
[01:08:52.239 --> 01:08:56.260]  That's why every program has a character that's supposedly Alex Jones.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.182]  The person says horrible things I never said to demonize the straw man.
[01:09:00.182 --> 01:09:02.883]  That was a directive.
[01:09:02.883 --> 01:09:07.464]  In many cases there's even government grants to pay for it.
[01:09:07.464 --> 01:09:08.885]  But they didn't have the NFL.
[01:09:09.901 --> 01:09:18.837]  And Americans were like, well, the owners tend to be conservative, and still it's pro-military and pro-America, and it was still a big corrupt spectacle.
[01:09:18.837 --> 01:09:22.203]  It's gotten more and more decadent, and I couldn't stand it, and most of you couldn't stand it.
[01:09:25.885 --> 01:09:30.527]  Then it got to a point where, oh my gosh, Trayvon Martin.
[01:09:30.527 --> 01:09:36.169]  So folks are taking a knee, even though four black witnesses said that he attacked Zimmerman.
[01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:38.249]  And I think Zimmerman did some weird stuff.
[01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:44.652]  I'm sure there's some white people shoot some black folks don't deserve it, but Zimmerman doesn't look too white to me.
[01:09:44.652 --> 01:09:49.053]  And nine out of 10 attacks on blacks are by blacks.
[01:09:49.053 --> 01:09:51.614]  It's actually like 97%, 95 in some areas.
[01:09:51.614 --> 01:09:54.535]  The point is those statistics are facts and I'm sad that's happening.
[01:09:55.762 --> 01:09:58.185]  I go around lobbying against black abortion.
[01:09:58.185 --> 01:10:00.709]  51% of blacks never get born.
[01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:04.394]  I go out and protest at the abortion clinics when a bunch of black ladies are going in.
[01:10:04.394 --> 01:10:06.257]  Not because I'm some hero.
[01:10:06.257 --> 01:10:09.021]  I don't want to kill babies.
[01:10:09.021 --> 01:10:10.923]  I'm not doing it to virtue signal.
[01:10:10.923 --> 01:10:11.725]  I'm doing it because I care.
[01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.848]  Because the same evil force trying to kill them wants to kill me.
[01:10:15.848 --> 01:10:18.591]  But it doesn't mean a bunch of hyped up black folks talk to hate me.
[01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:20.914]  It doesn't mean I'm gonna roll over to you and kiss your ass.
[01:10:20.914 --> 01:10:21.875]  Ain't gonna happen.
[01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:22.936]  I'm gonna straight shoot you.
[01:10:22.936 --> 01:10:24.898]  You're getting that straight shooting right now.
[01:10:24.898 --> 01:10:26.559]  If you want straight shooting, this is the place.
[01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:29.603]  If you want a bunch of bull, go someplace else and be an idiot!
[01:10:32.509 --> 01:10:34.630]  Black people on average aren't our problems.
[01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.710]  Let me tell you who honchos all this political correct crap.
[01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.890]  It's white people.
[01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:44.152]  And they do it because they know the average black, hispanic, or white person wants to get along and wants to be nice.
[01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:48.973]  And so they can add on to political correctness any political garbage they want.
[01:10:48.973 --> 01:10:52.834]  Like, being nice and not being racist is the engine.
[01:10:52.834 --> 01:10:56.295]  Is the 18-wheeler tractor.
[01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:59.056]  But the trailer is all the other BS we sign on to.
[01:10:59.056 --> 01:10:59.936]  The whole agenda.
[01:11:01.127 --> 01:11:02.828]  Support Obamacare, you're racist.
[01:11:02.828 --> 01:11:06.069]  It was written by Republican fat cats to triple prices.
[01:11:06.069 --> 01:11:07.330]  Doesn't matter, they call you a racist.
[01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:11.532]  I remember when I was fighting Obamacare, they go, well Alex Jones is deeply racist.
[01:11:11.532 --> 01:11:13.593]  There was no proof, they just said it.
[01:11:13.593 --> 01:11:16.054]  That was five years ago.
[01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:18.015]  And that's the script.
[01:11:18.015 --> 01:11:21.137]  I don't want everybody screwed over so I'm a bad guy.
[01:11:21.137 --> 01:11:22.437]  But it didn't work.
[01:11:22.437 --> 01:11:24.018]  So now they gotta increase the bullying.
[01:11:25.984 --> 01:11:40.210]  So they go and they worship the players, they give them all the support, and they do all this stuff, and the owners come out and say, yeah, have all these major teams stay in the locker room, don't come out with the National Anthem, because again, America's bad itself.
[01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:41.611]  It's an act of bullying.
[01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:45.852]  And most people doing it are steroid head morons.
[01:11:45.852 --> 01:11:49.874]  Every white player, every black player, I guess there's one Hispanic player that stood for the anthem.
[01:11:54.386 --> 01:11:59.411]  That's what this has been turned into, ladies and gentlemen, is a giant exercise in brainwashing.
[01:11:59.411 --> 01:12:12.604]  And what's happened is, the big secret, they don't want you to know, I saw it back at the time, the Justice Department went into the NFL and they said, you listen here, six years ago, they said, you run a gladiatorial sport.
[01:12:13.641 --> 01:12:26.671]  And the average person that plays in your league ends up being dead at about 50, 55 years old, and they've got all sorts of problems, and we're gonna shut you down unless you become wholly owned subsidiaries of our system.
[01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:37.079]  And the owners went, you're right, I don't want these liabilities, and I don't want the Justice Department leading this, and I want you to tell your federal judges to shut this down.
[01:12:37.079 --> 01:12:38.120]  See, my memory served right.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:38.681]  It's 53 to 59.
[01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:39.001]  Average that.
[01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:39.541]  What'd I say? 55.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.901]  Brain's still working.
[01:12:46.901 --> 01:12:48.902]  So.
[01:12:48.902 --> 01:12:49.923]  These are men.
[01:12:49.923 --> 01:12:51.383]  They make the decision to do that.
[01:12:51.383 --> 01:12:52.784]  You ban dangerous sports.
[01:12:52.784 --> 01:12:54.545]  You ban dangerous events.
[01:12:54.545 --> 01:12:55.665]  You ban rock climbing.
[01:12:55.665 --> 01:12:56.986]  You ban skydiving.
[01:12:56.986 --> 01:12:58.507]  You ban boxing.
[01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.628]  Baby, that's what we've always done.
[01:13:00.628 --> 01:13:02.749]  None of us are getting out of this alive.
[01:13:02.749 --> 01:13:08.852]  The nanny state's meant to shut down normal human activity and normal striving.
[01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:11.333]  But the NFL became a cupped group.
[01:13:13.462 --> 01:13:16.365]  And they were blackmailed into becoming political, and I mean it.
[01:13:16.365 --> 01:13:23.514]  And once they took over, five and a half, six years ago, it was boom, suddenly every ad, because they approved the ads.
[01:13:23.514 --> 01:13:25.736]  Remember they would refuse conservative or Christian ads?
[01:13:25.736 --> 01:13:31.483]  But they'd run ads where, like, five ads in a row were anti-father on Father's Day.
[01:13:31.483 --> 01:13:33.705]  The next week it'd be nothing but anti-gun ads.
[01:13:34.565 --> 01:13:41.787]  And it was just Hollywood and the big media and the big Google tech giants just all ganging up!
[01:13:41.787 --> 01:13:43.727]  It doesn't mean America's perfect!
[01:13:43.727 --> 01:13:45.708]  Doesn't mean we didn't have Wounded Knee!
[01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:47.568]  Doesn't mean we don't have a bad past!
[01:13:47.568 --> 01:13:49.449]  Everybody's got a bad past!
[01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:54.910]  But we had something called free market and striving that was truly liberal!
[01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:59.491]  And the globalists want that shut down more than anything!
[01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:00.692]  Let's back Trump's statement up.
[01:14:00.692 --> 01:14:01.832]  I want to play just the first 30 seconds.
[01:14:03.643 --> 01:14:14.972]  Boy, you got free space to do whatever you want, but if you're working for a company, and you're doing something out there, and then they can fine you for spiking the football, but they can't fine you or kick you out for saying, I hate America?
[01:14:14.972 --> 01:14:17.694]  Listen, if you hate it so much, get out!
[01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:19.595]  You got a right to get out!
[01:14:19.595 --> 01:14:32.145]  You got a right to criticize stuff going wrong in the country, but when you say it's fundamentally bad, and you won't stand for the anthem in London, for your own country, but you'll stand for God Save the Queen?
[01:14:34.079 --> 01:14:37.524]  You are disgraceful trash.
[01:14:37.524 --> 01:14:38.646]  But hey, I can't blame you.
[01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:42.972]  You grew up in the modern society, but I know this.
[01:14:42.972 --> 01:14:46.698]  You haven't gotten any of my money in 20 years.
[01:14:46.698 --> 01:14:49.302]  I'm somebody who used to go watch Dallas Cowboy Games growing up as a kid.
[01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:57.703]  But again, my grandfather was basically, I mean, Tom Landry used to call him almost every Sunday.
[01:14:57.703 --> 01:14:59.183]  They'd pray over the phone.
[01:14:59.183 --> 01:15:03.085]  So I grew up, you know, America, America's team, Tom Landry, all this crap.
[01:15:03.085 --> 01:15:06.346]  It was okay back then, but still, it wasn't really America.
[01:15:06.346 --> 01:15:09.347]  Tom Landry and the Dallas Cowboys wasn't really America, folks.
[01:15:09.347 --> 01:15:10.468]  John Wayne wasn't America.
[01:15:10.468 --> 01:15:11.508]  He was an actor.
[01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:12.868]  Not putting down John Wayne.
[01:15:12.868 --> 01:15:17.090]  This country is, and who we are, what we stand for, all of us are America.
[01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:21.072]  And I'm not going to sit here while the NFL steals that legacy anymore.
[01:15:21.072 --> 01:15:22.052]  Here's the clip as we go to break.
[01:15:22.412 --> 01:15:31.794]  Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, get that son of a bitch off the field right now.
[01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:32.074]  Out.
[01:15:32.074 --> 01:15:34.075]  He's fired.
[01:15:34.075 --> 01:15:34.995]  He's fired!
[01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:40.737]  Can you imagine what Tom Landry would do?
[01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:45.498]  If the team, he'd say, there's no game.
[01:15:45.498 --> 01:15:48.359]  And if they fired Tom Landry, he'd be gone right there.
[01:15:48.359 --> 01:15:49.339]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:49.339 --> 01:15:49.699]  Stay with us.

[01:16:52.564 --> 01:16:54.584]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:16:54.584 --> 01:16:57.506]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:16:57.506 --> 01:17:03.568]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:17:03.568 --> 01:17:12.751]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.

[01:17:20.276 --> 01:17:28.305]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:17:28.305 --> 01:17:29.327]  The general public doesn't.
[01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:34.432]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:17:34.432 --> 01:17:37.995]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:17:37.995 --> 01:17:44.718]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[01:18:53.545 --> 01:18:57.308]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:18:57.308 --> 01:19:05.053]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:13.659]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:19:13.659 --> 01:19:18.082]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:19:18.082 --> 01:19:23.245]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:19:23.285 --> 01:19:23.785]  We're good to go.
[01:19:54.537 --> 01:20:08.447]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:08.447 --> 01:20:16.633]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the NBA.
[01:20:22.074 --> 01:20:28.016]  Again, the globalists want to break national sovereignty because they want to absolutely destroy any nation-state.
[01:20:28.016 --> 01:20:30.537]  They want total planetary corporate dominance.
[01:20:30.537 --> 01:20:32.838]  They're committing incredible crimes across the globe.
[01:20:32.838 --> 01:20:35.599]  They're doing horrible things continually.
[01:20:35.599 --> 01:20:46.883]  They're funding dictators, suicide net-laced factories, you know, that Apple owns where they have suicide nets in the stairways and around the buildings because it's so horrible and people are committing suicide.
[01:20:48.117 --> 01:20:50.999]  They're building a very, very nasty world.
[01:20:50.999 --> 01:21:02.925]  And now they've gotten spoiled, rotten, decadent NFL on this whole race war bandwagon when America elected a black president to use that to drive a wedge into the country.
[01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:08.388]  And along comes Trump saying, let's unify the nation around free market, around jobs, and around a future.
[01:21:08.388 --> 01:21:12.090]  And he delivers in his first eight months to a great extent.
[01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:15.992]  And Hollywood howls with anger, sides with North Korea.
[01:21:16.832 --> 01:21:34.243]  I want to talk about this in this segment with Shepard Ambulus and then we're going to come back into his big story for intelhub.com or intellihub.com that was linked on drudgereport.com Friday and Saturday and got over a million readers just on our site alone.
[01:21:34.243 --> 01:21:38.786]  Though the comments have been not broken on InfoWars but you can't see the number of comments but they're all there.
[01:21:38.786 --> 01:21:39.726]  We're getting that fixed right now.
[01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:51.825]  I've noticed a theme where Satanists admit, but also Islamicists, that they like to take over Christian churches and then conduct their rituals inside of them.
[01:21:51.825 --> 01:21:54.367]  That adds to the blasphemy.
[01:21:54.367 --> 01:22:00.392]  And so now at a major Catholic church in London, they did a big satanic ritual that was in the British News, but broke here.
[01:22:00.392 --> 01:22:07.357]  We have photos and video of that, showing them doing the rituals, calling it a fashion show inside the church.
[01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:10.080]  So this just shows the whole degradation and decadence
[01:22:11.257 --> 01:22:11.877]  That goes on.
[01:22:11.877 --> 01:22:17.321]  The headline is Illuminati-themed fashion show held at London Catholic Church.
[01:22:17.321 --> 01:22:27.167]  We'll talk to Shepard Ambulas about that in the next segment, but first I want to go to Shepard, a great investigative journalist who's broken so many big stories at intelhub.com and infowars.com.
[01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:32.171]  I wanted to ask him, just overall, we haven't talked in probably a year on the phone.
[01:22:32.171 --> 01:22:38.255]  We've both been busy, but I've been working with Shepard for like more than 10 years off and on, broken a lot of big stories.
[01:22:39.423 --> 01:22:48.271]  Shepard, where would you call the demarcation line we're in right now in this fight against globalism?
[01:22:48.271 --> 01:23:02.985]  There's a huge awakening happening, but a huge counter-strike by globalists, where Trump is getting a lot done, going sideways a little, but the enemies only attack more, because the things he's saying are so powerful and so damaging to their brainwashing.
[01:23:02.985 --> 01:23:04.706]  I mean, this is an amazing time.
[01:23:05.507 --> 01:23:08.552]  So instead of getting into your big story up front, let's do it in the next segment.
[01:23:08.552 --> 01:23:09.794]  What do you make of the NFL?
[01:23:09.794 --> 01:23:11.918]  What do you make of North Korea?
[01:23:11.918 --> 01:23:13.721]  What do you make of Hollywood?
[01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:18.429]  Hundreds of so-called stars siding with Kim Jong-un who makes Hitler
[01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:23.196]  You know, look, compassionate.
[01:23:23.196 --> 01:23:39.509]  I mean, it's just, it's so crazy to see the split, where so many people awake of every race, color, and creed, all humans with red blood, to see Trump trying to unify us around the flag, trying to take the American flag back from globalists, and use it as a symbol of good again, and to watch them so pissed.
[01:23:39.509 --> 01:23:40.570]  What is this?
[01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:41.391]  You're a smart guy.
[01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:42.932]  I don't just patronize you.
[01:23:42.932 --> 01:23:44.333]  You're an attuned fella.
[01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:46.435]  What does your gut tell you about where we really are, Shepard?
[01:23:47.403 --> 01:23:50.525]  We're in an absolute turning point, Alex.
[01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:54.067]  It's do or die right now.
[01:23:54.067 --> 01:24:07.635]  If people don't push right now harder than ever to stand up for themselves, to stand up for their rights, for freedom, just for what's right, for good and not evil.
[01:24:07.635 --> 01:24:13.059]  If people don't make a major push, a concerted effort right now,
[01:24:13.777 --> 01:24:14.397]  We're good to go.
[01:24:32.743 --> 01:24:44.593]  Their whole entire thought process mixed with all the 3G interference that we got coming through the air.
[01:24:44.593 --> 01:24:47.656]  Oh Shepard, I was about to add what you say is so key.
[01:24:47.656 --> 01:24:49.137]  Cancer rates massively up.
[01:24:49.137 --> 01:24:51.039]  Diabetes massively up.
[01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:52.220]  It's all electromagnetic.
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.541]  The chemicals, all of it.
[01:24:54.802 --> 01:24:56.083]  And the media spun it.
[01:24:56.083 --> 01:25:00.507]  I said, Jimmy Kimmel, stop blaming health care for what happened to your son.
[01:25:00.507 --> 01:25:03.730]  Learn why birth defects, including congenital heart defects, are way up.
[01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.312]  I have the news articles here.
[01:25:05.312 --> 01:25:08.134]  They said that I made fun of him and his wife and blamed them.
[01:25:08.134 --> 01:25:08.855]  I didn't blame them.
[01:25:08.855 --> 01:25:10.917]  I said, Kimmel, do some good.
[01:25:10.917 --> 01:25:13.199]  Show why birth defects are skyrocketing.
[01:25:13.199 --> 01:25:14.040]  That's coming up as well.
[01:25:14.963 --> 01:25:21.493]  Well look, these telecommunications giants, they want to now go from 3G to 5G.
[01:25:21.493 --> 01:25:25.659]  And they want to have the whole entire system done by 2020, 2023, something like that.
[01:25:25.659 --> 01:25:27.041]  So, they're making a major push.
[01:25:30.786 --> 01:25:33.068]  It's what they have to do, Alex.
[01:25:33.068 --> 01:25:34.649]  They actually have to.
[01:25:34.649 --> 01:25:39.011]  The whole entire 3G infrastructure is used for 5G.
[01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:46.856]  They literally have to upgrade, not even upgrade, they have to replace and change out the entire infrastructure.
[01:25:46.856 --> 01:25:50.799]  And let's be clear, they know all of it is giving us cancer.
[01:25:50.799 --> 01:25:52.520]  And we have our own documents, Shepard.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.340]  It's by design.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.241]  What is their master plan?
[01:25:55.066 --> 01:26:08.213]  Well, one that had a leak on the project that's basically heading us up, you know, he openly admitted, I don't know his name right now, but he openly admitted that this is going to generate
[01:26:08.823 --> 01:26:11.805]  You know, trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:26:11.805 --> 01:26:12.946]  This is a new industry.
[01:26:12.946 --> 01:26:13.727]  They don't care.
[01:26:13.727 --> 01:26:16.409]  He said it's all about the money.
[01:26:16.409 --> 01:26:26.156]  For folks who don't know, it's mainstream Washington Post scientific reports that even 3G vibrates DNA, causing it to break, accelerating cancer.
[01:26:29.609 --> 01:26:33.974]  Not only do they want to have faster internet speeds, but people can just be distracted.
[01:26:33.974 --> 01:26:36.116]  But it's okay, look at the LA Times.
[01:26:36.116 --> 01:26:38.158]  Is 5G technology dangerous?
[01:26:38.158 --> 01:26:43.903]  Early data shows a slight increase of tumors in male rats exposed to cell phone radiation.
[01:26:43.903 --> 01:26:45.625]  They knew back in the beginning.
[01:26:47.975 --> 01:26:52.580]  Oh yeah, you can almost feel it in the air and imagine when there's basically barbeque.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.003]  You go around town, you go anywhere you go.
[01:26:55.003 --> 01:27:03.152]  3G Shepard in major German and Chinese studies causes massive deformities in first generation aphids and fruit flies.
[01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:13.262]  Well, they're gonna start popping these antennas up literally like, like, you know, 100, 200 feet away from your apartment complex, your home, schoolyard.
[01:27:13.262 --> 01:27:14.824]  They're already pretty much everywhere.
[01:27:14.824 --> 01:27:17.287]  You know, while you're pumping gas, you're getting radiated.
[01:27:17.287 --> 01:27:20.471]  I mean, we're talking about high level.
[01:27:20.471 --> 01:27:22.234]  And here's the deal.
[01:27:23.168 --> 01:27:27.290]  That's why I got you on, because you're always getting to this subject, and I knew I'd get into the Satanism.
[01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:35.734]  The globalists believe they're channeling an interdimensional being that has told them if they kill the majority of us, they'll be given godhood and secret technology.
[01:27:35.734 --> 01:27:41.076]  Now, humans have already basically built, little g, image of God, super tech.
[01:27:41.076 --> 01:27:45.698]  We are at the threshold of demigod status, just with our technology.
[01:27:45.698 --> 01:27:50.940]  The globalists do not intend for us to get that shepherd, and whether people believe in Satan or not, this is the plan.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:51.901]  We are being exterminated.
[01:27:52.898 --> 01:27:56.080]  Well, they want to keep the god-like power for themselves.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.382]  They want to be able to control all the weather on the planet.
[01:28:00.382 --> 01:28:01.322]  Use it as a weapon.
[01:28:01.322 --> 01:28:03.183]  They want to use it to control.
[01:28:03.183 --> 01:28:04.644]  I don't know if you've ever heard of the game.
[01:28:04.644 --> 01:28:07.205]  It's like an old video game back in the day.
[01:28:07.205 --> 01:28:09.767]  When I was a kid, I used to play this called Populous.
[01:28:09.767 --> 01:28:13.068]  And what you could do is essentially play like your god.
[01:28:13.068 --> 01:28:19.431]  You can create your own colonies and, you know, create drought, starvation, famine, all this stuff.
[01:28:19.431 --> 01:28:20.432]  This is what these
[01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:30.110]  The globalists are doing a lot of very wealthy people, they're engaging in these activities where they seek these god-like powers.
[01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:32.111]  They now have these god-like powers.
[01:28:32.111 --> 01:28:39.453]  They're now testing on these god-like powers, using them in ways that you could never imagine before.
[01:28:39.453 --> 01:28:41.694]  That's right, Shepard Ambulas, stay there.
[01:28:41.694 --> 01:28:47.056]  And now they desecrate the American flag in London while worshipping the Queen at the NFL.
[01:28:47.056 --> 01:28:47.436]  Stay with us.
[01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:59.439]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:28:59.439 --> 01:29:07.827]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:29:07.827 --> 01:29:12.511]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:33.686]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[01:31:56.997 --> 01:31:59.539]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists.

[01:32:33.187 --> 01:32:35.229]  And this part is most important.

[01:32:42.034 --> 01:32:43.477]  That means it's clean.
[01:32:43.477 --> 01:32:44.598]  That means it's pure.

[01:32:50.307 --> 01:32:53.993]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:32:53.993 --> 01:32:56.617]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.203 --> 01:33:21.884]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:21.884 --> 01:33:23.545]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:23.545 --> 01:33:29.528]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.528 --> 01:33:36.032]  So, the LA Times, the Washington Post, they all report cell phones do give you brain cancer.
[01:33:36.032 --> 01:33:40.234]  And those articles always come out, and then later they go, oh, but maybe it's questionable.
[01:33:40.234 --> 01:33:42.255]  Well, brain tumors are way up.
[01:33:42.255 --> 01:33:43.376]  Sperm counts are way down.
[01:33:43.376 --> 01:33:46.257]  We're dying.
[01:33:46.257 --> 01:33:49.339]  And the facts are that these are high-powered
[01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.833]  Microwave Relay Systems.
[01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:54.896]  And now they're going to 5G.
[01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:55.777]  Here's some of the articles.
[01:33:55.777 --> 01:33:57.258]  Is 5G technology dangerous?
[01:33:57.258 --> 01:34:00.462]  Even early data shows a slight increase.
[01:34:00.462 --> 01:34:02.084]  Just a slight though.
[01:34:02.084 --> 01:34:05.528]  In male rats exposed to cell phone radiation.
[01:34:05.528 --> 01:34:07.470]  But that's just a little bit.
[01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:08.832]  Not all the different systems.
[01:34:10.131 --> 01:34:12.732]  The bottom line, they know this is going on.
[01:34:12.732 --> 01:34:34.602]  So the reason I raise that is Shepard Ambulance, investigative reporter that allows us to post this great work at InfoWars.com with IntelHub.com, found public info just this week on major British TV and print, not giving it any attention here in the West, they were having at a big Catholic church, an Illuminati satanic themed event that looked just like Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:37.803]  Now if you understand black magic, whether you believe in the devil or not,
[01:34:39.042 --> 01:34:42.766]  You want to do it in front of everyone, throwing it in their face.
[01:34:42.766 --> 01:34:49.353]  And much of Satanism is about desecrating holy artifacts or doing it in a church.
[01:34:49.353 --> 01:34:50.674]  And then you notice they look like clowns.
[01:34:50.674 --> 01:34:52.115]  They're kind of dressed in clown outfits.
[01:34:52.115 --> 01:34:53.156]  If you go back to ancient
[01:34:54.085 --> 01:34:54.706]  I don't
[01:35:14.093 --> 01:35:17.478]  Next time you get via Skype, we'd love to have you back on your own phone right now.
[01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:21.823]  We're going to go through Illuminati-themed fashion show held at London Catholic Church.
[01:35:21.823 --> 01:35:29.593]  Walk us through who did it, what they were doing, and just how this is part of this new trend of churches renting things out to Satanists.
[01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:32.033]  Alex, it's unbelievable.
[01:35:32.033 --> 01:35:38.357]  Just like you said, Dilara Fendi Koglu, she's a Turkish designer.
[01:35:38.357 --> 01:35:46.042]  She was putting on a show for London Fashion Week last Monday where she revealed her Spring-Summer 2018 collection.
[01:35:47.803 --> 01:35:55.729]  It's basically all demon-esque, vampire-esque, Tim Burton, Nightmare Before Christmas style.
[01:35:55.729 --> 01:36:03.214]  You know, it's almost mixed with like that Italian metal band, Lacuna Coil look.
[01:36:03.214 --> 01:36:15.323]  All of the models, they were pretty average looking, had their faces painted up, very pale, very... You know, what they are is ugly, weak nobodies trying to look like Hit The Clown, and they're all really begging to have their necks broken.
[01:36:16.147 --> 01:36:18.490]  Well, and they act like the average person's gonna wear this.
[01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:29.182]  I mean, you're really not gonna see anyone in this type of attire except for, like, a Rihanna, maybe a... Well, no, this is the classic attire worn when you torture children to death.
[01:36:29.182 --> 01:36:29.903]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:29.903 --> 01:36:30.443]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:30.443 --> 01:36:35.129]  Before this came out a week ago, I said they wear these outfits from our research during Satanism.
[01:36:36.269 --> 01:36:40.071]  It literally resembles, you know, total Satanism, the devil.
[01:36:40.071 --> 01:36:50.637]  The altar at this church, of course, had twin Masonic pillars, the big G, you know, the Masonic logo.
[01:36:50.637 --> 01:36:57.720]  And I want to be clear, I'm not defending Masonry, but it's just a mystery school, going back to when colleges were secret, because you couldn't just get into them and give up the knowledge.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.063]  Masonry in the last 400 years was somewhat Christian.
[01:37:02.063 --> 01:37:03.204]  It got taken over.
[01:37:03.204 --> 01:37:04.485]  George Washington wrote about it.
[01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:11.573]  So them mixing in Masonic iconography into the Satanism, they're telling you we've conquered the whole Masonic system as well.
[01:37:11.573 --> 01:37:14.656]  They're telling you we've conquered the Masonic lodge.
[01:37:14.656 --> 01:37:17.199]  So where are the Masons saying no to this?
[01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:18.841]  See, they're not, because they've been conquered.
[01:37:19.904 --> 01:37:44.082]  Well, exactly, and Delara, the designer, she went on Instagram and posted some of these images of her models, but she posted an image of the altar, which she titled, Seven Sisters of the Inherited Sun, and also put a little phrase in there, Summoning Theons of 21 Souls of Society.
[01:37:44.082 --> 01:37:45.864]  This was all done at the St.
[01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:46.264]  Andrew's
[01:37:47.859 --> 01:37:51.623]  Holborn Church in Holborn Parish in London.
[01:37:51.623 --> 01:38:03.196]  The church is a denomination of the Church of England, Alex, and its churchmanship is listed as modern Catholic, which basically bleeds over into Anglo-Catholic or Angelican.
[01:38:03.897 --> 01:38:09.600]  Sure, and we've got major churches, both Protestant and Catholic, worldwide condemning the Pope.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.543]  I've got that in my stack, pointing out that he is literally a totally apostate.
[01:38:14.543 --> 01:38:18.705]  He can be another religion if he wants, but he is not a Christian, he is not a Catholic.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:28.685]  Well, and I even got trolled, of course, by Catholics who are trying to claim this church isn't Catholic, and they're trying to say it's just straight Evangelical.
[01:38:28.685 --> 01:38:36.530]  But, you know, you can go look at the listings for yourself on Wikipedia and in the London Guardian and all that.
[01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:47.997]  But, you know, to hold this, essentially, it's a black mask disguised as a fashion show in this church in London, right out in the open.
[01:38:49.097 --> 01:38:54.360]  It can only be a push to normalize Satanism.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:39:06.827]  Well, obviously, if you read Satanic Bibles and deeper Satanic texts, and some of the stuff you can't even find in bookstores that I've read over the years, it says you want to do it in a church for maximum effect.
[01:39:06.827 --> 01:39:12.330]  That's what real Satanism is, is torture a little kid to death while they beg for mommy in a church.
[01:39:13.653 --> 01:39:17.495]  Right out, right out in the open, right out in front of everyone, of course.
[01:39:17.495 --> 01:39:23.798]  Then, uh, everyone sees us, these, uh, Hollywood types, these, uh... Just like Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:23.798 --> 01:39:27.720]  Tell you it's not really a child, and the word is, sometimes it is.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:41.347]  Well, yeah, and then, and then you, they glorify it in, in Hollywood, and all this fashion, and then that trickles down into society, and to society, and, uh, apparently it's pretty much decimated it, you know, in the last, uh, several, several years.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.845]  Why do you think they're coming out in the open so much?
[01:39:45.845 --> 01:39:53.083]  I see it as a sign of weakness because they know the life force of humanity, that is just common sense, is struggling against this culture of death.
[01:39:54.065 --> 01:39:54.345]  It is.
[01:39:54.345 --> 01:39:56.107]  I couldn't have said it better myself, Alex.
[01:39:56.107 --> 01:39:58.230]  It's exactly that.
[01:39:58.230 --> 01:39:59.591]  It's a total sign of weakness.
[01:39:59.591 --> 01:40:00.633]  They're scared.
[01:40:00.633 --> 01:40:03.536]  There's nowhere else for them to go.
[01:40:03.536 --> 01:40:07.841]  They've tried to confront everything they can.
[01:40:07.841 --> 01:40:10.344]  They're trying to confront Trump on every level.
[01:40:10.344 --> 01:40:13.367]  They're basically to the point where they're going to fabricate.
[01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.910]  I don't know.
[01:40:32.608 --> 01:40:34.089]  What do you expect to happen next?
[01:40:34.089 --> 01:40:36.790]  I mean, notice the globalists have deep state ties to North Korea.
[01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:38.410]  The globalists put China in power.
[01:40:38.410 --> 01:40:47.894]  They've got him challenging Trump as well, threatening a preemptive strike on America, having his ambassador say yesterday at the UN, an attack on America is inevitable.
[01:40:47.894 --> 01:40:50.775]  An attack on the mainland, preemptively, is inevitable.
[01:40:50.775 --> 01:40:52.896]  If I point a gun at you, Shepard,
[01:40:53.596 --> 01:40:56.958]  And I say, it's inevitable I'm going to pull the trigger and blow your head off.
[01:40:56.958 --> 01:41:03.741]  Shepard, I'm not doing that literally, but if I did, you would have a right to shoot me because I've got a gun pointed at your head saying I'm going to kill you, Shepard.
[01:41:03.741 --> 01:41:05.062]  Absolutely.
[01:41:05.062 --> 01:41:06.723]  You know, and it's just...
[01:41:08.049 --> 01:41:12.151]  Well, what they're doing too is they're ramping all this up and it's going to come to a turning point.
[01:41:12.151 --> 01:41:19.854]  They recently warned residents in Hawaii, like, look, you guys better be prepared because something might happen now.
[01:41:19.854 --> 01:41:23.355]  This bulletin went out for the month of September.
[01:41:23.955 --> 01:41:31.319]  And it was a message from the President to the residents of Hawaii, and it said, get ready, you know, this could go down.
[01:41:31.319 --> 01:41:40.164]  It was the date of the month of September, you know, so we might be... I mean, look, how many days do we have left in September?
[01:41:40.164 --> 01:41:51.710]  You know, I mean, we could be counting down to who knows what, but I mean, surely this guy, he's coming out, he's posturing, he's on a mission.
[01:41:52.811 --> 01:41:56.712]  To get these rockets, uh, you know, going so that they can hit the mainland.
[01:41:56.712 --> 01:42:08.837]  What he wants to do, ultimately, probably, is just use this leverage, um, to say, look, you know, we've achieved this, you know, we're now considered kind of a superpower.
[01:42:08.837 --> 01:42:10.717]  Uh, look what we can do.
[01:42:10.717 --> 01:42:21.281]  Now, now we have some bargaining leverage on the table at the UN, but, but, you know, do you give this guy, as the Trump administration, do you give this guy the chance
[01:42:21.901 --> 01:42:29.427]  To gain that leverage on you if all he's done is go around pushing his way around with his people, pushing his way around with the U.S.
[01:42:29.427 --> 01:42:41.998]  And again, he's the little hereditary ruler over tens of millions of slaves and Hollywood's praising him, saying, please come here, comes young, we'll trade you, let Trump run your country, come run us.
[01:42:41.998 --> 01:42:42.858]  What?
[01:42:42.858 --> 01:42:46.361]  I mean, that just shows Hollywood is beyond redemption.
[01:42:46.361 --> 01:42:49.344]  They are our mortal enemies, literally.
[01:42:50.489 --> 01:43:01.097]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:43:01.097 --> 01:43:03.159]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.

[01:43:06.021 --> 01:43:07.502]  It's made in the USA.
[01:43:07.502 --> 01:43:10.645]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:43:10.865 --> 01:43:11.306]  Absolutely.
[01:43:31.243 --> 01:43:42.937]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:43:42.937 --> 01:43:46.220]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[01:46:54.856 --> 01:46:57.538]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.693 --> 01:47:08.656]  They take the most uncool people and put them on a pedestal.
[01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:11.878]  They teach us to worship them.
[01:47:11.878 --> 01:47:13.059]  Hollywood.
[01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:13.619]  The NFL.
[01:47:13.619 --> 01:47:14.019]  All of them.
[01:47:17.623 --> 01:47:20.146]  To make you feel like you haven't attained anything.
[01:47:20.146 --> 01:47:22.528]  You attained something not being damned.
[01:47:22.528 --> 01:47:26.232]  Thank God, we're not the NFL trash.
[01:47:26.232 --> 01:47:29.135]  Until the prison cracked.
[01:47:29.135 --> 01:47:33.759]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:33.759 --> 01:47:36.102]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:36.102 --> 01:47:38.504]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:38.504 --> 01:47:39.765]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.667 --> 01:47:43.068]  And the resistance is this.
[01:47:43.068 --> 01:47:46.589]  Pediatric cancers are up now 15,000 percent.
[01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:47.109]  I keep saying 10,000.
[01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:48.390]  It's well above 15,000.
[01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:57.573]  There's clearly some evil force running globalism that's poisoning and killing us on purpose and just doing horrible things.
[01:47:57.573 --> 01:48:08.678]  They've got the NFL everywhere with like multiple teams not even coming out on the field hating the American flag as if they got something better to replace it with and it's all funded by globalists.
[01:48:09.807 --> 01:48:16.550]  To replace it with shadowy world government that's tax-exempt.
[01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:22.253]  You got North Korea saying, we will nuke you first, let's go.
[01:48:22.253 --> 01:48:25.615]  Total mental illness with like a obese woodchuck saying it.
[01:48:26.618 --> 01:48:31.680]  Meanwhile, you've got top auditor claims Vatican axed him for probing illegal activity.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.481]  That's out of Yahoo News, Reuters.
[01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:34.022]  Here's another one.
[01:48:34.022 --> 01:48:38.284]  Conservative Roman Catholic theologians accuse Pope of spreading heresy.
[01:48:38.284 --> 01:48:42.746]  Hell, he says, I'm disgusted by Europe's Christian roots.
[01:48:42.746 --> 01:48:47.188]  What?
[01:48:47.188 --> 01:48:48.209]  He's certainly a hypocrite.
[01:48:48.209 --> 01:48:52.891]  He says we need to bring in millions more North Africans into Italy every year, but has a big wall around his house.
[01:48:54.773 --> 01:48:55.754]  He's a globalist operative.
[01:48:55.754 --> 01:48:58.976]  They use their sex operatives, pedophile rings, to control the Vatican.
[01:48:58.976 --> 01:48:59.817]  That's even in the Guardian.
[01:48:59.817 --> 01:49:00.878]  They put him in.
[01:49:00.878 --> 01:49:05.101]  His adjunct procured over a hundred little boys in kidnap rings.
[01:49:05.101 --> 01:49:12.007]  Now whether he uses the boys to get control or whether he likes to imbibe in it or not, he's a pedophile god.
[01:49:12.007 --> 01:49:14.729]  Oh, we're in deep trouble.
[01:49:16.328 --> 01:49:18.670]  The symbol of Americana.
[01:49:18.670 --> 01:49:23.794]  Which I always said, it's dangerous to make the NFL the symbol of Americana, because they can take that over.
[01:49:23.794 --> 01:49:24.915]  Woo!
[01:49:24.915 --> 01:49:26.396]  They did!
[01:49:26.396 --> 01:49:30.319]  And they now piss on the American flag.
[01:49:30.319 --> 01:49:38.425]  And at major churches in England, they have open satanic rituals, and they put it on television.
[01:49:38.425 --> 01:49:42.368]  Shepard Ambulas, investigative reporter for intelhub.com.
[01:49:42.368 --> 01:49:45.570]  The story's on newswars.com and drudgereport.com.
[01:49:46.991 --> 01:49:56.674]  People can make jokes about this, but when I go out to these events and cover this, these occultists take their Satanism very, very serious, and they're into not caring.
[01:49:56.674 --> 01:50:00.136]  They see the fact that we have a conscience and care as a weakness.
[01:50:00.136 --> 01:50:03.397]  So they use political correctness to manipulate us as a big joke.
[01:50:03.397 --> 01:50:10.219]  That's why we have to recognize political correctness as a fraud and a lie, and truly be good people and reject this fraud.
[01:50:10.219 --> 01:50:13.200]  They use our morals against us, Shepard.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.341]  How do we transcend that?
[01:50:15.805 --> 01:50:20.026]  Well, just with perseverance and persistence.
[01:50:20.026 --> 01:50:21.847]  And it's going to be hard.
[01:50:21.847 --> 01:50:28.809]  Their whole goal is to essentially turn us into a mindless race of worker bees.
[01:50:28.809 --> 01:50:29.489]  Sexless!
[01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.689]  And as I admit that, sexless!
[01:50:30.689 --> 01:50:31.029]  Sexless!
[01:50:31.029 --> 01:50:33.410]  Yeah, sexless to top it off.
[01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:34.430]  Exactly.
[01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:37.331]  And they essentially want to transform us.
[01:50:37.331 --> 01:50:41.712]  I mean, I said worker bees, but basically they want to turn us into gray aliens.
[01:50:41.712 --> 01:50:42.833]  You know, just these total
[01:50:44.353 --> 01:50:45.074]  No, I totally agree.
[01:50:45.074 --> 01:50:47.696]  If you go back to Huxley, whose brother ran the U.N.
[01:50:47.696 --> 01:50:50.838]  in 1932, in 1961 he wrote Brave New World Revisited.
[01:50:50.838 --> 01:50:56.182]  He said, listen, you're all going to be four feet tall, gray-skinned, not male or female, no one will know who you are.
[01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:57.844]  And he goes, watch, we're going to do it.
[01:50:57.844 --> 01:50:59.545]  And first, we'll break up your families.
[01:50:59.545 --> 01:51:01.347]  And they're doing it!
[01:51:01.347 --> 01:51:03.728]  Well, and everyone's turning into a snowflake.
[01:51:03.728 --> 01:51:08.772]  You know, when I was a kid, we were out riding our dirt bikes, you know, jumping jumps, breaking bones.
[01:51:08.772 --> 01:51:10.013]  Hey, breaking our bones!
[01:51:10.013 --> 01:51:12.535]  You do that now, they take your kids.
[01:51:12.535 --> 01:51:12.795]  Yeah.
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:16.462]  And so, you know, no one can do anything.
[01:51:16.462 --> 01:51:18.883]  You've got to sit behind a computer terminal.
[01:51:18.883 --> 01:51:21.044]  You know, your muscles waste away.
[01:51:21.044 --> 01:51:23.426]  So we're already in the matrix.
[01:51:23.426 --> 01:51:28.168]  Toxic lighting, everything's withering everyone away.
[01:51:28.168 --> 01:51:35.072]  Oh yeah, they picked with the new approved UN light bulbs the exact frequency to cause seizures and brain damage.
[01:51:35.072 --> 01:51:35.993]  That's even mainstream news.
[01:51:36.949 --> 01:51:54.834]  And they're in every office building in America, everyone's homes, you know, virtually everywhere you go, you're just under constant attack, whether it's propaganda or whether it's a physical attack from electronics and radiation.
[01:51:55.094 --> 01:51:56.275]  Here's the big secret.
[01:51:56.275 --> 01:51:57.756]  They've got us racially fighting.
[01:51:57.756 --> 01:51:59.037]  We're all humans.
[01:51:59.037 --> 01:52:02.640]  Over stupid, made up, 100 people killed by cops a year or something.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.921]  You expose bad police.
[01:52:03.921 --> 01:52:04.642]  We've all done that.
[01:52:04.642 --> 01:52:10.767]  But until you pull back the statistics, it's like, yeah, there's revenue generating, there's some bad cops, great, put them in prison.
[01:52:10.767 --> 01:52:14.070]  But to claim that a couple hundred dead black people a year is the number one issue,
[01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:23.496]  When half the blacks, four or five million a year, get aborted and blacks kill, you know, hundreds of thousands of each other a year, why are they obsessing on 200 and something a year?
[01:52:23.496 --> 01:52:27.918]  It's because they want to divide us all because globalists are killing everybody.
[01:52:27.918 --> 01:52:34.703]  They want us fighting with each other while the big telecoms, while the big Googles roll in with the AI takeover.
[01:52:35.643 --> 01:52:37.524]  Well, you used to talk about this a lot.
[01:52:37.524 --> 01:52:39.684]  It's like the order out of chaos.
[01:52:39.684 --> 01:52:55.409]  And you know, they're really, I mean, look, you were, I was listening to you talk about this 15 years ago, and now they're to the point to where they've just about castrated society to the point to where they're ready to do this massive takeover.
[01:52:55.409 --> 01:52:56.450]  Trump was a fluke.
[01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:58.830]  He got into the presidency.
[01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:59.611]  He's more than that.
[01:53:00.791 --> 01:53:02.652]  Not that Trump's perfect, and you aren't either.
[01:53:02.652 --> 01:53:04.732]  God will always give you a final chance.
[01:53:04.732 --> 01:53:08.513]  You get reprieves because God's a just God.
[01:53:08.513 --> 01:53:11.394]  So Trump's like a final chance.
[01:53:11.394 --> 01:53:12.494]  Absolutely, I agree.
[01:53:12.494 --> 01:53:19.356]  So, you know, we're basically in the thick of it right now.
[01:53:19.356 --> 01:53:23.278]  And, you know, a lot of people are not even paying attention right now, Alex.
[01:53:25.399 --> 01:53:25.499]  Yeah.
[01:53:39.666 --> 01:53:50.174]  And they don't know, as soon as the world government's in, as soon as AI is in full control, the globalists have all said in their white papers, because they have to warn us up front, they're going to release the bioweapon, Shepard.
[01:53:50.174 --> 01:53:55.158]  And the big question in the Pentagon is, who's going to launch Race Pacific first?
[01:53:57.552 --> 01:54:00.012]  Well, they, you know, and they're ready to do it.
[01:54:00.012 --> 01:54:02.693]  They've already prepped the mass graves for everyone.
[01:54:02.693 --> 01:54:12.295]  I mean, virtually every military cemetery in every state, every, uh, even regular cemeteries now are putting in those burial vaults that we talked about on our show before.
[01:54:12.295 --> 01:54:14.235]  Um, you know, they're laying the groundwork.
[01:54:14.235 --> 01:54:22.597]  They've put in pandemic preparedness plans and all of these, essentially, if you really read in the pandemic preparedness plans, each state has one.
[01:54:22.597 --> 01:54:24.437]  It's not like a federal thing.
[01:54:24.537 --> 01:54:31.200]  And they see it as an emergency surgery to cut off the human bloom that they see as a parasite hurting the Earth.
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.943]  The problem is, the globalists are the ones creating GMO, all the globalist technology stuff that's hurting the planet.
[01:54:37.943 --> 01:54:43.366]  So their claim that they're going to exterminate us for the greater good, that's only for lower-level minions.
[01:54:43.366 --> 01:54:46.988]  The real operation, if you study it, is to overwrite the whole planet.
[01:54:46.988 --> 01:54:49.729]  That's why they don't care, because they're racing to Godhead
[01:54:50.089 --> 01:54:53.392]  They're racing to the new singularity of being a new God.
[01:54:53.392 --> 01:54:56.735]  They don't care if it destroys everything, because they believe in the race.
[01:54:56.735 --> 01:54:58.696]  Only who gets there first matters.
[01:54:58.696 --> 01:55:04.581]  Who cares if you destroy the planet, as long as you're still willing to be the conscious Godhead.
[01:55:04.581 --> 01:55:09.806]  As if God would let them achieve Godhead by doing something this selfish, Shepard.
[01:55:09.806 --> 01:55:10.527]  That's the whole point.
[01:55:11.568 --> 01:55:13.528]  Yeah, no, no, really.
[01:55:13.528 --> 01:55:15.269]  I mean, that's the gist of it.
[01:55:15.269 --> 01:55:40.793]  And it's amazing the depth that these people go to and how far, you know, I mean, it's their legacy, it's their, you know, they've built their families, their bloodlines, their knowledge, their database that they've hidden from the general public, all their secret knowledge, their, you know, anything they know about, you know, the Rockefellers went around and they've
[01:55:40.993 --> 01:55:44.276]  And all of it is bet against our spirit, our instinct, and God.
[01:55:44.276 --> 01:55:47.139]  Because all God does is give us a spirit and free will.
[01:55:47.139 --> 01:55:47.819]  That's all it is.
[01:55:47.819 --> 01:55:50.322]  The truth versus all these fancy lies.
[01:55:50.322 --> 01:55:51.463]  It's up to us to choose it.
[01:55:51.463 --> 01:55:54.145]  Shepard, come back on this week for a full hour via Skype.
[01:55:54.145 --> 01:55:54.866]  I love you.
[01:55:54.866 --> 01:55:55.827]  I appreciate you.
[01:55:55.827 --> 01:55:56.747]  Intelhub.com.
[01:55:56.747 --> 01:55:57.208]  Thank you, sir.
[01:55:57.208 --> 01:55:59.009]  Thanks, my friend.
[01:55:59.009 --> 01:56:00.311]  That guy's so on target.
[01:56:01.581 --> 01:56:03.001]  That's why I'm not afraid of dying.
[01:56:03.001 --> 01:56:10.924]  I'm afraid of how weak I am, that I'm not going to be strong enough to give my contribution to beat these people, because God, they're so bad.
[01:56:10.924 --> 01:56:15.445]  I mean, if you've got brown skin, I love you.
[01:56:15.445 --> 01:56:17.106]  If you've got white skin, I love you.
[01:56:17.106 --> 01:56:18.886]  I don't give a rat's butt about that.
[01:56:18.886 --> 01:56:24.148]  I care about your soul, but I understand a lot of you have been brainwashed to be my enemy, so I've still got to fight you.
[01:56:26.089 --> 01:56:29.350]  Man, the vampires gotta get broke.
[01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:39.074]  I'm not a violent person, but the vampires, the sociopaths, the child molesters, the psychopaths, I want to hurt them bad.
[01:56:39.074 --> 01:56:46.617]  I'd like to get in a ring with them with a battle axe and say, here's your battle axe, you son of a piece of garbage, you fatherless goat.
[01:56:46.617 --> 01:56:48.558]  Pick up the damn weapon.
[01:56:48.558 --> 01:56:51.119]  They already know they're weak, that's the thing.
[01:56:51.119 --> 01:56:53.860]  But good men lay down, that's why evil is allowed to rise.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:57.430]  Just briefly, because we need to fund the operation.
[01:56:57.430 --> 01:57:00.262]  We got storable foods, the highest quality, 50% off, never done it before.
[01:57:01.431 --> 01:57:09.013]  I'm cutting prices, because I'm not going to do like Amazon, that devil, that demon, that monopoly runner that I'm going to cover tomorrow during a weekday show.
[01:57:09.013 --> 01:57:09.654]  Bezos does.
[01:57:09.654 --> 01:57:11.474]  50% off, but it's got to end soon.
[01:57:11.474 --> 01:57:16.316]  I'm high quality, my pay-per-supply, and a bunch of other specials as well, but that's all I got to say.
[01:57:16.316 --> 01:57:20.917]  You're funding us, and you're getting the things you need, so make the commitment today to financially support us.
[01:57:20.917 --> 01:57:23.238]  But to me, this is all metaphysical.
[01:57:23.238 --> 01:57:26.299]  It's all about defeating these vampires.
[01:57:26.299 --> 01:57:28.700]  Quite frankly, it's all about getting my hands around their necks.
[01:57:30.004 --> 01:57:31.326]  That's what this whole operation is about.
[01:57:31.326 --> 01:57:33.410]  And let me tell you, we got our hands around their neck.
[01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:38.137]  But when you pray for us, and when you take action, it gives us more power to squeeze.
[01:57:38.137 --> 01:57:39.218]  Their eyes are bulging out.
