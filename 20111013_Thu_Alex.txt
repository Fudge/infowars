[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.440]  All right ladies and gentlemen this is a maximum alert a maximum alert for all
[00:30.440 --> 00:36.040]  Info warriors and people that love peace and liberty worldwide maximum alert Alex
[00:36.040 --> 00:40.760]  Jones here coming to you from my home I knew this was big two days ago when they
[00:40.760 --> 00:47.600]  said they foiled the Iranian plot to blow up the Saudi embassy in DC and
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.280]  assassinate people claiming that it was Mexican drug cartels I knew that that was
[00:52.280 --> 00:55.960]  a cover for the fast and furious subpoenas that they knew were imminent
[00:55.960 --> 01:01.800]  the next day or yesterday since then Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer who
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.520]  you better believe speaks for some of the better elements of the Pentagon and
[01:06.520 --> 01:10.440]  of the ruling elite of this country he's reported in part a very important
[01:10.440 --> 01:15.000]  think tanks heavily involved in trying to kill bin Laden has blown the whistle on
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.920]  a lot of 9-11 stuff the Super Congress when he basically is unleashed to come
[01:20.920 --> 01:25.240]  out and say something you know it's important Paul Watson's article is up
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.240]  at infowars.com FBI insider Obama administration likely manufactured
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.200]  dubious terror plot and because Schaefer talked to a high-level FBI agent with
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.600]  clearances who knows that it's not in the system that there was not a plot
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.280]  repeat not a plot then and again people think I'm quick I'm not really quick a
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.080]  lot of this was hiding in plain view I knew there'd be some false flag or build
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.240]  up for war as the spokescreen for Obama's approval rating plunging the fast
[01:55.240 --> 01:58.680]  and furious coming out the Democrats calling for him not to run and I said
[01:58.680 --> 02:02.840]  last week if they don't start pulling a new war false flag Obama will be toast
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.800]  in one month then I discovered that a member of my family who's an army
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.320]  officer is being sent to Kuwait and was very tight-lipped and then I made some
[02:12.320 --> 02:17.400]  other calls and confirmed it's a green light attack Israeli strike on Iran
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.200]  repeat within two weeks T-minus two weeks it could happen tomorrow it could
[02:22.200 --> 02:28.600]  happen next week but the main forces and logistics forces for a US back strike of
[02:28.600 --> 02:34.440]  the Israelis is building up in Kuwait and surrounding areas right now this is
[02:34.440 --> 02:40.560]  an absolute mega alert I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen it could not be
[02:40.560 --> 02:46.800]  any more hardcore then my phone rings ten times in a row until I jumped off the
[02:46.800 --> 02:51.320]  treadmill this morning I went over and got it Dr. Steve Pachinik and you know
[02:51.320 --> 02:54.960]  he basically we know he's establishment he's run over throws of major
[02:54.960 --> 02:58.920]  governments and we know he represents a element of the Pentagon he said you know
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.040]  the Pentagon knows there's gonna be a strike the bunker busters have been
[03:02.040 --> 03:06.400]  delivered to Israel we don't want this that's why Shaffer's gone public and he
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.880]  basically put his cards on the table as if any of us needing to and just said
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.160]  you know I well he's coming on later we'll see what he says the point is
[03:15.160 --> 03:18.600]  he's been talking to a lot of people in concurrent government intelligence and
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.560]  the Pentagon he said it's on the government again I would add could
[03:23.560 --> 03:29.680]  stage terror attacks now and blaming on Iran it is on it is on it is on they
[03:29.680 --> 03:34.120]  could go with a new war stage terror attacks mass arrest internet kill
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.560]  switches they are testing the waters right now to completely drop the hammer
[03:38.560 --> 03:43.280]  on us this is a mega red alert ladies and gentlemen again Mike Adams was
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.000]  gonna be here today with like four guests on a host of key issues and doing

[04:17.480 --> 04:21.240]  exploding in their faces right now it's very clear Alex that fast and furious
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.280]  is what probably led them to have the motivation to start to drum up these
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.240]  other plots to distract people it's that slide of mind or a slide of hand
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.600]  tactic that they always use and we're going to be covering that more here on
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.040]  the Alex Jones show with Alex himself with Paul Joseph Watson and with Dr.

[09:06.960 --> 09:15.040]  fake Iran Saudi embassy attack story and a lot of things were staring me you know
[09:15.040 --> 09:18.640]  right the face but I wanted to be deliberative on this so I want to give
[09:18.640 --> 09:26.040]  you the announcement right now this is the most important and quite frankly
[09:26.040 --> 09:33.480]  most ominous radio show I have done since July 25th 2011 when I said the
[09:33.480 --> 09:36.360]  government was going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their
[09:36.360 --> 09:42.360]  asset Osama bin Laden and launch wars I could see the preconditioning I didn't
[09:42.360 --> 09:50.200]  have all the sources I have now I have two military sources known to me two
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.480]  military sources then separately I have a family military source who wouldn't
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.200]  give me the tales but that's how I went and found out more I have Dr. Steve
[10:00.200 --> 10:08.400]  Pachinick I have Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer of US Army and more to
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.680]  tell you what I'm telling you now I'm gonna give you the complete skinny right
[10:12.680 --> 10:18.400]  now we're gonna go to a clip again Mike Adams is waiting in the wings here it's
[10:18.400 --> 10:27.400]  very simple the federal government was induced in the last three years under
[10:27.400 --> 10:34.280]  fast and furious to ship tens of thousands of firearms into Mexico cocaine
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.880]  was then shipped back into the United States under ATF FBI DEA Coast Guard
[10:39.880 --> 10:45.520]  Border Patrol and several other agencies authorization foreign intelligence
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.560]  agencies including Israel but also elements of our own intelligence
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.920]  agencies in the Pentagon there's different camps then began to leak that
[10:54.920 --> 11:00.400]  information so they could then blackmail domestic agencies and domestic leaders
[11:00.400 --> 11:06.280]  of agencies to go along with the police state takeover of the United States to
[11:06.280 --> 11:11.760]  make sure that that happened they needed outside war and to tie it into the
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.760]  cartels that's what was done two days ago as they knew that within less than
[11:16.760 --> 11:24.400]  24 hours Congressman Issa subpoenas to the admitted liar Attorney General John
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.160]  P. Holder were going out connecting it to Mexican cartels again oh now look
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.360]  Obama is fighting the Mexican cartels that he's really shipping guns to several
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.200]  weeks ago as you know a second shipment of bunker buster missiles were
[11:39.200 --> 11:45.240]  delivered to Israel we had Ray McGovern on last week former top CIA analyst
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.280]  Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior saying from his sources this is the
[11:49.280 --> 11:53.680]  greatest green light ever for an Iran attack remember Fox Fallon four years
[11:53.680 --> 11:57.440]  ago they had a cent com had to resign refused to attack Iran with the fake
[11:57.440 --> 12:01.080]  PT boats thing the chain he wanted to do having fake PT boats attack our
[12:01.080 --> 12:10.400]  destroyers right now they have 100% green lighted a giant bombardment on Iran
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.960]  within the next two weeks Israel could launch an attack tomorrow or any time
[12:16.960 --> 12:22.840]  the next two weeks US military logistics forces fighter bomber pilots
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.120]  helicopter pilots ships you name it are all massing in and around the Persian
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.720]  Gulf I have family who has just been deployed yesterday to Kuwait 20 plus
[12:31.720 --> 12:39.560]  years the military has been put into logistics readying helicopters in the
[12:39.560 --> 12:46.640]  for the Gulf it is on the military does not want this repeat the military does
[12:46.640 --> 12:51.680]  not want this elements in the Pentagon that are good have have loosed Colonel
[12:51.680 --> 12:55.400]  Schaefer of course blew the whistle enabled danger and other ops who of
[12:55.400 --> 12:58.280]  course blew the whistle that the Pentagon is upset about the Super
[12:58.280 --> 13:03.600]  Congress and a move towards Obama trying to become a dictator so the white
[13:03.600 --> 13:10.040]  hats in the Pentagon have now gone public and here's the headline FBI
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.720]  insider Obama administration likely manufactured dubious terror plot this is
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.440]  from yesterday it's up at info wars.com this article needs to get out to
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.280]  everybody by Paul Joseph Watson I cannot stress to you enough that it's not
[13:24.280 --> 13:28.920]  just a distraction from fast and furious with people saying Obama needs to
[13:28.920 --> 13:32.880]  step down Democrats saying don't run again his approval rating and free fall
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.600]  that's the intelligence agencies globally and the private corporations and
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.840]  others positioning Obama for destruction if he doesn't do what he's told that
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.800]  getting all the agencies eight of them caught red-handed they had to do it
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.240]  system-wide every major city getting FBI, ATF, DEA and others involved shipping
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.200]  the guns so that even mid-level managers are now facing prison now they're
[13:59.200 --> 14:06.000]  being told go along with martial law my phone rang eight or ten times this
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.080]  morning ring ring ring Pachennik never does that and then he basically just put
[14:10.080 --> 14:12.840]  his cards with him he goes you know I work with a lot of agencies yeah he wrote
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.200]  the handbook on black ops he goes the good guys the Pentagon don't want this
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.840]  just like Schaefer he goes I want you to know you serve your country you know a
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.000]  lot of people appreciate it you need to know the government's not all bad the
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.480]  Pentagon doesn't want this attack I mean he was just right there not even
[14:26.480 --> 14:29.640]  mincing work as if we needed to know Pachennik you know it's still of all the
[14:29.640 --> 14:33.680]  black ops give me a break the point is is they he said they're getting ready to
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.440]  totally drop the hammer it could lead into martial law you name it I cannot
[14:38.440 --> 14:43.800]  stress to you we've got to stop this war if this is the key if they're able to
[14:43.800 --> 14:52.960]  sell this bogus baloney that Iran tried to assassinate Saudis here as Schaefer
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.800]  said it's total bull he's gone to the FBI high-level they search the computers
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.640]  it doesn't exist it isn't true this guy is a drunken idiot who they claimed did
[15:01.640 --> 15:04.840]  it Schaefer said it's probably an internal false flag this guy's probably
[15:04.840 --> 15:09.400]  just an operative fake name to put the story out all of this is coming to a
[15:09.400 --> 15:13.320]  head right now they're getting ready to hit Iran the globalist will then state
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.880]  terror attacks all over the West they will clamp down the media Obama's
[15:16.880 --> 15:20.800]  approval ready to go to 85% and they will ram through the austerity the
[15:20.800 --> 15:26.040]  banker bailouts all of it this is it I told you a war false flag all of it was
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.120]  coming it's here they're about to put the good news is you see the power
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.240]  structure doesn't like it a lot of that's why there's all these articles all
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.120]  over the New York Times says this Iran thing is full that's because a lot of
[15:37.120 --> 15:40.160]  people in the power structure have been brought to the edge of the cliff and they
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.720]  realize what's about to happen it's called World War three the Iran
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.040]  situation goes from $10 a gallon gas and wars and terror attacks on the good
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.840]  end to World War three on the bad end from bad to worse let's play this clip
[15:55.840 --> 16:00.120]  of Anthony Schaefer with Judge Andrew Napolitano yesterday on Fox Business here
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.880]  it is yesterday the FBI alleged that had foiled an Iranian terror plot but the
[16:05.880 --> 16:10.240]  main suspect has been in custody since September so why did the Department of
[16:10.240 --> 16:14.680]  Justice wait until now to announce this threat is it mere coincidence as it
[16:14.680 --> 16:18.480]  comes at a time when House Republicans as you've just heard subpoenaed the head
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.680]  of the Justice Department Attorney General Holder himself for his marred
[16:22.680 --> 16:27.840]  gun-running program operation fast and furious which as you know let military
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.520]  grade weaponry get in the hands of Mexican drug gangs or is there another
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.680]  explanation for this curious announcement that mr. Holder made yesterday
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.720]  joining us by phone from Virginia is retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.200]  Schaefer Colonel Schaefer it's always a pleasure and welcome back to Freedom
[16:45.200 --> 16:48.440]  Watch thank you for having me judge sorry I can't be there as are we we
[16:48.440 --> 16:51.880]  appreciate you picking up the phone and calling us what is your take on this
[16:51.880 --> 16:58.720]  alleged terror plot involving Iran is this is this the way the Iran
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.520]  intelligence agencies usually operate engaging with somebody they thought were
[17:04.520 --> 17:10.160]  involved with Mexican drug gangs to assassinate a Saudi Arabian ambassador in
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.720]  a public restaurant in New York or Washington well it's a long way to get
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.920]  to a a much easier target in other places and no I don't think so and
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.240]  obviously I've interrogated the Iranians it's two chapters my book
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.880]  Operation Dark Hearted dedicated to this and that's what makes me think twice
[17:25.880 --> 17:30.080]  about this the American that they're accusing here judge was it too enough he
[17:30.080 --> 17:33.880]  has to deal with the passport Iranian American but frankly that my experience
[17:33.880 --> 17:36.960]  has been directly that these people love being here once they're here they love
[17:36.960 --> 17:40.320]  being here and the idea of this guy all of a sudden after years being a
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.200]  successful by all accounts a successful use car salesman in Texas part of the
[17:45.200 --> 17:48.880]  community I would think it would be very difficult to imagine him to all the
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.200]  sudden deciding that he's going to go against everything he's done for the
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.640]  past you know for the past 15 years to do this is it just if it does not spell
[17:56.640 --> 18:00.720]  spell correctly at this point all right well give me if you would your best
[18:00.720 --> 18:04.960]  estimate as to what does spell correctly for example is it possible that this
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.880]  Iranian American is is a double agent who wanted to trick the government of the
[18:08.880 --> 18:13.480]  United States of America into taking some action against Iran there is a
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.440]  likely that the FBI can cocked at this whole thing and because it was a sting
[18:17.440 --> 18:21.200]  nobody was ever in danger there was never a real plot this guy was plotting
[18:21.200 --> 18:25.240]  with FBI agents who he thought were mux at Mexican drug lords what does Colonel
[18:25.240 --> 18:28.480]  Schaefer think really went down here I think as part of it I think the reason
[18:28.480 --> 18:32.720]  it came out now is literally this is red meat to to a bunch of lions you know I
[18:32.720 --> 18:35.840]  think this is why it threw it out now at this point not in September secondly
[18:35.840 --> 18:40.120]  yeah the FBI said a record lately and then I did talk to one of my inside
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.320]  guys today he is saying that he thinks the same thing you know why because he
[18:44.320 --> 18:48.160]  can't find any real information and he's got a clearance so that tells him that
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.680]  there's something going on is extraordinary by the fact that he's an
[18:50.680 --> 18:54.400]  inside you know investigator knows what's going on and yet and then I'm
[18:54.400 --> 18:58.000]  going to quote here there's nothing on this within the DOJ beyond what they've
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.960]  talked about publicly which means to him there's something very wrong with it
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.440]  look the United States used failed and flawed intelligence to attack Iraq in
[19:06.440 --> 19:13.280]  1991 and in 2003 is there the danger that we might use something as preposterous
[19:13.280 --> 19:17.800]  as this plot which was created and run and controlled by the FBI that was
[19:17.800 --> 19:23.040]  announced yesterday as a basis for invading the country of Iran which as
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.280]  you know a lot of neocons in this country have been itching to get us to do
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.720]  right I gotta tell you I do believe the Iranians do pose a threat however I
[19:31.720 --> 19:35.720]  agree with you on this I there's no reason to believe at this point that the
[19:35.720 --> 19:41.160]  intel is there to justify direct military action so much deeper the rest
[19:41.160 --> 19:44.840]  of the clip is up at infowards.com we're gonna be right back with Mike Adams

[24:14.920 --> 24:17.880]  Dr. Steve Pachennick popping in in the next segment he concurs with my
[24:17.880 --> 24:22.280]  analysis as if he has that from his intelligence agency connections and
[24:22.280 --> 24:26.240]  remember this is the guy who's literally overthrown governments and he says
[24:26.240 --> 24:30.640]  that yes the power structure right now is in a big fight he said Israel wants to
[24:30.640 --> 24:37.240]  go in and attack right now and the folks we don't want World War 3 but but Mike
[24:37.240 --> 24:40.240]  Adams and let's watch it pop in later he's gonna have a report out on this
[24:40.240 --> 24:44.720]  so pop in later during the show but Mike Adams has asked me a question in the
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.160]  break he said why is it Saudi ambassadors why well notice Mexico's
[24:49.160 --> 24:53.240]  involved so that kind of muddy the water with the drug runner a gun runner
[24:53.240 --> 24:59.120]  thing Saudi Arabia was used in the fable of 9-11 Saudi Arabia was used with the
[24:59.120 --> 25:02.960]  Mujahideen against the Russians Saudi Arabia's big allies with the US England
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.880]  and Israel and Saudi Arabia there's plausible deniability now to say oh
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.560]  there was a plot to bomb your embassy that way it's not a US embassy so it's
[25:11.560 --> 25:16.920]  always the same players and again you heard Colonel Schaefer saying he talked
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.320]  to the high-level just department the word is FBI Schaefer's on tomorrow so he
[25:21.320 --> 25:24.640]  was getting on a plane with jaren calling this morning to be on MSNBC about
[25:24.640 --> 25:31.440]  this you know Schaefer saying high-level just department said it's not the
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.120]  computers it's fake it's not real it's totally manufactured it's perfect
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.120]  timing the day before the subpoenas went out and Israel's got the bunker
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.280]  busters my cousin has just been deployed 20-something years in the army I
[25:44.280 --> 25:48.240]  called other army sources they said how do you know this stuff they said I'm not
[25:48.240 --> 25:51.760]  talking to you these are people I've known for a long time then then Steve
[25:51.760 --> 25:57.040]  Pachennik calls up saying it's on it's on ladies and gentlemen it has never been
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.000]  green-lighted like this except when Fox Fallon said no and they fired him from
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.160]  sitcom the military knows this is disastrous Paul Watson what's your
[26:06.160 --> 26:09.640]  intel on this I know you've got an article coming out we are on the verge
[26:09.640 --> 26:14.520]  of World War three they are launching it that's from multiple sources Paul we've
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.480]  got to get the article out and warn people the government blew its own cover
[26:19.480 --> 26:24.800]  on fast and furious to blackmail eight different federal agencies the eight
[26:24.800 --> 26:28.280]  federal agencies took the bait in this criminal conspiracy they're being black
[26:28.280 --> 26:34.360]  mailed now do you understand that Paul well I mean this makes the terror plots
[26:34.360 --> 26:39.080]  manufactured by the Bush administration which of course it was admitted that
[26:39.080 --> 26:43.320]  many of them were manufactured by Tom Ridge for the Homeland Security Director
[26:43.320 --> 26:48.440]  makes them look sophisticated in comparison to this I mean it's so
[26:48.440 --> 26:52.720]  transparently fabricated that even the New York Times and the Washington Post
[26:52.720 --> 26:56.800]  today are having to admit that it's dubious to say the least because we're
[26:56.800 --> 27:03.240]  being asked to believe that the elite Iranian Al Quds force hired a used car
[27:03.240 --> 27:09.040]  salesman from Corpus Christi to then hire assassins to blow up embassies and
[27:09.040 --> 27:14.280]  restaurants in Washington DC in order to try and kill the Saudi ambassadors to
[27:14.280 --> 27:17.160]  the United States
[27:17.680 --> 27:23.320]  obviously again it involves Mexican Los Zeta's gang members they were supposedly
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.160]  part of the plot he was trying to pay them off to carry out the assassination
[27:27.160 --> 27:32.680]  were trained at Fort Benning Georgia and are used to knock out that the drug
[27:32.680 --> 27:37.200]  cartels that aren't laundering their money this is ridiculous well yeah I mean
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.640]  court transcripts from the past few months have proven again and again that
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.320]  Los Zeta's is completely infiltrated in in cahoots with the federal government
[27:46.320 --> 27:51.120]  they received many of the weapons that were part of the fast and furious cover
[27:51.120 --> 27:56.520]  up but I mean aside from the ludicrous notion that Iran would risk carrying out
[27:56.520 --> 28:01.120]  such a hit inside the United States when it would be far easier to do so
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.200]  anywhere in the Middle East you know aside from the fact that this highly
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.200]  trained al-Quds Iranian elite revolutionary guard force to a highly
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.200]  trained would entrust this plot to a used car salesman as you just said
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.520]  Shafa dropped the bombshell last night on Judge Andrew Napolitano's Fox
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.880]  Business Show he talked to an FBI investigator with the necessary security
[28:26.880 --> 28:31.800]  clearance who went into the back channels into the archives and found no
[28:31.800 --> 28:36.760]  information whatsoever regarding the plot which obviously directly suggests
[28:36.760 --> 28:45.160]  that it's been completely fabricated or it doesn't exist exactly and isn't it
[28:45.160 --> 28:51.000]  ironic that the Obama administration has fabricated this hoax about Iran
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.080]  conducting assassinations on US soil when we know from the Bush era program
[28:57.080 --> 29:01.640]  which was continued by Obama that central intelligence agency works with
[29:01.640 --> 29:05.960]  John Doehler the Iranian Sunni al-Qaeda group to carry out bombings and
[29:05.960 --> 29:10.520]  assassinations in Iran to destabilize their government on a regular basis
[29:10.520 --> 29:14.320]  but a press release out on a call I need to get an article out with a fearing
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.360]  headline because you a headline can't talk about how powerful this is there's
[29:18.360 --> 29:23.920]  no way to be too sensational I've got sources across the board including
[29:23.920 --> 29:29.960]  family who won't talk but I know where they're going that it is on it is on it
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.600]  is on just like I told people they were gonna bring down Qaddafi and invade in
[29:34.600 --> 29:40.520]  September two months before it happened it is on folks it is on I want to repeat
[29:40.520 --> 29:44.560]  this they are planning an Israeli led bombardment on Iran and people say well
[29:44.560 --> 29:48.280]  how does this indict them it's just this idea well they try to attack America you
[29:48.280 --> 29:54.080]  know blowing up an embassy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[30:17.400 --> 30:22.400]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as

[32:06.360 --> 32:10.400]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[32:10.400 --> 32:14.320]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[32:14.320 --> 32:18.320]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid

[32:59.960 --> 33:16.320]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us dr.
[33:16.320 --> 33:20.720]  speed pacenic will join us for a longer interview tomorrow one time on a
[33:20.720 --> 33:29.640]  better skype connection we have we have also we're riding shotgun today was
[33:29.640 --> 33:33.320]  going to be hosting the whole show Mike Adams in studio there at the Impal
[33:33.320 --> 33:37.480]  Wars studios they'll be doing Impal Wars nightly news this evening we do have
[33:37.480 --> 33:41.960]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer who came on a month ago and said that the
[33:41.960 --> 33:45.640]  Pentagon is upset about the move towards dictatorship of the Super
[33:45.640 --> 33:49.520]  Congress here in America Schaefer basically speaks for the better
[33:49.520 --> 33:53.320]  elements of the Pentagon there are different power structures he was on
[33:53.320 --> 33:58.040]  freedom watch yesterday FBI insider Obama administration is manufacturing this
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.360]  dubious terror plot it doesn't exist it's made up according to his FBI high
[34:02.360 --> 34:07.840]  level security clearance source dr. Steve Pacenic contacted me this morning it
[34:07.840 --> 34:11.280]  said from his Pentagon sources and others they don't want to hit Iran and
[34:11.280 --> 34:15.560]  that this is all basically a setup for the buildup for Israel to hit them I
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.520]  have family that's been deployed to Kuwait it won't talk about it but I
[34:20.520 --> 34:25.440]  know what he works then it's logistics and helicopter gunships getting those
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.680]  ready for there in the Persian Gulf and I've made some calls to other military
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.320]  sources when I learned this two nights ago and they said how on earth do you
[34:34.320 --> 34:39.360]  know this I'm not going to talk about it that the word is the US military is
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.960]  preparing to back up Israel when the Iranians close the Strait of Hormuz a
[34:45.960 --> 34:50.920]  gallon of gas will go from eight to ten dollars conservatively the Iranians will
[34:50.920 --> 34:54.760]  probably respond different intelligence agencies could stage terror attacks
[34:54.760 --> 35:00.200]  it's also blaming on Iran Russ and China could get involved this will
[35:00.200 --> 35:04.520]  undoubtedly destroy the economy but it'll be a nice political diversion what
[35:04.520 --> 35:09.440]  it Gerald Salente and others say look for a big war what did Lindsey Williams say
[35:09.440 --> 35:14.680]  a year ago on our show he said next is Iran and that's from his big oil company
[35:14.680 --> 35:18.120]  insiders and I know who those sources are one of them died now we could talk
[35:18.120 --> 35:22.040]  about it kid from the former head of Atlantic Richfield the other ones even
[35:22.040 --> 35:32.120]  more I powered so so we have all that information right there and Schaefer
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.280]  came on a month ago and said yes Pentagon people to high level that he's
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.760]  basically the mouthpiece for them at a certain level he's joining us tomorrow
[35:40.760 --> 35:49.160]  are upset about Obama moving towards a Super Congress and dictatorship Schaefer
[35:49.160 --> 35:53.000]  concerned about that I know Dr. Steve Pachennick his bio is too long he'll be
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.840]  joining us for longer tomorrow he's waiting in the wings right now the
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.680]  author of Tom Clancy's books you know that ran black ops wrote the book the
[36:01.680 --> 36:05.840]  State Department on psychological warfare he hardly ever calls me this
[36:05.840 --> 36:09.120]  morning was calling over and over again I was on the treadmill jumped off and ran
[36:09.120 --> 36:12.360]  over there and he said just immediately I said you calling about the Iran thing
[36:12.360 --> 36:15.320]  and he said yes you know the ball I'll let him stand his own words but
[36:15.320 --> 36:19.960]  crystallized dr. Pachennick everything you're telling me is what I have from
[36:19.960 --> 36:24.280]  three military sources what I've got from Schaefer what I've got from common
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.480]  sense this is incredible now that a high-level FBI with the highest level
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.320]  security clearance says this plot doesn't exist we're to believe lost status we
[36:33.320 --> 36:37.000]  know trained at Fort Benning, Georgia and our narcotics enforcers for big
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.640]  central bank systems are supposedly working with some used car salesman this
[36:43.640 --> 36:47.360]  is unbelievable and it's right on time as Obama people are talking about him
[36:47.360 --> 36:52.640]  stepping down don't run again fast and furious subpoenas go out I know you've
[36:52.640 --> 36:55.720]  got incredible sources and you basically put the card on the table you said look
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.920]  Alex you know I talked a lot of people you know a lot of people and
[36:59.920 --> 37:03.480]  intelligence appreciate the service you're doing and I'm not getting into
[37:03.480 --> 37:07.120]  ego here the point is I got from what you were saying that you've got a lot of
[37:07.120 --> 37:10.880]  sources like Schaefer does and that there are good guys in the government the
[37:10.880 --> 37:13.840]  Pentagon that are upset about what's happening so let's put the cards on the
[37:13.840 --> 37:19.760]  table the intel I've got is a strike on Iran by Israel within two weeks the US
[37:19.760 --> 37:26.200]  been responding when Iran totally shuts down the oil supply well the issue and I
[37:26.200 --> 37:30.440]  can't thank you enough and I know our country the real military and the real
[37:30.440 --> 37:35.000]  love page it's in the intelligence community really love you and really a
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.800]  grateful I came on because once again as a citizen I'm not a hero I'm a citizen
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.640]  saying once again I have that this whole issue that came out of Mexico this
[37:46.640 --> 37:51.600]  entire nonsensical story which even Bueller thankfully said was a Hollywood
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.400]  script which it is and it's a very bad script we're an informer car salesman
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.520]  talks about the potential of killing a Saudi ambassador in the United States and
[38:00.520 --> 38:06.600]  it's somehow this Iranian is related to people in Iran is absolutely absurd it's
[38:06.600 --> 38:12.840]  disinformation DEA has had a terrible history of corruption and competence as
[38:12.840 --> 38:16.760]  you see in fast and furious and more importantly this is an indictment once
[38:16.760 --> 38:21.160]  again of Eric Holder who lied to Congress he's lied now lied to the
[38:21.160 --> 38:27.040]  American public about what he has supposedly learned in an investigation
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.360]  and more importantly Mueller who I'm absolutely ashamed of the FBI director
[38:31.360 --> 38:38.040]  who's a war hero from the Vietnam has won major awards and was a combat hero
[38:38.040 --> 38:43.240]  has been involved in 9-11 now is involved in this nonsensical story to
[38:43.240 --> 38:49.960]  create a pretext for an attack by Israel on Iran now why do I say that
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.160]  because two things happen when I heard this nonsensical intelligence report by
[38:55.160 --> 39:01.760]  DEA, ATF, CIA and other elements all of whom I've been compromised and it had
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.400]  intelligence problems in the past i.e. as we witness in the Osama bin Laden
[39:06.400 --> 39:10.760]  stupidity story where no one in the world absolutely no one in the world
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.440]  believes that neither is Obama and now Biden the most incompetent vice president
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.720]  we have with two aneurysms a history of plagiarism and Hillary Clinton a woman
[39:21.720 --> 39:28.240]  who is pathologically a liar incompetent is reaffirming that Iran who has
[39:28.240 --> 39:32.400]  repeatedly said we don't need to attack the United States on their home base I
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.680]  know the Iranians I was involved with a home they need I was in rival with the
[39:36.680 --> 39:41.560]  Rafsanjani I don't love them but I have respect for them and they're very clear
[39:41.560 --> 39:46.680]  on their attention furthermore the Iranians have proxy fights in Afghanistan
[39:46.680 --> 39:52.600]  with our soldiers and in Iraq and at the same time you can ask our generals that
[39:52.600 --> 39:57.280]  they have worked with the Iranians to keep down the Shiite populations both
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.240]  in Iraq and Afghanistan so both Biden is lying and is incompetent and by the way
[40:03.240 --> 40:08.840]  his in-law is Tom Donilon who really should not be there Obama once again is
[40:08.840 --> 40:13.800]  lying once again should be considered for impeachment we have serious war crimes
[40:13.800 --> 40:18.120]  here well why do I say it because two weeks ago and the reporters didn't
[40:18.120 --> 40:23.160]  mention this cluster bombs were sent to Israel now there is no reason for Israel
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.120]  to receive cluster bombs they cannot cluster bombs are used to break up the
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.200]  tarmacs on other air force bases but they're used to instigate a war now
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.120]  cluster bombs do not necessarily being used in Syria because the Syrians have
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.800]  helped the Israelis with Hamas and the PLO the Egyptians have now helped the
[40:40.800 --> 40:46.640]  Israelis release a soldier for 1,000 Palestinians so Israel is not going to
[40:46.640 --> 40:50.600]  be using a cluster bomb but Israel needs to divert attention away from its
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.160]  domestic problems where a million people have been unemployed from the fact
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.280]  that it is as an incompetent dysfunction civilian government in Netanyahu and
[41:00.280 --> 41:04.920]  will create a war to divert that attention because the state of Palestine
[41:04.920 --> 41:11.320]  will be and should be recognized by the UN and this is exactly what should happen
[41:11.320 --> 41:16.440]  around the world in order to divert that attention it has convinced Joseph Biden
[41:16.440 --> 41:21.560]  and Hillary Clinton to major supporters of the Jewish community here so that it
[41:21.560 --> 41:26.760]  can be mobilized in order to support an Obama election which does not look very
[41:26.760 --> 41:33.400]  likely and ironically Obama is creating another incident at the same way when
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.640]  Bush Jr. had very low approval in the ratings when the unemployment was very
[41:38.640 --> 41:43.600]  high and unlike George Bush Jr. who I feel would have been the worst president
[41:43.600 --> 41:48.880]  Obama is turning out to be by far the worst incompetent president we have
[41:48.880 --> 41:54.200]  ever had who really should be impeached for the lies he committed for the
[41:54.200 --> 42:04.280]  travesties of justice you have Biden you have Hillary Clinton all civilians but
[42:04.280 --> 42:10.440]  that does not explain why our military which has had to retreat from two wars
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.800]  and has been used as cannon fodder by civilians who were totally incompetent
[42:15.800 --> 42:21.520]  and sent into war to die for our country we have the most brilliant effective
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.080]  leaders in our military that I've ever seen in 30 years they have inquired they
[42:27.080 --> 42:32.120]  have followed orders but they are sick and tired of listening to incompetent
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.680]  civilians sending out a brave men and women into battle and dying we have
[42:36.680 --> 42:42.640]  special forces that were 24-7 time all over the world to knock out extremists
[42:42.640 --> 42:48.200]  and yet they get no support our veterans get no support back here and now in
[42:48.200 --> 42:56.920]  order to to promote his kids Obama's election he has gone to war again and
[42:56.920 --> 43:03.640]  created this nonsense but it is so absurd this nonsense that Iran is about to
[43:03.640 --> 43:07.720]  attack the United States Iran does not have to attack the United States as a
[43:07.720 --> 43:12.640]  matter of fact when I was involved with home a me not one of our hostages was
[43:12.640 --> 43:18.960]  ever injured by home they need it was in fact the terrorist group the M.E.K. which
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.880]  is being supported by three a former head of the FBI and was called the
[43:23.880 --> 43:29.960]  Musa Hadin that killed some of my CIA operatives like my state department
[43:29.960 --> 43:35.640]  operatives and they in turn are being supported by some of the prominent both
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.320]  liberals and right wingers who are receding money if you look at the list
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.680]  of the M.E.K. it's an issue we should talk about they want them off the
[43:43.680 --> 43:48.440]  terrorist list the real terrorists with a Musa Hadin who killed all of our
[43:48.440 --> 43:54.160]  civilians and operatives in Tehran and Dr. Pachinik this this is Mike Adams
[43:54.160 --> 43:57.960]  here you're not able to hear Alex because he's on a cell phone but Alex
[43:57.960 --> 44:02.280]  what's your take on all this let me just throw this in no no the steves on a
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.240]  cell phone so when I'm when I'm talking can't hear me I was just gonna throw this
[44:06.240 --> 44:10.760]  in sir I have military sources I know you have a hundred times what I have I
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.720]  have common sense I have Schaefer the Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer coming out
[44:14.720 --> 44:17.940]  and being green-lighted you know who still is in the Pentagon and is also
[44:17.940 --> 44:21.920]  part of a big think tank to say this is bull the New York Times has come out the
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.760]  day and said this terror plot is made up that shows the major elements of the
[44:26.760 --> 44:31.960]  power structure are saying don't go into Iran just like Fox Fallon said no to
[44:31.960 --> 44:35.320]  Cheney when he tried to stage the attack so these are my two questions for you
[44:35.320 --> 44:39.280]  and tomorrow we'll get more into this we appreciate you coming on on short notice
[44:39.280 --> 44:45.240]  my point was what are your current sources and we know you've got a lot of
[44:45.240 --> 44:50.840]  them are they concurring with what I've been told that Israel right now is test
[44:50.840 --> 44:55.600]  ballooning and intends to hit Iran in the next two weeks with bunker busters
[44:55.600 --> 45:00.320]  and cluster bombs to stop their Air Force retaliatory strike they've just
[45:00.320 --> 45:08.600]  put into place more anti-medium range anti ballistic missile systems and the
[45:08.600 --> 45:13.880]  word we've got is the attack on Iran is now been green-lighted they put up this
[45:13.880 --> 45:19.000]  balloon oh look Iran's gonna attack us and then it is on so a what is your
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.720]  intel on that a b what what do you expect the Iranians to do one of the
[45:24.720 --> 45:29.520]  different things that can happen if Iran is struck because the people like
[45:29.520 --> 45:33.040]  Ray McGovern others I've talked to you work you know the CIA is analyst they
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.720]  say it runs from bad to worse okay sir those are my questions those two
[45:36.720 --> 45:42.760]  questions the first answer is I will not court any of my sources in my extensive
[45:42.760 --> 45:45.440]  experience as a member of the Association of Foreign Intelligence
[45:45.440 --> 45:50.320]  Officers National Military Intelligence Association and my extensive experience
[45:50.320 --> 45:54.320]  in dealing with Iran with terrorists and incompetence to billions you are
[45:54.320 --> 46:00.000]  absolutely right we are creating a false flag situation where Israel will go
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.280]  forth to attack Iran what will happen in turn is Iran will not touch the United
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.360]  States it never has and it never will Iran is very effective at putting up
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.840]  pressure number one on his blood on Israel on to one Hamas and affect
[46:17.840 --> 46:22.800]  Israel's northern border its eastern border and its southern border in effect
[46:22.800 --> 46:27.920]  what Israel is doing is approaching on again where it's continuing itself
[46:27.920 --> 46:34.520]  destructive behavior both militarily and civilian I asked the Israeli ex-commanders
[46:34.520 --> 46:41.680]  of the IDF and the Mossad to come forth and to stop Netanyahu and stop the
[46:41.680 --> 46:47.680]  Americans who are involved in this attack because Israel will be seriously
[46:47.680 --> 46:53.800]  destroyed the state of Palestine will exist Egypt will be there Syria will
[46:53.800 --> 47:00.640]  maintain its low intensity conflict but Iran will exact a huge amount of
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.200]  problems for Israel and Israel knows that and Israel cannot handle that the IDF
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.680]  cannot handle three borders which will be exposed they cannot handle both
[47:10.680 --> 47:16.040]  Israel on the north Hamas on the south and the Jordanian border which is
[47:16.040 --> 47:21.400]  extremely extremely vulnerable and at the same time the Middle East will erupt
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.200]  in violence because Bahrain is the area where our military and the surrogates
[47:27.200 --> 47:32.440]  have effectively fighting Iran but Iran will not be involved in domestic
[47:32.440 --> 47:37.680]  terrorism. How do we stop the fall? I'm a very smart man I always respect my
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.680]  enemies and one of the things that's a problem is I do not respect our
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.120]  civilians advice as I have said repeatedly on this show the American
[47:46.120 --> 47:51.280]  public has to be awakened to the fact we have an incompetent dangerous president
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.800]  I'm not saying the Democratic Republic and we added truthfully with Bush Jr.
[47:56.800 --> 48:02.040]  but this one really is out of control you have Biden who is totally incompetent
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.160]  in the history of plagiarism a history ineffectual with his family is being the
[48:07.160 --> 48:12.040]  National Security Council you have a CIA that's totally out of control and
[48:12.040 --> 48:18.760]  Panetta who's never had experience in national security. Dr. Pachennick, how do we stop
[48:18.760 --> 48:26.280]  the war how do we stop this from happening two weeks ago and said attacking
[48:26.280 --> 48:30.760]  Iran would be a terrible idea but Netanyahu wants it politically so so how
[48:30.760 --> 48:36.200]  do we stop this the Israeli people have to go into the streets is a million of
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.600]  them and around the world the civilians must go into the streets to demonstrate
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.080]  that there can be no more wars and that they have to stop the Israelis from
[48:45.080 --> 48:49.280]  attacking from the United States supplying Israel with weapons that are
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.560]  totally irrelevant to the national security of the United States I will
[48:53.560 --> 48:57.200]  not quote our generals but I feel that some of our generals have correctly
[48:57.200 --> 49:03.960]  stated years ago Israel is a strategic liability let me repeat it again this is
[49:03.960 --> 49:09.320]  not just an emotional Republican or Democrat issue there is no need for
[49:09.320 --> 49:14.120]  us to have Israel on our southern or eastern flank Israel has had its own
[49:14.120 --> 49:20.080]  national security Israel has funded against all a sanctions that's why
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.560]  Hillary is lying like a banshee through the offer family
[49:24.560 --> 49:30.560]  into Iran while at the same time condemning the nuclear program Israel
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.520]  has repeatedly manipulated the attack in the Jewish community in the United
[49:35.520 --> 49:40.160]  States in the world to say that it's being persecuted when in fact it has not
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.240]  been persecuted Israel has been out of control last year that 25 operatives
[49:46.240 --> 49:52.880]  trying to kill one operative in in Dubai Israel is in fact dysfunctional the
[49:52.880 --> 49:59.360]  people of Israel has to mobilize into the streets Christian Jews and Muslims to

[54:08.640 --> 54:12.800]  folks to the Alex Jones show an extraordinary day I'm filling in for
[54:12.800 --> 54:17.520]  Alex who has been joining us by phone for the last 45 minutes or so we're
[54:17.520 --> 54:21.320]  also joined by Dr. Steve Pachennick who has been giving us an analysis and a
[54:21.320 --> 54:26.880]  breakdown of this just truly extraordinary historical news ground
[54:26.880 --> 54:31.400]  breaking you need to listen into what is being said here today because we are
[54:31.400 --> 54:37.600]  talking about a false flag pretext for war in the Middle East having now been
[54:37.600 --> 54:43.560]  as we're saying here fabricated by the Obama administration and continuing with
[54:43.560 --> 54:48.960]  Dr. Pachennick I have a couple of questions for you number one is the
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.640]  incompetence of this apparent false flag operation doesn't that strike you as a
[54:53.640 --> 54:57.640]  pattern from the Obama administration if you remember the the incompetence of
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.040]  how they tried to forge the birth certificate it was obviously a fake
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.600]  well this is obviously a fake terror plot does that strike you as as something
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.280]  characteristic let me start I don't want to get into the birth certificate but
[55:10.280 --> 55:13.800]  what's really the most fascinating part about Obama is the fact that he doesn't
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.360]  want to talk about his mother having been the CIA operative his grandmother
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.880]  being a CIA operative and his grandfather his mother was a very
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.840]  impressive woman who worked at the Hawaiian Asian Pacific Center which was
[55:26.840 --> 55:33.080]  the CIA front and I honor her and his grandmother was involved in banking for
[55:33.080 --> 55:38.880]  funding in East Asia his mother went into Indonesia speaking Russian and a
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.880]  white woman Arabic so what's missing is his connection between him and the CIA
[55:43.880 --> 55:48.720]  so you know that the CIA is very much a part of this and has been under 9-11 and
[55:48.720 --> 55:53.120]  has been out of control and it's one of the things that Eisenhower has always said
[55:53.120 --> 55:58.280]  this is we need a certain kind of genius to control the CIA and unfortunately we
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.920]  have not had it I'm hoping that General Petraeus can put them in line but you
[56:02.920 --> 56:09.440]  have the DEA you have the ATF and these are not functional institutions with all
[56:09.440 --> 56:14.000]  due respect to the FBI they're a brilliant domestically but Mueller has
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.600]  really discredited himself twice on the 9-11 and today and this is a war hero
[56:19.600 --> 56:24.560]  in Vietnam and if I were he I would resign out of just dignity Eric Holder
[56:24.560 --> 56:29.680]  should be indicted he's totally dysfunctional he is live he is
[56:29.680 --> 56:34.160]  committed perjury in front of Congress he has lied to the American public and
[56:34.160 --> 56:40.200]  now what you have is dysfunctional the most dysfunctional story of all is the
[56:40.200 --> 56:45.320]  fact the Osama bin Laden there is no one in the world that believes that Osama
[56:45.320 --> 56:50.520]  bin Laden was killed and then was dumped into the waters I mean it was so absurd
[56:50.520 --> 56:54.840]  it became ridiculous even Mueller came forth on this story about the
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.760]  assassination plot saying it's like a Hollywood movie as if he was trying to
[56:58.760 --> 57:03.200]  co-op himself and the truth of the matters Mueller I'm sorry but you failed
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.400]  once again and is beyond the Hollywood movie no producer in their right mind
[57:07.400 --> 57:11.160]  would have bought this because it's not true there's no consistency it's
[57:11.160 --> 57:15.400]  dysfunctional and once again you have operatives who have no idea of how to
[57:15.400 --> 57:20.520]  create a false flag well how much how much of this do you think stems from the
[57:20.520 --> 57:25.160]  heat that Attorney General Holder must now be feeling as the subpoenas are
[57:25.160 --> 57:29.560]  about to be handed to him and it looks like he's about to be handed his hat
[57:29.560 --> 57:33.520]  and shown the door because of his involvement in facet and furious is
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.120]  that a key motivation you think behind this I would say that's one of them the
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.400]  fact that he is going to be handed a door he should be actually prosecuted for
[57:41.400 --> 57:47.100]  lying in front of Congress for perjury for distortion disinformation for
[57:47.100 --> 57:51.760]  inciting a war I mean Eric Holder should be held accountable for a lot of
[57:51.760 --> 57:56.560]  malfeasance I'm not a lawyer but I certainly know that the miscreant
[57:56.560 --> 58:01.120]  behavior he has had it's not only his heat but you have a president who has
[58:01.120 --> 58:05.880]  not performed who has not been able to create jobs who has polarized the country
[58:05.880 --> 58:10.640]  and it basically has very low ratings the only way presidents historically in the
[58:10.640 --> 58:15.640]  United States at your risk and created an increased ratings and this one is
[58:15.640 --> 58:20.360]  pitiful right dr. Pachynic we are just about out of time here I apologize for
[58:20.360 --> 58:24.040]  cutting you off we're out of time for this segment I want to thank you for

[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.720]  Alex Jones welcome back friends to the Alex Jones show I'm the fill-in host for
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:29.480]  today Mike Adams Alex just joined us for much of the last hour and we have been
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.120]  breaking down just an explosive story probably the biggest breaking news in
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.720]  the country maybe in the world happening today and you're getting the inside
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.880]  scoop on it right here on the Alex Jones show thanks to Alex himself thanks to
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.280]  Paul Joseph Watson who has who who joined us in the last hour and is working
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.240]  on another story that will be posted at the top of this hour in other words just
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.960]  about an hour from now we intend to have Paul Watson back on here to give us
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.160]  further analysis of the situation and also Dr. Steve Pachennick joined us as
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.440]  you just heard if you were with us in the last segment we have a false flag
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:12.720]  pretext for war war in the Middle East this it is now being uncovered this
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.880]  false flag operation having been formulated apparently by the Obama
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.400]  administration we don't know exactly which operatives inside it but as Dr.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.960]  Pachennick eluded to we suspect Attorney General Holder may have a hand in this
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.560]  as he has with Operation Fast and Furious the illegal operation to ship
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.440]  guns into Mexico and put them into the hands of drug dealers there the FBI is
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.480]  suspected of being involved although of course there are good agents in the FBI
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:46.320]  there are rogue agents in the FBI there may be some warring factions within the
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.240]  FBI itself just as within the CIA itself who are trying to vie for top
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.800]  position right now and do the right thing for America rather than getting
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.680]  us dragged into another war in the Middle East we're going to continue to
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.640]  cover this story right here for the next two hours here on the Alex Jones show I
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.520]  do have other guests lined up who are going to be joining us who are
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.360]  scheduled for today so we are going to be talking to them but we will be
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.600]  coming back to this story and if there's any breaking news that happens in the
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.320]  next two hours we will go right to it immediately interrupting any guests who
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.280]  may be joining us so if you are listening to this right now don't turn
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:28.240]  your dial you're going to get the best breaking news right here today on this
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.560]  extraordinary situation which involved a false flag plot to have a used car
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.760]  salesman in Texas apparently try to assassinate a Saudi ambassador
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:48.120]  in the United States as a pretext for war again Israel according to Alex here
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.880]  as he explained earlier Israel may be just weeks away from launching a war
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.360]  launching an attack on Iran and this attempted assassination attempt which is
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.560]  being described by the mainstream media as a real thing but we believe is a
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:09.800]  false flag attack may be the pretext for justification of all of that now
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.080]  there's a lot more let's say aftermath to this that you need to know about and
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.160]  we're gonna be analyzing that and giving you some information about what you can
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.480]  expect to happen if an attack is launched on Iran what's going to happen to
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.040]  oil prices what's going to happen to gold prices what's going to happen in the
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.640]  presidential elections in the United States if Obama is positioned up as a
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.160]  war hero in much the same way that former president George W. Bush was
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.040]  positioned in the aftermath of 9-11 there are some very serious implications to
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.400]  all of this our world as of today because of this apparent false flag set up
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:53.920]  is headed for war a major global war and we need to take action to prevent it
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:00.200]  we've got to stop us from devolving into a world that can only resort to killing
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.000]  people in order for governments to gain power and control their own populations
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  we've got to resist this we've got to get the word out that we know about this
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.960]  we know what's going on and we've got to take action so that people can protest
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.720]  this even in Israel as dr. Pachinic said in the last segment the Israeli people
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.760]  need to take to the streets and demand peace demand that they do not start
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.240]  another war which can only end in suffering which can only end in death
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.760]  for people on both sides no matter who you side with in this war dropping bombs
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.800]  and and and causing death is not a positive outcome for our world so stay
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.320]  with us right here on the Alex Jones show we'll be breaking this down with a
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:05:02.800]  lot more details when we return right after this break
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.320]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.120]  that the state is God the United States is now recognized globally as one of the
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.600]  most oppressive police states on earth this film conclusively proves the
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.960]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.920]  this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.000]  established an old powerful shadow state police state for chronicles the

[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:25.360]  all right friends welcome back to the alex jones show I'm the fill-in host
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.920]  Mike Adams the editor of natural news and today as you've heard we have been
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:36.040]  exploring just an extraordinary breaking news story on the potential false flag
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:42.240]  attack well I I would say the obvious false flag pretext for an attack in the
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.120]  Middle East so we're going to continue to cover this story here for the next two
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.800]  hours we do have other guests lined up in fact we're going to be talking to
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:57.680]  Leslie botha from Sainvax who's going to give us some information about Governor
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.480]  Jerry Brown's decision in California that allows 12-year-old children to give
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.240]  consent to being injected with a vaccine that could kill them that's another
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.440]  bit of insanity happening in our world today and we're going to cover that we
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:17.280]  also have coming up Mark Castell from the cornucopia Institute at the top of
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.400]  the next hour he's going to talk to us about GMOs having been detected in so
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.040]  called natural cereal products breakfast cereals so we have a lot of news
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.480]  lined up for you also Paul Joseph Watson will likely be joining us in a little
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:38.120]  under an hour to give us some more breaking news on the Iranian the false
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.280]  flag assassination attempt on the Saudi ambassador to the United States and I
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.760]  want to thank Paul Watson for his story if you haven't read it yet get yourself
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.720]  on the info wars calm and read that article because this is probably the
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.520]  biggest news that you have heard certainly all week maybe maybe the
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.360]  biggest story of the year and it's breaking right here on the Alex Jones
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.980]  show I have a lot of questions about that situation too so I'd like to get
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:11.600]  Watson on the phone and ask him a few things to Jaren if you if you can set
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.360]  that up towards the end of this hour now getting to who we have joining us right
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:23.600]  now is a Leslie Batha from the Sainvax Inc. organization which has done
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.720]  extraordinary work on exposing for example the contamination of HPV
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:37.360]  vaccines with the our DNA the recombinant DNA of various strains of HPV
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.600]  itself and that should not be in the DNA and you learned about that here on the
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.160]  Alex Jones show when Dr. Andrew Wakefield joined us and also when Leslie
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.440]  when you saw her articles posted on both natural news and info wars calm as
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.920]  well she joins us now to talk about the recent decision in California I should
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.360]  say the signing of the law by Governor Jerry Brown in California that gives
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:06.080]  children the right the right to consent to something that could kill them Leslie
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.840]  are you with us on the phone I am I'm so glad to be talking about this issue
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:16.080]  absolutely thank you so much for having me on the show Governor Jerry Brown's
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.080]  decision certainly shocked all of us who were part of the efforts to send as much
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:28.240]  information as possible to our advocates in California so that his that he would
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.300]  know the truth about the dangers of this vaccine so that he signed this bill
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:41.400]  into law was against anybody's thinking rational thinking and and really a
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.000]  surprise and and it's still reverberating to the media obviously let's let's break it
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.680]  down though what what exactly this law allows because as I understand it and
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.000]  correct me if I'm wrong and a child could come home from school having a
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.760]  vaccine shot and can say hey hey mommy I got a vaccine shot today and here's my
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.720]  permission note which I signed myself and the school said I could or a child
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:11.160]  could come home from school like happened up to Linda Moran a child came home from
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.880]  school never told her mother she had the vaccine went in to take a bath and
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.080]  never came out of the bathtub because she died because she died absolutely I
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.160]  had another young woman named Courtney on my my own radio show about a month
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.480]  ago talking about this at 15 Courtney and her mother went to a doctor's office
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:37.160]  in California her gynecologist female gynecologist who said Gardasil they said
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.880]  no the gynecologist said can I speak to your daughter alone please pull the
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.960]  daughter aside into her office and said you know I can give you this vaccine
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.680]  without your mother knowing it incredible or Jerry Brown signed the law
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:13:01.240]  two years ago and so when the girl said no the gynecologist physically upset
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.160]  marched out to the mother and said I want you to know that if your daughter
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.440]  gets raped she's gonna get cervical cancer and died because you did not let
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.240]  her get this vaccine
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.880]  farther than the truth absolutely but let's really look at this issue and I
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:24.920]  know I was reading your commentaries on 84.99 this morning and you've done a
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:31.000]  great job total California cave into the criminal vaccine industry but why
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.080]  would governor Jerry Brown why would he sign this I mean who convinced him or
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.360]  who got to him or why would I mean I don't think in his heart that he he
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.800]  wants to be an evil person and yet this act can very easily be interpreted as
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.600]  as a crime against humanity because of the the number of children that are
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.240]  going to be maimed and killed by this why would he do this or is it really an
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.760]  act well it is an act against humanity yes however if he did not sign this bill
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.280]  Gardasil would not be in the news again this week I wouldn't be on the Alex
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.400]  Jones show I wouldn't be on Robert Scott Bell show and I wouldn't be on a
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.520]  radio station out in New York tonight talking about this issue
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:20.320]  let's look at it this way you know let's tie it in with what Michelle
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:26.480]  Bachman did all right well a month ago right at the Republican debate she shocked
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.880]  everybody when she brought up Gardasil and said I wouldn't get the vaccine for
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:38.080]  my kids for her daughters and calling it a potentially dangerous vaccine what if
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.520]  Governor Jerry Brown who I happen to be a fan of for the first time he was
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.640]  governor back in the 70s and buddy did a great job and stood up for the people
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.400]  what if Governor Jerry Brown was under so much pressure by his state
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.360]  legislature by the pharmaceutical companies who we know lobby the heck
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:03.200]  out of everybody sure and signed this bill to bring attention to what is going
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.000]  on what do you mean that the president you even said that in your right right
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.920]  he this this is the the closing chapter of his political career almost
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.120]  certainly and and what a very long political career as well but are you
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.880]  are you suggesting that he did this on purpose to show how ridiculous it is so
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.520]  that there would be some public discussion this backlash before a
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.080]  farmer goes in and buys up every state in the country trying to do the same
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.320]  thing yeah I am suggesting that and I think we need to get the governor Jerry
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:42.880]  Brown's office and find out why well if this is the reason I'm sorry to wrap but
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.800]  if this is the reason he did it and if he comes out and goes public with that
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.880]  then I owe him an apology because I had some very critical things to say about
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.920]  him for signing this what what's your take well I I mean if I could be wrong
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.240]  I've been wrong once already today and I'll probably be wrong by the end of the
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.640]  day but I'm just saying nothing has you know we're all so quick to jump in and
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.600]  to condemn all right and there is a lot to condemn here if indeed he's to come
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:16.360]  to lobbying pressure and work pressure and did this but if he wanted to show
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.800]  how crazy this is wouldn't it have been better to just call a press release and
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.360]  and have all the press around and announce that I'm not gonna sign this
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.800]  bill because big pharma keeps pressuring us and then these vaccines are
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.360]  are not safe for children wouldn't that have been more effective than passing it
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:35.840]  and waiting for the backlash would have been yesterday's news tomorrow
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.880]  everybody loves negative media and and maybe you're right and maybe I am wrong
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.520]  but we don't know yeah we don't we don't know the issue here but here's this is a
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:54.440]  this is a big issue because it does set a dangerous precedent all right so
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.520]  whatever the politics behind it it's a very dangerous precedent of parents
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:04.240]  losing control over their children or health care certain aspects of health
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.840]  care my interest it's STDs it's vaccines and STD vaccines which there are more
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:16.400]  and more coming down the pike and also for mental health diagnosis and SSRIs
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.640]  holy smokes well right and now with this precedent as you just mentioned the
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:28.480]  state overrides the parents not just their their their rights but even their
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.080]  knowledge of it the state can now round up children in school and and run these
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.520]  propaganda campaigns and it's very easy to twist the mind of a 12-year-old
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:42.480]  child in the sense of of social engineering in the context of a
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.600]  classroom they could inject them with with who knows what they could put them
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:50.480]  on preventive chemotherapy for preventing future breast cancer I mean
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.800]  your little girl could come home from school with chemotherapy absolutely
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.440]  absolutely but what better way to light a fire under parents and to set a bill
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.640]  in motion that takes away their rights because we are a very complacent society
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.520]  Leslie by the way what's what's your website address for those who want to
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.640]  follow your coverage of this my well there's samebacks.org and I have my
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.080]  own website on holy hormones.com which is all about women's health and you
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:24.800]  know really there there is a big picture here that is why we are in such a mess
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.320]  and that is because we do not have adequate information for young girls
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:36.120]  about health care and and that is the crime they don't understand their bodies
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.360]  they're being put on birth control pills at alarming rates they're putting out
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:46.680]  to be given Gardasil at alarming rates and it's killing them. The whole
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.760]  social-political issues surrounding women's health care is all about money
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.600]  and profit. Of course it is of course and this is also all about parents versus
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.720]  the state because I think you would agree with me that even if Gardasil were
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.760]  proven a hundred percent safe which it hasn't been proven but even if it were
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.440]  we would still want parents to have the rights to choose what gets injected into
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:14.440]  their children correct and that is absolutely correct at all times at all
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:19.000]  times parents need to be aware and they need to be accountable for their child's
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.240]  health we need to be accountable for our health that's what natural news is all
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:31.040]  about and that's what you provide us information for all the time. Leslie we're
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.720]  about to go to a break I'd like to ask you to stay with us and join us again on
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.440]  the other side of this break if you're listening this is the Alice Jones show
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.040]  I'm the fill-in host Mike Adams stay with us we'll be right back after this
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:57.640]  short break with more from Leslie and Sane Vax.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:02.680]  Why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today why don't doctors
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.160]  know how to help you could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.680]  a nutrition solution and they only know about drugs over 68 diseases are
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.120]  connected to a deficiency of glutathione the missing ingredient to
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:18.120]  increasing your body's production of glutathione is cysteine raising your
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.440]  glutathione production protects you from cancer heart disease Parkinson's macular

[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.400]  the fill-in host today Mike Adams the editor of natural news and we are
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.400]  joined in this segment continuing with Leslie Botha from Sainte-Vax Inc. talking
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.600]  about Jerry Brown governor Jerry Brown signature in California of Bill AB 499
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:37.440]  which allows children to give consent children as young as 12 years old if you
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.720]  can believe that they give consent to being injected with potentially deadly
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.680]  vaccines even without their parents knowing about it and at the same time by
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.680]  the way Governor Brown signed another bill that says oh you can't go to a tanning
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.200]  salon if you're under 18 without a note from your parents or actually parental
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.600]  escort almost you can't even go to the zoo you can't go to a field trip museum
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:04.200]  without a note from your parents but but now if you're 12 years old if you're
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:10.480]  13 you can say yes to a vaccine that we know has killed children a vaccine that
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.480]  maims some children a vaccine with neurological side effects it's absolutely
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.440]  insane and here to give us a little more information on that is Leslie from
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.120]  Sainte-Vax Inc. and that website is Sainte-Vax.org is that correct Leslie?
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.080]  That is correct. Sainte-Vax stands for safe affordable necessary and effective
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.600]  vaccinations. Perfect now just go ahead yeah. The whole thing does sound ludicrous I
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.600]  mean Governor Brown usually protects family rights parental rights he's been
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.160]  known to do that over the years he stands up for the people he stands up for
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.280]  the family and and that's why this is anybody else but Governor Brown I'd be
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:58.040]  going bastard but with Governor Brown it just doesn't make sense and then as I
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.200]  said before and in light of Michelle Bachman and what she did and the risk
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:09.560]  that she took in losing points and losing credibility for coming out and
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.560]  speaking about Gardasil during the Republican debate and you sort of look
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:21.080]  at those back and forth and you go maybe we're having more of an impact than we
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:27.600]  realize the collective impact in the wars Sainte-Vax vaccine truth all of the
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.000]  other vaccine awareness sites Dr. Mayor Eisenstein, Sherry Tenpenny
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.320]  I mean this is the strongest this movement has been in 30 years. Well it's
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.640]  extraordinary. It is extraordinary the press release that I wrote about Rick
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:48.520]  Perry and Gardasil was actually posted on Mitt Romney's website. Fantastic. Yeah
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:55.000]  Sainte-Vax has been written up and been visited by the CDC FDA, Senate,
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.320]  Governors, universities, you know we're watching all these people hitting on our
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:06.560]  website so is it really that absurd to think that? We are having this impact
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.480]  your work and the work of Alex here at his show at Info Wars Paul Watson
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:15.600]  what we're doing in natural news many like Sherry Tenpenny that you
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.400]  mentioned we are all having an impact and we are shaping the conversations out
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.040]  there kudos to Michelle Bachman for raising this issue I mean I may not
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.680]  agree with her on all her other issues but on this issue she nailed Rick Perry
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.080]  to the wall with it. Absolutely she did and she knew she was gonna be at great
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.200]  risk for doing so and she dropped immediately to the bottom of the barrel
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:43.280]  but she did it and she spoke as a mother and she was honest about it and so
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.320]  that's why I have to question really and I can't condemn Jerry Brown until we
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.120]  know that would be a great interview for you or somebody out there let's get to
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.800]  Jerry Brown's office well I already condemned Jerry Brown maybe it's too
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:01.200]  late but look hey I'll retract it if I mean I'll apologize to the guy if it
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.480]  turns out that this was some kind of weird behind-the-scenes plot to actually
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.920]  expose the dangers of vaccines I just I that that seems like a stretch to me but
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:17.760]  you may be right in the media Gardasil is in the media Merck's marketing
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.520]  department has to be dying there is no more damage control for them this thing
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.600]  is a train wreck it's a train running out of control and it's going to gain
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:31.040]  more momentum as we go and we could have done this about Michelle Bachman and we
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:36.760]  couldn't have done it without sorry Governor Jerry Brown signing this bill
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:42.400]  what an extraordinary roll call of players in the the stage of world events
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:47.040]  just on the vaccine front not to even mention what's going on today with Iran
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.720]  and and Saudi Arabia and Israel and all that we're just about out of time here
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.320]  Leslie I want to thank you for joining us I'm sorry it's a short segment for you

[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:18.680]  Mike Adams we're gonna be joined shortly by Paul Joseph Watson who is working
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:24.960]  feverishly on a breaking story to be posted on info wars.com probably maybe
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.920]  within half an hour I guess he'll tell us exactly when before we bring Paul
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:33.120]  Watson in I just want to cover a couple of things here on this issue this
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.120]  breaking news today this is the biggest news story happening probably probably
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.640]  on the planet today because we're talking about a false flag pretext for war in
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:49.040]  the Middle East the Obama administration now practically being caught
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:56.360]  just just fudging a false flag attempted assassination plot against a
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:01.760]  Saudi ambassador in the United States involving an Iranian used car salesman
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.800]  from Texas who has been just probably another another Patsy set up by perhaps
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:12.120]  the FBI perhaps the CIA certain rogue elements within those agencies I'm gonna
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.800]  ask Paul Watson about more about that but let's go to the mainstream media very
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:21.120]  quickly and see how they are beating the drums for war beating the war drums
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:26.240]  the Washington Post Obama blames Iran government for role in assassination
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.520]  plot against Saudi diplomat well how convenient is that problem reaction
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:39.120]  solution from the Obama administration a former Netanyahu advisor says time for
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:47.880]  the US to strike Iran very convenient pretext there daily news says Iran's
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:52.680]  terror plot marks the end of engagement it's time for Washington to get tough
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:57.960]  with Tehran oh really time to get tough because of this because of this just
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:05.040]  juvenile assassination plot really what else do we have here Treasury official
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.240]  Iran sanctions are working and we should keep them going this is from CNN
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.800]  politics Baltimore Sun reports I attacking Iran would invite disaster
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.440]  here's a little different point of view on this yeah of course they would invite
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:24.480]  disaster disaster for Israel and much more here's something from CBS news very
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.000]  interesting it leads off with quote the alleged plot to kill the Saudi
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.160]  ambassador to the United States was comically amateurish yeah no kidding
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.720]  but the US government believes not only that it was approved at high levels in
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:45.680]  Tehran but also that it was not the only plot from CBS news correspondent Bill
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.520]  Plante now we're gonna bring in Paul Joseph Watson who has already reported
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:55.440]  on this and he's going to be posting another story Paul Watson are you with
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:03.560]  us now with us via Skype hello Mike hello Paul great to hear from you all right
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.520]  basically what's happening is that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta visited
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.680]  Tel Aviv back on October 3rd and it appears as if the Israelis basically
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.520]  told him look we've got a two-month window for this strike on Iran we've got
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.520]  to get it done before winter because if we wait then it's going to make it a
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:30.080]  whole lot more difficult and the debate apparently has been on how the United
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.880]  States would give the green light for this Israeli assault on Iran so low and
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:42.280]  behold less than two weeks later we have this ridiculous fantasy hoax of a
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:47.600]  terror plot which it now turns out the so-called mastermind behind it this
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:54.320]  used car salesman turns out to be a drunk pothead hawker frequenting quote
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:00.680]  joke that's how he's being described but now this fake plot is being
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:06.320]  aggressively exploited from everyone from you know Hillary Clinton John Kerry
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.360]  to John McCain and it's interesting because back in February last year we
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:16.880]  wrote that it would be an assassination attempt that would be used as the
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:22.000]  pretext to go into Iran now we speculated that it might be Obama as the
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.400]  target it actually turns out that Obama is now being pressured by the neocons
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.040]  he's been blackmailed into this attack because they're saying this is the only
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:38.720]  way to get tough to save your presidency is to green light this attack on Iran
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:44.200]  so you know ten days after Panetta visits Tel Aviv the Israelis basically
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:47.640]  tell him look this is what's going to happen you better get on board with it
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:52.560]  and then ten days later we have this ridiculous fake terror plot which is
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.160]  Anthony Schaefer Lieutenant Colonel told Andrew Napoletano last night on
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:03.400]  Fox Business is a complete myth there's no evidence to detail it within the FBI
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:10.280]  channels Schaefer had an FBI insider an FBI FBI investigator look to see if he
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.120]  could find any details regarding this alleged plot and he found absolutely
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.800]  nothing it's being completely manufactured out of whole cloth and now
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.360]  it's being used as the pretext to green light this planned preplanned
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.240]  Israeli assault on Iran but Paul importantly on this and an outstanding
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.600]  analysis you've offered us already and I know more coming from you today with
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:38.120]  new stories to be posted on info wars.com but the question is is the
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.280]  mainstream media going to continue to buy it and will the people of America
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:48.080]  buy into this even though it is now an obvious hoax I mean we've got some media
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.280]  outlets are questioning it others are buying into it where do you see this
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.400]  playing out across the mainstream media and then in the minds of the American
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:06.480]  people. Were you able to hear me there Paul? Yeah it's just cutting out a bit but
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:11.120]  yeah I got the gist of what you were saying yeah the Washington Post the New
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.560]  York Times and others have come out with articles admitting that most foreign
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:21.040]  observers and terror experts doubt the credence of this plot but then in the
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.600]  rest of the article they'll go on to detail the frivolous you know storyboard
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:31.480]  the myth behind it what they're saying now is that there's a chain of plots
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.520]  that are going to be blamed on Iran so this is only going to escalate and now
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.800]  Time magazine has come out and basically said look the response to this is not
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.720]  going to be sanctions it's not going to be isolation of Iran it's a pretext for
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.320]  war so they're going beyond saying that it's just going to be another tactic to
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.160]  isolate Iran and saying that that you know Obama's gonna gonna have to get
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:57.680]  tough or he's gonna be accused of being quote soft on Iran so that's what the
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.760]  likes of Time magazine are saying so they're gonna play this game where Obama
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.880]  gets the right cover from the neocons Michelle Bachman Romney they've all
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:11.760]  come out all the so-called tea party people and said that it you know it
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.880]  proves the case that we need to go and attack Iran so Obama's got right cover
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.680]  from his supposed political enemies who have all teamed up together to support
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:27.880]  him and now you know the green lights being given Paul Watson do you does the
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:35.000]  term CS1 mean anything to you CS1 as a referring to a paid informant with the
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.240]  Department of Justice I'm just getting some some breaking news handed to me
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:47.520]  here is that something you've covered so far yeah I believe that's that's the
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:54.880]  Department of Justice go between that this this joke of a mastermind went
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.920]  and visited and he gave him the orders to create the leisure which they could
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.680]  then exploit to put out this myth in the media that it was a big a big
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:09.480]  dangerous assassination plot involving Mexican drug cartels of course as we
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:15.480]  documented those very same Mexican Los Settos gang members from court
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.960]  transcripts that's come out in recent months have been proven to be working
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.200]  directly in cahoots with the federal government itself and in fact many of
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.400]  the weapons from fast and furious the guns went directly to Los Settos gang
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:35.040]  members so I mean from the DEA agent to the Los Settos they were all working
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.280]  together and then they find this idiot joke of a guy who's into you know smoking
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:46.560]  part getting drunk and frequenting brothels to be the quote mastermind of
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.120]  this plot it's completely inconsistent with how Al Kud's the Iranian
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.880]  revolutionary special tactics unit works as every terror expert has said
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:00.880]  they're not going to hire some idiot drunk in America to carry out an
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.280]  assassination plot and they wouldn't even carry out in America this ambassador
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.720]  is going to be in the Middle East most of the time why not just carry out there
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:14.600]  why would you do it in Washington DC it's ridiculous and every expert has
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:19.760]  said so very good questions from you Paul Watson I want to thank you for
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.520]  joining us I know you've got to go to keep working on the story that you're
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:27.840]  about to post on info wars.com can you give us an idea when when can people
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.160]  expect that story to be live
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:38.080]  yes terror hoax could foreshadow Israeli attack on Iran and it'll be up
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.240]  within half an hour on info wars.com all right all right there you have it
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:46.680]  then terror hoax story to be posted on info wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.040]  coming up hopefully within half an hour now that how's that for pressure for Paul
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:53.960]  Watson I bet he's scrambling there thank you for joining us Paul for taking time
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:58.200]  out of your busy journalism schedule there also to get us that story now
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.000]  some of the breaking news we have on this and by the way this is all
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.080]  teleprompter free radio just like info wars nightly news is teleprompter free
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.880]  this is all breaking news right now this is huge breaking news and so bear with
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.640]  us as as we bring in different stories and different guests and different
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:20.720]  pieces of evidence here the the latest piece that I'm seeing here is a story
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:27.520]  entitled paid DOJ agent provocateur at the center of quote Iranian terrorist
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.160]  plot this was written by Kyle Rogers from the Charleston political buzz
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.440]  examiner and in that story he says he asked the question was the assassination
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:41.960]  plot an actual plot or just entrapment well that's because the FBI as we know
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:47.360]  goes out there and recruits Patsy's we've seen this pattern emerging just over
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.600]  and over again where they recruit these people who are largely incompetent just
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.960]  like what we are seeing here and then the FBI actually gives them the gear gives
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.400]  them for example the remote controlled airplane that was supposed to be flown
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:07.040]  into the Pentagon it gives them the explosives gives them the firearms and
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:11.440]  the grenades in that case and there are many other cases other attempted quote
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.400]  attempted bombings attempted terrorist events where it's on the record now it's
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.960]  been exposed that the FBI itself or perhaps let's say a rogue element within
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.440]  the FBI because I don't I don't want to say that all FBI agents are bad that's
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:30.720]  not true there are many very good men and women in the FBI who are doing their
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.680]  jobs and I want to give them credit but there are also rogue elements within
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:41.000]  every agency that appear to be putting together these false flag attacks for the
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.320]  sole purpose of reminding us all in an Orwellian type of style that we are
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.040]  always at war and we should always be afraid now in this case they're amping
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:57.360]  it up to a whole new level with this what what looks like a false flag
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:04.560]  assassination attempt they're saying not just be afraid not just be terrified
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.600]  that there are terrorists running around everywhere but even more so that oh
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:17.360]  now we have the moral justification to go to war or to allow Israel to bomb Iran
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:24.960]  to to allow a key US ally to engage in what's going to be a murderous attack a
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:32.000]  high fatality rates no doubt attack on Iran which now looks imminent as Alex
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.920]  said when he joined us in the last hour he believes this may happen within two
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:41.360]  weeks you know certainly give or take a some timetable on that we don't have a
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.200]  crystal ball around here but we do see the patterns and we do know history and
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:50.440]  we do know when there's a problem reaction solution being presented to us
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.800]  so that we will react and then allow these administrations to commit what
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:00.600]  are essentially illegal acts and then justify it with these actions that they
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:06.760]  have fabricated from the get-go so I've got some some questions about this and
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:12.840]  some analysis that I want to share with you we are what five minutes away from
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:16.120]  a break good we've got enough time to do this and by the way we are going to be
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.520]  joined at the top of the next hour by Mark Castell from the cornucopia
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.160]  Institute who's going to be giving us information about how GMOs have been
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.440]  found detected verified in laboratories in so-called natural food products
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:38.040]  natural cereals you know most people think natural foods are better than
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:41.360]  than everything else they think that they have no pesticides and no GMOs and
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.240]  it turns out that is not exactly the case now just coming in here on my desk
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:50.800]  we have a tip from a listener Aaron in Canada thanks for sending this in this
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:56.080]  is a an article Canada should arrest George W. Bush when he visits next week
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:04.400]  says amnesty oh wow okay Bush admitted in his memoirs that he authorized the
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:11.000]  use of torture against terror suspects all of this was authorized George Bush
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.960]  wrote and condoned and put in place through his own repeated decision I'm
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:18.720]  sorry that's not what George Bush wrote that is that is being quoted from the
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:22.840]  story all of this was authorized and condoned and put in place through his
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:29.520]  own repeated decisions he being president former president Bush so amnesty
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.440]  is saying he should be arrested when he shows up in Canada well that would be
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:38.800]  interesting it wasn't Rumsfeld didn't someone try to arrest Rumsfeld when he
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.840]  was traveling through Europe a couple of years ago these these sort of
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:49.520]  unindicted war criminals running running around who many of the awakened
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.080]  people are trying to get arrested that's an interesting bit of news yeah if you
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:59.040]  have any more news coming in on either fast and furious or this false flag
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.560]  assassination attempt just jump on in here bring it bring it to me we're
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.840]  gonna jump in at any moment that's necessary to cover this story let me
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:15.520]  ask you the question listeners what do you suppose happens if Israel bombs Iran
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.800]  what is the aftermath of that now if you've been listening to the Alex Jones
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:24.800]  show for any length of time you probably have a very solid grasp of what
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:30.880]  we're talking about that would happen in the aftermath of that and I'd love to
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.080]  have man I'd love to be talking to Bob Chapman right now about this I would I
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.840]  would love to have Gerald Salente on right now but let me just take a whack
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:44.040]  at this you can expect oil prices to just skyrocket globally massive spike in
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:50.720]  oil prices maybe gasoline it at five to ten dollars a gallon in the aftermath
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.840]  of a strike on Iran what about gold prices well of course gold prices would
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:01.880]  spike how high we don't know but maybe this would hit that $2,500 an ounce
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:07.680]  target that was mentioned previously I believe by by Bank of America what about
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:14.720]  people who would see this as a an increased tensioning of world events and
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.000]  they would be more interested in preparedness I think you would see a
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.200]  run on ammunition in the US I think you'd see a run on preparedness supplies
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:29.120]  and preparedness food and gear I think many of these companies that offer these
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:35.240]  products would be backordered after a strike on Iran you would also have of
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:41.680]  course radioactive fallout if a nuclear facility a nuclear processing
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:46.920]  facility was targeted in the strike which is almost a certainty what else
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.720]  would Israel be going after other than the political leadership of Iran and
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:55.800]  also the nuclear processing facilities now if that happens I really wish we
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:00.000]  had a nuclear expert on here who could give us even more details about this and
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.800]  perhaps we will let's see what we can do about that in the next hour but you're
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.600]  gonna have essentially a dirty bomb unleashed a massive radioactive tidal wave
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:17.720]  of contamination sweeping across Iran now which way do the winds blow across
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.040]  Iran and who which neighbors are going to be affected by this what is going to
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:27.920]  be the cost in human lives and suffering and future sickness from the
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:33.040]  potential radioactive fallout if there is an Israeli strike on Iran these are
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.520]  questions that you've got to consider now that the pretext for this is is right
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:42.600]  in our faces now stay with us here on the Alex Jones show we're going to
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.440]  continue talk about this and we'll have more guests on on the other side of this
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.560]  break I'm Mike Adams filling in today for Alex stay with us we'll be right back

[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:29.040]  iphone app plugged into the stereo here in the info wars mobile and you
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.640]  mentioned the Charleston paper and others the New York Times has come out
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.840]  dead this is baloney and and this isn't where they go out and set up the
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:41.360]  Iranian National if you know secret police this is where they just go out
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.520]  and usually recruits by to be part of the drill and then the person takes part
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.160]  in the drill they set them up or they're not even involved or they find a
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:54.560]  mentally ill person because that's the MO over and over again and he would make
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.560]  for immediate miss the FBI the last two years as you pointed out more than a
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.960]  hundred cases of this have come out over and over again to create this
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.080]  perception of a threat instead of carrying out a big elaborate false flag
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.640]  like 9-11 but there's no doubt with old with Obama plunging no doubt with the
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.640]  global bankers not getting their agenda through but the global crisis that would
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.600]  come out of an Iran strike you know be bad for the economy people
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.800]  primitively and to still rally around their government in Europe in the US and

[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.240]  like you said remember the George Bush moment after 9-11 where he took the
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.280]  bullhorn and and looked really presidential this this is what Obama is
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.880]  being set up for here to look presidential in this war crisis it's

[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:12.680]  Panetta set 10 days ago as Raymond governs that last week what he was on
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:16.880]  with us and then we got to get Raymond over non-demar for like 10 15 minutes if
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.360]  he can if he can do it show show show all of that is happening
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:26.440]  Obama is being politically destroyed Israel wants to watch this attack that
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:31.680]  Yadu needs it politically all of this is going on Israel's lost wars and
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:36.640]  Lebanon and other areas so that the Hawks over there are hot for this war it'll
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.320]  massively increase oil price to be oil companies like that it will hurdle the
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:52.760]  world into a massive global crisis so this is serious serious serious right
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:02:00.360]  now it is green-lighted this is not a potential green light I've talked to two
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:04.800]  military sources and another through family who's being shipped over there
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:12.120]  right now and logistics it is on U.S. supporting Israel in a strike and all
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:17.280]  of this to just to have a headline there to divert the public that well after all
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:23.880]  Iran wants to blow up an embassy in DC so old Obama's pretty bad but he still hit
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.600]  them and then the establishment elements of it are using fast and furious
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:32.320]  and you notice the neocons are the Republican leadership is demanding
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:38.520]  a war along with Israel they're using that to get Obama in line for it if it
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:47.240]  is when Los Netta's and and and and Sino Loa drug cartel shipping drugs into the
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.200]  United States a chip and guns down there that goes back five and a half years
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:54.960]  that's it they'll pass the time for the papers show show show show you sir he's
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:03:01.480]  using this right now he's using this right now as a way to basically put
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:06.320]  pressure on Obama to go ahead and go with this war that's how blackmail and
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.160]  government works that's how statecraft works this is on Mike this is gonna
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.360]  happen if we don't expose this hoax well it seems like every war always has this
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.600]  fairytale pretext and remember remember weapons of mass destruction that was
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.800]  that was sold to us as the justification for it now we're gonna have this this
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:28.080]  embassy bombing attempt and even if it later comes out that it was completely
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:33.520]  fabricated the media will conveniently forget it and and they'll say well the
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:38.160]  war was justified anyway all by itself later on right I mean they have this is
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.760]  the strange memory of of reality
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:47.480]  exactly we've seen fraud after fraud hoax after hoax the little nobody puppet

[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:22.360]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:26.720]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is

[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:32.000]  all right welcome back friends this is the Alex Jones show I'm the fillin
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.160]  host today Mike Adams the editor of natural news dot com we've been talking
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:42.440]  about this huge breaking news now I know why Alex keeps the studio so chilly in
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:46.320]  here with the air conditioning because the news is so incredibly hot that you
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:49.720]  really have to have some extra AC to keep you going I mean this this is
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:53.960]  incredible and it's not it's not funny news by the way this is very disturbing
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:09:00.560]  news that we've been covering about the potential pretext for war in the Middle
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:06.160]  East now we're going to be joined we have a scheduled guest here going to be
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:10.960]  joining us here shortly market Castel from the cornucopia Institute to talk
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.640]  about GMOs and natural serial products I'll give you a brief intro on that here
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.400]  in a second but I just want you to know we will continue to return to the big
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:25.200]  breaking news of today so we'll give you the latest updates on that close to the
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:30.240]  bottom of the hour and also at the top at the top of this hour as well and we'll
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.840]  see if we can get the headlines from Paul Joseph Watson's story which should
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:39.920]  be posted shortly we spoke to him in the last hour now cornucopia Institute has
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.600]  put out just an extraordinary new piece of research this actually came out what
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:51.160]  was it Tuesday in fact we were the first to carry the news at natural news and
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:56.920]  then cornucopia has tested all of these serial products that claim to be natural
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.600]  now here's why this is important out there because all of you listening you
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:07.520]  know you want to avoid GMOs most people do surveys now say that something like
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.240]  80 90% of people who are aware of the issue they want to avoid genetically
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:17.600]  engineered ingredients in their food so these food companies the big mega
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:23.360]  corporations they continue to use genetically engineered corn and soy
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:29.920]  and and cotton seed oil and canola oil in their products but they label them as
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:35.240]  natural because they know that most moms most people shopping in the grocery
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:38.800]  stores when they look on the store shelf and they see a box of cereal and it
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:43.800]  says oh it's all natural wholesome from the earth and it has a wonderful
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.360]  beautiful name and it has pictures of grain on it and pictures of the earth
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:53.480]  on it they think the consumers think and they've been misled they think that
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:58.280]  that means no GMOs they think that that means no pesticides they think it means
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:04.800]  organic but it doesn't and this is the scam that is being exposed by the
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:10.960]  cornucopia Institute so joining us today from that Institute is Mark Castell
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:15.320]  the executive director there who was instrumental in putting this story
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:20.120]  together and breaking this news to the world Mark you're on the Alex Jones show
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:26.520]  thanks for joining us hi Mike it's great to have you on greetings from not so
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:32.760]  sunny Wisconsin today yeah a lot going on in Wisconsin I bet you've been hammered
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:37.640]  by a media request since putting this story out what has been the reaction so
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:44.040]  far well it's been big obviously you have a lot of followers on your natural
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:50.360]  news website it's now been just I don't know viral the right term but it's been
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:56.400]  carried by quite a few of the prominent websites the great media we're starting
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:03.360]  at calls now from cereal and granola makers who aren't entirely happy and you
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:09.520]  really hit the nail on the head people think and most of us have a working
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  definition for the term natural in in the world whether it's on a package of
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:23.240]  food cereal or granola in this case and let's also define what's not natural I
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:31.280]  think if Monsanto splices genes together and puts a naturally occurring
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:37.360]  pesticide in corn something that doesn't appear in the natural genome wasn't
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.480]  created by God was created by scientists to make a profit most of us wouldn't
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:47.600]  call that quote natural so it's outrageous that marketers can decide to
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:53.760]  put that word natural on a label and then include genetically modified organisms
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:59.640]  or we could even talk about how that grain is raised besides the GMOs and
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:06.400]  the USDA has done extensive study of cereal grains and found high residues
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:14.600]  of many toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in the commodities themselves those
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:20.200]  aren't natural and if in to make matters worse I'd say this is almost rubbing
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:25.520]  salt in the wounds after you get done harvesting those genetically engineered
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:31.760]  crops that were sprayed maybe with glyphophate roundup is the Monsanto's
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.040]  trade name for this the most popular herbicide in the world after you get done
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.920]  harvesting those crops you put them in a storage bin and then you spray them with
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:46.240]  what's commonly called a crop protectant that's a fancy word for pesticide
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:50.560]  they're spraying right on the oats or right on the wheat to make sure that
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.760]  rodents and bugs don't eat them in storage and then they're in your kids
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:14:00.000]  breakfast cereal I I just don't consider it natural and that's why we've we've
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.400]  published this report to try to differentiate what the difference is
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.360]  between certified organic food where there are some standards and natural
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:15.240]  where the standards are are developed by the marketing executives and they mean
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:19.480]  they mean whatever they want them to say all right so so very quickly than the
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:23.480]  the most important takeaway point from this for those listening is that the
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:29.240]  word natural on grocery products is essentially meaningless and your
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:36.680]  organization through lab testing with a reputable lab that you already told me
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.600]  the name of them so I know I know that they're reputable I don't know if you
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:44.360]  released that publicly but you found pesticide residues in so-called or I'm
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:48.400]  sorry you found genetically engineered ingredients in so-called natural products
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:54.040]  and you also know that the USDA says that these pesticides are typically used
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.680]  in those conventional grains that are found in natural products as well is that
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:04.480]  correct that's correct Mike to make matters worse not only did we find high
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:10.600]  levels of GMOs we're talking about 28 to 100% so this was not a little drift
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.760]  from the next farm or a grain bin that wasn't quite cleaned out well these
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:18.280]  were the crops themselves were genetically engineered so not only did we
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:23.680]  find that in quote natural cereal some of those cereals were actually touting
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:31.600]  themselves as being GMO free so it was really borderline or outright consumer
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:35.760]  fraud here well this is this is sent shockwaves through the natural health
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.760]  industry I mean I've talked to many influential people in the industry who
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:46.080]  who are very concerned obviously everybody wants the term organic to
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:51.640]  mean something they want a non GMO certification to really mean non GMOs and
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:55.320]  and there's concern right now that a lot of consumers are confused I mean they're
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:59.920]  upset we've had people who are upset they they were buying a brand and they
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:04.640]  thought it was GMO free and it turns out it's not was there a cereal brand that
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:11.000]  came out of this squeaky clean that can be trusted mark yes in fact what I want
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.600]  to encourage your listeners to do and your readers on your website is to go to
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:24.920]  the cornucopia Institute website and that's C O R N U C O P I a dot org go to
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:29.200]  the cornucopia Institute website and visit the cereal report it's called
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:34.640]  cereal crimes and on that we have a scorecard where we list all the name
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:40.400]  brands organic and natural and what their policies are and we rate them and I'm
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:45.480]  happy to tell you that there are a bunch of 100% organic brands that you can
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:50.920]  really trust and here's the kicker some of these quote natural brands they cost
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:54.800]  more expensive than the organic one oh yeah I saw that yeah pretty outrageous
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.880]  you know the the other interesting thing that that the listeners might not be
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:04.800]  aware of is that that many of these quote independent kind of green crunchy
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:10.640]  companies you know we are talking about granola here are actually hiding behind
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:16.640]  a facade the one of the biggest companies is Tashi they're owned by
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:20.360]  Kellogg's you'll never see the name Kellogg's on a package or their website
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.040]  another brand is bear naked granola it's one of the largest selling granola
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:29.880]  brands probably the most expensive on the store shelf at your grocery whether
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:34.920]  you stop shop at Safeway or Whole Foods or one of the co-ops very expensive
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:39.760]  that's that's owned by Kellogg's as well another granola brand back to nature
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:43.920]  that's not the nice that's owned by Kraft but you'll never see their name on
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:47.920]  there either yeah doesn't Pepsi co-own one of the major brands out there is at
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:55.320]  mothers yeah I think that's Pepsi co so yeah yeah so most of these people know that
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:06.840]  people are Quaker is Pepsi co and and I believe mothers also so you know when
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:11.080]  when consumers are looking for value-added food and they're willing to
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:15.320]  pay a premium for it most of time that means organic these natural ones are
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:21.920]  what I like to call organic light folks aren't just buying the granola or the
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:25.440]  cereal or the melt they're buying the story behind that label how it was
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:29.480]  produced where it was produced and they think they're supporting sound
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:33.680]  environmental stewardship they they think that they're supporting more
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:37.800]  humane animal husbandry when it comes to meat and dairy and they think that one
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.440]  of the reasons it costs more is that economic justice for family farmers is
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:47.720]  built right into the price so when they find out we really talking about giant
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:53.480]  agribusinesses giant corporations exploiting the trust of consumers that
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:58.760]  the people that are doing the farming might be exploited immigrants not small
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:03.960]  family farmers the cows might be living short stressful lives you know none of
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:08.480]  those things comport with the the values and the story they think they're paying
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:13.480]  extra for right exactly exactly an aisle there for some part mark I want to ask you
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.960]  to stay with us we're about to go to a break but I have a couple more questions
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:21.000]  for you on the other side of this coming break specifically I'd like to ask you
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:28.120]  what can parents and consumers look for on the labels to be as sure as possible
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:32.520]  that there are no GMOs in those products to the best of your knowledge I'd like
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:37.480]  to ask you that question when we return this is the Alex Jones show we're going
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:41.280]  to continue to cover GMOs and the breaking news of today the false flag
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.800]  assassination embassy bombing attempt so stay with us here we'll be right back
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:48.960]  on the Alex Jones show
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.280]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:08.000]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.280]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:16.640]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:20.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:29.400]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:33.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:37.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.920]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:15.720]  I'm the fill-in host Mike Adams the health ranger I'm sometimes called happy
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:20.280]  to join in and fill in today with with the whole crew here the Info Wars crew
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:24.400]  doing a fantastic job as usual and we are joined right now by Mark Castell
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:29.760]  from the cornucopia Institute which has released a groundbreaking new report
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:35.240]  exposing the genetically engineered ingredient content in quote natural
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:40.280]  foods it's extraordinary we're going to talk to mark for a couple more minutes
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:43.800]  and then we're going to summarize some additional breaking news on the other
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:48.400]  news fronts oh man it is a day of just incredible news there's so much going on
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:51.800]  here if you see me looking around if you're watching this on prisonplan.tv
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:56.840]  it's because I'm surrounded by by headlines and stories everywhere this
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.120]  there's so much to bring in there's no way we're going to get to it all but let's
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:03.880]  continue with Mark Castell here from cornucopia I asked you a question before
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:10.320]  the break mark about how can parents and consumers know with at least some
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:16.840]  certainty which cereals they can trust to be completely or substantially free of
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:22.920]  GMOs well I think the best weapon in making sure that a you have the safest
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:32.080]  food in terms of chemical residues GMOs antibiotics hormones is to look for
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.720]  that organic seal and to buy products that qualify for organic certification
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:44.320]  that is by far the most comprehensive food production system that there's out
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:51.320]  there it has federal law governing the standards it has lots of independent
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:56.640]  certifiers that inspect every farm and every plant every year to obtain that
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:01.200]  certification and then it has governmental and corporate watchdogs
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.600]  like the cornucopia Institute to make sure that the USDA is actually fulfilling
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:10.440]  their duties and they haven't always done that and but there are lots of most
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:14.640]  importantly stakeholders the individual farmers that believe in this the
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.840]  consumers that believe in this that's our intelligence agents out here at the
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:23.080]  cornucopia Institute we hear about problems we were able to look at them
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:27.720]  and other than organics there's nobody looking over the shoulder of corporate
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:33.120]  business they're just kind of painting this this pretty marketing picture and
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:37.760]  expecting to buy products that are really conventional food and the profit
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:42.760]  margins on these quote natural products are through the stratosphere well that's
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:45.280]  the other angle on this that really shocks a lot of people and by the way
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:51.440]  jaren can you bring up a symbol search the image of the USDA organic seal I'd
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:56.280]  like to put that on the screen for those watching this it's a green circular
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:00.680]  symbol and you need to be familiar with this symbol so that you can look for it
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:04.600]  that's what mark was just mentioning if it doesn't have that symbol it's not
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.200]  certified by the USDA and even though I personally don't have a lot of nice
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:11.920]  words for the USDA in general I do know that their their their organic
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:17.800]  certification program is rock solid I've seen their inspectors working and
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:21.960]  inspecting and they actually do a very good job that symbol means something and
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:28.280]  I support that symbol any comments on that mark yeah we've seen the organic
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:33.720]  programs relatively young and during the first year we uncovered first years we
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:38.360]  uncovered a pretty fair amount of corruption at one point we partnered
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:46.120]  with cornucopia and the Washington Post on an expo day of kind of a way too
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:50.280]  cozy relationship between the woman who was running the national organic
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:54.480]  program during the Bush administration and corporate lobbyists and they were
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:58.840]  putting some synthetics and food that were illegal they were allowing some
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:04.600]  giant factory farms to produce eggs and milk and we've cleaned that up I you know
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:13.760]  I think the legacy of Barack Obama at the USDA is mixed at best but in terms of
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:19.400]  the organic program they've appointed some people with high integrity and it's
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:24.680]  not where it should be yet it's not 100% bull proof Mike but it's getting there I
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:28.080]  think your impression is generally accurate well the other thing that
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:32.240]  people need to realize and this was also mentioned in your report in various
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:38.360]  ways that GMO contamination is so widespread right now that it's virtually
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:44.240]  impossible to get a breakfast cereal made with corn or soy that doesn't have
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:48.280]  at least some small level of GMO contamination but that that might only
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:54.200]  be what 0.1% to 0.5% something like that yeah there are very low
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:29:00.160]  thresholds it you know this really amounts to the fact that no matter what
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.360]  our number one issue is and right now we're talking about food but it could
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:10.520]  be about you know whether the citizenry gets accurate information before we go
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:14.920]  to war I mean this is like deja vu all over again I mean remember the talking
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:19.960]  bulk resolution you know mark I've got to I'm sorry I've got to cut you off here
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:23.800]  we're closing out this segment and I want to thank you for joining us and

[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:22.320]  fill-in host for today Mike Adams the editor of natural news dot-com and I
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:27.560]  think Kurt Nemo just put up a story on info wars dot-com about Walgreens this is
[02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:32.600]  story that I wrote yesterday Walgreens we've been getting reports from Walgreens
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:36.600]  customers that they feel like they're being bullied about getting a flu shot
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:41.640]  at Walgreens like they're checking out at the checkout counter you know and the
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:44.360]  employees there are saying have you had a flu shot do you want a flu shot go get
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.120]  a flu shot and we're being told by people who say they are Walgreens
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:54.600]  employees that they're being rewarded with iPads if they meet a certain number
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:01.200]  of flu shot recruiting goals now for the record the Walgreens corporate media
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:06.480]  spokesperson that I spoke to yesterday denies any knowledge of this doesn't
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:10.280]  it didn't deny that it's happening he just says that he wasn't aware of this so
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:14.920]  we posted a story and now info wars has got the story where if you have been
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:20.280]  bullied by Walgreens get on to that story click the links and file a complaint
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:25.920]  with Walgreens or with CVS pharmacies they are pushing these vaccines so
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.520]  aggressively that people are getting angry and now you can take a stand against
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:35.800]  that by lodging a complaint with one or both of these pharmacies or you could
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:40.000]  just I guess shut up and take your flu shot which is what the vaccine industry
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.160]  wants you to do that's not okay with us around here where where are we all right
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:48.360]  we have been talking with Mark Castell from the cornucopia Institute about GMOs
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:53.120]  in natural food products that was really good segment if you missed that go back
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.320]  and check the archives make sure you understand that the term natural doesn't
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:02.080]  mean really anything in the food marketplace today in this segment we're
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:07.440]  going to be joined by Mike Bundrant who is a psychologist very experienced in
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:15.160]  the realms of neuroscience linguistics and in fact this gets to just an
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:21.040]  amazing story here it is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience this
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:27.240]  scientific study is entitled how unrealistic optimism is maintained in
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:32.160]  the face of reality this is fascinating stuff you want to tune in on this
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:38.560]  because it explains why about 4 out of 5 people in the general population they
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:44.160]  have something different about their brains that doesn't allow them to code
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:50.520]  in to grasp the reality of something negative this is why about 80% of the
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:55.560]  people you might see out there don't get it when it comes to the false flag
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:00.800]  attacks or vaccines or fluoride in the water supply or how big government is
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:03.920]  really trying to destroy your freedoms and take away your rights rather than
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:07.600]  save you and protect you and do all these things if you've ever asked the
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:12.360]  question why don't people understand when I'm telling them about the reality
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:18.280]  that's out there this scientific study could help explain that so joining us to
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:23.160]  analyze this and give us further details is Mike Bundrant he's also the
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:28.480]  publisher of Healthy Times newspaper that you'll find throughout California and
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:33.560]  other regions Mike are you with us I'm with you how you doing Mike I am doing
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.800]  great thank you for joining us today and I really appreciate your input on this
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.120]  what do you think about this study well it's a very interesting study I have to
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:50.200]  say that it doesn't come as a total shock for anyone who you know thinks a
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:55.320]  little bit about human nature and what's going on around us that you know
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:01.280]  people tend to hear what they want to hear see what they want to see and sort
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:05.120]  of generate self-fulfilling prophecies about you know what works for them in
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:10.680]  terms of what they want so it's not a total shock however it's very very
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:17.480]  interesting that they have actually taken scans of people's brains and the way
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:23.120]  they work in in in the face of news that is worse than expected in the act the
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:27.960]  frontal lobe actually shuts down of course not entirely but it doesn't
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:32.600]  process information that is news that's worse than expected it's
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:37.400]  fascinating but it sort of confirms probably what a lot of people know well
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:40.760]  the let me read from the abstract of this study again which was published in
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:44.880]  the journal Nature Neuroscience and in the abstract says quote highly
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:50.440]  optimistic individuals exhibited quote reduced tracking of estimation errors
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:57.280]  that called for negative update in right inferior prefrontal gyrus these
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:02.360]  findings indicate that optimism is tied to a selective update failure now this
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.520]  is pretty technical language what what does that mean in layman's terms break
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:11.400]  it down make it even simpler for us Mike I'll make it even simpler basically I
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:18.240]  guess you could say that opt overly optimistic people are brain damaged Mike
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:24.760]  I guess that's I think that's I guess that's a little too simplistic but here's
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:30.520]  the way that I understand this that we are talking about these people in the
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:34.840]  study were presented with negative information information that's worse
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:40.320]  than expected and so if I if I if you ask me what Mike what's the chance that
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:45.520]  you'll get cancer in your lifetime and I say well I'd say it's 10% and you say
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:51.800]  actually the statistics the data suggests that you have a 30% chance of
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:57.280]  getting cancer if I'm one of these overly optimistic people I will literally
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:02.760]  my frontal lobe will not process that information and I will not adjust my
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:09.160]  expectations accordingly effectively keeping me in denial and we see this
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:14.520]  across the population on on many issues that I hinted at earlier that people you
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:19.480]  know when you tell people about well 9-11 was an inside job let's say right
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:23.680]  and they might reply it now it couldn't be be more optimistic why aren't you more
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:28.160]  optimistic you hear that a lot in the deniers out there you do you think this
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:32.080]  helps explain cognitively what's happening in their brains I think it
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:36.840]  actually explains what's happening in their brains but and let's talk a little
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:45.160]  bit about the role of denial denial is a is like fire it's a precious gift and
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:51.320]  it's a dangerous enemy depending on how you use it if we didn't have the
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:58.400]  capability of denying certain realities or certain possibilities then we would
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:07.840]  literally be overwhelmed with worry and fear from everything from did I leave
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:13.320]  the iron on when I left the house this morning to when am I going to die if I
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:19.760]  couldn't filter out all there is to worry about in life and just effectively
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:25.840]  deny that and focus on what I want to focus on none of us could function right
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:30.800]  so there's a there's a positive role for this to in the sense that this helps us
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:36.040]  adapt to reality or what about the idea of holding out you know real hope for
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:40.000]  freedom for example how do we maintain optimism in the face of so much
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.560]  tyranny that this this phenomenon actually could help us in that context it
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.200]  could help us into that context but we've got to get past the denial in
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:55.280]  other words in order for real optimism or your or pessimism for that matter to
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:02.320]  take place we have to be dealing with the truth so for example if I let's say
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:06.080]  that it's the 10th of the month and I only have $100 in my checking account
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:10.960]  to make it to the end of the month which is not a lot of money and if I could be
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:14.760]  optimistic or pessimistic about that I could be optimistic and say you know
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:19.120]  what it's a challenge but I'm going to find a way to make this work I'm going
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.240]  to cut back I can do X Y and Z and I'm going to get to the end of the month and
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:27.280]  I know I can make it happen and I'm and so forth I come up with a plan or I
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.840]  could be pessimistic and say oh geez I'm you know this isn't this is going to
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:36.040]  happen and I'm going to you know lose my house that I don't know what I'm going
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:40.720]  to do I have a choice to be optimistic or pessimistic what we're talking about
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:47.560]  here though with the study is that I'm not even acknowledging how much money is
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:52.040]  in my checking account in the first place so I'm just in a different reality
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:58.080]  denying reality what's denying reality in this situation and that's what's
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:05.480]  dangerous and so we have to get we have to break through that barrier barrier of
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:11.800]  denial and and allow people help people understand the reality of what's going
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:17.040]  on then let's be optimistic but let's be optimistic based on the truth there's
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:22.200]  really no problem or very few problems that we can't solve right but if we
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:27.240]  don't even look at the problem for what they are there's we don't have a prayer
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:32.520]  and solving them and I think that's what's going on as a culture we're so
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:38.080]  in denial about just about everything well the what's extraordinary about this
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:43.360]  is this term now is going to become I think a part of mainstream vernacular
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:49.240]  that term is unrealistic optimism so folks if you're listening I want you
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:52.480]  to repeat that term a couple of times because you're going to hear it more and
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:57.920]  more unrealistic optimism is maintained in the face of reality this story says
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:02.320]  that I had not really heard this term before unrealistic optimism and now
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:05.720]  we're seeing it as the title of a a neuroscience article I think that's
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:09.960]  quite fascinating but in terms of practical aspects here Mike it seems
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:15.240]  like the excuse me the key issue is how do we balance this in our own lives so
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:20.240]  that we can maintain optimism where it's required to keep moving forward and
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:25.520]  yet not be hoodwinked into a state of denial about what's really happening in
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:30.360]  the world around us do you have any tips on on that balance I do the principle
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:35.640]  is to learn to manage your own emotions and your own anxiety to look at the
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.640]  truth whether it's the truth about what's going on in the country or just the
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:43.960]  truth about how much money is in your checking account to look at that truth
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:49.600]  is create anxiety I mean there's there's a lot to be worried about in terms of
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:57.400]  what's going on so the first thing to do is to learn to manage our emotions on a
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:02.120]  to become more efficient in them so the things that scare us the things that
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:07.800]  we're uncomfortable with to learn to look at those things in a way and get some
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:15.560]  skills to manage our state because if we can't do that denial is the tool that
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.960]  the default tool that will that will resort to the better we can manage
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:24.840]  ourselves the less need we have for denial wait a minute Michael why should
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:28.360]  we manage our own emotions I thought the government was going to tell us when to
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.920]  be afraid when to feel patriotic when when to feel big when to feel small I
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.120]  mean the government tells us how to feel about everything like like this pretext
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:40.800]  for war why obviously I'm being facetious but you know it seems like the
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:45.840]  skill of managing our own emotions is not something that's really widespread
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:53.520]  throughout the populations of the world in fact it's not taught in schools just
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:57.840]  like how to be in a relationship effectively how do you have a healthy
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:04.920]  happy partnership or marriage how do you control your anxiety how do you make
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:10.200]  goals and plan for them and be efficient none of this is taught it's almost as
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:15.680]  if like the government does want us just to take their answers for it and
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.480]  follow them blindly in other words perhaps the greatest propaganda for
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:25.320]  unrealistic optimism and the denial that goes with it are the messages we get in
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:32.600]  the in the mainstream media and so learning to manage yourself to me is the
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:37.960]  first step toward taking an independent stand and taking control of your life
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:41.480]  Mike this is a really good analysis you're offering us and I have more
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:45.480]  questions for you but first do you have a website where people can learn more or
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:53.800]  see more of what you've written sure my website is inlpcenter.com
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:46:00.400]  okay inlpcenter.com Mike Bundrant is our guest here to give us some analysis of
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:06.520]  this study of quote unrealistic optimism that was published in Nature
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.400]  Neuroscience now my question for you Mike is how do you think these other
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:16.200]  factors might play into this phenomenon that we are discussing here for
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:21.560]  example consuming fluoride which we know numbs the mind taking psychiatric
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:27.040]  medications which we also know can can cause just craziness in the brain all
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:31.840]  kind you know suicidal thoughts even taking action on things like that what
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.040]  about the the toxic food additives that are out there all these other toxic
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:40.120]  chemicals coming in how might they interact with this phenomenon to
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:46.400]  potentially dull the minds of people and make them sort of zombie optimists is
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:50.760]  that I mean is that even the right term that's actually a very good term it's
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:55.840]  actually very good every chemical that we put into our body is either gonna
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:01.280]  help us or her to play a role in supporting our organs or not and the
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:06.560]  brain of course is an organ and the mind you know comes from the brain so if
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:14.520]  you're gonna do some work on yourself to the degree that you have brain numbing
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:20.960]  chemicals in your body it's just going to make that work more difficult it'll
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:27.560]  feel sort of like digging through sludge yeah a little bit is it impossible of
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:33.600]  course not if you're taking some sort of medication or eat a lot of chemicals
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:38.240]  does that mean you're a total zombie no of course not you're not as sharp as
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:46.000]  you might be but the key for everybody no matter where you are is to get
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:51.440]  started learn some ways to manage your mind learn some ways to reduce your
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:56.760]  anxiety learn how to think more clearly everybody no matter where you're at
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:02.720]  right now can in the next week or two learn to think a several degrees more
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.880]  clearly to learn to manage their emotions with two or three percent more
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:13.880]  efficiency and to feel just a little bit better simply by practicing let's say
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:18.680]  meditation simply by you know practicing some cognitive behavioral
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:23.320]  techniques everybody can sit and can take a step forward it doesn't matter
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:28.240]  where you are and the ideal of course is to become self-sufficient where you
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:33.320]  don't need medication in order to feel okay right you're aware you're able to
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:37.680]  be aware of what's going on with the food supply and the water supply so that
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:42.840]  you can take measures to avoid it and there are ways to do that just
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.440]  extraordinary information and I hope those of you listening here are really
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:50.640]  getting this this is explaining the brain defect of those who can't see
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:55.160]  reality and who maintain what we're now calling zombie optimism but I want to be
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:59.960]  clear about this we are not opposed to optimism itself in fact I consider
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:03.440]  myself an optimist I don't know about you Mike you're probably an optimist too I
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:09.080]  mean I maintain optimism on issues like we are going to expose corruption we are
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:13.880]  going to protect the planet in the way that really matters like I'm optimistic
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:17.840]  about I'm going to learn permaculture and practice permaculture and grow more
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.560]  of my own food no matter what I don't care what barriers are put in the way
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.320]  I'm going to be optimistic about making progress it seems like combining
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:30.840]  optimism with action is a real strategy for success yes optimism combined with
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:37.400]  action based on reality is an incredible combination for success
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:43.880]  absolutely I mean if you think about it the the odds don't have to be in your
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:49.520]  favor in order for you to succeed so if I'm going to start a business we all
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:55.000]  know that most businesses fail okay but if I know that if I go out nine out of
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.840]  ten businesses fail within the first year of being in business okay that's a
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:04.080]  truth I'm not going to avoid that truth I want to start a business anyways and
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:09.440]  given the reality of how difficult it is I'm going to make a list of everything
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:13.720]  that I need to do to give myself the best chance of success I'm going to do
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:17.920]  the research I'm well funded etc we're just about to wrap this up 20 seconds
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:21.720]  left anything else you want to add as we wrap up this segment with you yeah
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:28.040]  absolutely even though that there is neuroscience and studies on the brain
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:34.400]  that shows that the brain does certain things in order to create certain
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:39.280]  outcomes we can take cognitive control we can influence whether or not that
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:43.640]  frontal lobe shuts down in the face of bad news our good information from Mike
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:46.480]  Bundren thanks for joining us on this segment stay with us here we'll be back
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:59.080]  with more and breaking news here on the Alex Jones show thank you hi I'm Mark
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:03.520]  Craighead founder of crossbreed holsters I designed our top-selling holster the

[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:41.960]  Alex feels the same way the story we promised earlier from Paul Joseph
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:48.180]  Watson is now been posted on info wars.com title is sources us gives
[02:55:48.180 --> 02:55:55.080]  Israel green light for Iran strike oh my here we go beating the war drum once
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:56:00.760]  again Paul Joseph Watson says the Obama administration's fabricated terror plot
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:06.280]  blamed on Iran represents the green light for an Israeli attack on Iran set
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:11.080]  to take place within the next two weeks says according to confidential military
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:16.080]  sources who spoke with Alex Jones the story goes on you can find the story
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:20.840]  posted at info wars.com it goes into some of the details of what is happening
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:26.320]  behind the scenes I bet you I bet you the CIA and the FBI are tuning in and
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:29.680]  listening to this show right now today and they are probably learning some new
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:34.000]  things because there you know there are factions within every group in government
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:39.640]  and some factions have put this into play and other factions probably tried to
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:43.440]  resist it or are trying to stop it and they're shocked just as you are shocked
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:49.880]  just as we are shocked by this how so many of the key globalist players in our
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:54.800]  world are pushing us towards violence and pushing us towards war for example
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:57:00.760]  here we go here's a story out of the Guardian headline Saudis say Iran must
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:08.200]  quote pay the price for alleged plot as US resists retaliation again this is
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:13.800]  published in the Guardian by who is it Ewan McCaskill in the Guardian Tehran
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:19.160]  denies it was behind plot to kill Saudi ambassador and says the US is using it to
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:23.200]  divert attention from problems at home that sounds like a pretty good
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:29.320]  assessment actually Iran may be exactly right on this particular analysis again
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.120]  I'm not I don't agree with the Iranian government and all their policies and so
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:39.000]  on but they could very well be a right be right with this particular analysis so
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:42.360]  we're going to learn more about that tonight as we go into the Info Wars
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:47.360]  Nightly News at 7 p.m. some other stories that we did not have time to get to
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.000]  today but I want to mention to you very briefly some stuff that will blow your
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:57.080]  mind the FDA has approved another new anti-depressant drug for dogs yeah so if
