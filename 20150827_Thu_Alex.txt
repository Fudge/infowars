[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.760 --> 00:42.640]  David Knight and Joe Biggs are in Virginia where there is a giant anti-gun
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.880]  anti-self-defense feeding frenzy going on on the heels of the tragic live
[00:48.880 --> 00:56.480]  television shooting yesterday we now have two dead TV station members and of
[00:56.480 --> 01:03.600]  course the shooter who is an Obama bot got in trouble for wearing Obama pins
[01:03.600 --> 01:09.040]  during election coverage basically got in fights with everybody his own
[01:09.040 --> 01:13.840]  manifesto says black people didn't like him white people didn't like him women
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.240]  didn't like him a spoiled brat clearly mentally ill and now we're getting
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.880]  reports that he was under some type of mental treatment so we're burrowing in
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.640]  right now was he on medication obviously being under psychiatric care being
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.520]  under counseling it goes to say normally you are on some type of
[01:36.520 --> 01:39.960]  medication that's what most psychologists and psychiatrists have become
[01:39.960 --> 01:45.440]  is basically pill dispensers well psychiatrists always have been but more
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.560]  and more counselors and there are some good counselors out there I'm not
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.480]  demonizing their entire profession but more and more it's a political tool of
[01:52.480 --> 01:55.680]  oppression clearly and it's been that way in many other countries around the
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.880]  world I kept saying yesterday at nauseam and I'm not bragging I'm just
[01:59.880 --> 02:03.640]  saying we know what we're talking about don't need to go back and play the
[02:03.640 --> 02:11.440]  clips I probably said it 50 times that this was tied to Charleston in South
[02:11.440 --> 02:18.880]  Carolina and sure enough he said that he did it because of the Charleston
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.880]  shooter that that's what pushed him over the edge because nine black people
[02:22.880 --> 02:29.720]  were killed and so this is fundamentally the big fat seeds of race war in this
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.560]  country because now if some other unstable white person strikes back and
[02:33.560 --> 02:39.120]  then some other unstable black person strikes back this could really start to
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.920]  unravel and that's why the system wants the collapse that's coming to this
[02:43.920 --> 02:50.360]  country to be racial in nature as a distraction to scapegoat different
[02:50.360 --> 02:53.640]  groups against each other that's why Europe is allowing and putting people on
[02:53.640 --> 03:00.880]  welfare the massive unfettered flood of illegals from the Middle East Africa
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.320]  Asia you name it into Europe and then giving a massive welfare to incentivize
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.400]  it no matter how destructive it is no matter how many cities get lit on fire
[03:11.400 --> 03:16.720]  because under the economic collapse whoever is middle class and left will
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.680]  end up siding with the government in the end who will come in as the saviors to
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.000]  protect the public and I've got not one but two articles today Paul Joseph
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.280]  Watson wrote an article for info wars calm he's joining us in 30 minutes Steve
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.000]  quels coming on again our reporters will join us from Virginia at the start of the
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.840]  next hour France prepares for mass unrest radicalized immigrants taking over
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.680]  cities and this is a Ministry of Defense report from France there's the
[03:48.680 --> 03:51.920]  military's job to assess threats their compartmentalize they're not part of the
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.640]  takeover they're just going to respond when things break down and they say
[03:55.640 --> 03:59.840]  RPGs and anti-aircraft missiles have been smuggled in from Libya and Syria oh
[03:59.840 --> 04:07.160]  sorry I probably said a thousand times in the last four years since Libya that
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.320]  you will then hear they're going to shoot down jetliners with the missiles but
[04:11.320 --> 04:15.720]  never a discussion of why they got them they're now getting everybody ready for
[04:15.720 --> 04:20.040]  the jihadis like the guy that tried to attack on the train last Friday to have
[04:20.040 --> 04:26.400]  stinger missiles RPGs and AK-47s that the police are starting to find all over
[04:26.400 --> 04:34.080]  the country so you see how that works not hard to predict this stuff other
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.280]  people don't seem to be able to which just shows how dumb most pundits and
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.440]  analysts are and then this dovetails with it Fort Bragg troops trained for
[04:42.440 --> 04:48.400]  domestic emergency this exercise is about the home front and that is from ABC
[04:48.400 --> 04:54.240]  news 11 so there you go they're now going mainstream with it which means
[04:54.240 --> 04:59.160]  they're getting close they're thinking about pulling the trigger we now know
[04:59.160 --> 05:02.640]  why stem express was so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood
[05:02.640 --> 05:06.880]  video featuring its CEO the law prohibits organ and tissue donors from
[05:06.880 --> 05:10.760]  selling for profit yet solicitation materials from stem express repeatedly
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.320]  tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to
[05:14.320 --> 05:18.240]  the fiscal growth for abortion clinics and when asked what they can do to help
[05:18.240 --> 05:22.040]  clinics that aren't profiting the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know
[05:22.040 --> 05:25.800]  any who aren't profiting you want to say this is about women's health she talks
[05:25.800 --> 05:30.200]  about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions
[05:30.200 --> 05:34.760]  being a repeated problem and the stem express CEO talks about the stigma of
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.000]  delivering butchered baby parts to labs how they freak out how they have meltdowns
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.720]  when they get a whole head how they'll request hands and feet to be removed from
[05:42.720 --> 05:46.400]  limbs so they don't have to confront what it is but then she comments but we
[05:46.400 --> 05:51.040]  know what it is for that reason she says many are turning to adult stem cells
[05:51.040 --> 05:57.280]  or bone marrow and she concludes this is David Knight reporting for info wars

[08:51.080 --> 08:57.080]  we have our reporters from the site of the tragic shooting yesterday in a rural
[08:57.080 --> 09:03.560]  area two hours away from major airports in Virginia where this tragic event with
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.920]  the shooting live on television took place and Paul Joseph Watson joins us
[09:08.920 --> 09:15.280]  from London to break down a report he's written for info wars calm France
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.800]  prepares for mass unrest radicalized immigrants taking over cities that's a
[09:20.800 --> 09:28.160]  army ministry of defense report released to the media also there's video of this
[09:28.160 --> 09:36.080]  out of North Carolina we're going to be playing that ABC 11 in a max lavo article
[09:36.080 --> 09:43.000]  and info wars calm fort bragg troops train for domestic emergency this
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.400]  exercise is about the home front ostensibly and on the surface they're
[09:48.400 --> 09:52.400]  trained to help out with things like natural disasters floods and hurricanes
[09:52.400 --> 10:00.400]  but this is regular army they're gearing up for the collapse ladies and gentlemen
[10:00.400 --> 10:05.360]  I want to be clear whenever we warn of the lurch into the police state the
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.320]  lurch into globalism federalism the lurch into centralization we're not
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.320]  saying it's imminent where it's going to happen overnight or troops trying to
[10:14.320 --> 10:18.320]  stabilize a burning city we're not trying to say they're the enemy the
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.680]  globalist have created the climate where you're going to beg and I'm going to
[10:23.680 --> 10:29.760]  beg for the big red one to come down the street in armored vehicles and we're
[10:29.760 --> 10:33.720]  trying to stop the globalist from maneuvering us into this position
[10:33.720 --> 10:38.120]  they're running around in newspapers I mean every couple days around the
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.200]  country because they know national media has no respect with locals but local
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.640]  media still has some though it's lost a lot of credibility in the big national
[10:47.640 --> 10:51.760]  study here's a new one out today and they're running stories like this one we
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.960]  actually got the newspaper itself the inlander the major newspaper for Spokane
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.760]  and four counties daring to tread why Spokane's Republican sheriff says we
[11:02.760 --> 11:06.840]  should be scared of homegrown extremists and the fanatical fringe of the tea
[11:06.840 --> 11:13.000]  party and he's a microcosm of what they're gearing up for and this all broke
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.920]  last year again when he had enough these armored vehicles being delivered and
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.400]  they were at Walmart saying therefore the tea party therefore the
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.680]  constitutionalist so we ran the video and said this is wrong drudge and others
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.240]  picked it up world and daily picked it up the story went viral and he first came
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.120]  out and said we're liars it's not for us then we said no you're a liar so he said
[11:33.120 --> 11:37.240]  Alex Jones and info wars is threatened to kill me when it was comments on the
[11:37.240 --> 11:44.120]  site which anybody could do I mean I could go on the inlander and put comments
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.720]  and then say they said it I mean it's just very bizarre and and he keeps
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.120]  warning of something's about to happen I really see this is a prime false flag
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.680]  zone that's what my spider sense common sense tells me now by exposing and it
[11:57.680 --> 12:03.680]  may not happen but I think the sheriffs are really really bad person from
[12:03.680 --> 12:07.800]  everything he's done he speaks with the fork and tongue and I think he's playing
[12:07.800 --> 12:11.840]  people and I may just go to a county nearby and not even go into his
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.760]  jurisdiction and call for peace when I go out there and see if he'll come to the
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.160]  county line because I don't even know if it's safe to even get within his
[12:19.160 --> 12:22.440]  jurisdiction with with the history of his deputies the things he's been
[12:22.440 --> 12:27.280]  involved in bizarre deaths this is a pretty bad guy the southern property
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.400]  law center might have something on him I'm not sure I'm speculating there but
[12:31.400 --> 12:36.680]  this is a microcosm a canary in the coal mine with things like this going on
[12:36.680 --> 12:42.760]  and they're looking for provocations in different zones around the country to be
[12:42.760 --> 12:48.160]  triggered events to paint the liberty movement as terroristic when they start
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.560]  the Soros race war that we're battling to stop and look we know our stuff you
[12:54.560 --> 12:59.720]  could call it criminology modus operandi studying human behaviorism I've been on
[12:59.720 --> 13:06.440]  air 20 plus years almost 21 I've been immersed in this sometimes 18 hours a
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.560]  day I'll be honest the last couple years I can't do more than 10 hours a day I
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.720]  just it's too much I'm not as immersed as I used to be it's just because every
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.640]  data point opens up a whole other data set for me and it just I actually know
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.440]  too much now and I just can't handle it back when I was trying to figure stuff
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.520]  out it was kind of fun to learn stuff now it's just horrific I mean I'll be
[13:26.520 --> 13:30.960]  honest but I got up here and I said this guy I'll end up being mentally ill he'll
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.400]  end up being on psychotropic that's starting to come out but I said he did
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.160]  this probably because of Charleston and the nine innocent black people that were
[13:41.160 --> 13:47.920]  killed by the white guy hopped up on drugs again prescription drugs I mean
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.720]  it's not hard to make these connections people are going yeah common sense well
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.840]  none of the other media did it and now as manifestos out and it turns out that
[13:56.840 --> 14:00.880]  is basically a black lives matter Obama drone and so David Knight made the
[14:00.880 --> 14:05.040]  point to be on the phone this morning that this is Obama's first drone strike
[14:05.040 --> 14:10.480]  domestically because this is one of his drones out attacking and when you get
[14:10.480 --> 14:17.560]  all this race war promotion on MSNBC and CNN and the legit the groups
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.120]  legitimizing saying let's go out let's attack the white people they're the
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.200]  cause of all the problems you're going to have blowback to the knockout game and
[14:27.200 --> 14:30.560]  the looting and the robbing and the rest of it when unstable white people
[14:30.560 --> 14:33.800]  start going on killing black people and then black people are going to respond
[14:33.800 --> 14:40.040]  to that it's a chain reaction but sure enough that's now come out after
[14:40.040 --> 14:45.480]  shooting alleged gunman details grievances and suicide note or what you
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.480]  call as manifesto revenge race murderer bitter black reporter who gunned down
[14:51.480 --> 15:00.760]  white ex colleagues lived on air and posted the video online blames
[15:00.760 --> 15:06.240]  Charleston shootings and anti-gay harassment in manifesto of why he did
[15:06.240 --> 15:15.000]  it continuing he wasn't the human tape recorder how TV murderer was criticized
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.320]  by boss for appalling journalistic standards and reprimanded for wearing
[15:19.320 --> 15:26.400]  an Obama badge to report on elections continuing after shooting alleged
[15:26.400 --> 15:29.720]  gunman detailed grievances again I mentioned that I want to go over some
[15:29.720 --> 15:35.840]  of that US shooting video shocks internet in new frontier it's not new
[15:35.840 --> 15:42.680]  frontier what do you think military videos are and of course he's dead now
[15:42.680 --> 15:49.880]  but that hasn't stopped Hilary Clinton and others from coming out and saying they
[15:49.880 --> 15:53.480]  blame the second amendment quote we have to do something about gun violence in
[15:53.480 --> 16:00.440]  America well we have Hillary that's why overall gun crime is down 51 to 52
[16:00.440 --> 16:06.120]  percent since 1992 and professor lot says I'm wrong looking at the numbers
[16:06.120 --> 16:12.520]  Fox News he says is wrong he says it's 61 well we had a statistician go over
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.880]  the just department numbers first it was 51 then Fox News did their own
[16:17.880 --> 16:26.680]  analysis said 51 lot says 61 whatever they admit even in the LA Times that gun
[16:26.680 --> 16:31.480]  crime is way down but perception is its way up this is the fraud just like the
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.720]  perception is if you go swimming in the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean great white
[16:35.720 --> 16:39.800]  sharks are gonna eat you you've got a better chance of being mugged by a
[16:39.800 --> 16:45.200]  leprechaun then you do be an attack by a great white shark but again I always
[16:45.200 --> 16:49.720]  use an analogy because it's just so ridiculous yeah there's the LA Times
[16:49.720 --> 16:55.000]  gun crime plunged but Americans think it's up study sets and that's from two
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.360]  years ago that's when they released that the 20 years of numbers and I'm just
[17:00.360 --> 17:03.680]  putting that up on screen because I get these emails and see comments oh he
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.680]  just makes all that up listen I make mistakes here and there and when we find
[17:08.680 --> 17:14.200]  out we make mistakes we correct them but we're very accurate we know what we're
[17:14.200 --> 17:18.560]  talking about and we immerse ourselves in the information and the fact is
[17:18.560 --> 17:22.080]  there is not an epidemic of gun violence most of people being killed are
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.560]  criminals breaking in people's houses or trying to carjack or people shooting at
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.400]  the police or other gangs shooting each other go look at the numbers most crime
[17:31.400 --> 17:36.880]  is criminals killing each other or citizens fighting back in justified
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.040]  shootings or police shooting people in justified shootings and statistically
[17:41.040 --> 17:43.520]  there are some bad cops out there and they're trying to make them really bad
[17:43.520 --> 17:47.920]  with their training but still you you count the number of people cops kill
[17:47.920 --> 17:53.600]  every year it's a very small part of the overall issue and I'm only saying that
[17:53.600 --> 17:58.400]  because it's not the biggest problem there is George Soros says it is it's
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.520]  not it's part of causing a civil war in this country where they've got these
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.080]  federally controlled police running around saying I'm a terrorist that wants
[18:07.080 --> 18:11.080]  dead cops when all this stuff starts folks they're gonna blame the Liberty
[18:11.080 --> 18:16.400]  Movement we've got to stop it now let's go to this clip of Donald Trump getting
[18:16.400 --> 18:21.000]  it right that's why so popular now even the establishment people are saying he
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.560]  has a chance to win he said that it mental health should be the focus and
[18:24.560 --> 18:28.400]  he's a strong second amendment supporter here it is this isn't a gun problem this
[18:28.400 --> 18:34.400]  a mental problem and you know you have cases where like had the had the veterans
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.760]  had the guys that were shot recently had they if they had weapons they might
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.960]  have been able to save themselves they would have been able they were all
[18:41.960 --> 18:46.760]  heroes they were all tremendous military men and they had absolutely no
[18:46.760 --> 18:52.240]  defense and frankly you know a case like this he snuck up on him whether it was a
[18:52.240 --> 18:55.960]  gun or a knife or whatever it would have been it would have been something but
[18:55.960 --> 19:00.280]  you know you're not going to get rid of all guns so I know one thing if you tried
[19:00.280 --> 19:05.080]  to do it the bad guys would have them to use an expression and the good folks
[19:05.080 --> 19:09.000]  would abide by the law that be hopeless and just it would be a hopeless
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.280]  situation for them and I think it's a big mistake and you know I'm a very much
[19:14.280 --> 19:19.200]  second amendment person Chris and I know the arguments both ways very well but
[19:19.200 --> 19:23.680]  I'm very much into the second amendment you you need protection now you also have
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.240]  entertainment and you have you know all sorts of activities and all of that but
[19:28.240 --> 19:32.720]  taking that out of the picture you know most most I mean guns are used for
[19:32.720 --> 19:37.240]  recreational purposes like people play golf and like people play other things
[19:37.240 --> 19:43.800]  and hunting but but beyond that in terms of safety you know if you're sitting in
[19:43.800 --> 19:48.040]  a cabin someplace and you're not armed and somebody walks in with a gun I'll
[19:48.040 --> 19:51.120]  tell you what I'd rather be in that cabin with a gun than not with a gun
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.560]  that I tell you right now so I tell you I mean I'm liking Donald Trump more and
[19:55.560 --> 19:59.400]  more doesn't mean I trust him but I tell you I'm liking him a lot more you're
[19:59.400 --> 20:03.200]  old enough to tell that something is definitely wrong you've been paying
[20:03.200 --> 20:07.320]  attention for years and you're ready you're probably frustrated because your

[25:20.560 --> 25:24.400]  break down here I want to get more into the shooting more the response but what
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.520]  this is diverting from is their prop in the stock market up artificially right
[25:28.520 --> 25:33.600]  now but the fundamentals are imploding worldwide so that won't be sustainable
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.680]  just like they've been prop in China up for a year but it's finally unraveling
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.080]  and still imploding China has started selling us treasuries to support the
[25:43.080 --> 25:49.720]  you on an article asked the question what of the crash is rigged like
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.560]  everything else no kidding we're also going to get into the tropical storm
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.440]  Erica targets Caribbean Florida Bahamas on alert Hillary Clinton obviously in
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.040]  deep trouble quote text responsibility says it wasn't the best choice Biden eyes
[26:04.040 --> 26:13.880]  officially running number one in the polls that is all coming up but first I
[26:13.880 --> 26:18.440]  was about to do this during the break here on the TV radio show I thought
[26:18.440 --> 26:22.480]  why not just do it on air because I hadn't taken my survival shield nason
[26:22.480 --> 26:27.600]  iodine yet and I like to put it in a glass of water I take about half a
[26:27.600 --> 26:33.400]  dropper once a day that's a little more than the dose that's recommended
[26:33.400 --> 26:37.240]  consult your physicians out there and see how it works for you much smaller
[26:37.240 --> 26:41.000]  does just three years ago when I started this I think a larger does because I
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.600]  forget some days I probably do it three four days a week I'm thinking I'm
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.480]  getting better about taking it every day such probably reduce my does hindsight
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.280]  2020 that's just greedily put too much in there and then I take some super
[26:52.280 --> 26:57.120]  mortality that's even stronger under the tongue but I just put it in water because
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.040]  it really has like a cola yee taste when you mix it with the iodine I take three
[27:02.040 --> 27:09.520]  dropperfuls you know why not just take whatever mean batter in fact somebody
[27:09.520 --> 27:15.280]  ran off of my secret 12 that was in here my secret 12 was in here oh it's
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.560]  underneath I can't reach it will somebody give me my mythical bollum in
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.720]  place sorry see I didn't really prepare this I was loading up this glass here in
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.040]  the break and I thought you know what this is what I do at least once a day
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.480]  and when I religiously do it things get a lot better around here you go I really
[27:33.480 --> 27:37.880]  appreciate your help I can't really someone ran off with it it's probably me
[27:37.880 --> 27:41.320]  I probably wandered off with it I probably wandered off with it I don't
[27:41.320 --> 27:44.200]  need it's okay I'll take it later and that really is better under the tongue
[27:44.200 --> 27:49.800]  not in water but this is this is how I take it right into the old stomach right
[27:49.800 --> 27:59.240]  down the old gullet with me dirty geese and so there it is mmm taste delicious
[27:59.240 --> 28:02.040]  you know when I first heard of drinking this stuff it didn't taste good but now
[28:02.040 --> 28:06.520]  my body loves it like the first time you drink whiskey you don't like it but down
[28:06.520 --> 28:09.920]  the road you know it tastes like mama's milk but you know you don't remember what
[28:09.920 --> 28:13.320]  mama's milk tastes like you imagine it probably tastes like the Jameson's you're
[28:13.320 --> 28:19.200]  drinking but so drinking Jameson's I drink this so again it's available at
[28:19.200 --> 28:25.480]  infowarslife.com thank you sir and your purchases do make the transmission
[28:25.480 --> 28:30.120]  possible and we had been sold out of secret 12 medical grade methylcobalamin
[28:30.120 --> 28:35.360]  but it has come back in and I tell you talk about energy talk about stamina
[28:35.360 --> 28:40.480]  this is the real energy drink one or two squirts of that a day and you will feel
[28:40.480 --> 28:45.480]  I mean I certainly do you can read the right reviews dramatic dramatic effects
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.520]  with the secret 12 so I mix those three things together x2 super male and the
[28:50.520 --> 28:57.040]  methylcobalamin during the winter I put winter sun in but actually vitamin D and
[28:57.040 --> 29:01.720]  other systems here it is I should have gotten ready for this for actually
[29:01.720 --> 29:05.080]  that it's down there as well are the building blocks of everything and so
[29:05.080 --> 29:08.480]  much of the cheap stuff you found at the store is synthetic well your body can't
[29:08.480 --> 29:15.280]  even absorb that many cases is toxic you need the real unheated unpasteurized
[29:15.280 --> 29:23.360]  raw stuff and it will change your life I have a big giant pumpkin head so it

[29:31.880 --> 29:35.520]  myself five years ago versus now it's night and day from job of the hut to
[29:35.520 --> 29:39.720]  just a little bit overweight but now folks with the shirt off the six packs

[29:48.440 --> 29:59.160]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we now know
[29:59.160 --> 30:02.640]  why stem express was so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood
[30:02.640 --> 30:06.880]  video featuring its CEO the law prohibits organ and tissue donors from
[30:06.880 --> 30:10.760]  selling for profit yet solicitation materials from stem express repeatedly
[30:10.760 --> 30:14.360]  tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to
[30:14.360 --> 30:18.240]  the fiscal growth for abortion clinics and when asked what they can do to help
[30:18.240 --> 30:22.080]  clinics that aren't profiting the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know
[30:22.080 --> 30:25.640]  any who aren't profiting you want to say this is about women's health she
[30:25.640 --> 30:29.680]  talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.200]  conditions being a repeated problem and the stem express CEO talks about the
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.400]  stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs how they freak out how they
[30:38.400 --> 30:42.120]  have meltdowns when they get a whole head how they'll request hands and feet to
[30:42.120 --> 30:45.480]  be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront what it is but then she
[30:45.480 --> 30:50.000]  comments but we know what it is for that reason she says many are turning to
[30:50.000 --> 30:56.160]  adult stem cells or bone marrow and she concludes this is David Knight

[34:00.660 --> 34:06.820]  Remember him talking about weaponized drones 15 years ago and now they were going to be coming to our doorsteps with the police
[34:06.820 --> 34:11.700]  And now that was in the news yesterday, and it just sounded so crazy even back then
[34:11.700 --> 34:18.200]  But he has been quite the trailblazer. He's gonna be joining us our reporters David Knight and Joe Biggs
[34:18.420 --> 34:20.420]  We'll be joining us
[34:20.620 --> 34:25.020]  From the little town out in Virginia where the media is
[34:25.620 --> 34:33.060]  Preparing to destroy the second amendment if they can and there's really no mention that he's an Obama bot wearing Obama pens
[34:33.060 --> 34:40.540]  Who thought black people were out to get him white people are out to getting and he was mad about the Charleston shooting
[34:41.380 --> 34:43.380]  So he struck back
[34:45.460 --> 34:47.300]  Simply
[34:47.300 --> 34:49.460]  Sickening that this is going on
[34:50.300 --> 34:54.020]  but maybe they sense that the race war pushes and working because
[34:55.420 --> 35:00.740]  Al Sharpton's having his weekday show cancelled and moved to the weekends, which is where they kind of quietly
[35:00.740 --> 35:02.740]  Shuffle people off
[35:03.740 --> 35:05.740]  Pierce Morgan is back
[35:06.420 --> 35:09.780]  Demonizing the second amendment. This is a guy that has armed response security
[35:10.500 --> 35:14.580]  At his LA house mansion. He has armed security
[35:15.340 --> 35:20.900]  That is in the neighborhood. He has a sign in his yard that responds within one minute with guns
[35:21.820 --> 35:25.780]  Why don't you just I mean I've lived in one of those neighborhoods if I had the money and lived out there
[35:25.780 --> 35:28.980]  Sure, why don't have the armed security guards, but I'd have guns, too
[35:28.980 --> 35:33.020]  I mean, I'm not knocking if you got the money for armed security guards. Why not?
[35:34.100 --> 35:39.740]  Especially if you live in you know, LA and there are robberies in those rich neighborhoods. I know folks that live out there
[35:40.300 --> 35:44.540]  But just how do you sit there with a straight face saying the general public can't have guns?
[35:44.540 --> 35:53.140]  It's so fundamentally hypocritical when Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton or Michael Moore or Diane Feinstein or Barbara Boxer or
[35:54.100 --> 35:56.100]  Michael Bloomberg or
[35:56.100 --> 36:03.340]  Nancy Pelosi or any of these people or Harry Reid tries to restrict the general public second amendment
[36:03.340 --> 36:08.700]  And then they sit there with a straight face saying nobody wants your guns like it's a conspiracy theory
[36:11.300 --> 36:18.180]  Now here's an article that we talked about a few weeks ago, but now I was actually mailed the inlander
[36:18.180 --> 36:28.740]  There August 13th to 19th weekly edition this is like the Austin Chronicle there the big popular weekly tabloid
[36:28.980 --> 36:34.900]  And it says daring to tread with him standing on the Gadsden flags meaning his constituents
[36:35.660 --> 36:40.220]  And he says the sheriff is scared of extremists and wants the public to be scared of them as well
[36:40.220 --> 36:42.180]  And says they're a danger to read the exact quote
[36:42.180 --> 36:48.580]  Why spoke into public a sheriff says we should be scared of homegrown extremists and the fanatical fringe of the Tea Party
[36:50.860 --> 36:57.220]  Now the reason I mentioned this article is it ties in with this story that Paul Watson's going to be talking about
[36:57.780 --> 37:04.620]  Fort Bragg troops trained for domestic emergency. This exercise is about the home front during civil emergency
[37:04.620 --> 37:12.060]  ABC 11 North Carolina reports and
[37:14.140 --> 37:16.140]  Reading from the report
[37:16.540 --> 37:22.820]  Scenarios which could all be really coming to America and that's when the potential for martial law kicks in
[37:23.500 --> 37:25.500]  You know, I have an ABC news report
[37:25.860 --> 37:31.340]  Out of Louisiana where they go martial law may be needed in America and
[37:31.340 --> 37:35.140]  Then it cuts to the very same photo that they have
[37:38.100 --> 37:42.220]  In that earlier report in this one showing Katrina and
[37:42.780 --> 37:50.660]  Armored vehicles and troops riding around confiscating guns with the state police and others integrated in with regular army
[37:50.660 --> 37:53.220]  I mean, this is what's being prepared for
[37:56.340 --> 37:58.020]  And
[37:58.020 --> 38:04.420]  Again, they create enough of an economic collapse and a hundred million people that are on food assistance go hungry
[38:04.420 --> 38:06.420]  You're gonna see an explosion in this nation
[38:06.940 --> 38:10.700]  It's gonna make the Great Depression if it goes this way. We're trying to stop it
[38:11.220 --> 38:18.500]  Look like a heavenly event look like a cake walk look like green pastures look like a walk in the park a
[38:21.820 --> 38:23.820]  Piece of cake whatever you want to call it
[38:23.820 --> 38:25.820]  And
[38:26.660 --> 38:34.540]  There's this massive buildup in the army times and Stars and Stripes just hundreds of articles about the military prepares to take on the tea party
[38:34.860 --> 38:40.980]  Yes, the number one enemy on C-span army war college generals. We're preparing to take on the gun owners
[38:40.980 --> 38:46.540]  They're the I mean we have all this on video and then we warn about it when the media goes
[38:48.460 --> 38:53.220]  You think martial law is coming in August in September you believe the gun confiscation will be done
[38:53.220 --> 38:58.340]  You believe the governor will be arrested you but you want to kill us military, mr. Jones
[38:58.460 --> 39:00.660]  We're like no, we're reading the army times
[39:01.100 --> 39:06.100]  We're showing local news where they admit the martial law preparations, but push it is good
[39:07.140 --> 39:13.780]  Just type in the YouTube clergy response teams and then you'll get different newscasts around the country where it's the same federal script about
[39:13.900 --> 39:20.420]  Daring emergencies the clergy will work with the army to tell you to go ahead and turn the guns in and go to the emergency center with your family
[39:20.420 --> 39:27.440]  And it cuts the preacher. It's a lord a ramen certain do what you're told and go to the camp
[39:27.980 --> 39:29.980]  Actually say that
[39:30.020 --> 39:32.020]  You've heard me play it at nauseam
[39:32.020 --> 39:37.460]  I mean, it's like if I get up here and I say I have CBS news across the country in the same script
[39:37.460 --> 39:42.780]  They send federal scripts down through it, then you trust it because it's local, but it's a federal teleprompter
[39:42.780 --> 39:44.780]  It's been loaded federally
[39:45.300 --> 39:47.300]  So it might as well be national and
[39:47.300 --> 39:51.740]  And they're like mercury helps your child's brain and is now a nutritious part of the food group
[39:52.980 --> 39:55.220]  And it helps your child's cognitive mind
[39:56.100 --> 39:59.940]  Do I need to play that clip probably for the 300th time? I mean, I will
[40:00.580 --> 40:05.540]  Mercury is good for your children. In fact, you know what? I'm not gonna play it
[40:05.540 --> 40:09.260]  Just go to YouTube. We'll do it on screen type in mercury is good for you
[40:09.260 --> 40:13.060]  And you can find different newscast saying mercury is good for you
[40:13.060 --> 40:18.380]  And I remember when I saw
[40:19.780 --> 40:23.620]  The report I knew it was nationally written so I googled it years ago
[40:23.620 --> 40:30.280]  And it was all over the country that day, but local newscasters going mercury is good mercury helps mercury is wonderful
[40:30.580 --> 40:37.620]  Mercury, it's the new vitamin C be trendy today. You'll never talk again, but it's fun government loves you. I
[40:39.100 --> 40:41.300]  Mean this is the creepiness of this
[40:41.300 --> 40:48.160]  Nobody wants your guns. Nobody's gonna take your doctor away. Obamacare is getting free all lies
[40:53.100 --> 40:55.980]  Hillary never had fake emails now she admits she did
[40:57.140 --> 40:59.980]  The head of the EPA had to step down over it. She needs to do right now
[41:02.100 --> 41:07.780]  So that's all coming up but Paul Watson wrote an article that ties into this one and we're going to him right now
[41:07.780 --> 41:11.340]  France prepares for mass unrest
[41:11.980 --> 41:16.820]  Radicalized immigrants taking over cities and this is in the French news
[41:18.900 --> 41:21.180]  But then you ask why are they bringing in
[41:22.100 --> 41:31.340]  To Europe over a hundred thousand North Africans and Middle Easterners a month. That's a conservative one hundred thousand a month
[41:31.340 --> 41:40.420]  There's a hundred plus thousand people out of North Africa on the island of Lesbos. I think it said 156,000 two weeks carported that
[41:41.100 --> 41:44.380]  One little island's got a hundred and fifty thousand people on it
[41:46.460 --> 41:47.700]  And
[41:47.700 --> 41:52.100]  In Germany wherever you just walk outside and there's just giant hordes of people
[41:52.100 --> 41:58.740]  I was in Toronto last week beautiful city blue skies great weather and I'm not kidding folks
[41:58.740 --> 42:01.780]  I've seen videos of street folks in Pakistan. I
[42:02.580 --> 42:09.300]  Mean you could tell these were malnourished children from very young age. You could tell the disorders when they haven't gotten enough food and they're just
[42:10.620 --> 42:12.140]  Absolutely
[42:12.140 --> 42:15.220]  The scariest look at people you'd see in a Pakistan market
[42:15.620 --> 42:21.260]  There are a lot of great Pakistani people. I have friends that are Pakistani wonderful smart scientific, you know merchant folks whatever
[42:21.260 --> 42:23.580]  I mean, you know, you talk about bad folks from a country
[42:23.580 --> 42:28.260]  You can find some really bad people from a white area black area. You find bad people in Mexico
[42:28.260 --> 42:34.180]  I'm just saying bottom of the barrel and they were so shocking when I would see this walking down the street that
[42:34.860 --> 42:36.860]  I
[42:39.580 --> 42:44.940]  Didn't even videotape the people well, I just kind of but I mean I'm talking wild
[42:44.940 --> 42:50.540]  I and and aggressively trying to sell you bottles of water or whatever and it was just so shocking
[42:50.900 --> 42:55.300]  To know that just the world's collapsing and our governments are just
[42:55.300 --> 43:03.020]  Disgourging this in along with stinger missiles and AK-47s. That's what the Paul's gonna break down and
[43:04.820 --> 43:09.860]  So when they strike, I mean how many times did I say the stinger missiles would end up in Europe probably France first?
[43:09.860 --> 43:12.580]  I'm gonna start shooting down airliners. They say that's imminent
[43:13.020 --> 43:15.020]  Our government again gave it to him
[43:15.500 --> 43:22.300]  And our governments go in and destroy central governments there that are even working with the West to turn
[43:22.300 --> 43:25.060]  It over to the worst elements
[43:29.700 --> 43:35.180]  But let me tell you it just didn't mix seeing a bunch of folks that look like they came out of an Afghan Bazaar
[43:36.260 --> 43:38.260]  That look like they came out of the Middle Ages
[43:40.500 --> 43:45.260]  Looking wild-eyed at women wearing many skirts and stiletto heels
[43:45.260 --> 43:48.980]  I mean there were women out there on the street that looked like they were you know
[43:48.980 --> 43:54.740]  Supermodels or something in Toronto and right next to it. There'd be like people on on
[43:55.740 --> 43:57.740]  rugs
[43:57.780 --> 43:59.300]  Smoking, you know
[43:59.300 --> 44:06.140]  Many hookahs and yelling at people. I mean it was just over the top and that's what Europe is seeing and getting freaked out about
[44:06.140 --> 44:08.380]  And Europe's got to pay for it
[44:08.380 --> 44:17.420]  And all I'm saying is suddenly it isn't just immigration or the best people coming here. It's spacebar folks. I
[44:19.620 --> 44:25.380]  Mean I've been down on the hike and bike trail and seen homeless Guatemalans catching fish
[44:26.340 --> 44:32.060]  With a piece of monofilament line wrapped around a coke can that they use as the and I'm sure they're really sweet great
[44:32.060 --> 44:34.060]  nice people the question is
[44:34.060 --> 44:39.100]  What is the government doing here and everywhere else just opening everything up and
[44:39.780 --> 44:43.340]  By the way, those immigrants did don't even know how to go get the assistance
[44:43.340 --> 44:49.860]  They haven't made it to the Democratic Party facility yet and and and haven't been scooped up to actually be taken off the street
[44:49.860 --> 44:57.700]  They're living in the green belt. It was grandma dad. They must have died. It was mama. It was daddy and three kids
[44:57.700 --> 45:04.540]  With a fire going over across the creek catching fish and eating them. I mean, we're talking grizzly Adams. Okay, fine
[45:05.140 --> 45:12.300]  These are countries that live like grizzly Adams. We're in the 21st century. Why are they bringing grizzly Adams in in mass?
[45:12.900 --> 45:14.900]  What's the reason?
[45:14.900 --> 45:19.460]  Because when it all unravels and melts down under depression, it is going to be a, you know, what storm and
[45:20.100 --> 45:25.420]  They're mixing radical jihadist into this and they're going to use the attacks to take everything away
[45:25.420 --> 45:31.140]  This and they're going to use the attacks to take everybody's liberties and there won't be any logic of our government open the borders
[45:31.140 --> 45:32.980]  our government gave them the weapons
[45:32.980 --> 45:34.980]  Because the public doesn't have logic anymore
[45:36.340 --> 45:39.060]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London to break this down
[45:39.300 --> 45:45.960]  France prepares for mass unrest radicalized immigrants taking over cities. That is a huge headline and you go through what the military says
[45:47.020 --> 45:52.300]  They think this is imminent. I mean for those that don't know a lot of French cities are more than half
[45:52.300 --> 45:55.660]  Islamic now and the radical islamics are
[45:56.940 --> 46:03.040]  Bullying the non-radical islamics like they've done in Libya Syria Egypt and other places in the submission pole
[46:03.040 --> 46:09.700]  And so Islam itself is being radicalized. Why is the West rolling a red carpet out to this?
[46:10.820 --> 46:16.880]  Well, I think one of the main reasons Alex is that their values are completely incompatible with quote, you know
[46:16.880 --> 46:23.100]  Western liberal democratic values, especially when it comes to free speech. I posted an image
[46:24.540 --> 46:29.820]  Earlier this week on Monday, I think it was of an ISIS flag on a toilet roll
[46:30.140 --> 46:32.700]  Okay, this is an image that's been out everywhere
[46:33.380 --> 46:38.940]  Originally Facebook bandits said it was offensive to Muslims. They later back down restored the image
[46:39.100 --> 46:44.220]  So I posted this image and said look this is being censored. Everybody should post this image
[46:44.220 --> 46:50.300]  So it got three hundred and sixty thousand shares on Facebook and ever since it was posted
[46:51.180 --> 46:57.260]  Literally every day death threat after death threat after death threat of people saying
[46:58.140 --> 47:04.860]  Insulting someone's religion isn't covered by free speech. Well, it is that's what free speech is all about the radical islamists
[47:04.860 --> 47:11.380]  They're gonna join with the left to selectively ban free speech of libertarians Christians and conservatives. That's their sick alliance
[47:11.380 --> 47:15.780]  Yeah, so it's like you don't have the free speech to criticize our religion
[47:15.780 --> 47:21.540]  But we have the free speech to make death threats against you for doing that quite the topsy-turvy world
[47:21.620 --> 47:23.700]  So it's been an interest in week
[47:24.940 --> 47:29.940]  And yeah, then we've got this story out of France, which is an intelligent source who spoke to the telegraph
[47:29.980 --> 47:35.380]  Who basically said that the French army is preparing for mass unrest that will arise out of these
[47:35.380 --> 47:42.860]  Immigrant populations obtaining weapons from Libya given to Libyan jihadist rebels
[47:46.500 --> 47:48.500]  We just lost
[47:48.780 --> 47:50.780]  neighborhoods in France
[47:52.060 --> 47:54.060]  Continue Paul you cut out for on it repeat that
[47:55.140 --> 48:01.220]  Yeah, so they're gonna get these weapons from Libya given to the jihadist by the French government in the first place these
[48:01.820 --> 48:03.820]  immigrants fourth generation
[48:03.820 --> 48:08.780]  Already, you know disenfranchised. They're saying they're gonna get control of these weapons
[48:09.020 --> 48:17.940]  Takeover entire neighborhoods in France and that then they're going to have to send the army in to reclaim this territory in major cities
[48:17.940 --> 48:23.860]  And don't forget that just last week we had this attack this attempt to the tack on a train in France
[48:24.740 --> 48:32.420]  whereby this guy obtains a Kalashnikov from where he visited Syria no doubt that has a connection to it obviously the three
[48:32.420 --> 48:38.780]  Individuals bravely tackle him, but then the lawyer comes out for this terrorist and says he's not a terrorist
[48:38.780 --> 48:45.900]  He just got the AK-47 because he was hungry and he wanted to get food off people and don't call him a terrorist
[48:45.900 --> 48:50.000]  That's his limo phobic, you know Muslim guy walking around a train carriage with
[48:51.340 --> 48:54.980]  Cutters and shooting at people. He's a he's a little cupcake. Yeah
[48:55.780 --> 48:59.580]  270 rounds, but don't call him a terrorist. That's his limo phobic
[48:59.580 --> 49:04.420]  So you've got this this cultural war basically going on in all these European countries
[49:04.940 --> 49:09.980]  Sweden as well, which we can get on to which is even worse than France, but in France
[49:10.660 --> 49:17.420]  They did a poll last year found that 15% of French citizens support ISIS
[49:18.780 --> 49:22.380]  27% of French citizens aged 18 to 25
[49:22.380 --> 49:29.220]  Support ISIS and of course the vast majority of these figures are coming from these immigrant areas
[49:29.460 --> 49:31.820]  Doesn't mean they're gonna go out and behead people
[49:31.820 --> 49:34.900]  But again, it shows that their values are completely incompatible
[49:35.700 --> 49:39.020]  With the values of free speech with the values of liberal
[49:39.020 --> 49:47.700]  But the the controlled left hates Western culture so much that they're willing to use radical Islam as the sword to behead
[49:47.700 --> 49:54.660]  The West I mean this is the execution of Western culture by any means necessary by the New World Order
[49:55.700 --> 50:03.140]  Yeah, and now they're even getting into positions of power Sweden one of their top immigration officials is an ISIS sympathizer
[50:03.340 --> 50:07.500]  She praises jihadists fighting in Syria on her Facebook page
[50:07.580 --> 50:13.140]  She likes ISIS propaganda and she's in control of the immigration system in Sweden
[50:13.140 --> 50:20.180]  People who speak out against it are charged with hate crime. By the way, they even pose on their Facebooks in their jihad outfits
[50:20.580 --> 50:26.900]  Then some have even traveled to be with them. They even let people in and then they're just praises liberal
[50:27.460 --> 50:32.100]  Well, the the taxpayer funded expert on Islamophobia in Sweden
[50:32.460 --> 50:38.180]  Nicolai Scrammo, he went on to join ISIS. He was the government expert on
[50:38.180 --> 50:45.820]  All authoritarians can go to hell. I mean, I'm done with this and that's what I mean about the left
[50:45.820 --> 50:51.460]  They are a weird mentally ill group. I mean, they'll say that you and I weren't pants and sexes
[50:51.540 --> 50:56.980]  But if people want to sexually mutilate women and blow up Buddhist temples, it's okay. I mean, no, it's not

[54:00.940 --> 54:26.640]  Newsweek's reporting that a suspect is in custody after an active shooting incident reported
[54:26.640 --> 54:31.100]  at Mississippi State University, right now it appears like it's really nothing and that
[54:31.100 --> 54:33.820]  no one's been hurt, hopefully.
[54:33.820 --> 54:37.580]  We also see a lot of hysteria where there's a backfire outside the capitol so they evacuate
[54:37.580 --> 54:42.500]  it, but we'll continue to track this as it unfolds.
[54:42.500 --> 54:43.660]  Maybe Sirius may not be.
[54:43.660 --> 54:48.620]  Going back to Paul, Joseph Watson, Paul, it's very clear.
[54:48.620 --> 54:53.700]  They take Western values of having open, laissez faire culture.
[54:53.700 --> 54:57.900]  They then expand that until the West submit to everything, let us do whatever we want
[54:57.900 --> 55:00.260]  to you politically.
[55:00.260 --> 55:07.180]  Then they bring in groups that are basically neolithic when it comes to the policies.
[55:07.180 --> 55:09.460]  Very primitive.
[55:09.460 --> 55:15.580]  And they then make an alliance with the radicals of that group, a billion, 300 million Muslims
[55:15.580 --> 55:19.740]  to take over regular Islam because, I mean, most Muslims just want to have businesses
[55:19.740 --> 55:22.220]  and live and are pretty conservative good people.
[55:22.220 --> 55:26.020]  I don't believe in Islamophobia where there's just all a bunch of bad people, but the group
[55:26.020 --> 55:30.420]  getting in charge, Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabist are really horrible people.
[55:30.420 --> 55:31.780]  I mean, they're about as bad as it gets.
[55:31.780 --> 55:32.780]  They're scum.
[55:32.780 --> 55:36.260]  And they're always raping kids and women and running snuff rings.
[55:36.260 --> 55:38.380]  They talk about because they can do it because it's infidels.
[55:38.380 --> 55:43.180]  I mean, they make Charlie Manson look like a cupcake.
[55:43.180 --> 55:46.100]  And they're just out of control.
[55:46.100 --> 55:49.180]  And our governments are traitorous bringing them in.
[55:49.180 --> 55:50.180]  What's the end game?
[55:50.180 --> 55:53.460]  I used to think they were just going to use them for a clash of civilizations to take
[55:53.460 --> 55:54.620]  our liberties.
[55:54.620 --> 55:56.540]  But I think they've looked at the population demographics.
[55:56.540 --> 56:02.260]  I think they've decided to join with it in the next generation and actually end Western
[56:02.260 --> 56:04.260]  culture as we know it, Paul.
[56:04.260 --> 56:05.260]  Yeah.
[56:05.260 --> 56:06.860]  It's definitely about that.
[56:06.860 --> 56:10.740]  It's about diluting cultures, about taking away liberties.
[56:10.740 --> 56:18.260]  And it just came out in the UK, 330,000 immigrants per year, per year coming into the UK, a tiny
[56:18.260 --> 56:21.700]  island of just over 60 million population.
[56:21.700 --> 56:25.540]  And as you were just talking about, it came out, Tony Blair's government, that was their
[56:25.540 --> 56:31.300]  secret planet got leaked to allow all these immigrants to come in, to use them as a voting
[56:31.300 --> 56:37.340]  block, to use them to dilute basically the whole culture and create this organization.
[56:37.340 --> 56:40.860]  I've had members of your parliament on their liberal and they admit, well, her conservatives
[56:40.860 --> 56:45.020]  say it, didn't believe it, but they're actually putting them in charge of the social services,
[56:45.020 --> 56:47.020]  the police, you name it.
[56:47.020 --> 56:52.380]  The government's bringing in a foreign illegal alien group to be their Victorian guard.
[56:52.380 --> 56:53.380]  Yeah.
[56:53.380 --> 57:00.220]  And while arresting people like Tommy Robinson for considering to attend a meeting about
[57:00.220 --> 57:06.460]  a draw Mohammed cartoon contest, there's literally snatching people off the street for thought
[57:06.460 --> 57:09.820]  crime because they may be planning to offend.
[57:09.820 --> 57:15.340]  And banned Michael Savage from coming and then banned a martial arts expert from coming
[57:15.340 --> 57:17.340]  in.
[57:17.340 --> 57:18.340]  Yeah.
[57:18.340 --> 57:21.100]  And Sweden's even worse though, I keep hopping on about Sweden.
[57:21.100 --> 57:22.100]  Okay.
[57:22.100 --> 57:27.740]  Since they opened their borders in the seventies, 1400% rise in rapes.
[57:27.740 --> 57:31.740]  Feminist liberals bang on about this rape culture in the West, which has completely contrived
[57:31.740 --> 57:32.940]  and invented.
[57:32.940 --> 57:39.420]  While Sweden goes through this 1400% surge in rapes, you go through the arrest records
[57:39.420 --> 57:45.140]  about 75% of them are foreign born immigrants, the perpetrators of these rates.
[57:45.140 --> 57:48.380]  And they say it's cultural in their countries to rape women.
[57:48.380 --> 57:49.380]  So it's okay.
[57:49.380 --> 57:50.380]  Yeah.
[57:50.380 --> 57:51.380]  That's just their culture.
[57:51.380 --> 57:55.060]  I guess we're islamophobic for being against the raping of women now.
[57:55.060 --> 57:56.060]  We're not trendy.
[57:56.060 --> 57:57.060]  We're not liberal.
[57:57.060 --> 58:00.940]  So they went a step further and said, that's not trendy enough.
[58:00.940 --> 58:05.980]  Now some of the politicians in Sweden are saying the returning ISIS jihadists, we need to
[58:05.980 --> 58:10.580]  give them jobs, give them welfare and make the taxpayers pay for it.
[58:10.580 --> 58:16.420]  They're even talking about forcing Swedes to give up their garages to house these immigrants
[58:16.420 --> 58:18.340]  because there's a massive housing force.
[58:18.340 --> 58:19.340]  Yeah.
[58:19.340 --> 58:20.340]  Oh yeah.
[58:20.340 --> 58:22.460]  Forcing you to quarter the jihadis in your house.
[58:22.460 --> 58:28.140]  I mean, this, the left is mentally ill and wants to take over and wants to crap all
[58:28.140 --> 58:29.140]  everything.
[58:29.140 --> 58:30.660]  I mean, I hate to use a term like that, but that's it.
[58:30.660 --> 58:34.420]  I mean, it's like somebody that's got dementia, rubbing stuff all over their body.
[58:34.420 --> 58:37.220]  I mean, that's what they, the left has dementia.
[58:37.220 --> 58:44.180]  They're fascist mentally ill scum who hate progress, hate freedom, hate wealth, help.
[58:44.180 --> 58:45.180]  They hate strength.
[58:45.180 --> 58:47.500]  I want to talk more about the military plans.
[58:47.500 --> 58:48.860]  Stay there, Paul.
[58:48.860 --> 58:53.100]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has
[58:53.100 --> 58:54.980]  been told not to drink the water.
[58:54.980 --> 58:57.620]  Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency.
[58:57.620 --> 59:03.260]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[59:03.260 --> 59:04.580]  single day?
[59:04.580 --> 59:07.620]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[59:07.620 --> 59:10.540]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[59:10.540 --> 59:12.580]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[59:12.580 --> 59:15.500]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[59:15.500 --> 59:21.420]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[59:21.420 --> 59:24.580]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[59:24.580 --> 59:27.820]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[59:51.260 --> 1:00:04.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:09.660]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:09.660 --> 1:00:10.660]  You want answers?
[1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:12.820]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:16.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:16.980 --> 1:00:23.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.980 --> 1:00:39.060]  Paul Watson's our guest.
[1:00:39.060 --> 1:00:44.180]  Our reporters will join us from Virginia, the little town where the tragic shooting happened
[1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:49.060]  yesterday, coming up in the next segment, and Steve Quell joins us, a loss of open phones
[1:00:49.060 --> 1:00:51.060]  with Steve Quell's with us.
[1:00:51.060 --> 1:00:58.540]  Paul, clearly, though, the very neocons and rhino-republicans pushing Islamophobia, just
[1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:04.020]  the Muslims in general, so we've got to invade their countries, they go over, destabilize
[1:01:04.020 --> 1:01:09.500]  the countries, then put the jihadis in, that's the super double cross.
[1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:15.620]  And so dastardly, it makes the headspin, and geopolitically, clearly now they're gearing
[1:01:15.620 --> 1:01:21.580]  up for these groups to be given the green light through their leadership to start soft
[1:01:21.580 --> 1:01:24.180]  target attacks.
[1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:31.020]  Does the establishment really think the West will put up with continued rape, continued
[1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:35.020]  murder, and jihad attacks, and then not call it Islamic?
[1:01:35.020 --> 1:01:37.580]  I mean, how are they going to get away with this?
[1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:43.980]  Well, they've rebranded authoritarianism, so now you see in countries like Germany,
[1:01:43.980 --> 1:01:48.340]  the host population are attacking the immigrants, this is where it's going to go.
[1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:52.020]  And the same thing's happening with this whole Black Lives Matter thing, okay?
[1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:56.500]  We had the attack yesterday, which was a revenge for Charleston, it's all part of this contrived
[1:01:56.500 --> 1:02:01.300]  race war, but most people don't know, and this, I'm going to write an article on this,
[1:02:01.300 --> 1:02:06.140]  this is basically an exclusive, this hasn't been pointed out by anyone, okay?
[1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:10.820]  Most members of Black Lives Matter are just useful idiots, they're not dangerous, but
[1:02:10.820 --> 1:02:16.060]  if you look at the three founders of Black Lives Matter, who are three militant lesbian
[1:02:16.060 --> 1:02:22.140]  feminists, they say as their inspiration, and in their foundational texts for Black Lives
[1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:31.060]  Matter, this woman called Assata Shakur, she is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[1:02:31.060 --> 1:02:37.580]  This is a convicted cop killer who escaped to Cuba back in the 70s with the help of the
[1:02:37.580 --> 1:02:43.860]  weather underground, she killed police officers, and this is the woman cited as the inspiration
[1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:44.860]  behind Black Lives Matter.
[1:02:44.860 --> 1:02:48.820]  And then it's the left constantly saying that libertarians, constitutionalists are going
[1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:53.140]  to kill cops, well, only if they follow orders to come confiscate all the guns and have martial
[1:02:53.140 --> 1:02:54.140]  law.
[1:02:54.140 --> 1:02:58.700]  I mean, it's not libertarians and patriots that hate police, it is historically the
[1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:02.620]  communists left, and again, the left-right paradigm is false because globalists control
[1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:09.260]  the whole thing, but they're taking over worldwide using leftist ideologies and groups allied
[1:03:09.260 --> 1:03:11.940]  with super-fascist radical Islam.
[1:03:11.940 --> 1:03:13.580]  What a sickening combo.
[1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:19.180]  Yeah, and remember the Obama administration has met with these Black Lives Matter leaders.
[1:03:19.180 --> 1:03:24.340]  This idol, this icon that they worship, Assata Shakur, she left the Black Panthers because
[1:03:24.340 --> 1:03:26.060]  it wasn't violent enough.
[1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:31.820]  She joined the Black Liberation Army, which killed 13 cops in the 70s.
[1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:33.860]  This is the foundational inspiration.
[1:03:33.860 --> 1:03:35.340]  They say it's about Black liberation.
[1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:38.940]  And that's why they're obsessed with killing cops now and Soros is funding it.
[1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:41.060]  Yeah, Soros is funding the whole thing.
[1:03:41.060 --> 1:03:42.660]  They're now trying to say, oh, that's debunked.
[1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:45.860]  Meanwhile, this sheriff says that we want to kill cops, basically.
[1:03:45.860 --> 1:03:50.460]  Yeah, well, it's all, you know, the dangerous right-wing conservatives, the Tea Party, never
[1:03:50.460 --> 1:03:54.820]  been involved in any act of violence, and these people are literally chanting, what
[1:03:54.820 --> 1:03:56.340]  do we want dead cops?
[1:03:56.340 --> 1:03:57.740]  When do we want it now?
[1:03:57.740 --> 1:04:02.660]  The NYPD cop killer Ishmael Brinsley said that was a revenge attack for Black Lives
[1:04:02.660 --> 1:04:03.660]  Matter.
[1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:05.380]  Now we have the incident yesterday.
[1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:10.020]  This in turn creates more dill and roofs, and the whole cycle goes round and round.
[1:04:10.020 --> 1:04:13.260]  Then the government comes in with the control, with the new powers.
[1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:18.540]  That's why it's in their interest to fuel the flames of this race war.
[1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:23.060]  To distract us from the fact that foreign banks are looting everything right now, Paul.
[1:04:23.060 --> 1:04:27.540]  Yeah, it's a massive distraction, again, to get us fighting with each other.
[1:04:27.540 --> 1:04:31.860]  And the very leaders, the de facto leader of Black Lives Matter came out within minutes
[1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:34.460]  of the news breaking of yesterday's shooting.
[1:04:34.460 --> 1:04:38.700]  Before the identity of the shooter was even known, blamed it on white people.
[1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:41.500]  Time magazine, in defense of rioting.
[1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:42.500]  You know, salons.
[1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:46.740]  That's right, you should do a story on how Time Magazine called for killing people and
[1:04:46.740 --> 1:04:50.740]  is responsible, because more than anything, they are now, and it's important to point
[1:04:50.740 --> 1:04:53.260]  out that it's incredible, Paul.
[1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:54.260]  It's totally sick.
[1:04:54.260 --> 1:04:55.260]  Great job.

[1:04:56.260 --> 1:04:58.780]  We'll be back with our reporters.
[1:04:58.780 --> 1:05:02.660]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter
[1:05:02.660 --> 1:05:04.460]  Vester Lee Flanagan.
[1:05:04.460 --> 1:05:09.020]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery, and by his inability to use
[1:05:09.020 --> 1:05:10.020]  a teleprompter.
[1:05:10.020 --> 1:05:14.020]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:17.780]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation, not only of Shirts County
[1:05:17.780 --> 1:05:20.820]  policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[1:05:20.820 --> 1:05:24.420]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different
[1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:25.420]  standard.
[1:05:25.420 --> 1:05:28.620]  President Obama responded saying, guns are worse than terrorism.
[1:05:28.620 --> 1:05:31.620]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun related incidents around
[1:05:31.620 --> 1:05:35.220]  this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:39.340]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes
[1:05:39.340 --> 1:05:42.620]  the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan show.
[1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:43.620]  How about Prozac?
[1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:45.780]  You know the number, oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:50.380]  Don't want to talk about the U.S. number one cause of death is suicide now, because they
[1:05:50.380 --> 1:05:53.460]  give people suicide mass murder pills.
[1:05:53.460 --> 1:05:56.180]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.

[1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:43.380]  Staring at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[1:06:58.140 --> 1:07:02.380]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for Info Wars listeners.
[1:07:02.380 --> 1:07:07.260]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply survival shield X2
[1:07:07.260 --> 1:07:13.260]  Deep Earth crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[1:07:13.260 --> 1:07:15.860]  Devices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[1:07:15.860 --> 1:07:20.740]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the pure Deep Earth crystals and have now
[1:07:20.740 --> 1:07:23.020]  been able to produce more.
[1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:26.580]  Survival Shield Nacin iodine X2, this is the good halogen.
[1:07:26.580 --> 1:07:29.620]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.

[1:08:00.260 --> 1:08:06.180]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[1:08:06.180 --> 1:08:22.580]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:22.580 --> 1:08:26.900]  Alex Jones here back live into the second hour, our reporters Joe Viggs and of course
[1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:35.220]  David Knight are reporting live from the site of yesterday's tragic shooting, WDBJ
[1:08:35.220 --> 1:08:41.740]  in Manetta, Virginia and former Staff Sergeant Joe Viggs is there first up to tell us what
[1:08:41.740 --> 1:08:46.060]  happened since they got in last night, what's happening with the press conferences, they're
[1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:50.260]  going to be covering the media response to this, Hillary calling for more gun control,
[1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:56.420]  the father of the news reporter calling for that, simply ridiculous, very, very sad that
[1:08:56.420 --> 1:09:01.100]  this is now being used to try to disarm other innocent people that had nothing to do with
[1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:05.900]  this, but giving us the latest from the ground is Joe Viggs.
[1:09:05.900 --> 1:09:06.900]  Joe?
[1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:10.300]  Joe Viggs here with infowars.com, now I'm standing right across the street from the
[1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:15.260]  Beardwater Plaza, now over to my left over here we'll pan across, this is the actual
[1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:20.260]  location where Flanigan came in and shot the two journalists and we still have another
[1:09:20.260 --> 1:09:22.940]  person critically injured in the hospital.
[1:09:22.940 --> 1:09:27.580]  Now today at five o'clock our time here on East Coast Standard Time, we're going to have
[1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:31.020]  a press conference right over here across the street, they're going to actually bring
[1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:36.340]  us over and let us walk around, talk, ask questions, and I've got a few questions I'm
[1:09:36.340 --> 1:09:39.900]  going to ask too as well, so we're prepared for that, but one of the things that we know
[1:09:39.900 --> 1:09:47.700]  today is they found the LGBT flag in Flanigan's apartment, so what this means is, since he
[1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:53.500]  has the flag, that means he represents all gay, lesbian people, so I think he speaks
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:58.220]  for them all, it's a hate flag now, I think we should call for a full out ban on that
[1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:00.220]  flag just like they did in Charleston, Alex.
[1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:05.380]  I agree because the Confederate battle flag, Robert E. Lee flag, was there, historically
[1:10:05.380 --> 1:10:12.180]  has nothing to do with oppressing black people even though they say it does, let's ban the
[1:10:12.180 --> 1:10:16.860]  rainbow flag now and let's ban the Confederate flag, and then if somebody's wearing a Coca
[1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:21.220]  Cola shirt when they kill somebody, I want Coca Cola banned, and if somebody runs over
[1:10:21.220 --> 1:10:26.260]  somebody in a Ford F-150 on purpose, ban Ford, because it is the fault of Ford, that's a
[1:10:26.260 --> 1:10:27.260]  great idea.
[1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:31.740]  I mean, since he is a black homosexual or he was...
[1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:37.380]  Alright, our Skype has now broken up, but we will go back...
[1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:38.380]  Actions, because...
[1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:41.660]  Okay, Joe, go ahead and finish up the point.
[1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:42.660]  Check, check.
[1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:43.660]  You're back, go ahead.
[1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:48.860]  Alright, I said, well, since he was an African American homosexual, I think we should hold
[1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:54.740]  everybody responsible for this because his loan actions represent everyone across the
[1:10:54.740 --> 1:11:01.300]  full spectrum of the LGBT community and the black community, so there's going to be a
[1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:04.420]  lot of pay now for this, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[1:11:04.420 --> 1:11:07.340]  Everyone's talking about a gun, you've got the Clinton people coming out saying we need
[1:11:07.340 --> 1:11:10.900]  to ban the guns, you've got the governor here in Virginia saying that they restrict
[1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:15.140]  their gun background checks, but in fact, we know now that a flan again went through the
[1:11:15.140 --> 1:11:20.420]  proper procedures, got the gun two days after the Charleston shooting, this was premeditated,
[1:11:20.420 --> 1:11:24.300]  this guy went through the background check, so we don't need to call for more background
[1:11:24.300 --> 1:11:25.720]  checks, they're already in place.
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:31.020]  This was a lone man, one guy who was pushed over the edge, he was mentally unstable, he
[1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:35.420]  didn't know how to react to these so-called rumors from these reporters saying that they
[1:11:35.420 --> 1:11:41.780]  made racist comments, and instead of doing like most people do, anyone in their lifetime
[1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:44.900]  has come across some kind of racist comment they've heard of.
[1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:45.900]  You know what you do?
[1:11:45.900 --> 1:11:48.740]  You do like I've done before and other of my friends have done, you brush it off and
[1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:49.740]  move on.
[1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:53.460]  Instead, this guy decided to cross the line of no turning back and he decided to go out
[1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:54.820]  and commit murder.
[1:11:54.820 --> 1:11:58.060]  You don't blame a gun, you don't blame an object, I can lay a gun down right down the
[1:11:58.060 --> 1:12:02.420]  middle of the street and cars will drive by, people will walk by and not one person will
[1:12:02.420 --> 1:12:03.420]  be-
[1:12:03.420 --> 1:12:08.860]  That's right, but expanding on that while your Skype breaks up Joe Beggs, it's very,
[1:12:08.860 --> 1:12:10.380]  very simple.
[1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:14.700]  This is what the Talitarianism does, is it blames whole groups of people for the actions
[1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:20.100]  of one person, and as soon as we learned this guy was black, we didn't start blaming all
[1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:23.780]  black people for it like a lot of black groups did and the left did.
[1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:30.940]  This is their guilt-based mindset, and we had the guy, because of the Southern Primary
[1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:37.220]  Law Center, he admitted it, go in and shoot up Dr. Dobson's facility, focus on the family.
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:43.020]  The truth is the left is very, very violent and they are pushing with Time Magazine saying
[1:12:43.020 --> 1:12:47.220]  the case for rioting and Black Lives Matter groups calling for violence.
[1:12:47.220 --> 1:12:53.060]  The truth is though, as a group, they've been pushing violence, and that's the problem.
[1:12:53.060 --> 1:12:57.940]  And I really wonder when Nancy Pelosi is in control of the DC-based Black Lives Matter
[1:12:57.940 --> 1:13:01.220]  with her staffer, why would they be pushing this?
[1:13:01.220 --> 1:13:03.220]  What do they think they're going to get out of it?
[1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:09.140]  Well, I don't get it, I confronted Dorei McKesson, the guy that said the so-called head of the
[1:13:09.140 --> 1:13:13.180]  Black Lives Matter group in Ferguson this last time, and I said, how are you going to
[1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:15.660]  fight racism by creating more racism?
[1:13:15.660 --> 1:13:18.780]  And he told me to get away and adjust my white privilege.
[1:13:18.780 --> 1:13:21.660]  The guy is out of control, that's what they pushed.
[1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:25.260]  When I sit down in these different places and I engage in conversation and everyone
[1:13:25.260 --> 1:13:30.620]  praises these guys like they're the new Martin Luther King's, I just don't see it.
[1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:36.300]  These guys, the guys at the top of this movement, are pushing racism and somehow that's going
[1:13:36.300 --> 1:13:37.980]  to defeat the racism against them.
[1:13:37.980 --> 1:13:39.620]  All they're doing is creating more.
[1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:40.620]  It's out of control.
[1:13:40.620 --> 1:13:43.420]  Well, that makes business, that makes business better for them.
[1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:47.340]  Now I want to talk about what you've witnessed since you got there, then we're going to
[1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:51.420]  switch here in a minute and get David Knight's breakdown on what's happening, and then tell
[1:13:51.420 --> 1:13:53.660]  us what's coming up as well.
[1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:58.660]  Well, what we've seen so far is you have the whole area has been blockaded off, there's
[1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:00.060]  police up and down the road.
[1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:03.980]  They're not letting anybody over in that area right now, except for essential people who
[1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:06.900]  are working in some of the smaller businesses over here.
[1:14:06.900 --> 1:14:12.220]  This is a really small little lake town, nice area, a main road that comes through here.
[1:14:12.220 --> 1:14:16.460]  There's a good bit of media that's behind us right now, most of these people are going
[1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:19.260]  to be pushing how there should be stricter gun control.
[1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:23.060]  You have the victim's father, the female reporter coming out saying that he's going
[1:14:23.060 --> 1:14:27.740]  to work tirelessly to make sure there's a more stricter gun control.
[1:14:27.740 --> 1:14:28.740]  And that's the thing.
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:29.740]  That's what I want to do later on.
[1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:33.220]  There's going to be a press conference and I'm going to ask if that gun has been charged
[1:14:33.220 --> 1:14:37.180]  with murder, because I mean, really, that's what it is, we're blaming the guns, we're
[1:14:37.180 --> 1:14:39.300]  not going to blame the end of this.
[1:14:39.300 --> 1:14:41.940]  I think the gun should be charged with first-degree murder.
[1:14:41.940 --> 1:14:47.940]  In fact, it also pressured and brainwashed the shooter into doing it.
[1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:51.900]  Well, I want to talk to these mainstream reporters too when they're live, once we go live, and
[1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:56.260]  tell them how dare they're ashamed on them for taking this senseless act of violence
[1:14:56.260 --> 1:15:00.820]  by one person and you're going to push their anti-gun agenda.
[1:15:00.820 --> 1:15:01.820]  Absolutely, Joe.
[1:15:01.820 --> 1:15:02.820]  I want you.
[1:15:02.820 --> 1:15:07.340]  What should law-abiding citizens have to give up our rights to protect ourselves so these
[1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:09.900]  cowards can hide behind?
[1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:13.900]  Well, you're absolutely on target, Joe Biggs.
[1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:15.380]  We're going to come back to you in a little while.
[1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:19.060]  I want to disconnect and reconnect the Skype, see if we can get a better connection and
[1:15:19.060 --> 1:15:22.260]  then we're going to bring David Knight on and then bring Joe Biggs back.
[1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:24.980]  You can tell Joe is really hot under the collar.
[1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:27.140]  We're going to have a bunch of HD reports filed.
[1:15:27.140 --> 1:15:29.860]  We're going to be covering the press conferences.
[1:15:29.860 --> 1:15:30.860]  That's why they're there.
[1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:33.660]  There's two hours from any major airport.
[1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:40.540]  The guys left at like four o'clock yesterday, got into Virginia at about seven, and then
[1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:43.060]  took them to like 10 at night to get out there.
[1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:47.420]  It's in the middle of nowhere, beautiful area, and it's a tragedy.
[1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:52.780]  But I mean, I'm more upset about 300,000 dead Syrians killed by Al Qaeda and ISIS than our
[1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:54.020]  government funded.
[1:15:54.020 --> 1:15:55.980]  Hillary was instrumental in running all that.
[1:15:55.980 --> 1:16:00.100]  She wants to say she's upset, she's so sad for these two dead people.
[1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:01.100]  We could care less.
[1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:05.460]  This is a cold-blooded killer, fast and furious, all of it.
[1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:09.940]  And they're just using these events to push their agenda.
[1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:13.940]  And I know everybody knows that, but obviously not everybody because some people still buy
[1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:17.540]  into this bull.
[1:16:17.540 --> 1:16:24.580]  But the good news is most people I talk to when I see happening online and what gun sales
[1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:29.020]  show and national statistics, gun ownership is only rising.
[1:16:29.020 --> 1:16:33.140]  People are getting into guns, whether it's for self-defense, whether it's for recreation.
[1:16:33.140 --> 1:16:38.060]  It's really an exciting time to be alive, and that's why they're pushing so hard.
[1:16:38.060 --> 1:16:44.020]  But clearly, they've overdone it and really played their hand, and that's why they're
[1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:45.260]  having more and more trouble.
[1:16:45.260 --> 1:16:47.900]  All right, do we have the guys back?
[1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:52.820]  Okay, we're getting them back, and then we're going to get David Knight's breakdown on
[1:16:52.820 --> 1:16:53.820]  all of this as well.
[1:16:53.820 --> 1:16:57.580]  And this is live, radio slash TV.
[1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:01.180]  I know we have affiliates all over the country on AM and FM radio, and people are like, is
[1:17:01.180 --> 1:17:02.180]  this a TV show?
[1:17:02.180 --> 1:17:08.940]  Yes, it's radio-based, but we added television to it 10 years ago or more so that we could
[1:17:08.940 --> 1:17:12.260]  document what we were saying more.
[1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:15.380]  Because I would have reporters 10 years ago or 12 years ago on the ground reporting my
[1:17:15.380 --> 1:17:16.380]  phone.
[1:17:16.380 --> 1:17:19.100]  People say, oh, that person wasn't really there during that urban warfare drill.
[1:17:19.100 --> 1:17:21.380]  And we'd have to put the video online.
[1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:26.660]  YouTube came along and started letting us add even more.
[1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:34.900]  Because I was putting videos up 15, 16, 17, 18 years ago online, but they were on my servers,
[1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:36.900]  and I couldn't afford it.
[1:17:36.900 --> 1:17:39.300]  So that was a big, big problem there.
[1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:44.180]  But now as bandwidth's gone down, it's opened things up to allow us to build a real media
[1:17:44.180 --> 1:17:45.180]  platform.
[1:17:45.180 --> 1:17:52.500]  David Knight, again, joining us from right outside the Small Town, Virginia, WDBJ Center,
[1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:57.380]  News Center, we're going to skip this network break to have more time, Steve Quell's coming
[1:17:57.380 --> 1:17:58.380]  up.
[1:17:58.380 --> 1:18:03.980]  David Knight, tell us what you've seen so far, observations, and what's coming up today.
[1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:11.340]  Yeah, there must be so much media there that you're able to get an internet connection,
[1:18:11.340 --> 1:18:12.860]  but it's not able to stay up.
[1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:18.380]  Because I guarantee you that town is not used to the extra 500 people that are there covering
[1:18:18.380 --> 1:18:19.380]  this.
[1:18:19.380 --> 1:18:25.580]  We'll try to reconnect with that yet again, or maybe use another Skype handle.
[1:18:25.580 --> 1:18:33.060]  And again, this is all part of what live radio slash TV is, teleprompter free, ladies and
[1:18:33.060 --> 1:18:34.060]  gentlemen.
[1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:39.100]  Before we go any further, we can also just default, get David Knight on telephone.
[1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:43.860]  I want to remind you that this hour is brought to you by survival shield, nascent iodine
[1:18:43.860 --> 1:18:44.860]  X2.
[1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:50.740]  X2 is unlike any other nascent iodine out there.
[1:18:50.740 --> 1:18:54.700]  It comes from a deep earth crystal source.
[1:18:54.700 --> 1:19:01.260]  And it goes in and basically blocks the bad halogens.
[1:19:01.260 --> 1:19:05.460]  And it's able, in my experience, to really detoxify the body.
[1:19:05.460 --> 1:19:07.300]  You die without iodine.
[1:19:07.300 --> 1:19:11.300]  There is such a huge epidemic of iodine deficiency all over the world.
[1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:15.780]  Just iodine is bound to other elements that you'll find, so you don't really absorb it
[1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:17.660]  or it makes you sick.
[1:19:17.660 --> 1:19:24.580]  Experience real iodine in our quest to find the most powerful alternative products, nutraceuticals.
[1:19:24.580 --> 1:19:29.140]  We developed X2 and that's why it's such a sensation and helps finance this very expensive
[1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:30.140]  operation.
[1:19:30.140 --> 1:19:31.140]  So it's a win-win.
[1:19:31.140 --> 1:19:35.260]  When you purchase survival shield nascent iodine X2, let's look at a few reviews.
[1:19:35.260 --> 1:19:42.460]  Daniel in Las Vegas, Nevada, said that himself, this whole family, take this daily.
[1:19:42.460 --> 1:19:43.460]  Works great.
[1:19:43.460 --> 1:19:46.260]  We recommend it to a friend, five-star review.
[1:19:46.260 --> 1:19:47.420]  Thank you for your support.
[1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:51.740]  Sylvia in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada says I use this product for two days and already
[1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:53.540]  feel better and more energized.
[1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:55.620]  My whole body feels lighter and more relaxed.
[1:19:55.620 --> 1:19:57.860]  Just love it as it gave me instant results.
[1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:01.860]  It is extremely easy to take and the taste is great.
[1:20:01.860 --> 1:20:04.980]  Thank you for providing us with such a great product.
[1:20:04.980 --> 1:20:06.900]  God bless.
[1:20:06.900 --> 1:20:10.820]  It's like when you're pushed under water and you finally get to the top and get air.
[1:20:10.820 --> 1:20:14.100]  I mean, when you regularly have air and aren't under water, you don't realize how much you
[1:20:14.100 --> 1:20:16.620]  miss it.
[1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:21.220]  Some people don't have deficiencies, eat enough seafood, things like that.
[1:20:21.220 --> 1:20:23.020]  So if you get it, it won't be that big of a deal.
[1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:27.580]  But if you do have a deficiency, which they say like half the public does, it is dramatic.
[1:20:27.580 --> 1:20:32.300]  Warning though, within two, three, four weeks, you'll have a detox and you'll feel pretty
[1:20:32.300 --> 1:20:36.420]  crappy for four or five days and then after that, it feels even better and all this stuff
[1:20:36.420 --> 1:20:38.460]  will come out of your skin.
[1:20:38.460 --> 1:20:43.220]  And most people's experience, I mean, it is dramatic when you slough the bad halogens
[1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:47.860]  out of your thyroid and things.
[1:20:47.860 --> 1:20:55.260]  So again, Survival Shield, nascent iodine X2 available exclusively at infowarslife.com

[1:21:37.820 --> 1:21:43.460]  Now let's go ahead and go back to David Knight.
[1:21:43.460 --> 1:21:51.780]  Let's go back to David Knight, who is outside WDBJ in Manetta, Virginia, the site of the
[1:21:51.780 --> 1:21:58.180]  tragic shooting, the quote, revenge race murder, better black reporter who gunned down white
[1:21:58.180 --> 1:22:06.820]  ex-colleges, lived live on air and posted the video, online blames charlton shooting
[1:22:06.820 --> 1:22:12.420]  and anti-gay harassment manifesto and I'm not tooting my horn, but hours before this
[1:22:12.420 --> 1:22:18.700]  came out I said I bet he did it because of charlton shooting and the way MSNBC promoted
[1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:20.180]  it and now that's coming out.
[1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:24.140]  I mean you can read this from a mile away, this is so transparent.
[1:22:24.140 --> 1:22:27.540]  David Knight, give us your breakdown.
[1:22:27.540 --> 1:22:31.740]  David Knight from Bridgewater and we're right across the plaza here where the shooting actually
[1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:32.740]  took place.
[1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:36.100]  Alex we haven't been able to get to the crime scene, they have that blocked off as Joe Biggs
[1:22:36.100 --> 1:22:37.100]  was telling you.
[1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:39.740]  What we've been able to see here is the media and as I was saying before, I don't know how
[1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:42.300]  much of it you got before it cut off.
[1:22:42.300 --> 1:22:46.580]  We've seen a lot of foreign press here, we've seen Fiji press from Japan.
[1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:50.180]  When I was looking for information, every other article on the first page of Google
[1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:54.580]  was foreign when I was trying to get information about Bester Flanagan, that is I went a couple
[1:22:54.580 --> 1:22:56.380]  of pages and they were all foreign.
[1:22:56.380 --> 1:23:00.780]  We're talking about Greece, Italy, Spain, Mexico, all these different countries are
[1:23:00.780 --> 1:23:02.280]  seizing on this.
[1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:03.540]  What do they see?
[1:23:03.540 --> 1:23:06.380]  As Joe Biggs pointed out, are we going to charge the gun with murder?
[1:23:06.380 --> 1:23:08.460]  That's what the press here is doing.
[1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:11.500]  There is a business over here that's got a large parrot.
[1:23:11.500 --> 1:23:13.340]  I don't know if you can see that or not.
[1:23:13.340 --> 1:23:16.660]  And I said, this is a perfect picture of what the media is doing.
[1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:20.860]  They're actually just parroting the talking points of the Obama administration.
[1:23:20.860 --> 1:23:25.700]  I think we look at this, we need to understand there's a difference between motivation and
[1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:27.300]  between method.
[1:23:27.300 --> 1:23:32.140]  What this guy did is independent of how he was motivated and that's the key thing.
[1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:34.940]  He's been preparing for this for a very long time.
[1:23:34.940 --> 1:23:38.340]  His motivations as I look at it, he's an incredible narcissist.
[1:23:38.340 --> 1:23:43.500]  He would seek out jobs in media when he wasn't interested at all in reporting any facts.
[1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:46.140]  Just was about him getting in front of the camera.
[1:23:46.140 --> 1:23:51.900]  He creates the social media account a month or so before he does the actual shooting and
[1:23:51.900 --> 1:23:54.900]  he starts telling people about himself, what he's going to do.
[1:23:54.900 --> 1:24:00.300]  He sends out his massive 23 page manifesto of what he's doing.
[1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:01.780]  It's all about him.
[1:24:01.780 --> 1:24:04.180]  But of course, there's also the racism aspect.
[1:24:04.180 --> 1:24:10.460]  He's got a history, a work history, where he was kicked out.
[1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:13.900]  Every time something went wrong, he picked a fight with people and said it was because
[1:24:13.900 --> 1:24:17.180]  of his race, because he was a homosexual.
[1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:21.300]  He had this chip on his shoulder and the Obama administration has said that.
[1:24:21.300 --> 1:24:24.260]  So are we going to charge Obama with this crime?
[1:24:24.260 --> 1:24:29.180]  We just had a purge of all Confederate history saying that it was Jefferson Davis who had
[1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:30.980]  motivated the Charleston shooter.
[1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:34.220]  Not about our current setting president pushing this race war.
[1:24:34.220 --> 1:24:38.860]  I put up a video and I titled it Obama's first drone strike in the race war.
[1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:42.300]  That's what this is about, creating these drones out there, telling them that they're
[1:24:42.300 --> 1:24:44.260]  justified in doing this.
[1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:49.580]  And if anything, the media is just as culpable in this, the idea that everybody wants to
[1:24:49.580 --> 1:24:52.340]  get their 15 minutes of fame.
[1:24:52.340 --> 1:24:54.500]  That is a key motivating factor.
[1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:56.900]  The motives behind this are what's going to drive it.
[1:24:56.900 --> 1:24:59.940]  I haven't been able to find anything in terms of SSRI.
[1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:04.940]  I think it was simply drinking the Obama Kool-Aid and that's something that's been fed to people
[1:25:04.940 --> 1:25:05.940]  all over this country.
[1:25:05.940 --> 1:25:09.380]  Now we've seen somebody act on it for the first time.
[1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:15.940]  The headline and the video report, you filed Obama's first domestic drone strike.
[1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:21.260]  This is an Obama bot gone off the rails and reading his manifesto, he was talking about
[1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:23.580]  black people are out to get him too.
[1:25:23.580 --> 1:25:26.580]  So he just looks like a crazy spoiled brat baby.
[1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:30.060]  Yeah, he didn't trust anybody when he had these lawsuits.
[1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:33.740]  He wanted a jury composed solely of black women.
[1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:38.460]  He said black men beat him up because he was gay and he had an issue with white women.
[1:25:38.460 --> 1:25:43.380]  He didn't mention white men, but basically he breaks everybody into categories.
[1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:46.740]  He's absorbed all of the programming, all of the lessons.
[1:25:46.740 --> 1:25:47.740]  Which is ridiculous.
[1:25:47.740 --> 1:25:52.980]  I mean, women vary person to person more than they quote race to race and men vary.
[1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:57.500]  It's just so mindless where you just look at a group and this is how they're going to
[1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:58.500]  operate.
[1:25:58.500 --> 1:25:59.900]  This is how they're going to act.
[1:25:59.900 --> 1:26:05.420]  We've also seen in his complaints the kind of hyper political correctness combined with
[1:26:05.420 --> 1:26:07.940]  racism, a fear of racism, a chip on the shoulder.
[1:26:07.940 --> 1:26:12.500]  I wonder if the EOC is going to go ahead with a complaint against the white reporter that's
[1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:13.500]  dead.
[1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:18.580]  Maybe they'll lynch your dead body or something because I don't think they've ever seen a
[1:26:18.580 --> 1:26:21.620]  harassment claim they didn't follow that was politically correct.
[1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:24.020]  What an unconstitutional organization.
[1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:27.460]  They actually, these cases happened a couple of years ago.
[1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:30.940]  I think the first one in a Florida studio was like three years ago.
[1:26:30.940 --> 1:26:32.460]  The second one with this particular thing.
[1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:33.460]  Sure.
[1:26:33.460 --> 1:26:35.700]  He just did say on the tweet that he'd filed stuff on her.
[1:26:35.700 --> 1:26:40.020]  He said he'd heard, she'd said racist things, so the complaints were filed on her.
[1:26:40.020 --> 1:26:43.980]  And I wonder if they're going to, you know, maybe arrest her corpse at the funeral.
[1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:44.980]  Exactly.
[1:26:44.980 --> 1:26:49.220]  Well, those cases were totally thrown out by the EOC.
[1:26:49.220 --> 1:26:52.860]  As I was saying, you know, with his hyper political correctness, he even in one of the complaints
[1:26:52.860 --> 1:26:57.700]  Alex was talking about a watermelon that kept appearing and disappearing around the office.
[1:26:57.700 --> 1:26:59.900]  He thought that was a sign of harassment.
[1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:03.540]  That's the kind of over the top paranoia, political correctness.
[1:27:03.540 --> 1:27:06.300]  Watermelons all over the place in the South.
[1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:07.820]  Everybody eats watermelon.
[1:27:07.820 --> 1:27:10.620]  But it's like the brown bag scenario.
[1:27:10.620 --> 1:27:12.300]  Remember that we've talked about brown bag.
[1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:13.300]  That's racism.
[1:27:13.300 --> 1:27:14.300]  Well, here it is.
[1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:15.300]  You know, watermelon.
[1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:16.300]  I see a watermelon.
[1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:17.300]  That's racist.
[1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:19.740]  That's being pushed, that's his motivation.
[1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:23.900]  That's what's constantly being pushed by the press, by the Democrats, by the political
[1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:24.900]  gain.
[1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:26.300]  When you push that, you get a race for it.
[1:27:26.300 --> 1:27:27.860]  They very well know that.
[1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:29.300]  That's what they want.
[1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:30.780]  And that's the motivation for this.
[1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:34.100]  He planned this for so long, he could have used any kind of weapon.
[1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:37.700]  And again, we need to point out to everybody that he bought this in retail.
[1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:42.100]  So even though Terry McCollough, who's nothing but a Democrat campaign manager who's become
[1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:46.300]  governor and he's now campaigning for gun control, he's pushing for universal background
[1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:50.420]  checks, which would put background checks on private sales, on gun sales.
[1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:54.040]  But this gun was bought in a store at retail.
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:55.860]  So he went through all the background checks.
[1:27:55.860 --> 1:27:59.300]  It's absolutely irrelevant to what's going on here.
[1:27:59.300 --> 1:28:02.740]  Now, I know you're going to be covering some of the press conferences and things that are
[1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:05.460]  coming up.
[1:28:05.460 --> 1:28:09.700]  You're at a particular plaza that's just off the highway.
[1:28:09.700 --> 1:28:14.020]  It's about 10, 15 miles outside of Manetta.
[1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:17.860]  You're geographically where you're located for folks in Virginia that may want to come
[1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.860]  and be citizen journalists as well.
[1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:25.940]  And then for TV viewers pan around, is the new center across the street that I see there,
[1:28:25.940 --> 1:28:29.220]  that's where the shooting took place on that balcony?
[1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:33.900]  Across the street, across the street over here, Alex, is where the shooting took place.
[1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:36.820]  That's why they have the police here and they've got that roped off as a crime scene.
[1:28:36.820 --> 1:28:38.620]  They're not letting anybody into that area.
[1:28:38.620 --> 1:28:42.900]  So all the press that's come here is camped out on the opposite side of the road.
[1:28:42.900 --> 1:28:43.900]  Sure.
[1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:48.420]  And they also took footage from the BBC that they caught the police chasing the guy and
[1:28:48.420 --> 1:28:49.420]  him crashing.
[1:28:49.420 --> 1:28:51.420]  Why would they take the BBC's footage?
[1:28:51.420 --> 1:28:52.980]  Well, that's interesting.
[1:28:52.980 --> 1:28:53.980]  I don't know.
[1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:54.980]  Yeah.
[1:28:54.980 --> 1:28:58.420]  You know, there's a hyper paranoia by our government.
[1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:00.180]  They want to keep everything secret.
[1:29:00.180 --> 1:29:04.300]  And all that does is feed people's concerns that there's some kind of a conspiracy going
[1:29:04.300 --> 1:29:08.580]  on, that they're actually up to something, and of course, often they are.
[1:29:08.580 --> 1:29:15.460]  But this kind of hyper paranoia by the government that matches this kind of hyper-racism, hyper-political
[1:29:15.460 --> 1:29:17.100]  correctness that we're seeing everywhere.
[1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:20.380]  They want to shut everything down, censor everything, take everybody's footage.
[1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:21.380]  Sure.
[1:29:21.380 --> 1:29:23.820]  I didn't know that they'd confiscated BBC's footage of the chase.
[1:29:23.820 --> 1:29:26.980]  Yes, BBC's followed a formal complaint.
[1:29:26.980 --> 1:29:29.620]  I'm going to go to break Steve Quill's coming up.
[1:29:29.620 --> 1:29:34.100]  This is a protest and this is a riot.
[1:29:34.100 --> 1:29:41.100]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[1:29:41.100 --> 1:29:48.260]  Infowars.com.
[1:29:48.260 --> 1:29:49.540]  We're on the march.
[1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:51.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:51.940 --> 1:29:58.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.780 --> 1:30:02.700]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter
[1:30:02.700 --> 1:30:04.500]  Vester Lee Flanagan.
[1:30:04.500 --> 1:30:09.020]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use
[1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:10.020]  a teleprompter.
[1:30:10.020 --> 1:30:14.060]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[1:30:14.060 --> 1:30:17.820]  In the report his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Shirts County
[1:30:17.820 --> 1:30:20.860]  policy but of standard journalistic ethics.
[1:30:20.860 --> 1:30:24.580]  Journalists and particularly reporters who appear on television must abide by a different
[1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:25.580]  standard.
[1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:28.620]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:31.660]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun related incidents around
[1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:35.300]  this country warfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[1:30:35.300 --> 1:30:39.380]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes
[1:30:39.380 --> 1:30:42.660]  the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan show.
[1:30:42.660 --> 1:30:43.660]  How about Prozac?
[1:30:43.660 --> 1:30:45.780]  You know the number, oh that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[1:30:45.780 --> 1:30:50.460]  Don't want to talk about the U.S. number one cause of death is suicide now because they
[1:30:50.460 --> 1:30:53.380]  give people suicide mass murder pills.
[1:30:53.380 --> 1:30:56.220]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.

[1:32:35.420 --> 1:32:36.420]  of brain force.
[1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:39.580]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:42.980]  Staring at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:45.100]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[1:32:45.100 --> 1:32:48.340]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that
[1:32:48.340 --> 1:32:49.340]  do it clean.

[1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:10.220]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until
[1:33:10.220 --> 1:33:11.220]  dawn.
[1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:14.380]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied
[1:33:14.380 --> 1:33:15.380]  zone.
[1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.260]  The chair is against the wall.
[1:33:17.260 --> 1:33:24.260]  John has a long mustache, John has a long mustache, it's 12 o'clock American, another
[1:33:24.260 --> 1:33:30.140]  day closer to victory and for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your
[1:33:30.140 --> 1:33:31.140]  song.
[1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:39.660]  But they took a lot of people away, people that they thought were going to make trouble
[1:33:39.660 --> 1:33:43.740]  for them, people that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:44.740]  Where?
[1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:47.740]  We had education camps that they call it.
[1:33:47.740 --> 1:33:50.620]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[1:33:50.620 --> 1:33:55.060]  to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[1:33:55.060 --> 1:34:04.620]  I have decided we really need camps for adults and we need the American camps that you all
[1:34:04.620 --> 1:34:05.620]  run.
[1:34:05.620 --> 1:34:06.620]  I mean, really.
[1:34:06.620 --> 1:34:09.940]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[1:34:09.940 --> 1:34:13.980]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the Army almost overnight had built
[1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:14.980]  a family center.
[1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:15.980]  Come on.
[1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:16.980]  I'm a sorry citizen.
[1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:18.980]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[1:34:18.980 --> 1:34:21.980]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[1:34:21.980 --> 1:34:25.980]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[1:34:25.980 --> 1:34:29.700]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability
[1:34:29.700 --> 1:34:36.500]  and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[1:34:36.500 --> 1:34:41.260]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal
[1:34:41.260 --> 1:34:44.260]  to the United States.
[1:34:44.260 --> 1:34:49.260]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[1:34:49.260 --> 1:34:55.260]  It's all we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[1:34:55.260 --> 1:35:00.260]  We're building a domestic Army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[1:35:00.260 --> 1:35:04.260]  Put your gun down, really?
[1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:09.260]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[1:35:09.260 --> 1:35:11.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:35:11.260 --> 1:35:16.260]  Are you some kind of a Constitutionist?
[1:35:16.260 --> 1:35:29.260]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:35:29.260 --> 1:35:34.260]  And we're watching a globalist economic culture war.
[1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:40.260]  Whereas in the fictional Red Dawn, they're watching tanks basically attack the U.S. military
[1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:45.260]  and take over the police department and kill the local government leaders and our collaborators.
[1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:49.260]  We're watching our society, our culture dismantled.
[1:35:49.260 --> 1:35:53.260]  We're watching our energy system shut down, our jobs shipped overseas, our families attacked,
[1:35:53.260 --> 1:35:55.260]  our food and water poisoned.
[1:35:55.260 --> 1:35:59.260]  Steve Quell joins us in about five minutes for the balance of the broadcast.
[1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:05.260]  The original prepper, the original survivalist, been a survivalist for over 30 years,
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:08.260]  been on air 25 years.
[1:36:08.260 --> 1:36:12.260]  I used to hear him 25 years ago and I thought he was sincere,
[1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:15.260]  but I thought about 80% of what he was saying was true.
[1:36:15.260 --> 1:36:19.260]  And now I think about 95% of it's accurate.
[1:36:19.260 --> 1:36:22.260]  But who knows, the next five, maybe I'll be proven wrong.
[1:36:22.260 --> 1:36:27.260]  I mean, it's just the stuff he used to say, he's shown it's so wild and now it's every day.
[1:36:27.260 --> 1:36:33.260]  And really the guy, more than anybody, I've got to say, who said stuff first.
[1:36:33.260 --> 1:36:36.260]  I mean, I had him on as a guest 20 years ago and I respected him.
[1:36:36.260 --> 1:36:40.260]  I just, I argued with him and disagreed with him on a lot of stuff and he'd get frustrated
[1:36:40.260 --> 1:36:43.260]  and just say, fine, you'll see.
[1:36:43.260 --> 1:36:46.260]  So we're going to be talking to him about everything, you know, that's going on.
[1:36:46.260 --> 1:36:50.260]  Steve Quell.com, he hosts the Q-Files, very popular, one of the most popular online shows.
[1:36:50.260 --> 1:36:55.260]  He's been syndicated before and of course he, probably the most popular other than myself
[1:36:55.260 --> 1:36:58.260]  or others, guest, he's in the top three or four top guests on coast to coast.
[1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:01.260]  I've been told with George Norrie.
[1:37:01.260 --> 1:37:02.260]  So he joins us.
[1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:04.260]  We appreciate him joining us here in a minute.
[1:37:04.260 --> 1:37:09.260]  I wanted to go back to Joe Biggs and parental discretion is advised while he's talking.
[1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:13.260]  I'm going to show what was censored yesterday, Drudge link to the video.
[1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:20.260]  Other media did show it, but the first person shooter, shooting the reporter and the cameraman,
[1:37:20.260 --> 1:37:22.260]  there's no blood.
[1:37:22.260 --> 1:37:26.260]  He does shoot her three times it looks like and she runs in high heels.
[1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:30.260]  And a lot of folks said they don't believe that they think it's fake.
[1:37:30.260 --> 1:37:32.260]  Well, we know some stuff's been staged.
[1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:34.260]  We know much of Sandy Hook isn't as they say.
[1:37:34.260 --> 1:37:38.260]  We know the Aurora shooting is staged, but I've shot wild boar.
[1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:39.260]  I've shot elk.
[1:37:39.260 --> 1:37:40.260]  I've shot whitetail.
[1:37:40.260 --> 1:37:47.260]  I've shot mule and sometimes you shoot one with a seven mil mag and they fall right there.
[1:37:47.260 --> 1:37:51.260]  Sometimes you shoot a little whitetail with 30 odd six and they run 500 yards.
[1:37:51.260 --> 1:37:55.260]  Even though their heart is blown in half.
[1:37:55.260 --> 1:37:58.260]  Joe, you know, it's in the news they covered.
[1:37:58.260 --> 1:38:02.260]  You've had quite a few kills in the army yourself and been blown up a few times yourself.
[1:38:02.260 --> 1:38:03.260]  You've had experience with this.
[1:38:03.260 --> 1:38:05.260]  It looks like a first person shoot them up.
[1:38:05.260 --> 1:38:10.260]  I don't think the White House is beyond doing this, but the narrative would be he'd be tea party or something.
[1:38:10.260 --> 1:38:12.260]  And they'd have been on the ground ready.
[1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:16.260]  Like we saw Bloomberg send an email the night before saying get ready.
[1:38:16.260 --> 1:38:17.260]  Big things about to happen.
[1:38:17.260 --> 1:38:19.260]  That was in mainstream news.
[1:38:19.260 --> 1:38:21.260]  They had the porta potties being delivered.
[1:38:21.260 --> 1:38:23.260]  They were already with PR at Sandy Hook.
[1:38:23.260 --> 1:38:27.260]  The school had been closed before, you know, the evidence goes on and on that something's not right.
[1:38:27.260 --> 1:38:30.260]  We don't know exactly what, but even Rob do his uncle.
[1:38:30.260 --> 1:38:35.260]  It's a retired FBI agent has gone there and says he's never seen anything like it and looks like a cover up.
[1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:43.260]  So yeah, people are on the case, but watching that video that will roll while you're talking of him shooting her.
[1:38:43.260 --> 1:38:48.260]  We're not going to put it back on YouTube because we don't want to get censored again, but my own show, I can roll it.
[1:38:48.260 --> 1:38:52.260]  Why do you think they don't want this being seen a and then B?
[1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:54.260]  Does it look real to you?
[1:38:54.260 --> 1:38:56.260]  Well, I mean, it's interesting.
[1:38:56.260 --> 1:39:00.260]  You know, when I saw the gun go up, I could automatically tell, I mean, to me, it looks like a Glock.
[1:39:00.260 --> 1:39:02.260]  I think that's it's come out now that is a Glock.
[1:39:02.260 --> 1:39:03.260]  I own a Glock.
[1:39:03.260 --> 1:39:04.260]  I know what they look like.
[1:39:04.260 --> 1:39:09.260]  But you gotta, for me, I'm not willing to jump into the whole.
[1:39:09.260 --> 1:39:12.260]  It's a stage event pool yet because there's still more to go.
[1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:15.260]  I'm so I still have an opportunity to go over here and see and look for myself.
[1:39:15.260 --> 1:39:17.260]  So until then, I'm not ready to go to that.
[1:39:17.260 --> 1:39:23.260]  I really think this was a disturbed man who just went over the line and this made a huge horrible bad decision.
[1:39:23.260 --> 1:39:25.260]  Angry racist man.
[1:39:25.260 --> 1:39:27.260]  And the fact of being shot.
[1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:30.260]  Yeah, you could be shot and still run away for a little bit.
[1:39:30.260 --> 1:39:31.260]  You're still going to have some momentum.
[1:39:31.260 --> 1:39:32.260]  You're going to be scared.
[1:39:32.260 --> 1:39:33.260]  Your adrenaline is going to pump.
[1:39:33.260 --> 1:39:35.260]  You can see that she saw that had that look in her eye.
[1:39:35.260 --> 1:39:39.260]  That's going to automatically put that adrenaline rush into your body.
[1:39:39.260 --> 1:39:43.260]  And her automatic thing was to start turning anyways as she got hit.
[1:39:43.260 --> 1:39:47.260]  So she could use that momentum as she turned to essentially push forward.
[1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:49.260]  And then we don't know how far she went.
[1:39:49.260 --> 1:39:51.260]  We don't know if she took five steps, 10 steps, 20 steps.
[1:39:51.260 --> 1:39:53.260]  But I'm sure she eventually fell over.
[1:39:53.260 --> 1:39:55.260]  So you can see that she jerks.
[1:39:55.260 --> 1:39:57.260]  He shoots her in the abdomen first.
[1:39:57.260 --> 1:39:59.260]  You watch the footage and that's my experience.
[1:39:59.260 --> 1:40:00.260]  I think it's real.
[1:40:00.260 --> 1:40:03.260]  I was just throwing out that we're being criticized for saying it's real.
[1:40:03.260 --> 1:40:05.260]  Not everything is fake.
[1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:06.260]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:40:06.260 --> 1:40:08.260]  There's a lot more that needs to be seen.
[1:40:08.260 --> 1:40:10.260]  There's a lot more that needs to go on.
[1:40:10.260 --> 1:40:15.260]  What I do think is happening is I think a senseless violent or senseless act of violence
[1:40:15.260 --> 1:40:19.260]  happened by a lone person who made a stupid decision, who was a horrible person.
[1:40:19.260 --> 1:40:29.260]  And now the mainstream media is using this to push their anti-gun movement into the public's eyes.
[1:40:29.260 --> 1:40:30.260]  That's what's going on.
[1:40:30.260 --> 1:40:34.260]  That's a horrendous act that's happening besides the two people being murdered.
[1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:38.260]  The fact that these people over here behind me are going to use this situation,
[1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:41.260]  this scenario, and push their anti-gun stuff.
[1:40:41.260 --> 1:40:47.260]  So law abiding citizens all across this country will no longer be able to defend themselves.
[1:40:47.260 --> 1:40:53.260]  That is the atrocity happening here in Manetta, Virginia at the Bridgewater Plaza, Alex.
[1:40:53.260 --> 1:40:56.260]  Joe Biggs, thank you so much.
[1:40:56.260 --> 1:40:59.260]  I know you're filing a lot of other reports for the nightly news tonight at 7 o'clock Central.
[1:40:59.260 --> 1:41:02.260]  You're going to be asking real questions at the press conferences.
[1:41:02.260 --> 1:41:05.260]  You've done this at a lot of other big press conferences and made national news,
[1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:09.260]  getting real questions out there. So great job to you and David Knight.
[1:41:09.260 --> 1:41:11.260]  Give them hell, my friend.
[1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:13.260]  We'll do it. Thank you, Alex.
[1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:15.260]  All right. They're out there standing up for the Second Amendment.
[1:41:15.260 --> 1:41:19.260]  And of course, you notice we're not blaming black people for this.
[1:41:19.260 --> 1:41:25.260]  Just like the senseless evil killing of nine black people was absolutely disgusting in Charleston.
[1:41:25.260 --> 1:41:31.260]  It is mentally ill people whacked out of their minds, stirred up by the media.
[1:41:31.260 --> 1:41:37.260]  But we are going to go with the angle, ban the rainbow flag because he had a rainbow flag at his house.
[1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:40.260]  And so he did this for gay rights.
[1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:44.260]  So all people that are gay, it's your fault.
[1:41:44.260 --> 1:41:46.260]  I'm not actually saying that.
[1:41:46.260 --> 1:41:48.260]  But see how that feels?
[1:41:48.260 --> 1:41:51.260]  To have someone blame you for what somebody else does, it's ridiculous.
[1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:54.260]  Steve Quell is joining us here in just one moment.
[1:41:54.260 --> 1:41:57.260]  I want to remind people that the special will end tomorrow.
[1:41:57.260 --> 1:42:01.260]  Friday is the last day.
[1:42:01.260 --> 1:42:07.260]  We are selling the highest quality colloidal silver that is just so amazing on so many fronts.
[1:42:07.260 --> 1:42:12.260]  Read the scientific info. See the videos that break it down at infowarslife.com.
[1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:15.260]  Buy two bottles at the regular price.
[1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:19.260]  We didn't jack the price up and then say buy two and get two free at these firework places.
[1:42:19.260 --> 1:42:23.260]  You know, other folks, it's the regular discounted price.
[1:42:23.260 --> 1:42:27.260]  Buy two bottles, get two free.
[1:42:27.260 --> 1:42:33.260]  And your purchase helps find the operation so I can send reporters to these key events.
[1:42:33.260 --> 1:42:35.260]  And hopefully wake people up with our reportage.
[1:42:35.260 --> 1:42:37.260]  Buy two bottles, get two free.
[1:42:37.260 --> 1:42:40.260]  Or buy one bottle, get 30% off.

[1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:06.260]  If you'd rather mail something to us.

[1:43:20.260 --> 1:43:26.260]  And we have Super Mill Vitality, Prostate Guard, Super High Quality, Oil of Oregano from the Mediterranean.
[1:43:26.260 --> 1:43:31.260]  The highest quality and a lot of other products at infowarslife.com.

[1:43:38.260 --> 1:43:40.260]  Is Knockout back in stock? I thought that was sold out. Scroll down.
[1:43:40.260 --> 1:43:42.260]  Oh, it is sold out, darn.
[1:43:42.260 --> 1:43:46.260]  Because I've run out of bottle of that only. I took one bottle home and just ran out last night.
[1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:50.260]  The last couple of months used it all. I don't use it every night, but I do a lot.
[1:43:50.260 --> 1:43:55.260]  And I am out myself and they were looking around yesterday. There is none in the office even.
[1:43:55.260 --> 1:44:00.260]  Darn it. I misread that. That is a super big bummer.
[1:44:00.260 --> 1:44:04.260]  But that is all available at infowarslife.com.
[1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:06.260]  Now, shifting gears.
[1:44:06.260 --> 1:44:10.260]  We are joined by Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[1:44:10.260 --> 1:44:18.260]  The first guy 20 years ago who was writing bestselling books about them taking human baby fetus brains
[1:44:18.260 --> 1:44:22.260]  and putting them in dogs, cats, cockroaches, mice.
[1:44:22.260 --> 1:44:29.260]  The first guy I heard talk about geoengineering, terraforming, manipulating the weather.
[1:44:29.260 --> 1:44:33.260]  The first guy I heard talk about so many issues.
[1:44:33.260 --> 1:44:42.260]  I heard him was like seven, eight years ago say they are doing the census to track where you live to mark your house for drone strikes.
[1:44:42.260 --> 1:44:46.260]  And then now they admitted that the military has been giving all that data. They are now arming drones.
[1:44:46.260 --> 1:44:50.260]  So it is easy to make fun of him, but I got to tell you, he is willing to really say what he thinks.
[1:44:50.260 --> 1:44:53.260]  And so much of what he said has turned out to be true.
[1:44:53.260 --> 1:44:57.260]  SteveQuayle.com, host of the Q-Files, joins us.
[1:44:57.260 --> 1:45:01.260]  Steve, thank you for coming on. I'm not even going to throw out a bunch of issues.
[1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:07.260]  I got a bunch of questions for you, but front and center, you've got the floor here for the balance of the hour, the next 15 minutes.
[1:45:07.260 --> 1:45:14.260]  What do you want to say about the world meltdown of the markets, about the shooting, about what is this distracting us from?
[1:45:14.260 --> 1:45:20.260]  Donald Trump. Where is it all? ISIS spreading all over the world. Steve Quayle.
[1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:28.260]  Well, Alex, thank you and good afternoon to all Info warriors all around the world. But what's going on right now is pretty critical.
[1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:36.260]  First of all, I think the idea that we're in full motion gun control and confiscation.
[1:45:36.260 --> 1:45:43.260]  Alex, when we signed on the United States under Obama signed under the Small Arms Convention Treaty,
[1:45:43.260 --> 1:45:54.260]  what most people fail to understand is all of the NATO troops that are here, all of the Russian, Chinese are here to basically do two things.
[1:45:54.260 --> 1:45:59.260]  To assert their domination control of the United States and also to disarm.
[1:45:59.260 --> 1:46:03.260]  I was told years ago, went on the radio, may have said it on your show,
[1:46:03.260 --> 1:46:13.260]  but basically part of the agreement between US government and China to continue buying our debt was that we would agree to, excuse me,
[1:46:13.260 --> 1:46:22.260]  allow the disarmament of the entire American citizenry. You remember the flak I got? Well, there are 300 million guns in the United States, blah, blah, blah.
[1:46:22.260 --> 1:46:28.260]  But what most people don't understand is during the census, and you just brought that up in your opening to me,
[1:46:28.260 --> 1:46:37.260]  is that everybody who was a known gun owner was GPS'd. Most people didn't understand the term yard farming in those days.
[1:46:37.260 --> 1:46:45.260]  It was Greg Evenson who brought that up. I went on record yard farming means literally using drone strikes against American citizens.
[1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:51.260]  So many people thought that was outlandish. So many people thought that I'd gone over the edge.
[1:46:51.260 --> 1:47:02.260]  And that basically I was a fear porn purveyor, I was a whatever, Armageddonite. But all those things now are coming to be into the focus to prove that that's really the plan.
[1:47:02.260 --> 1:47:10.260]  With the advent of all the forest fires in the Northwest. This was part of the plan also that, and what is his name?
[1:47:10.260 --> 1:47:22.260]  And, you know, Anatoly Golitsyn wrote about in two of his books, which basically are going right by the script, you know, and one of them was New Lies for Old and the Perestroika Deception.
[1:47:22.260 --> 1:47:29.260]  The bottom line in both that was the Russians faked their own demise to get investment in the West and still having the plan.
[1:47:29.260 --> 1:47:35.260]  Now listen, I'm going to quote somebody that I used to quote all the time in the first 10 years that I was on talk radio.
[1:47:35.260 --> 1:47:43.260]  My guy named, I think it was Boris Mann Uilski. And he was a professor at the London School of Political Warfare in Moscow.
[1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:49.260]  So many people don't get the big picture. I pray by the grace of God I can give them the big picture.
[1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:56.260]  The bourgeois will have to be put to sleep. So shall we begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record.
[1:47:56.260 --> 1:48:01.260]  The capitalist country, stupid and decadent, will rejoice to cooperate in their own discretion.
[1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:10.260]  They will leap at another chance to be friends. So we've all heard that Lenin said that, you know, the West will sell the East, the Roeper, which to hang themselves.
[1:48:10.260 --> 1:48:19.260]  But I think what's happening now is in order to understand the new world order, people must get the basic. It's simply this.
[1:48:19.260 --> 1:48:26.260]  All borders, nationalities, cultures and language must basically be done away with.
[1:48:26.260 --> 1:48:32.260]  The elite literally have no problem talking about the death of six billion people.
[1:48:32.260 --> 1:48:40.260]  And that's why I just interrupt. They do things that are unconstitutional, that are unpopular and aren't even law, because they say they've got the international treaties.
[1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:48.260]  And you mentioned this. I want to throw this out. This is out of Bloomberg News. China sells US treasuries to support their Yuan.
[1:48:48.260 --> 1:48:59.260]  That is an unprecedented move. So there's also some in-fighting, but it's globalist multinationals controlling Russia, controlling China, controlling the US, playing us off against each other.
[1:48:59.260 --> 1:49:01.260]  But that's the unseen hand, correct, Steve?
[1:49:01.260 --> 1:49:12.260]  Absolutely. And the thing is, is that even in the famous statement, you know, that some argue over on the three-year-eight rural wars, which would be fomented.
[1:49:12.260 --> 1:49:18.260]  Obviously, we're talking about Mazzini's letter. That is absolutely Albert Pike.
[1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:24.260]  Whether you want to believe it or not, not you, Alex, but whether the people want to believe it or not, wars don't just happen.
[1:49:24.260 --> 1:49:31.260]  They're stage two happen. And one of the critical points that I must get out on your show today, and again, thank you for letting me back on.
[1:49:31.260 --> 1:49:40.260]  I apologize to you. Yesterday was a screw-up, a mix-up, and someone I told Niko was intentionally screwing with my email and our ability to contact each other.
[1:49:40.260 --> 1:49:44.260]  But that just tells me that the timeframe has moved way up.
[1:49:44.260 --> 1:49:51.260]  I got an email before going on the air tonight that basically said, or that's afternoon, excuse me, I'm used to doing late night talk radio,
[1:49:51.260 --> 1:50:03.260]  is that from a National Guard guy who basically said, we're worried that we're going to be shipped overseas and that all the foreign troops that have been training here are going to be given the go ahead.
[1:50:03.260 --> 1:50:16.260]  Now, whether people want to admit it or not, one of the purposes of whether they're a false flag, real shooting, MK Ultra, mind-control-y, disenfranchised video game player,
[1:50:16.260 --> 1:50:25.260]  most of these trained killers have multiple identities. And you and I have talked about mind-control, MK Ultra, until we're blue in the face,
[1:50:25.260 --> 1:50:28.260]  but evidently, most people still don't get it.
[1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:36.260]  Remember, it's not what really happens that counts. It's what's made to look like what they want to happen that counts.
[1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:43.260]  So again, the mass media, and again, to go on record, I believe they are nothing more than vomit brokers.
[1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:58.260]  You're seeing that play out daily.
[1:51:13.260 --> 1:51:24.260]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources. Is it time to convert paper 401Ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet? Get our 10 Reasons book free. Call 800-686-2237.

[1:53:02.260 --> 1:53:04.260]  It's those nasty fish oil pills I've been taking.
[1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:07.260]  Why won't you just switch to neutral gold fish oil like I did?
[1:53:07.260 --> 1:53:09.260]  It's fish oil. What's the difference?
[1:53:09.260 --> 1:53:14.260]  Well, my neutral gold fish oil is sourced and manufactured right here in the USA.
[1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:16.260]  What's so special about that? Aren't they all?
[1:53:16.260 --> 1:53:23.260]  Are you kidding? Of course not. Only neutral gold fish oil is 100% USA made, which is why it's so fresh.
[1:53:23.260 --> 1:53:29.260]  100% product of USA and fresh? I like the sound of that. So no more fish burps?
[1:53:29.260 --> 1:53:38.260]  No more fish burps. And that's not all. If you go to www.fishoil.vest and enter my fish oil, you can save $5 like I did.
[1:53:38.260 --> 1:53:40.260]  That won't be necessary. We can just share your bottle.
[1:53:40.260 --> 1:53:45.260]  Nice try. Get your own at www.fishoil.vest.
[1:53:45.260 --> 1:53:46.260]  Sorry.
[1:53:46.260 --> 1:54:15.260]  Get rid of those fish burps for good. Go to neutral gold's USA made fish oil products by going to www.fishoil.vest and get $5 off by entering my fish oil at checkout.
[1:54:15.260 --> 1:54:27.260]  I started getting politically involved, a little bit more savvy. I was like a mainline libertarian until about 93, 94.
[1:54:27.260 --> 1:54:35.260]  I was in college then. And I remember hearing, you know, they got Russian troops, they got Chinese troops, they're training them.
[1:54:35.260 --> 1:54:42.260]  And I think these old-timers, mainly military vats, are crazy. I wasn't disliking military vats. I just thought they were paranoid.
[1:54:42.260 --> 1:54:48.260]  And then they'd have black helicopter drills all over Texas and blowing up buildings, people having heart attacks.
[1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:57.260]  Folks would cover it and they'd get death threats. And I got on air and I'd cover it and there'd be military in plain clothes threatening me in the parking lot.
[1:54:57.260 --> 1:55:02.260]  Like, you better watch it, buddy, and it'd be military guys in plain clothes.
[1:55:02.260 --> 1:55:08.260]  And then I had people pull guns on me and just everything else just because I was covering it. I was like, wow, this whole thing's real.
[1:55:08.260 --> 1:55:16.260]  Then I became a source for people to be able to get info out. I started getting, you name it, NSA stuff, just crazy.
[1:55:16.260 --> 1:55:27.260]  I mean, I was being educated by my audience. And then there's Steve Quayle going, they're training Russian troops at this base outside Denver and this base outside Colorado Springs.
[1:55:27.260 --> 1:55:32.260]  And they're training them under secret treaties for gun confiscation. I'm like, that's just can't be true.
[1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:38.260]  And then now two years ago and last year it comes out in the Denver Post, it comes out in AP, we'll put them on screen.
[1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:42.260]  Russian troops trained to fight domestic terrorists in America.
[1:55:42.260 --> 1:55:47.260]  And you're like, but we're at war with Russia. Well, it's all part of these treaties. So they have to let the U.S. over there.
[1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:54.260]  They're over here. There's Fox News. And this is really going on. It's what the Chinese have been giving the Panama Canal.
[1:55:54.260 --> 1:56:01.260]  It's globalism. It's part of this balance of power. There's a lot of double crossing going on, major drills against the Chinese right now.
[1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:07.260]  What do you think in the four minutes we've got to break Steve Quayle, then we'll come back and you can flesh stuff out?
[1:56:07.260 --> 1:56:12.260]  How do you see the power structure set up in the world? And what do you think is going on right now?
[1:56:12.260 --> 1:56:25.260]  Because clearly there's the most action I've ever seen going on and massive amounts of foreign troops, even Washington Post admits, quote, Canadian and Mexican troops will be used during martial law for, quote, civil unrest.
[1:56:25.260 --> 1:56:28.260]  I mean, this is in the newspapers. What's going on?
[1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:39.260]  Well, obviously, Alex, it takes money to fund terrorism. Remember this, terrorism is all with someone's army. That's a statement that I stand by for the past 25 years.
[1:56:39.260 --> 1:56:49.260]  Talk radio. Let's take ISIS, one of the most well funded, well equipped, savvy international oil investors, currency manipulators, drug dealers, and all that.
[1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:58.260]  Who does that sound like? That sounds like a very sophisticated, intelligent, generated, and coordinated effort to destabilize the United States.
[1:56:58.260 --> 1:57:03.260]  When you and I started talking years ago that, listen, the globalists are serious.
[1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:11.260]  What's concerning to me the most is that the Americans don't get this, that they're already on the chopping block.
[1:57:11.260 --> 1:57:19.260]  And see, that's the critical issue here. Things have escalated. It is my intent to make it clear by the grace of God today.
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:27.260]  We are absolutely in that prepositioning of an attack by Russia and China.
[1:57:27.260 --> 1:57:33.260]  You brought up the amount of money that China is dumping to support the Yuan. You brought up all these things.
[1:57:33.260 --> 1:57:38.260]  The elites are scaring out of the U.S. at record rates. That's even in mainstream news.
[1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:43.260]  Absolutely. What happens? Well, you know, the old statement, rats abandon ship, you know?
[1:57:43.260 --> 1:57:48.260]  Well, they abandon it in their golf streams and in their, you know, two and three hundred million dollar yachts.
[1:57:48.260 --> 1:57:55.260]  But those in the know, obviously, go. Those who are, how should I say this, ignorant, stay.
[1:57:55.260 --> 1:57:58.260]  But this is what I'm not talking about. Anybody fleeing the country.
[1:57:58.260 --> 1:58:07.260]  But what I'm saying is, is that, you know, people have got to recognize this is, as you have so appropriately entitled that, this is the end game.
[1:58:07.260 --> 1:58:13.260]  Game in place. Everything up until the time, Alex, that you've been on radio, I've been on radio, others have been on radio warning.
[1:58:13.260 --> 1:58:20.260]  That's all passed now. We aren't approaching the cliff. We're over the cliff. It's just like an avalanche, OK?
[1:58:20.260 --> 1:58:26.260]  And what is terrifying is that people are going to get caught in the avalanche. I talk to so many investors.
[1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:31.260]  I talk to women. Stay there. I want to hear from your intel and your gut where you think the economy is going.
[1:58:31.260 --> 1:58:36.260]  How this is happening and how we can have a soft landing maybe and not have this happen.
[1:58:36.260 --> 1:58:39.260]  We know we've been holding it back. I mean, the people that love Liberty Worldwide.
[1:58:39.260 --> 1:58:43.260]  Good people in government, mainly corporations are good. We have good people everywhere.
[1:58:43.260 --> 1:59:09.260]  That's the only reason this hasn't come down yet. I just got chills. You can feel the evil right now.

[2:00:07.260 --> 2:00:16.260]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:16.260 --> 2:00:28.260]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:37.260]  Now, into hour number three, Steve Quayle is our guest. You can find his books and films at SteveQuayle.com.
[2:00:37.260 --> 2:00:46.260]  In fact, towards the end of the interview, we're going to talk about some of the really wild stuff he gets into studying ancient history, what the elites are suppressing in his research, and what he's discovered about these ancient legends.
[2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:52.260]  In fact, briefly, Steve, well, we'll get to that towards the end of the show, but it's very, very exciting.
[2:00:52.260 --> 2:01:08.260]  Now, Steve, going back to you right now, looking at the economy, looking at the world, looking at the huge stock market manipulations, huge military forces of the U.S., naval forces off the coast of China right now today, massive things happening.
[2:01:08.260 --> 2:01:13.260]  What point are we at now, and who are the power players? What's going on?
[2:01:13.260 --> 2:01:22.260]  Well, first of all, I believe there was a time when we could have made a difference. Now, I want to make sure everyone understands. I'm not saying abandon hope.
[2:01:22.260 --> 2:01:35.260]  The ye who enter here into the world of what's really going on, but understand your number one priority, your priority, your priority, your priority is to get prepared for they're going to crash the financial system.
[2:01:35.260 --> 2:01:45.260]  Alex, you have every monetary authority in the world on your show, you know, over the years. I've interviewed some really incredibly bright people.
[2:01:45.260 --> 2:01:53.260]  But now, when you have the 1200-point day down, we all knew Black Monday was coming. Good night. Who didn't warn about it pretty much?
[2:01:53.260 --> 2:02:05.260]  And the circuit breaker is kicking in 1200 times. The issue is that that was nothing more than a manipulated event to make a lot of people a lot of money.
[2:02:05.260 --> 2:02:13.260]  One question that's not being asked, Alex, is all the losers, we know who lost the money, but who are the gainers?
[2:02:13.260 --> 2:02:23.260]  I tell people, follow the money that still works. The gainers were the ones who manipulated. Find the short sellers on the Dow and you'll find out who did it.
[2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:35.260]  Obviously, Soros is being blamed for a large part of it, but it goes even beyond him. And what's happening now is that, look, it's just like there was a story written today by, I think, Chuck Baldwin.
[2:02:35.260 --> 2:02:47.260]  And he's quoting the Spokane County Sheriff Ozzy, what, at Nizovitch or something, showing hands on his hips standing on the top of the Don't Tread on Me or the Gas and Flag, the title, Daring to Tread.
[2:02:47.260 --> 2:02:53.260]  And he's making the statement, Alex, what you and I have warned about. You brought it out first on the Mayak Report.
[2:02:53.260 --> 2:03:01.260]  The sheriff and the least one of his deputies have verbalized opinions that constitutionalists are threats to the sheriff's office, the federal government, and to the country itself.
[2:03:01.260 --> 2:03:13.260]  He went so far as to compare constitutionalists with a Sunni Muslim terror group, ISIS. Now, again, I talked to years and years ago, you probably heard me say this, identify, vilify, nullify, destroy.
[2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:17.260]  Okay, we're in the identification. We're in the vilification.
[2:03:17.260 --> 2:03:29.260]  That's right. They've been secretly gearing up to come after us. Now they're getting ready to roll out, which is, I mean, you talk about giving the sheriff's deputies a mission that's not going to end too well. This is crazy.
[2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:37.260]  Yeah, and then, you know, they can't even quote where you live or whoever they're complaining about, you know, the point being is, is that this is the attitude.
[2:03:37.260 --> 2:03:43.260]  So here's what I want to make people understand. The American people still believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:47.260]  Those of us who still believe in the living God know there's a right and a wrong.
[2:03:47.260 --> 2:03:57.260]  But in the age of what I call relativistic takedown in the country, Alex, when we hear the head of Planned Parenthood saying they want 50 livers to experiment on,
[2:03:57.260 --> 2:04:09.260]  such, and you know, I write about ancient history, the practices even of burning babies in the arms of Molech are sacrificing babies to, for the Phoenicians to on their anchor ropes.
[2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:19.260]  That's what they did. The point is, is that we stood by as a nation knowing this stuff was going on. And now where we are, we're at a point where we didn't care about human life.
[2:04:19.260 --> 2:04:27.260]  And now everyone who didn't care, they're in the, the sites, you know, how many of those people that were aborted could have changed everything.
[2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:38.260]  So here's what I think and I'll be as blunt as I know how and as prescient as I can be. We are headed for a manufactured World War Three in order for the New World Order to bring on their missile.
[2:04:38.260 --> 2:04:45.260]  We call them the Antichrist, meaning in place of Jesus Christ. Jesus said, I came, you receive me, not another will come claiming to be me.
[2:04:45.260 --> 2:04:55.260]  Well, this is what the globalists, the Satanists, and, and you know, it took, it's now coming into your full focus to realize the supernatural evil.
[2:04:55.260 --> 2:04:58.260]  That's right. Stay there. Not a little break. Steve Quill.
[2:04:58.260 --> 2:05:04.260]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:09.260]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[2:05:09.260 --> 2:05:15.260]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report. In the report, his supervisor writes,
[2:05:15.260 --> 2:05:20.260]  This is a clear violation not only of shirts, county policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:24.260]  Journalists and particularly reporters who appear on television must abide by a different standard.
[2:05:24.260 --> 2:05:28.260]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[2:05:28.260 --> 2:05:35.260]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[2:05:35.260 --> 2:05:42.260]  Trump responded by saying the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan show.
[2:05:42.260 --> 2:05:45.260]  How about Prozac? You know the number, oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[2:05:45.260 --> 2:05:53.260]  Don't want to talk about the U.S. number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills.

[2:08:15.260 --> 2:08:19.260]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:24.260]  Here's what happens with social engineering.
[2:08:24.260 --> 2:08:30.260]  By successive approximation or incrementalism, we get conditioned to put up with more and more.
[2:08:30.260 --> 2:08:37.260]  Fluoride in the water, forced inoculations, GMO that sterilizes and kills many of the rodents they feed it to,
[2:08:37.260 --> 2:08:41.260]  that farmers won't give their farm animals because they die when they eat it.
[2:08:41.260 --> 2:08:43.260]  The honeybees are dying.
[2:08:43.260 --> 2:08:46.260]  90 plus percent of the nuclear reactors worldwide are leaking.
[2:08:46.260 --> 2:08:50.260]  It's not even news anymore. They're supposed to be shut down over 30 years.
[2:08:50.260 --> 2:08:52.260]  Most of them are almost 40 years old.
[2:08:52.260 --> 2:08:54.260]  They just don't care.
[2:08:54.260 --> 2:08:56.260]  They're geoengineering.
[2:08:56.260 --> 2:08:59.260]  They're telling us that you can't say father and mother.
[2:08:59.260 --> 2:09:02.260]  Public schools are banding on all over the country.
[2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:07.260]  New buildings put in communal bathrooms where you now walk into one and there's a woman in there.
[2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:10.260]  They go, oh, it's okay.
[2:09:10.260 --> 2:09:12.260]  I mean, we're just being messed with.
[2:09:12.260 --> 2:09:14.260]  We're being social engineered.
[2:09:14.260 --> 2:09:17.260]  Stinger missiles to al-Qaeda.
[2:09:17.260 --> 2:09:21.260]  Now the French news says they're bracing for terror attacks there.
[2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:27.260]  Meanwhile, they're in the news saying the Pentagon's preparing for war with the Tea Party.
[2:09:27.260 --> 2:09:32.260]  Now, we broke this, you know, the details, the proof many years ago.
[2:09:32.260 --> 2:09:34.260]  Quell from sources talked about it before that.
[2:09:34.260 --> 2:09:36.260]  Mark Corky and so many others.
[2:09:36.260 --> 2:09:39.260]  But people say, when's it all coming?
[2:09:39.260 --> 2:09:41.260]  The New World Order's here.
[2:09:41.260 --> 2:09:43.260]  It's here.
[2:09:43.260 --> 2:09:48.260]  When they blame gun owners for a mass shooting or they blame the rebel flag for a mass shooting.
[2:09:48.260 --> 2:09:50.260]  It's here.
[2:09:50.260 --> 2:09:56.260]  When they're openly selling babies and keeping babies alive and dissecting them.
[2:09:56.260 --> 2:09:59.260]  And then it's like, oh, big deal.
[2:09:59.260 --> 2:10:02.260]  Our conscience has been seared.
[2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:03.260]  We've been conditioned.
[2:10:03.260 --> 2:10:11.260]  I myself have just gotten conditioned to where I hear, oh, the major corporations making their employees take chips in their necks to get into work in Europe.
[2:10:11.260 --> 2:10:14.260]  Oh, big deal. I didn't even cover it on air a month ago when it was in the news.
[2:10:14.260 --> 2:10:16.260]  Because I knew it was coming 20 years ago.
[2:10:16.260 --> 2:10:17.260]  Now it's here.
[2:10:17.260 --> 2:10:19.260]  I'm like, okay.
[2:10:19.260 --> 2:10:21.260]  You see?
[2:10:21.260 --> 2:10:24.260]  So it's just the continued conditioning.
[2:10:24.260 --> 2:10:29.260]  And then to now have this sheriff who's a microcosm in Spokane.
[2:10:29.260 --> 2:10:34.260]  We have this all over the country getting giant armored vehicles in the news with the straight face goes.
[2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:37.260]  Because how do they segue from there's no armored vehicles.
[2:10:37.260 --> 2:10:39.260]  We're not targeting constitutionalists, too.
[2:10:39.260 --> 2:10:41.260]  Yeah, they really are dangerous and bad.
[2:10:41.260 --> 2:10:43.260]  They warned this was coming.
[2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:44.260]  It's here now.
[2:10:44.260 --> 2:10:46.260]  The deputy says it's for us.
[2:10:46.260 --> 2:10:48.260]  They say it all over the country.
[2:10:48.260 --> 2:10:49.260]  We say it's bad.
[2:10:49.260 --> 2:10:51.260]  So they go, look, see, they are bad.
[2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:56.260]  We need the armored vehicle because they said that we were getting the armored vehicle for them.
[2:10:56.260 --> 2:11:00.260]  But we did get it for them because they're bad because they're bad because they're right.
[2:11:00.260 --> 2:11:05.260]  And then he lies about us and says info wars is death threatening.
[2:11:05.260 --> 2:11:07.260]  And they're doing this all over the country.
[2:11:07.260 --> 2:11:09.260]  I played the clips yesterday. I'm not going to play them again.
[2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:12.260]  Where they sit there saying we have these for the veterans.
[2:11:12.260 --> 2:11:13.260]  We have these for the gun owners.
[2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:15.260]  We have these for the conservatives.
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:18.260]  This is like Hitler saying we have these for the communists.
[2:11:18.260 --> 2:11:19.260]  We have these for the Jews.
[2:11:19.260 --> 2:11:22.260]  We as a political movement, Americana.
[2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:26.260]  I'm a liberal in the sense of Thomas Jefferson.
[2:11:26.260 --> 2:11:28.260]  I believe in live and let live.
[2:11:28.260 --> 2:11:30.260]  I'm not getting in your business.
[2:11:30.260 --> 2:11:33.260]  If you don't get in mine, the problem is we didn't get in their business.
[2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:36.260]  They took over and now they're getting in our business.
[2:11:36.260 --> 2:11:43.260]  And so I'm begging you to realize that we need alarmist like Steve Quayle.
[2:11:43.260 --> 2:11:45.260]  We need to be concerned.
[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:51.260]  Well, Matt Drudge a year ago said Americans really should have an exit strategy to get out of the country on a Twitter.
[2:11:51.260 --> 2:11:52.260]  People made fun of that.
[2:11:52.260 --> 2:11:53.260]  The elite are leaving.
[2:11:53.260 --> 2:11:55.260]  It's in the London Guardian, the Associated Press.
[2:11:55.260 --> 2:11:58.260]  I don't know what exactly is coming.
[2:11:58.260 --> 2:12:04.260]  I know that they were in the newspapers last week again and on TV saying I'm behind the Boston bombing.
[2:12:04.260 --> 2:12:09.260]  My lawyer says I could win a lawsuit, but I don't have time to spend all my energy on that.
[2:12:09.260 --> 2:12:15.260]  I have to just take the hatch, move forward as a vanguard.
[2:12:15.260 --> 2:12:18.260]  But it everything is escalating.
[2:12:18.260 --> 2:12:21.260]  I don't know if it's going to trigger next month next year.
[2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:25.260]  I don't know, but things are exponential.
[2:12:25.260 --> 2:12:33.260]  And the Democratic Party with a Republican leadership has made the decision to be willfully totalitarian and evil.
[2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:37.260]  You get around Democratic Party operatives, not your average Democrat who's a nice person.
[2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:38.260]  And Republicans are nice people too.
[2:12:38.260 --> 2:12:40.260]  Their leadership is just as bad.
[2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:42.260]  But the Democrats are their vanguard.
[2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:48.260]  And when you get around these people, almost Steve Quayle's take on this, they are consciously evil.
[2:12:48.260 --> 2:12:49.260]  They know they're taking over.
[2:12:49.260 --> 2:12:52.260]  They're just a criminal group like ISIS.
[2:12:52.260 --> 2:12:54.260]  That's why they work with ISIS.
[2:12:54.260 --> 2:12:58.260]  They are getting ready for something big.
[2:12:58.260 --> 2:13:06.260]  That's why suddenly, communist rallies that have been deactivated to tell us that didn't exist for 20 years are suddenly,
[2:13:06.260 --> 2:13:11.260]  I've been in New York, I've been in Europe, I've been in Austin, Texas,
[2:13:11.260 --> 2:13:14.260]  and other places and people I know have been seeing it too.
[2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:20.260]  You'll just be at a cafe and communist march by with 100 red flags.
[2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:26.260]  And suddenly devil worshipers are showing up everywhere at Planned Parenthoods,
[2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:28.260]  and they've been killing babies.
[2:13:28.260 --> 2:13:30.260]  I mean, you've seen it with us show up.
[2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.260]  And these people literally crawl out from under rocks and just start saying,
[2:13:33.260 --> 2:13:36.260]  I'm ugly, I'm fat, Satan killed babies.
[2:13:36.260 --> 2:13:44.260]  And in the state house, they're just women dressed in normal dresses just spontaneously.
[2:13:44.260 --> 2:13:45.260]  News talked to them.
[2:13:45.260 --> 2:13:46.260]  They didn't know each other.
[2:13:46.260 --> 2:13:50.260]  They were just drawn like zombies, like spirits to just go,
[2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:53.260]  Hail Satan, Satan, man, and drowned out prayer meetings.
[2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:56.260]  Women just came out of their offices and like zombies went downtown,
[2:13:56.260 --> 2:13:59.260]  didn't know why they were there to Satan, Satan, Satan.
[2:13:59.260 --> 2:14:04.260]  And I'm realizing when I sit back and I look at this, I go, what is this?
[2:14:04.260 --> 2:14:06.260]  It's like a movie.
[2:14:06.260 --> 2:14:08.260]  It's like we got possessed or something.
[2:14:08.260 --> 2:14:14.260]  And then those of us that see it and don't like it, they go, oh, you're a terrorist.
[2:14:14.260 --> 2:14:15.260]  You're going to kill people.
[2:14:15.260 --> 2:14:17.260]  We've got to arrest you.
[2:14:17.260 --> 2:14:19.260]  And then we get official reeducation camp manual.
[2:14:19.260 --> 2:14:23.260]  Stevequell, Stevequell.com, I apologize for running for five minutes.
[2:14:23.260 --> 2:14:24.260]  Go ahead to the break.
[2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:25.260]  Six minutes away.
[2:14:25.260 --> 2:14:27.260]  What do you say to that?
[2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:28.260]  Who are the players?
[2:14:28.260 --> 2:14:29.260]  What is the end game?
[2:14:29.260 --> 2:14:30.260]  You were saying it's spiritual.
[2:14:30.260 --> 2:14:31.260]  Right.
[2:14:31.260 --> 2:14:34.260]  It's spiritual because, you know, we're written about stargates.
[2:14:34.260 --> 2:14:37.260]  And by the way, I just want to tell people this.
[2:14:37.260 --> 2:14:39.260]  It's important to what we're talking about, Alex.
[2:14:39.260 --> 2:14:41.260]  We've uploaded for a subscription.
[2:14:41.260 --> 2:14:45.260]  You can download a paid downloader to the DVD, true legends.
[2:14:45.260 --> 2:14:50.260]  And why this is critical, okay, is it's really critical for people to understand that.
[2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:55.260]  And one of the revelations in that night, it's shown amazing 90 minutes.
[2:14:55.260 --> 2:15:01.260]  We actually believe now that through some pretty amazing genius level mathematicians
[2:15:01.260 --> 2:15:05.260]  and Tim Alborino being down with the film crew and, you know, the South American stuff,
[2:15:05.260 --> 2:15:10.260]  we actually believe we have found the fallen angels linguistics.
[2:15:10.260 --> 2:15:12.260]  And I'll let people go on it and we'll see it.
[2:15:12.260 --> 2:15:14.260]  But what's going to be important?
[2:15:14.260 --> 2:15:16.260]  Let me tell you why this is important.
[2:15:16.260 --> 2:15:20.260]  Because the spiritual nature of the battle, when the Satan has come out, you know,
[2:15:20.260 --> 2:15:24.260]  during World War II, you and I did a show, I don't know, 10 years ago about this,
[2:15:24.260 --> 2:15:26.260]  when I wrote a book called Breathe No Evil.
[2:15:26.260 --> 2:15:36.260]  But Dr. Ishii and Unit 731 were tried for war crimes for the live vivis sections on human beings.
[2:15:36.260 --> 2:15:41.260]  By the way, that's why the Chinese, one of the main reasons the Chinese hate the Japanese so much,
[2:15:41.260 --> 2:15:45.260]  is that the atrocities under Japan were just horrific.
[2:15:45.260 --> 2:15:50.260]  So China has a historic, I would say, precedent for payback.
[2:15:50.260 --> 2:15:56.260]  But saying all that, that is a war crime, yet we do not criminalize the debt.
[2:15:56.260 --> 2:16:02.260]  Now, when I'm hearing that they have live babies, that they're giving over to the experimenters,
[2:16:02.260 --> 2:16:09.260]  and when I hear that the American citizens are eating all of the, if you will, baby parts
[2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:14.260]  and all the lists of the food companies and everything, you can understand something.
[2:16:14.260 --> 2:16:17.260]  They want us changed at a genetic level.
[2:16:17.260 --> 2:16:24.260]  They want us so isolated and so non-human that all of the normal God-given qualities of compassion,
[2:16:24.260 --> 2:16:28.260]  of love, of understanding, of forgiveness, they don't want that, okay?
[2:16:28.260 --> 2:16:30.260]  They want a totalitarian hell.
[2:16:30.260 --> 2:16:34.260]  Back in the United States, what was the name of the survey that you and I broke on air?
[2:16:34.260 --> 2:16:36.260]  I sent you an email, we talked about it.
[2:16:36.260 --> 2:16:40.260]  One that showed the population of America taking down to 80, 90 million.
[2:16:40.260 --> 2:16:42.260]  Absolutely. That was put out by the government.
[2:16:42.260 --> 2:16:45.260]  And expanding on this, whether we believe in all this or not,
[2:16:45.260 --> 2:16:49.260]  the elites believe in the angels, the stargates, the occult,
[2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:52.260]  they believe they're getting their power from it.
[2:16:52.260 --> 2:16:56.260]  And regardless, with the chimeras, with the cross species creations,
[2:16:56.260 --> 2:17:00.260]  with baby brains put in rats, with octopuses crossed with humans,
[2:17:00.260 --> 2:17:04.260]  all this is being done in labs, admitted now, these are new creatures.
[2:17:04.260 --> 2:17:08.260]  They're creating aliens right here on this planet.
[2:17:08.260 --> 2:17:09.260]  Yes, they are.
[2:17:09.260 --> 2:17:13.260]  And see, the reason for that is God created mankind in his image and likeness.
[2:17:13.260 --> 2:17:17.260]  People can argue about it, but all the creative genius,
[2:17:17.260 --> 2:17:21.260]  all the magnificent things, and there have been magnificent things
[2:17:21.260 --> 2:17:25.260]  that men in their honor of God, look at this.
[2:17:25.260 --> 2:17:28.260]  They kicked God out, no parent school, now they kick God out of everything,
[2:17:28.260 --> 2:17:32.260]  the universities, which most even Christians send their kids to.
[2:17:32.260 --> 2:17:34.260]  Now they say, don't say mother or father.
[2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:35.260]  Now they say purple penguin.
[2:17:35.260 --> 2:17:36.260]  Right.
[2:17:36.260 --> 2:17:41.260]  Well, our children are trying to be taught to choose sexuality at four years old.
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:47.260]  Vladimir Putin and his young wolves are stripping AK-47s blindfolded.
[2:17:47.260 --> 2:17:49.260]  ISIS is teaching, and I'm not in favor of it.
[2:17:49.260 --> 2:17:50.260]  That's right.
[2:17:50.260 --> 2:17:51.260]  That's right.
[2:17:51.260 --> 2:17:55.260]  They're teaching seven-year-olds how to strip AK-47s blindfolded and march in the snow.
[2:17:55.260 --> 2:17:58.260]  Our four-year-olds are learning how to give a blow job.
[2:17:58.260 --> 2:17:59.260]  Absolutely.
[2:17:59.260 --> 2:18:03.260]  And I'm sorry it has to be stated that way, but here's the deal.
[2:18:03.260 --> 2:18:06.260]  Yeah, I apologize too, but that's what they're teaching five-year-olds.
[2:18:06.260 --> 2:18:07.260]  Yep, they are.
[2:18:07.260 --> 2:18:08.260]  And see, here's the thing.
[2:18:08.260 --> 2:18:12.260]  Human sexuality, and we could do a show on that,
[2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:15.260]  and I promise you a different take, and it wouldn't be x-rated,
[2:18:15.260 --> 2:18:19.260]  but the problem with human sexuality has been taken over by the,
[2:18:19.260 --> 2:18:23.260]  I would say this, the fallen angel perverts.
[2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:25.260]  And I document all this stuff.
[2:18:25.260 --> 2:18:30.260]  By the way, one of the most astonishing revelations coming from 1545
[2:18:30.260 --> 2:18:35.260]  was the fact that God himself sent an angel to sway the,
[2:18:35.260 --> 2:18:43.260]  and I'm gonna say this, the homosexual giants and the 1545 to 1600 chroniclers
[2:18:43.260 --> 2:18:47.260]  absolutely said this was a given fact.
[2:18:47.260 --> 2:18:51.260]  Even the Native Americans who were non-Christians at that time,
[2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:54.260]  obviously I'm talking about Peru, Bolivia,
[2:18:54.260 --> 2:18:58.260]  they, they, they chronicled this in all of their myths and legends.
[2:18:58.260 --> 2:19:00.260]  So here's the deal.
[2:19:00.260 --> 2:19:04.260]  We are now seeing a spirit of supernatural perversion.
[2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:05.260]  What is it?
[2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:09.260]  If anybody, and I don't want to go into detail, but anybody who understands Satanism,
[2:19:09.260 --> 2:19:14.260]  they have to desecrate, denigrate, they have to offer blood sacrifices,
[2:19:14.260 --> 2:19:19.260]  they have to ritualize, sodomy, they, they've got to do all that,
[2:19:19.260 --> 2:19:22.260]  because ultimately it's destroying the image and likeness of God.
[2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:27.260]  So when the Christians, and the, and what I call the jellyfishes in the pulpit,
[2:19:27.260 --> 2:19:31.260]  those would be the pastors that have as much spine as a jellyfish that they float,
[2:19:31.260 --> 2:19:34.260]  you know, in the ocean, and they sting everybody with their poison.
[2:19:34.260 --> 2:19:36.260]  Sorry, that's how I see it.
[2:19:36.260 --> 2:19:40.260]  I hear you, listen, it's really far out, but when you read the Old Testament,
[2:19:40.260 --> 2:19:44.260]  it describes these giants coming out of flying saucers, raping everybody,
[2:19:44.260 --> 2:19:48.260]  and then, and then now you see the elite trying to cross species, everybody.
[2:19:48.260 --> 2:19:52.260]  Whether people think it's real or not, it's manifesting now.
[2:19:52.260 --> 2:19:54.260]  Why do we have legends about this?
[2:19:54.260 --> 2:20:20.260]  Maybe this isn't a good idea to be teaching kids their purple language.
[2:20:24.260 --> 2:20:28.260]  That's 800-686-2237.

[2:23:53.260 --> 2:24:19.260]  Don't wait. Call today.
[2:24:24.260 --> 2:24:25.260]  I know this.
[2:24:25.260 --> 2:24:28.260]  The whole Promethean legend, the movie Prometheus,
[2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:32.260]  Time Magazine even reports that most genetic engineers and others
[2:24:32.260 --> 2:24:35.260]  believe that we were seeded from space now.
[2:24:35.260 --> 2:24:40.260]  They've abandoned the theory of evolution as it's promoted.
[2:24:40.260 --> 2:24:42.260]  I don't go where I can't prove stuff.
[2:24:42.260 --> 2:24:46.260]  I have Army manuals admitting they're trying to put us in FEMA camps
[2:24:46.260 --> 2:24:48.260]  that are at Army.mil,
[2:24:48.260 --> 2:24:50.260]  and I can have Nightline here and hand them the document,
[2:24:50.260 --> 2:24:52.260]  and they just won't look at it.
[2:24:52.260 --> 2:24:55.260]  The public listening can't believe that,
[2:24:55.260 --> 2:25:00.260]  but I know I've studied Aztec, Mayan, Mesoamerican culture.
[2:25:00.260 --> 2:25:05.260]  They believe that gods came from the heavens and seeded us here.
[2:25:05.260 --> 2:25:08.260]  The elites believe it, the Egyptians, others,
[2:25:08.260 --> 2:25:12.260]  and I know that it's skull and bones and bohemian grove and the occult
[2:25:12.260 --> 2:25:16.260]  that they believe that they are channeling goddesses
[2:25:16.260 --> 2:25:18.260]  and entities from other dimensions.
[2:25:18.260 --> 2:25:20.260]  They believe they're doing that at CERN.
[2:25:20.260 --> 2:25:22.260]  They believe they're going to find the god particle.
[2:25:22.260 --> 2:25:24.260]  So whether it's real or not,
[2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:26.260]  I don't think we can criticize Steve Quell for looking into it
[2:25:26.260 --> 2:25:30.260]  because when you ask what is the elite main agenda,
[2:25:30.260 --> 2:25:32.260]  it is to be god,
[2:25:32.260 --> 2:25:35.260]  and they have been splicing humans with cows, pigs, you name it,
[2:25:35.260 --> 2:25:40.260]  to grow babies in utero for organ harvesting of larger humanoids.
[2:25:40.260 --> 2:25:44.260]  Then they argue that the humanoid has no rights
[2:25:44.260 --> 2:25:48.260]  because it's part bovine or part porcine, pig,
[2:25:48.260 --> 2:25:51.260]  or part peniped. They've put them in seals as well.
[2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:55.260]  And look, I'd talk about this 16, 17, 18, 19 years ago.
[2:25:55.260 --> 2:25:56.260]  People didn't believe it.
[2:25:56.260 --> 2:25:59.260]  It was in industry papers then.
[2:25:59.260 --> 2:26:00.260]  Now it's mainstream news.
[2:26:00.260 --> 2:26:02.260]  I mean, I'd talk about spider goats 20 years ago
[2:26:02.260 --> 2:26:05.260]  before it was in the news. People thought I was a liar.
[2:26:05.260 --> 2:26:08.260]  But then for like 18 years, it's been in the news.
[2:26:08.260 --> 2:26:11.260]  Goats that are part spider that produce body armor and their milk.
[2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:15.260]  So if that's not alien, I don't know what is.
[2:26:15.260 --> 2:26:18.260]  We live on a planet who knows what's going on.
[2:26:18.260 --> 2:26:20.260]  But Steve, we're going to come back and take phone calls,
[2:26:20.260 --> 2:26:23.260]  get into the economy, geopolitics, Donald Trump,
[2:26:23.260 --> 2:26:26.260]  other things that are closer to home.
[2:26:26.260 --> 2:26:33.260]  But the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[2:26:33.260 --> 2:26:37.260]  for your question, specifically your comment for Steve Quayle.
[2:26:37.260 --> 2:26:40.260]  800-259-9231.
[2:26:40.260 --> 2:26:42.260]  Wide open phones are free for all.
[2:26:42.260 --> 2:26:45.260]  But in the three, four months we have to break.
[2:26:45.260 --> 2:26:48.260]  Currently geopolitically, Russia, China, the US,
[2:26:48.260 --> 2:26:51.260]  aren't they just different power blocks played off against each other,
[2:26:51.260 --> 2:26:56.260]  but with the same globalist operatives in quasi-control of all three?
[2:26:56.260 --> 2:26:58.260]  Right. Probably that's true.
[2:26:58.260 --> 2:27:01.260]  But people can't identify as supernatural, if you will,
[2:27:01.260 --> 2:27:03.260]  brilliance, orchestrating evil.
[2:27:03.260 --> 2:27:05.260]  Now, like, I deal on that whole statement.
[2:27:05.260 --> 2:27:09.260]  Obviously, the Illuminati is going to say we were ceded by aliens.
[2:27:09.260 --> 2:27:14.260]  It's called Ben Spermia. The Vatican is getting ready to baptize aliens,
[2:27:14.260 --> 2:27:17.260]  where I differ from all those guys as this.
[2:27:17.260 --> 2:27:22.260]  Well, it's easy for them to claim the Anunnaki, name them whatever,
[2:27:22.260 --> 2:27:25.260]  the gods, actually, the Pentagon's called,
[2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:29.260]  I think the Pentagon's official name form is the Sumerian gods.
[2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:33.260]  All those things are fallen angels, masquerading as something.
[2:27:33.260 --> 2:27:34.260]  The Bible's very clear.
[2:27:34.260 --> 2:27:38.260]  I believe that, you know, obviously God created Adam and Eve,
[2:27:38.260 --> 2:27:41.260]  not, you know, somebody from the planet Antares.
[2:27:41.260 --> 2:27:47.260]  But in order to deceive, in order to seduce, in order to destroy,
[2:27:47.260 --> 2:27:52.260]  the fallen angels have perpetrated, have populated the planet,
[2:27:52.260 --> 2:27:58.260]  and even all the Mesoamericans recorded, Native Americans record, the star people.
[2:27:58.260 --> 2:28:01.260]  So what greater lie, and I tell people this, Alex,
[2:28:01.260 --> 2:28:05.260]  when people say why won't they talk about all the giants that are found,
[2:28:05.260 --> 2:28:10.260]  why do they hide the bones, why do they hide all of the evidence, Steve,
[2:28:10.260 --> 2:28:14.260]  that you and the ancient writers, I'm not ancient yet,
[2:28:14.260 --> 2:28:19.260]  but I will obviously become ancient sometime, the idea is simply this, Alex,
[2:28:19.260 --> 2:28:22.260]  it's the greatest deception in the history of the universe.
[2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:26.260]  If someone says the aliens created mankind, I said, then who created the aliens?
[2:28:26.260 --> 2:28:28.260]  You see, because the law first mentioned.
[2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:31.260]  So what I'm trying to get people to understand is,
[2:28:31.260 --> 2:28:35.260]  is that we're seeing the Pope show up on the 23rd of September,
[2:28:35.260 --> 2:28:40.260]  and the Vatican, Tom Horn has done an amazing job of, you know,
[2:28:40.260 --> 2:28:44.260]  basically writing out the Vatican's own statements on the aliens,
[2:28:44.260 --> 2:28:47.260]  and that they will baptize aliens, and then the idea,
[2:28:47.260 --> 2:28:50.260]  can you have an alien saved by Jesus?
[2:28:50.260 --> 2:28:55.260]  The answer to that is no, because Jesus didn't die for the angels that sin.
[2:28:55.260 --> 2:28:58.260]  He died for mankind. Jesus absolutely makes that clear.
[2:28:58.260 --> 2:29:03.260]  So look at the attack on Jesus. Anything is fair game, and you know this.
[2:29:03.260 --> 2:29:07.260]  See, the spiritual realm is coming into the visible physical realm.
[2:29:07.260 --> 2:29:10.260]  Book of Revelation states,
[2:29:10.260 --> 2:29:13.260]  Roland, you inhabitants of the earth, for your devil, the devil,
[2:29:13.260 --> 2:29:17.260]  your adversary has come down, knowing he has but a short time.
[2:29:17.260 --> 2:29:19.260]  People can't separate the wrath of God,
[2:29:19.260 --> 2:29:22.260]  which is at the end of the tribulation, from the wrath of Satan.
[2:29:22.260 --> 2:29:25.260]  They try and make the same thing as, yes.
[2:29:25.260 --> 2:29:28.260]  I mean, I know this. I mean, even if you were an atheist,
[2:29:28.260 --> 2:29:30.260]  if I was an atheist, which I'm not researching this,
[2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:33.260]  I would discover the elite believe they are being influenced
[2:29:33.260 --> 2:29:37.260]  by interdimensional creatures that give them special knowledge to be in control.
[2:29:37.260 --> 2:29:40.260]  And then you see how the Eugenicists came up with all these plans
[2:29:40.260 --> 2:29:44.260]  160 years ago. It is none of this world, as the Bible says.
[2:29:44.260 --> 2:29:56.260]  It's, it's devilish. I mean, it's all let it describe it.
[2:30:15.260 --> 2:30:18.260]  This is a clear violation, not only of shirts, county policy,
[2:30:18.260 --> 2:30:20.260]  but of standard journalistic ethics.
[2:30:20.260 --> 2:30:23.260]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television,
[2:30:23.260 --> 2:30:25.260]  must abide by a different standard.
[2:30:25.260 --> 2:30:28.260]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[2:30:28.260 --> 2:30:31.260]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents
[2:30:31.260 --> 2:30:34.260]  around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism,
[2:30:34.260 --> 2:30:35.260]  the president added.
[2:30:35.260 --> 2:30:38.260]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness,
[2:30:38.260 --> 2:30:42.260]  which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan show.
[2:30:42.260 --> 2:30:45.260]  How about Prozac? You know the number, oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[2:30:45.260 --> 2:30:49.260]  Don't want to talk about the U.S. number one cause of death is suicide now,
[2:30:49.260 --> 2:30:53.260]  because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[2:30:53.260 --> 2:30:55.260]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[2:30:55.260 --> 2:31:20.260]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com.

[2:31:56.260 --> 2:32:02.260]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world
[2:32:02.260 --> 2:32:05.260]  praised the health benefits of silver.

[2:33:21.260 --> 2:33:24.260]  You know, there's only a few herbs out there
[2:33:24.260 --> 2:33:30.260]  that even the FDA admits is a treatment for prostate problems
[2:33:30.260 --> 2:33:32.260]  and large prostate, things like that.
[2:33:32.260 --> 2:33:35.260]  And that's Saupon Meadow.
[2:33:35.260 --> 2:33:40.260]  And we set out at InfoWarsLife.com to just create an entire line
[2:33:40.260 --> 2:33:43.260]  that like 15 products now, a couple of them aren't here yet,
[2:33:43.260 --> 2:33:45.260]  but they're in the pipeline,
[2:33:45.260 --> 2:33:48.260]  that just has stronger dosages, organic,
[2:33:48.260 --> 2:33:52.260]  highest quality, and then fuses in the latest research.
[2:33:52.260 --> 2:33:57.260]  And Prostagard, what has like 10 different ingredients, Saupon Meadow, Lycopene,
[2:33:57.260 --> 2:33:59.260]  that's what supercharges the Saupon Meadow.
[2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:01.260]  A lot of evidence says it's even better than that.
[2:34:01.260 --> 2:34:07.260]  Plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, copper, and other key compounds.
[2:34:07.260 --> 2:34:16.260]  It's back in, very popular, because similar formulas are $29.95, $34.95 or more
[2:34:16.260 --> 2:34:20.260]  for just Saupon Meadow or the Lycopene.
[2:34:20.260 --> 2:34:25.260]  We put it all together in one pill, and I take it a couple of times a week.
[2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:28.260]  There's so many pills now, but I'm trying to get in the habit.
[2:34:28.260 --> 2:34:32.260]  And it's really just fused together with everything else I'm doing.
[2:34:32.260 --> 2:34:35.260]  I'm 41, and look, if it's helping your prostate,
[2:34:35.260 --> 2:34:38.260]  it's going to be helping other stuff as well.
[2:34:38.260 --> 2:34:40.260]  And that's one of the number one problems men have.
[2:34:40.260 --> 2:34:44.260]  It's one of the biggest problems with dysfunction and things like that.
[2:34:44.260 --> 2:34:48.260]  I don't have any of those problems, but boy, has my life gotten better overall.
[2:34:48.260 --> 2:34:53.260]  I mean, occasionally, I've gone out of medical checkup, I'm fine,
[2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:55.260]  but your prostate burns.
[2:34:55.260 --> 2:34:59.260]  Every once in a while, you'll urinate or whatever your prostate starts burning.
[2:34:59.260 --> 2:35:01.260]  We're adults here, we're talking about it.
[2:35:01.260 --> 2:35:05.260]  You take this stuff, I mean, I'll tell you, that might have happened once a month to me.
[2:35:05.260 --> 2:35:07.260]  I've been on prostate guards for about a year.
[2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:10.260]  Even before we had it out, I was taking what our formula was,
[2:35:10.260 --> 2:35:12.260]  and it just has changed a lot of things.
[2:35:12.260 --> 2:35:15.260]  Because these plants are so key and our bodies need them.
[2:35:15.260 --> 2:35:18.260]  That's where the idea of drugs comes from, pharma key is from plants.
[2:35:18.260 --> 2:35:22.260]  Look at what aspirin or any of this stuff does, and it's just right there.
[2:35:22.260 --> 2:35:26.260]  So if you're not taking prostate guard, I mean, I think women ought to take it.
[2:35:26.260 --> 2:35:29.260]  I mean, it's just good for your glands, period.
[2:35:29.260 --> 2:35:32.260]  And I think it does a lot more than what they say.
[2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:39.260]  So prostate guard is available at infowarslife.com or 888-2533-139.
[2:35:39.260 --> 2:35:45.260]  Luke in Waco, Texas says, Alex team, two days with dramatic improvement with urine flow
[2:35:45.260 --> 2:35:47.260]  and reduction of nighttime visits to the bathroom.
[2:35:47.260 --> 2:35:49.260]  You know, when it swells up, it does that.
[2:35:49.260 --> 2:35:51.260]  6X to 1X.
[2:35:51.260 --> 2:35:53.260]  AM, completely satisfied.
[2:35:53.260 --> 2:35:54.260]  And completely satisfied.
[2:35:54.260 --> 2:35:56.260]  Thank you, Luke.
[2:35:56.260 --> 2:36:02.260]  And now that's the other issue is when my prostate has flared up, which is very rare,
[2:36:02.260 --> 2:36:05.260]  you got to get up and go to the bathroom every hour.
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:07.260]  I mean, this is just what it does.
[2:36:07.260 --> 2:36:10.260]  And, you know, guys, we can talk about it as part of our body.
[2:36:10.260 --> 2:36:14.260]  The plant God gave us is the answer.
[2:36:14.260 --> 2:36:16.260]  And so I kicked myself.
[2:36:16.260 --> 2:36:18.260]  I got a Lazy Susan now.
[2:36:18.260 --> 2:36:19.260]  Oh, that's politically incorrect.
[2:36:19.260 --> 2:36:20.260]  Lazy Susan.
[2:36:20.260 --> 2:36:22.260]  They're actually saying don't use that word anymore.
[2:36:22.260 --> 2:36:25.260]  And don't say bossy because it hurts women's fault feelings.

[2:37:14.260 --> 2:37:16.260]  Now going back to Steve Quayle.
[2:37:16.260 --> 2:37:23.260]  Steve, I want to do a whole interview with you sometime where I show the New York Times admitting,
[2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:28.260]  and you remember the scientific name, I did a whole video on it, secret from Atheist movie revealed,
[2:37:28.260 --> 2:37:31.260]  Transpermia, what's the term that scientists use?
[2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:33.260]  Pan-spermia.
[2:37:33.260 --> 2:37:35.260]  Yeah, pan-spermia.
[2:37:35.260 --> 2:37:43.260]  So I could show all of them saying this so then you don't sound like you're crazy for people,
[2:37:43.260 --> 2:37:49.260]  because regardless, this is what the elite believe, but I want to segue out of it in a moment, but go ahead and finish up with that.
[2:37:49.260 --> 2:37:55.260]  Well yeah, pan-spermia, and the whole thing is Alex is that, you know, whenever you want to do a show on it,
[2:37:55.260 --> 2:38:02.260]  I would welcome that because what's tragic is, is that people somehow can't put two and two together.
[2:38:02.260 --> 2:38:06.260]  If I'm some guy in the 20th, you know, first century talking about this stuff,
[2:38:06.260 --> 2:38:14.260]  there are so many accounts in ancient history and antiquity, the giants of South America,
[2:38:14.260 --> 2:38:21.260]  there's no place, the giants of China, and the reason why people want to cover that up, especially the elite,
[2:38:21.260 --> 2:38:26.260]  remember this, the elite are preparing the world to accept Lucifer as their god.
[2:38:26.260 --> 2:38:33.260]  They are absolutely bent on one thing, they must destroy the Christians.
[2:38:33.260 --> 2:38:39.260]  Look at this, ISIS could have been stopped on their four-mile march of all the U.S. stuff.
[2:38:39.260 --> 2:38:44.260]  Why has the United States and Britain been supplying ISIS with weapons?
[2:38:44.260 --> 2:38:50.260]  And we've seen the pictures of it in the C-130s dropping, you know, equipment, but here's one thing I want to share.
[2:38:50.260 --> 2:38:54.260]  I was contacted by a C-130 pilot last summer and the summer before,
[2:38:54.260 --> 2:39:00.260]  people were noticing in all parts of a really remote, whether Colorado, Montana, Washington,
[2:39:00.260 --> 2:39:04.260]  and I'm talking about a C-130 training pilot said this, he said, Steve,
[2:39:04.260 --> 2:39:10.260]  all the C-130s that you are seeing, even some landing on highways, abandon airstrips,
[2:39:10.260 --> 2:39:16.260]  their primary goal is only one thing, and that's to supply the foreign troops
[2:39:16.260 --> 2:39:22.260]  making war with the patriots and the veterans when they decide it's time.
[2:39:22.260 --> 2:39:27.260]  Now again, since when is a constitution, a hate document, the answer to that is
[2:39:27.260 --> 2:39:32.260]  when you've got a communist and a Muslim controlling everything that is being done in this country.
[2:39:32.260 --> 2:39:38.260]  Most people don't understand this, the anchor babies is more than just a problem
[2:39:38.260 --> 2:39:44.260]  of Latin Americans and South Americans, what you're seeing is the complete dissolution
[2:39:44.260 --> 2:39:49.260]  of the middle class and all their assets and all their fruits of their labor,
[2:39:49.260 --> 2:39:55.260]  their life, their inheritance being transferred courtesy of the federal betrayers
[2:39:55.260 --> 2:40:00.260]  into the hands of illegals, into the hands of those who have been released.
[2:40:00.260 --> 2:40:05.260]  Alice, you and I talked years ago, years ago about the ultimate prism,
[2:40:05.260 --> 2:40:12.260]  and that's the Islam in the prisons, and I had a very high ranking Texas guy
[2:40:12.260 --> 2:40:16.260]  who emailed me and said, Steve, the plan is to release them all.
[2:40:16.260 --> 2:40:20.260]  Someone said, ah, you're crazy, Quail, you're crazy, Jones, oh yeah?
[2:40:20.260 --> 2:40:25.260]  Well, we've already seen it done, how many hardened criminals have been turned loose?
[2:40:25.260 --> 2:40:30.260]  Imagine- Obama just came out two weeks ago and said he wants to start releasing criminals out of prisons,
[2:40:30.260 --> 2:40:34.260]  which sounds like some peace initiative, no, it's further to destabilize,
[2:40:34.260 --> 2:40:38.260]  because it's whacked out as all this sounds, the border's wide open, they are trying to destabilize.
[2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:42.260]  And so the phone calls, what do you see as the timetable?
[2:40:42.260 --> 2:40:49.260]  Not so much the actual time on the table, but what is the cascade of events that you think they're preparing?
[2:40:49.260 --> 2:40:53.260]  Well, I think, first of all, they inspired their first shot on the 23rd of August.
[2:40:53.260 --> 2:40:55.260]  Remember, we've all been told the 23rd of September?
[2:40:55.260 --> 2:40:57.260]  Everything is in motion now.
[2:40:57.260 --> 2:41:02.260]  What my concern is, my concern is, is that they will actually use,
[2:41:02.260 --> 2:41:07.260]  the terrorists will use nuclear weapons that have been provided for them on the desert southwest
[2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:08.260]  going into detail.
[2:41:08.260 --> 2:41:14.260]  With your permission, Alex, I'll send Nico an email to pass on to you, you can check it.
[2:41:14.260 --> 2:41:18.260]  I don't want to speak it on the air, but the thing that's important is this,
[2:41:18.260 --> 2:41:25.260]  is that when people finally understand that terrorism is a well-financed army,
[2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:27.260]  and let's call it what it is, the army of Antichrist.
[2:41:27.260 --> 2:41:29.260]  A shadow army, a proxy army.
[2:41:29.260 --> 2:41:32.260]  Yes, a proxy, that's even a better word.
[2:41:32.260 --> 2:41:38.260]  The proxy army of Antichrist, do you really think they have a hard time coming up with the money to buy anything?
[2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:44.260]  Look, Pakistan has been providing clandestine nukes to the world for pretty much,
[2:41:44.260 --> 2:41:46.260]  I don't know, 15 years probably.
[2:41:46.260 --> 2:41:49.260]  I heard you say that 10 years ago, that's now pretty much admitted.
[2:41:49.260 --> 2:41:55.260]  Right, and when I put up the first article about Iran exploding a nuclear weapon 15 years ago,
[2:41:55.260 --> 2:41:58.260]  it was sanitized from the Associated Press.
[2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:02.260]  I still think you can find it on my website through a search, and I've got to be honest people,
[2:42:02.260 --> 2:42:07.260]  I have lost track of the tens of thousands of pages on my website, you know what I'm talking about.
[2:42:07.260 --> 2:42:12.260]  Listen, I've talked to a high-level Special Forces commander, and I couldn't get into details,
[2:42:12.260 --> 2:42:15.260]  and I don't want to know the classified details, and I was told this a long time ago,
[2:42:15.260 --> 2:42:19.260]  that it was from Pakistan, that Saudi Arabia already had them,
[2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:24.260]  and that the Iranians had gotten parts from the Russians and others,
[2:42:24.260 --> 2:42:28.260]  they needed a delivery system, but that they have devices space-based,
[2:42:28.260 --> 2:42:31.260]  but also drone-based that can scan through the rock,
[2:42:31.260 --> 2:42:34.260]  and they even know the isotopes of the bombs,
[2:42:34.260 --> 2:42:40.260]  and then Iran had three good-sized atomic bombs at least a decade ago.
[2:42:40.260 --> 2:42:45.260]  Absolutely, and they actually exploded one, and then the official lie that came out,
[2:42:45.260 --> 2:42:49.260]  ladies and gentlemen, on the Associated Press, sanitized within one hour,
[2:42:49.260 --> 2:42:52.260]  and by the way, I went on coast to coast with that story,
[2:42:52.260 --> 2:42:56.260]  basically stated that all the seismographs in the world failed.
[2:42:56.260 --> 2:43:03.260]  Now, let me make it clear, an earthquake has a total different seismic signature than a nuclear weapon.
[2:43:03.260 --> 2:43:07.260]  Totally different. They can tell, not only that, Alex, but you're spot on.
[2:43:07.260 --> 2:43:13.260]  They can tell the origin, they can tell the country that refined uranium, they can tell everything,
[2:43:13.260 --> 2:43:17.260]  and then if people want to know how our enemy's got the delivery system,
[2:43:17.260 --> 2:43:22.260]  I just encourage you to go look up LORAL, L-I-A-L, satellite.
[2:43:22.260 --> 2:43:24.260]  Clinton gave it to all of them in 95.
[2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:34.260]  Yep, and so now we've got, realistically, Pakistan may have the world's third largest nuclear weapons,
[2:43:34.260 --> 2:43:40.260]  again, because they're producing 20 of them a year, okay?
[2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:41.260]  That's what they believe.
[2:43:41.260 --> 2:43:46.260]  Now, that's what they can kind of figure out by centrifuges, tests, all that stuff,
[2:43:46.260 --> 2:43:49.260]  but if you go back 10 years, that's 200 nuclear weapons.
[2:43:49.260 --> 2:43:52.260]  You're talking about strategic capability.
[2:43:52.260 --> 2:43:56.260]  When they talk about launch weight, throw weight, all those missile terms,
[2:43:56.260 --> 2:43:59.260]  you know, I say this, well, have you guys factored in container weight?
[2:43:59.260 --> 2:44:00.260]  They say, what do you mean?
[2:44:00.260 --> 2:44:07.260]  I said, preposition containers with medium-range ballistic missiles that besides full-down, and voila,
[2:44:07.260 --> 2:44:10.260]  have you considered that those are already in the United States?
[2:44:10.260 --> 2:44:13.260]  Well, right now, you know, your sources will tell you the same thing.
[2:44:13.260 --> 2:44:17.260]  They know of at least 16 nuclear weapons, unaccounted for in the United States.
[2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:21.260]  So, the point being is, look, we can find this crap.
[2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:25.260]  If they can find Alex Jones, and they can see your wristwatch, read it from outer space,
[2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:31.260]  if they've got gigapixel cameras that can pick out 50,000 people and identify each individual base,
[2:44:31.260 --> 2:44:38.260]  why is it that all the assets that are turned against the American people aren't using the international terrorism?
[2:44:38.260 --> 2:44:43.260]  Listen, take the F-22. They've now proven what was said 15 years ago when they started development.
[2:44:43.260 --> 2:44:47.260]  It's not as good as the F-16. It's not as good as anything before it.
[2:44:47.260 --> 2:44:51.260]  It is sabotage, hundreds of something billion dollars.
[2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:55.260]  I mean, we are being sabotaged. Human flight programs. NASA.
[2:44:55.260 --> 2:45:01.260]  I had one of the former top NASA astronauts on just two weeks ago, and he said, no, I agree.
[2:45:01.260 --> 2:45:05.260]  NASA is being sabotaged. Human operations are being sabotaged.
[2:45:05.260 --> 2:45:12.260]  America is being sabotaged. We are under sabotage attack.
[2:45:12.260 --> 2:45:15.260]  Well, and not only that, but here's the thing.
[2:45:15.260 --> 2:45:22.260]  You know, we're talking about an American population taken down in the not too distant future by a couple hundred million people.
[2:45:22.260 --> 2:45:26.260]  The only way you can achieve that is through pretty much primarily two delivery systems,
[2:45:26.260 --> 2:45:30.260]  weapons systems, biological, i.e. mandatory vaccines.
[2:45:30.260 --> 2:45:32.260]  Everybody used to bust my chop, your chop.
[2:45:32.260 --> 2:45:35.260]  And notice, we're the sickest now. Yeah, we never had mandatory vaccines.
[2:45:35.260 --> 2:45:38.260]  Now, California is doing it. Now, Australia is doing it.
[2:45:38.260 --> 2:45:42.260]  We've got to go to calls here, Steve, but I mean, it is accelerating.
[2:45:42.260 --> 2:45:52.260]  One last thing before we go to calls. If everybody noticed the closing down number the other day was 15,666, okay?
[2:45:52.260 --> 2:45:57.260]  I want everyone to look for two numbers. I want them to look for multiples of 33.
[2:45:57.260 --> 2:46:05.260]  And for instance, there are 66 challenges to NATO and American aircraft by the Russians.
[2:46:05.260 --> 2:46:10.260]  66 in the last so many months. So here's the deal, Alex.
[2:46:10.260 --> 2:46:15.260]  The Illuminous are basically wetting their pants with glee, okay?
[2:46:15.260 --> 2:46:17.260]  Because they see this coming to pass.
[2:46:17.260 --> 2:46:22.260]  And there is, and I'm going to say this, there is no turning it around politically.
[2:46:22.260 --> 2:46:25.260]  My critics will take me on. They'll say I'm negative. I'm not negative.
[2:46:25.260 --> 2:46:28.260]  I'm just telling you this. We've gone too far.
[2:46:28.260 --> 2:46:31.260]  And now the race war warned about 20 years ago.
[2:46:31.260 --> 2:46:39.260]  And by the way, I'm doing everything I can to stop it by warning both the blacks, the whites, Latinos, everyone.
[2:46:39.260 --> 2:46:42.260]  You're all, we're all being played against each other.
[2:46:42.260 --> 2:46:46.260]  Who's the central command? But look who are the villains right now.
[2:46:46.260 --> 2:46:52.260]  And you can understand this when they, when anybody says, if you're a constitutionalist, a Christian,
[2:46:52.260 --> 2:47:00.260]  I'm saying this, if they say about veteran, anybody, homeschoolers, whoever they identify the enemy as,
[2:47:00.260 --> 2:47:05.260]  they're not playing games. You are being targeted for elimination.
[2:47:05.260 --> 2:47:07.260]  I don't know how to make it any easier, Alex.
[2:47:07.260 --> 2:47:12.260]  250 vets, 250,000 vets pretty close have died in the last five years.
[2:47:12.260 --> 2:47:15.260]  So am I off? I don't think so.
[2:47:15.260 --> 2:47:19.260]  All I know is we need alarmist, whether you're completely right or completely wrong.
[2:47:19.260 --> 2:47:23.260]  You're obviously a lot more right than wrong. We need to be upset. We need to be concerned.
[2:47:23.260 --> 2:47:28.260]  Alan in Washington, DC, you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[2:47:28.260 --> 2:47:40.260]  Hi, Alex and Steve. My question is about what Steve was saying about the possibility that the Chinese and the Russians could eventually team up against the United States.
[2:47:40.260 --> 2:47:49.260]  I believe it's obvious they have. They're now having joint military drills. They're obviously in the Arctic together.
[2:47:49.260 --> 2:48:04.260]  The Russians, the Brick Nation, the Brick Nation, Brazil, Russia, India, China are already forming their international money transfer system to compete with the West Swift.
[2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:06.260]  So they're ready to go.
[2:48:06.260 --> 2:48:16.260]  China is starting to dump U.S. Treasuries. I think that signals the dollar is in trouble, even though it's been dominant. It signals a war zone.
[2:48:16.260 --> 2:48:24.260]  Absolutely. So the answer is they're already here. They're already ready. And I hope you understood, sir, the caller when I first started talking.
[2:48:24.260 --> 2:48:40.260]  It's already a given that the Chinese, in order to continue to buy America's debt years ago, demanded the disarming of the United States citizenry. Even Michelle Obama, what was it, Alex, a couple months ago, said before my husband leaves office, he's going to take the guns away.
[2:48:40.260 --> 2:48:46.260]  By the way, most people don't understand. John Kerry, without Senate approval, signed the United Nations Small Arms Convention.
[2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:55.260]  Definitely, they're making their move. I don't know if they're going to get away with it. Exposing them may stop it, then we get blamed for fair mongering. We're trying to stop this. Alan, thank you so much.
[2:48:55.260 --> 2:48:59.260]  James and Kendall, you're on the air with Steve Quill.
[2:48:59.260 --> 2:49:13.260]  Hi, guys. Thank you. My question is about the fires. I'm in Southern Alberta, and we're getting a ton of smoke coming from the Washington fires. Do you think this is part of the chemtrails or part of their agenda to smoke us out or something?
[2:49:13.260 --> 2:49:35.260]  Well, I'll give you the answer to that. Again, I would encourage you to go on, do a web search for Spetsnaz and also Golitsyn, G-O-L-I-T-S-Y-I-N. It is a part of the preparatory events taking place before the Russian and Chinese invasion of the United States.
[2:49:35.260 --> 2:49:44.260]  If the fires are intentionally being set, and that's exactly what a guy, he posted 148 points, 139 points.
[2:49:44.260 --> 2:49:56.260]  Well, I remember people saying the fires in Russia might have been started by NATO. NATO is certainly starting a fight. What about the big chemical explosions at the military base last week in Japan?
[2:49:56.260 --> 2:50:01.260]  And then the stuff happening in China, some word is, they're saying that's environmental terrorists?
[2:50:01.260 --> 2:50:06.260]  Well, I don't believe that. I believe it's space-based weapons, okay? Here's the reason I say that.
[2:50:06.260 --> 2:50:17.260]  Ken Zhang, and I may be pronouncing wrong the same thing. There's so much payback. And G-O-Engineering, by the way, is what is directing the normal rain away from the Pacific Northwest.
[2:50:17.260 --> 2:50:22.260]  I have people that live in the Olympic Peninsula, Alex, talking to me about how dry it is there.
[2:50:22.260 --> 2:50:33.260]  G-O-Engineering is the perfect weapon. Chemtrails, the perfect weapon. When we talk about the introduction of a bioweapon across the country or across the world,
[2:50:33.260 --> 2:50:44.260]  if the chemical spray, the chemical soup that's already in the air, in our lungs, in our body, in our genes, all they have to do is add, let's say, that's part A of the ingredient, part B of the ingredient.

[2:50:53.260 --> 2:50:56.260]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[2:50:58.260 --> 2:51:04.260]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[2:51:04.260 --> 2:51:15.260]  Then I go, Doug, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting. ISIS is already here. I'm not waiting for these people to defend me. If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue.

[2:54:22.260 --> 2:54:33.260]  That's the founder of the Democratic Party saying that. And that's what they make us do with all the textbooks, the government-run media, the funding of it, is just push all this disinfo.
[2:54:33.260 --> 2:54:43.260]  All I'm trying to do today is get people to think outside the box. We're gonna do five minutes of overdrive so we have time to try to go to at least five or six callers of the folks that are holding.
[2:54:43.260 --> 2:54:51.260]  Have you heard about this guy in New Jersey? They got arrested for redirecting red light cameras. He said, of course, I knew I'd get arrested. I want to get him on.
[2:54:51.260 --> 2:55:01.260]  Red light rebel, how to fight back video, gets him arrested, but gets a lot of love too. The point is, is that he knew he'd win because in that state and others, they're illegal.
[2:55:01.260 --> 2:55:08.260]  It's not a sworn officer riding the summons. They're all unlawful, but they still keep putting them up because people don't know and pay.
[2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:14.260]  So it's just not a civil disobedience against criminal government activity that's going to save this country.
[2:55:14.260 --> 2:55:22.260]  So great job. We salute you. Long Island man 42 busted for tampering with traffic cameras and posting YouTube. He said who he was on the video.
[2:55:22.260 --> 2:55:26.260]  He didn't hide it, but the act like he's a criminal, New York Daily News.
[2:55:26.260 --> 2:55:32.260]  All right, going back to Steve Quayle, we're taking phone calls. Art in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:55:32.260 --> 2:55:41.260]  Hi, thank you, gentlemen. My question to Steve is prompted by a discussion he had with George Norrie earlier this year.
[2:55:41.260 --> 2:55:52.260]  And it's this, Steve, are you still expecting some sort of a Planet X appearance event early next year?
[2:55:52.260 --> 2:56:03.260]  Well, I actually expected, I think we're seeing it. We're experiencing the gravitational, the climatic and the volcanoes.
[2:56:03.260 --> 2:56:10.260]  You know, there's all kinds of pressures. I'm talking gravitational pressures and other pressures being placed on there.
[2:56:10.260 --> 2:56:17.260]  So yeah, I think you're seeing it. I can take anybody back to recorded history and even the ancients chronicled the volcanoes.
[2:56:17.260 --> 2:56:25.260]  You know, some of the biggest ones, Vesuvius, etc. You know, the point being is, is that those are all going off concurrently.
[2:56:25.260 --> 2:56:32.260]  Well, there's no doubt that there's hundreds of planets out in the Kuiper Belt. And so instead of calling them planets, they just delisted Pluto.
[2:56:32.260 --> 2:56:37.260]  There's planets two or three times the size of Pluto out there. And we know that Earth collisions happen a lot often.
[2:56:37.260 --> 2:56:42.260]  I just don't think anybody can tell exactly when that's going to happen. There's so many amateurs, astronomers.
[2:56:42.260 --> 2:56:48.260]  I would expect something gets close. People are going to see it. But thank you, Art. Appreciate your call. Adam in FEMA Region 4.
[2:56:48.260 --> 2:56:51.260]  What former state are you in, sir?
[2:56:51.260 --> 2:56:53.260]  That would be Florida, sir. How are you doing?
[2:56:53.260 --> 2:56:56.260]  Good. Go ahead. You have a question or comment for Steve Coyle?
[2:56:56.260 --> 2:57:00.260]  Well, I got so much stuff I'd love to talk about, but I'll be as fast as I can.
[2:57:00.260 --> 2:57:11.260]  Basically, on the chem trail issue, I was wondering if you think it would be a smart approach to take basically saying that, listen, the skies are meant to be clear and free of cloud.
[2:57:11.260 --> 2:57:20.260]  Here we have planes that have something coming out of the back, whether it be just a byproduct of the fuel that's combusted in the engine or something that's added or whatever.
[2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:26.260]  Can't we get environmentalists and liberals to just say, hey, what's up with all this pollution in the sky?
[2:57:26.260 --> 2:57:28.260]  No, that's the government doing that. That's good.
[2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:34.260]  Let me answer that really quick and really easy. Go to geoengineeringwatch.org.
[2:57:34.260 --> 2:57:37.260]  As the guy who broke the story about the chem trails, I can tell you this.
[2:57:37.260 --> 2:57:50.260]  There's a difference between condensation trails and chem trails, chemicals, aluminum, barium, and also human blood cells, leukocytes, and also viruses.
[2:57:50.260 --> 2:57:52.260]  People say, well, our government would never do that.
[2:57:52.260 --> 2:57:57.260]  285 times they've admitted to doing that, experimenting on servicemen.
[2:57:57.260 --> 2:58:10.260]  So again, geoengineering, and this is what a, by the way, a guy who used to live in Austin told me, four-star general, he said they are preparing the Earth's atmosphere for the return of the gods of the Samaritans.
[2:58:10.260 --> 2:58:12.260]  That's, by the way, fallen angels.
[2:58:12.260 --> 2:58:21.260]  And the thing is, Alex, when you hear that from four-star spec ops generals, you know, the bottom line is you start paying attention because what's happening?
[2:58:21.260 --> 2:58:32.260]  Who looked at the deleterious effects, Fukushima, I maintain that both the earthquake and the explosion of the reactors were absolutely generated.
[2:58:32.260 --> 2:58:33.260]  And now, the main-
[2:58:33.260 --> 2:58:37.260]  Stay there. Hold on one more segment, Steve. Stay there. Thanks, Adam. Good question.
[2:58:37.260 --> 2:58:40.260]  We're really getting outside the box today. Stay with us.
[2:58:40.260 --> 2:58:52.260]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[2:59:10.260 --> 2:59:17.260]  We're calling 888-253-3139.
[2:59:40.260 --> 3:00:00.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:00.260 --> 3:00:11.260]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:11.260 --> 3:00:18.260]  By the way, tropical storm Erica is battering the Caribbean. Florida Bahamas are on alert.
[3:00:18.260 --> 3:00:33.260]  Hurricanes have been down the last decade or so, but now they're back. But what is definitely out of control is tectonic activity around the world, and they're saying that California could be seeing a huge one very, very soon.
[3:00:33.260 --> 3:00:36.260]  We're going to be getting some experts on that next week.
[3:00:36.260 --> 3:00:48.260]  Steve Quill is our guest, SteveQuill.com. Appreciate him joining us today. We're going as many calls as we can. Get quick comments from Steve. Darien in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[3:00:48.260 --> 3:00:49.260]  Am I on?
[3:00:49.260 --> 3:00:50.260]  Yes, you are.
[3:00:50.260 --> 3:00:58.260]  All right. Yeah, I was watching Ancient Aliens the other day, and it was talking about the transhumanoid thing that, you know, with the building the cells and all that.
[3:00:58.260 --> 3:01:05.260]  What more can we do to expose the elite plan, you know, because this is just, you know, almost too far-fetched for some people to believe.
[3:01:05.260 --> 3:01:13.260]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call. People can joke around about this, but they've already created transhuman chimeros that we see about the old legends.
[3:01:13.260 --> 3:01:21.260]  So whether that was real or not, it's happening now. And because this has been pre-discredited before, just like there's no black helicopters, there's no world government.
[3:01:21.260 --> 3:01:26.260]  The Pope's not calling for world government, even when he is. Then when this stuff starts to happen, people can't believe it.
[3:01:26.260 --> 3:01:35.260]  They're already changing the earth and attacking the genetic code of the planet of the creatures on the planet across the board.
[3:01:35.260 --> 3:01:42.260]  This is a very evil plan that isn't helping the elite themselves. So, Steve Cuell?
[3:01:42.260 --> 3:01:48.260]  Well, Alex, it's a total evil plan, and it's totally from start to finish.
[3:01:48.260 --> 3:01:56.260]  The book of Revelation, which a lot of people croak, but don't want to, you know, put it into perspective, is telling us what the end times are going to be like.
[3:01:56.260 --> 3:02:04.260]  And so the idea that we're dealing with the Four Horsemen, the Apocalypse, famine, look at the whole situation with Fukushima.
[3:02:04.260 --> 3:02:12.260]  A third of the sea life, the Pacific Ocean, is actually a third of the sea life. It's just about dead or dying, yet there's nothing in the mainstream bomb at Brokers.
[3:02:12.260 --> 3:02:21.260]  And it's like, it doesn't matter. Here's what people have got to understand and act and speak out and stand up for what this country is.
[3:02:21.260 --> 3:02:27.260]  They want you dead. By the way, the name of that report was a DEGLE report, okay? DEA-GLE.
[3:02:27.260 --> 3:02:31.260]  When you and I put it on, we went out there, then they even had to put all of their caveats.
[3:02:31.260 --> 3:02:36.260]  Well, we really didn't mean it, blah, blah, blah. Believe me, that meant what it meant.
[3:02:36.260 --> 3:02:44.260]  So the population, and you talk about tectonic plate weapons, I quote, obviously, in the books I've written...
[3:02:44.260 --> 3:02:48.260]  Secretary of Defense Colin, 1997 Army Times, that they have tectonic weapons.
[3:02:48.260 --> 3:02:52.260]  I wrote that in Weather Wars. You have me on your show. By the way, that's available.
[3:02:52.260 --> 3:02:59.260]  Weather Wars, can I tell you something interesting? Weather Wars is the most important book I ever wrote a decade ago for right now.
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:05.260]  When I'm writing about transgenics and transhumanism and everything we're talking about, kind of going in the rural area,
[3:03:05.260 --> 3:03:12.260]  well, the thing is that that's right now happening, but the Weather Wars are ongoing, 285 patents.
[3:03:12.260 --> 3:03:15.260]  Alex, if people seriously read the patents on...
[3:03:15.260 --> 3:03:19.260]  There's a whole real world going on under national security. It's out of control.
[3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:22.260]  Gary in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:03:22.260 --> 3:03:23.260]  How you doing, guys?
[3:03:23.260 --> 3:03:25.260]  Go ahead, you're in our last corner.
[3:03:25.260 --> 3:03:32.260]  I hate to be the one that looks at everything that is fake or a hoax, but as far as the shooting goes yesterday,
[3:03:32.260 --> 3:03:37.260]  just when it's the media covering something that happens within the media,
[3:03:37.260 --> 3:03:42.260]  it adds multiple layers of deception and it seems to fit multiple agendas,
[3:03:42.260 --> 3:03:51.260]  but I just find it hard to believe that they didn't hear a six-foot-four, 300-pound guy walking on a wood plank deck,
[3:03:51.260 --> 3:03:56.260]  and then the reaction from the woman news reporter's boyfriend,
[3:03:56.260 --> 3:04:03.260]  I mean, I wouldn't be able to do an interview if my dog died that day, let alone my wife or my girlfriend,
[3:04:03.260 --> 3:04:06.260]  and I just wanted to know your comments on it.
[3:04:06.260 --> 3:04:13.260]  No, I mean, I don't know what to say. I mean, they've staged stuff before, so it's not discrediting the question,
[3:04:13.260 --> 3:04:17.260]  but this doesn't fit all their narratives. What do you think, Steve?
[3:04:17.260 --> 3:04:22.260]  Well, first of all, it was the statement from the shooter himself that he wants to generate a race war.
[3:04:22.260 --> 3:04:27.260]  And Alex, again, I'm not wanting that, but the bottom line is they want that.
[3:04:27.260 --> 3:04:32.260]  It has been a plan of the Russians' plan, and I'm not blaming Russians, you know?
[3:04:32.260 --> 3:04:34.260]  You're just part of the global system.
[3:04:34.260 --> 3:04:38.260]  Yeah, the bottom line is the globalist, and you've got Vladimir Putin, who by the way, I respect,
[3:04:38.260 --> 3:04:45.260]  in the sense that he's at least looking to God as represented by the Russian Orthodox Church.
[3:04:45.260 --> 3:04:49.260]  Sure, you know we're in trouble when Vladimir Putin sounds more liberty-based than who runs our country. It's amazing.
[3:04:49.260 --> 3:04:50.260]  Absolutely.
[3:04:50.260 --> 3:04:53.260]  Listen, Steve, we're out of time. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you soon.
[3:04:53.260 --> 3:05:22.260]  I'm Alan Jones. Thank you. Nally News 97, 7.
