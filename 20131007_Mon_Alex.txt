[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.460]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[00:20.460 --> 00:39.840]  Jones I'm holding in my hands here articles out of the Washington Post the
[00:39.840 --> 00:45.880]  New York Post you name it with headlines like why reporters fear team
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.780]  Obama another headline New York reporter New York Times reporter Obama
[00:51.780 --> 00:58.820]  administration most closed control freak administration I've ever covered and I
[00:58.820 --> 01:02.500]  have another headline here of the Daily Caller with a direct link to the arch
[01:02.500 --> 01:07.820]  diocese that's over all chaplains and priests and military service shut down
[01:07.820 --> 01:12.660]  in packs chapel services and they go on to say they've been threatened with
[01:12.660 --> 01:19.820]  the rest Catholic's period if they ministered anyone on the basis this is
[01:19.820 --> 01:28.820]  the ultra authoritarianism that we're dealing with and I know I already covered
[01:28.820 --> 01:34.380]  this yesterday or much of this yesterday the New York Post articles noon but I
[01:34.380 --> 01:39.220]  was sitting here looking at this a noctagon look at all this news here
[01:39.220 --> 01:46.060]  all of this is vitally important there are more than 30 stacks here some stacks
[01:46.060 --> 01:52.620]  more than 20 articles thick of just bombshell info bombshell info but out
[01:52.620 --> 01:56.260]  of it all I was sitting here right before the show started and I thought
[01:56.260 --> 02:00.660]  what is most important of all the stacks it's this stack right here because
[02:00.660 --> 02:09.460]  they're calling total tyranny absolute pure evil absolute pure manifest we're
[02:09.460 --> 02:13.220]  in deep trouble just like oh yeah they're arresting people for their speech
[02:13.220 --> 02:17.260]  and yeah they'll mean to everybody and yeah they're taking all our freedom but
[02:17.260 --> 02:22.220]  it's liberal so it's okay if Obama is able to get away with what he's getting
[02:22.220 --> 02:25.260]  away with he might actually try to stay in office I don't think that's the case
[02:25.260 --> 02:30.580]  because he's just a puppet but the globalist want dictatorial power imbued
[02:30.580 --> 02:36.860]  into the office itself so I realized we've got to impeach Obama we've got to
[02:36.860 --> 02:41.700]  bring over the Obama administration down we've got to prosecute holder for
[02:41.700 --> 02:45.260]  fast and furious and the rest of it and the Republican leadership has to be made
[02:45.260 --> 02:49.420]  to do it because they all blackmail each other that's why they hate Ted Cruz and
[02:49.420 --> 02:53.220]  Rand Paul there are no skeletons in the closet that's why they hate me there's
[02:53.220 --> 02:55.980]  nothing to make up there's nothing to dig up there's nothing there they've
[02:55.980 --> 03:03.580]  tried and that's why they hate drudge report and world net daily and folks
[03:03.580 --> 03:08.220]  like that because they don't control it but the people they do control they
[03:08.220 --> 03:13.220]  absolutely abuse openly and you can tell where they want to take us not just
[03:13.220 --> 03:16.620]  from their own literature in their own statements you can tell what the globalist
[03:16.620 --> 03:23.940]  want to take us from what they do to captive groups foster children or
[03:23.940 --> 03:29.740]  Appalachian white people or southern black folks in every case the
[03:29.740 --> 03:33.700]  technocracy that's been in control of this country really for a hundred years
[03:33.700 --> 03:39.060]  to a great extent over the scientific corridors and that's the technocratic
[03:39.060 --> 03:42.740]  elite the technological elite that Eisenhower warned about that he said
[03:42.740 --> 03:47.100]  controls the military industrial complex they always talk about that quote he
[03:47.100 --> 03:53.260]  says the technological elite that run it are the danger because he was in bed
[03:53.260 --> 03:59.820]  with them but a human had human empathy and knew the plan by 1961 folks the
[03:59.820 --> 04:04.980]  plan were under was codified shield it's been declassified to set up the
[04:04.980 --> 04:09.020]  technological tyranny and Eisenhower was creeped out by it growing up on a
[04:09.020 --> 04:14.460]  farm and I've reverse engineered the whole thing it's not hard to do the
[04:14.460 --> 04:17.820]  whole things public you just got to read all their documents and now they're
[04:17.820 --> 04:21.940]  pretty much going public with all of it but dressing it up as trendy when
[04:21.940 --> 04:27.020]  they've got a captive group they torture the living daylights out of the
[04:27.020 --> 04:32.620]  person and then finally kill them look at the foster kids look at the I use the
[04:32.620 --> 04:35.780]  syphilis example in Tuskegee and black folks because that's one of the only
[04:35.780 --> 04:38.700]  mass test people know about there's thousands but that's one of the big
[04:38.700 --> 04:42.940]  ones that people know about so I talk about that you've got a new poll out
[04:42.940 --> 04:46.580]  where more people care about Miley Cyrus and the NFL the government shutdown or

[09:27.580 --> 09:37.860]  to free will and 100% opposed to every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[09:37.860 --> 09:44.260]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live we were here of course last night 4 to 6
[09:44.260 --> 09:48.100]  p.m. central standard time with the Sunday transmission and the battle against
[09:48.100 --> 09:53.500]  the globalist never really ends but we are now live ladies and gentlemen we
[09:53.500 --> 09:59.140]  have returned and just kicked off this worldwide transmission it is the seventh
[09:59.140 --> 10:07.060]  day already of October 2013 as we hurdle towards 2014 and the open
[10:07.060 --> 10:12.780]  announcement of planetary corporate anti-human eugenics based neo feudalistic
[10:12.780 --> 10:19.180]  crony capitalism all right where to begin my friends where to start we're
[10:19.180 --> 10:22.940]  going to get into the huge events happening in the global meltdown in the
[10:22.940 --> 10:31.260]  economy today and what is happening on that front we're going to look at
[10:31.260 --> 10:36.380]  Obama running around fear mongering saying that we're going to lose the US
[10:36.380 --> 10:43.460]  credit rating if this whole Obamacare shutdown continues or if they don't raise
[10:43.460 --> 10:51.620]  the debt ceiling yet again we're also going to look at the persecution of the
[10:51.620 --> 10:56.940]  free press in this country and now the persecution of religion or the right to
[10:56.940 --> 11:02.260]  practice spiritualism across the board it's it's it's really getting the point
[11:02.260 --> 11:05.340]  where I realized that I've been conditioned to accept all this I've
[11:05.340 --> 11:09.820]  become comfortable with the tyranny not that I accept it or like it but I've
[11:09.820 --> 11:14.300]  now been living next to it so long that even though it's growing like some
[11:14.300 --> 11:20.980]  tumor on my face now I think it's part of my body and and and don't want to cut
[11:20.980 --> 11:24.660]  it off no ladies and gentlemen we need to cut it off and go through the pain
[11:24.660 --> 11:32.220]  and deal with it ladies and gentlemen but world markets are tumbling right
[11:32.220 --> 11:37.380]  now and we're going to be going over all of that in great detail here is the
[11:37.380 --> 11:43.300]  business insider headline up on info wars.com markets tumbling all around
[11:43.300 --> 11:49.620]  the world economy set to slow debt ceiling crisis grows and how do they
[11:49.620 --> 11:53.980]  hold Brazil and all these other third-world countries hostage over and
[11:53.980 --> 11:58.340]  over again since the 50s with IMF and World Bank loans at loan sharking fees
[11:58.340 --> 12:02.060]  and then the money that's loaned to them has to be given to globalist
[12:02.060 --> 12:08.140]  corporations that set up shop in the country as a direct banker payoff or
[12:08.140 --> 12:13.580]  looting to them so we're going to be discussing all of that today but first I
[12:13.580 --> 12:17.020]  want to get into something that I mentioned yesterday but that is not
[12:17.020 --> 12:22.500]  really getting any attention in the globalist controlled corporate press
[12:22.500 --> 12:28.500]  and that is that people are walking across the barriers at national parks
[12:28.500 --> 12:35.700]  at privately controlled and paid for World War two and Vietnam memorials and
[12:35.700 --> 12:40.580]  the establishment doesn't really know what to do jokes were made a few days
[12:40.580 --> 12:44.780]  ago last week that they would have helicopters hold a white sheet over
[12:44.780 --> 12:49.220]  Mount Rushmore so that you couldn't see the four presidents carved into the
[12:49.220 --> 12:53.980]  face of the mountain there but now they're actually blocking the roads
[12:53.980 --> 12:58.460]  miles and miles away that they don't even own or control the news is
[12:58.460 --> 13:03.420]  reporting show that people can't even get within close distance to see it so
[13:03.420 --> 13:09.060]  this just shows the total control freak nature of the government we've got where
[13:09.060 --> 13:14.140]  they want to dominate you they hate your freedom they absolutely hate your
[13:14.140 --> 13:19.660]  individualism and they want to totally run your life that's what New York Times
[13:19.660 --> 13:23.620]  and Washington Post reporters are saying about the Obama administration they
[13:23.620 --> 13:28.580]  are the most arrogant the most hateful the meanest if there aren't cameras
[13:28.580 --> 13:33.980]  around they don't give even a quarter tip when Obama goes to eat somewhere they
[13:33.980 --> 13:38.940]  are completely rude and hateful and the entire gaggle of criminals you know when
[13:38.940 --> 13:43.660]  you read about Larry Summers and you read about Al Gore it comes out they don't
[13:43.660 --> 13:48.300]  give tips they're rude to everyone they tell people at Bilderberg group meetings
[13:48.300 --> 13:53.220]  and it gave us don't look at the people in the eyes and if they do they get the
[13:53.220 --> 14:02.780]  person fired if a janitor or someone bumps into one of these globalists they
[14:02.780 --> 14:08.620]  have them fired I mean they are just there to hate on people we have empathy
[14:08.620 --> 14:13.220]  we care what people think we care we want people to do well the average good
[14:13.220 --> 14:17.700]  person enjoys having friends over their house barbecuing for them feeding them
[14:17.700 --> 14:21.740]  seeing people enjoy themselves set feeling of community of family of
[14:21.740 --> 14:25.860]  kinsmanship they're not into that they're not like us and that's why they
[14:25.860 --> 14:31.580]  rule over us is because we're blind to them and believe their propaganda when
[14:31.580 --> 14:37.820]  when if you study this particular Western elite that we have got you don't get
[14:37.820 --> 14:43.540]  in the club it's it's like Getty the famous billionaire on record had big
[14:43.540 --> 14:50.420]  mansions all over the world and when family when family would come to one of
[14:50.420 --> 14:54.660]  his mansions to stay he had pay phones and if they wanted to come visit him they
[14:54.660 --> 15:00.700]  have to pay for maid service or pay for food and I've been doing more reading on
[15:00.700 --> 15:06.540]  the globalist they're like that today they will try to stiff a restaurant and
[15:06.540 --> 15:10.340]  say oh your boss says it's taking care of talk to him and then the boss doesn't
[15:10.340 --> 15:13.780]  want to make a rich person you know who's known in the community mad or
[15:13.780 --> 15:21.420]  they'll they'll make family again when they come to visit pay for everything
[15:21.420 --> 15:27.380]  in fact I was talking to somebody I know who has a rich uncle that heads up a
[15:27.380 --> 15:33.620]  major top 10 bank and he says the same thing if you go to the house even though
[15:33.620 --> 15:38.140]  you're invited there they charges you to stay in the house this is because they
[15:38.140 --> 15:43.980]  can't stand you getting anything it's like a hyper competitiveness on PCP
[15:43.980 --> 15:48.420]  mixed with steroids with a rocket tied to it signed in I mean it's just it's
[15:48.420 --> 15:53.180]  it's it's it's it's total evil and they don't like you having swimming pools they
[15:53.180 --> 15:55.900]  don't like you have an air conditioning they don't like your kids being healthy
[15:55.900 --> 16:00.940]  they don't want their pleasure is that they're putting GMO into the crops their
[16:00.940 --> 16:05.140]  pleasure is they're putting fluoride in the water their pleasure is that they're
[16:05.140 --> 16:09.900]  wrecking the society their pleasure is they're promoting ugly art and devilish
[16:09.900 --> 16:14.660]  art and death their pleasure is that they're mutating society their pleasure
[16:14.660 --> 16:18.220]  is that they're cutting off the resources their pleasure is that they're
[16:18.220 --> 16:23.620]  in denturing you and your family through debt it is their pleasure it's
[16:23.620 --> 16:28.460]  Warren Buffett's pleasure in the first round of bailouts to get 48 billion
[16:28.460 --> 16:32.420]  dollars of money directly into his company of taxpayer money the first
[16:32.420 --> 16:37.460]  round he got 40 plus billion you know how much it is the last five years that
[16:37.460 --> 16:41.220]  Berkshire Hathaway and his allied companies last time I saw that it was in
[16:41.220 --> 16:49.740]  Bloomberg over four hundred billion dollars directly to that pig and Wells
[16:49.740 --> 16:56.380]  Fargo and the rest of it four hundred billion dollars one way or another of
[16:56.380 --> 17:02.100]  taxpayer backed garbage is it turns the money into garbage and he gets up there
[17:02.100 --> 17:10.260]  and finances ABC this week that airs on Sundays he finances that through the
[17:10.260 --> 17:13.700]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation it says at the end of it last time I saw it
[17:13.700 --> 17:17.500]  you can look it up they financed the Guardian they financed the New York Times
[17:17.500 --> 17:21.660]  you know most that news is paid for now and of course it's paid for with your
[17:21.660 --> 17:26.740]  tax money given to that fat pig that degenerate piece of garbage I use him
[17:26.740 --> 17:32.660]  as an example who sits up there and reportedly again stiffs people on tips
[17:32.660 --> 17:39.260]  doesn't pay his bills that's come out in the news pushes people around you know
[17:39.260 --> 17:43.780]  leaves his mama and some disgusting nursing home I've been told by high
[17:43.780 --> 17:53.260]  level people won't even take care of his mama and he he gets the taxes raised on
[17:53.260 --> 17:58.500]  poor people telling the poor people hey we're gonna get the rich people that's
[17:58.500 --> 18:02.020]  what that ABC this week always says every every week the show that I've seen
[18:02.020 --> 18:05.660]  it is oh we've got to raise taxes on the on the rich they're getting away with no

[24:14.220 --> 24:20.020]  folks let me get into the news here I start ranting about the nature of the
[24:20.020 --> 24:27.500]  globalist I start thinking about how nasty they are and how their religion is
[24:27.500 --> 24:35.340]  lying to the public I saw a commercial on selling financial instruments on CNN
[24:35.340 --> 24:39.660]  just a minute ago and I was back in the kitchen and the person was talking to
[24:39.660 --> 24:47.860]  everyone like they were two years old going we are the number one company
[24:47.860 --> 24:55.940]  that are experts at doing this and it's a feedback loop you start dumbing people
[24:55.940 --> 25:03.580]  down like that and dumbing the culture down pretty soon it actually creates a
[25:03.580 --> 25:08.020]  culture where people are mindless jellyfish and that's the system the
[25:08.020 --> 25:14.620]  globalists are going to but I've already talked about that historically the press
[25:14.620 --> 25:20.300]  in this country would have covered the man who set himself on fire at the
[25:20.300 --> 25:26.140]  National Mall here's the headline from the Associated Press it says he may have
[25:26.140 --> 25:33.860]  been protesting but other than this AP article that I saw carried in an Alabama
[25:33.860 --> 25:40.700]  newspaper I'm seeing almost no coverage witnesses who saw as a still
[25:40.700 --> 25:47.020]  unidentified man set himself on fire report hearing him say something about
[25:47.020 --> 25:54.900]  voting rights and turning to salute the Caboodle the Washington Post reports the
[25:54.900 --> 25:59.660]  man gave a military style salute before dousing himself in gasoline around 425
[25:59.660 --> 26:04.060]  p.m. local time Friday he died around 9 p.m. that night according to Metropolitan
[26:04.060 --> 26:08.820]  Police Department spokesman surprised they didn't call the police heroes or
[26:08.820 --> 26:13.580]  something for roasting weenies and marshmallows on him I mean I'm not even
[26:13.580 --> 26:18.580]  trying to joke they call themselves heroes for killing that woman and now
[26:18.580 --> 26:24.260]  the family including a retired New York detective police detective is are going
[26:24.260 --> 26:27.900]  public saying the official story isn't true she didn't ram the White House
[26:27.900 --> 26:32.260]  barricade it was the cops that rammed it she didn't shoot at him with guns we
[26:32.260 --> 26:36.660]  already know all that we already know it was all lie and now the family is
[26:36.660 --> 26:40.540]  speaking out about that she got scared ran off from an army Marine Corps
[26:40.540 --> 26:44.980]  checkpoint they're having drills in the area the news admitted it was temporary
[26:44.980 --> 26:51.460]  checkpoint got scared had postpartum depression they reportedly put her on a
[26:51.460 --> 26:55.980]  bunch of socket tropics that causes fighter flight to be jacked up and she
[26:55.980 --> 27:01.540]  ran off and she got scared people pointing guns at her of course if you
[27:01.540 --> 27:06.660]  study criminology and just basic psychology statistically women will
[27:06.660 --> 27:15.700]  either grovel attack you or run of course men will either grovel attack you or
[27:15.700 --> 27:23.180]  run but statistically women tend to run as their mechanism more than men men
[27:23.180 --> 27:27.820]  tend to just lay there in the modern society the modern culture men see a
[27:27.820 --> 27:32.060]  gun pointed at them they shut down and a lot of women do too but statistically if
[27:32.060 --> 27:36.820]  you can look this up I've seen the studies over the years women will run
[27:36.820 --> 27:39.820]  more than men especially they have a child with them they'll just take off
[27:39.820 --> 27:45.340]  they'll just bolt now when a deer sees you and get scared and bolt it's okay but
[27:45.340 --> 27:50.620]  when a woman does it you kill her and the cops were so hysterical I've already
[27:50.620 --> 27:53.740]  talked about this they're just randomly driving around down the middle of the
[27:53.740 --> 27:56.700]  street ramming into barriers it's not like they were going around a turn in
[27:56.700 --> 28:00.540]  ramming barriers they were just driving straight into barriers just like I'm
[28:00.540 --> 28:04.700]  just gonna run my car into a barrier and reportedly there were a bunch of
[28:04.700 --> 28:09.180]  crash-ups with police just driving like total psychopaths they were endangering
[28:09.180 --> 28:14.820]  the public should the public have gone after them no obviously not but it is
[28:14.820 --> 28:18.940]  some type of mental illness mass mental illness and you're gonna see more and
[28:18.940 --> 28:24.180]  more craziness but so many revolutions have started with self-immolation or
[28:24.180 --> 28:31.140]  people will go to a high rooftop and jump off at a public event to make a
[28:31.140 --> 28:35.340]  point and it is an exclamation point that we see a lot of times a revolution
[28:35.340 --> 28:39.460]  start but I thought that we would talk about it man who died after setting
[28:39.460 --> 28:43.460]  himself on fire at the National Mall may have been protesting that's really you
[28:43.460 --> 28:50.260]  think he may have been protesting and we still don't still knows that what
[28:50.260 --> 28:54.460]  happened there were five gentlemen hitting him with their t-shirts witnesses
[28:54.460 --> 29:00.980]  said when he fell over his arms were all white he was burned really bad yeah it
[29:00.980 --> 29:06.820]  looks like and I know you'd be charred from fire as well but it looks like he
[29:06.820 --> 29:11.220]  was a black man not from the fire I'm in fact I'm predicting he is a black guy
[29:11.220 --> 29:14.420]  it's not from the fire because the area where he's burned is white it's burned
[29:14.420 --> 29:22.380]  his top three layers of skin off down to the meat and he looks like a big guy
[29:22.380 --> 29:26.620]  probably looks like he's about 45 years old probably a military veteran just
[29:26.620 --> 29:31.260]  looking at his body structure in the way he looks we'll see if I'm accurate when
[29:31.260 --> 29:39.180]  it comes out I'm saying he's a 45 year old army veteran probably who shot
[29:39.180 --> 29:43.060]  himself on fire because the military isn't allowed to vote they're saying
[29:43.060 --> 29:45.460]  that's what some of what was said if it was about voting rights but we'll see
[29:45.460 --> 29:51.820]  we'll see what comes out God rest his soul we're on the march the empires on

[33:10.540 --> 33:16.740]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[33:16.740 --> 33:28.460]  GCN radio network
[33:28.460 --> 33:32.340]  all right I'm gonna try to discipline myself and actually go through what's
[33:32.340 --> 33:36.900]  happening in the world financial markets then the unrest and an attack on the
[33:36.900 --> 33:43.700]  press and the free society period that has really reached proportions that are
[33:43.700 --> 33:48.900]  staggering and if the government gets away with this the next level we'll be
[33:48.900 --> 33:53.060]  arresting people who criticize the government in mass and then a civil
[33:53.060 --> 33:57.140]  war is gonna start because everybody's not just gonna go to your FEMA camp your
[33:57.140 --> 34:01.740]  Bolshevik Run Center just because you say our free speech is illegal I mean
[34:01.740 --> 34:06.860]  they're now telling Catholic priests Methodist priests it doesn't matter
[34:06.860 --> 34:11.780]  across the board they're now telling them you will be arrested and only the
[34:11.780 --> 34:18.580]  Catholic diocese is complaining if they give communion if they pray with
[34:18.580 --> 34:22.700]  someone if they visit with someone what do you think a priest or a preacher that
[34:22.700 --> 34:26.180]  does their jobs really doing they're going to people's houses when the father
[34:26.180 --> 34:31.420]  dies or the mother dies or the kids in a car wreck or when somebody sick or when
[34:31.420 --> 34:38.260]  somebody's in the hospital I mean it's amazing and it goes on to say if you
[34:38.260 --> 34:43.100]  volunteer your time you're gonna be arrested in court-martialed I mean this
[34:43.100 --> 34:51.020]  this this really this really shows just how evil the Obama people are and it is
[34:51.020 --> 34:55.780]  the Obama people the Republicans are sold out dismantling the country they've
[34:55.780 --> 34:58.900]  been going after our guns at the top they're trying to shut down the good
[34:58.900 --> 35:03.460]  Tea Party Republicans and libertarians but compared to Obama I'm even shocked
[35:03.460 --> 35:10.860]  that I guess they're getting away with it going after pro-life groups going
[35:10.860 --> 35:16.140]  after adoption in groups going after Christian groups going after mainline
[35:16.140 --> 35:23.260]  Christian organizations and telling them you can't be 501c3 and be anti-abortion
[35:23.260 --> 35:28.780]  that's political when folks just so you know Congress shall make no law
[35:28.780 --> 35:32.540]  respecting an establishment of religion for every exercise thereof but even if
[35:32.540 --> 35:36.500]  you're a quote religious charity you have the free speech to be against

[36:59.460 --> 37:02.500]  this and I and I realize it's worse than I'm even saying there's not words to
[37:02.500 --> 37:08.300]  describe it and it's really worse than I can even describe I cannot believe how
[37:08.300 --> 37:14.340]  evil and consciously bad these people are I said I get into this I'm gonna get
[37:14.340 --> 37:21.260]  into it and we've got just just just just so much to cover here we're gonna
[37:21.260 --> 37:27.180]  have Michael Bolden on from the Tent of Image Center to talk about how the
[37:27.180 --> 37:30.780]  states can fight back at the bottom of the next hour and then we're going to
[37:30.780 --> 37:35.380]  have John McAfee on of course who's coming out with the system he says

[37:50.380 --> 37:56.500]  financial news I'm just tempted not even have a guest on in the next hour but I
[37:56.500 --> 37:59.740]  want to get the Tent of Image Center on because it's important to talk about how
[37:59.740 --> 38:03.580]  we can change things and how there there are states for a reason even if the
[38:03.580 --> 38:06.900]  government says you don't have a right to pray you do even the government says
[38:06.900 --> 38:10.500]  the states don't have any rights it's all a bluff it's all a fraud by
[38:10.500 --> 38:17.780]  consciously criminal scum by the way let me just tell listeners about some of
[38:17.780 --> 38:23.060]  the well-researched documented systems that I use to protect myself and my
[38:23.060 --> 38:30.060]  family's thyroid and overall system from the increased radiation that is in the
[38:30.060 --> 38:34.980]  northern hemisphere it's over double what it was and Fukushima reactor water
[38:34.980 --> 38:40.980]  pump has now shut down the Japan Times is reporting and and that's the big the
[38:40.980 --> 38:46.700]  big crisis is that if they if they can't get all the water pumped in to keep
[38:46.700 --> 38:51.420]  those damaged fuel rods that are stored by the tens of thousands there they will
[38:51.420 --> 38:55.860]  set on fire and and and each little fuel rod area will be much bigger than
[38:55.860 --> 38:59.900]  Chernobyl that the UN estimates has killed a million people since 1986 I
[38:59.900 --> 39:03.500]  mean that's how big this is I mean I'm actually looking at places in the
[39:03.500 --> 39:09.980]  southern hemisphere for my wife and my children okay I mean I've said I'll
[39:09.980 --> 39:13.300]  never evacuate the United States I'm going down with a ship but I am
[39:13.300 --> 39:18.500]  seriously having to look if that reactor blows up on leaving and in the
[39:18.500 --> 39:23.900]  meantime I'm taking the amazing nascent iodine can find out all the details and
[39:23.900 --> 39:28.860]  what it does an info wars life calm and also an info wars life calm and info

[39:36.820 --> 39:41.300]  tested it and know that the southern hemisphere is a lot cleaner obviously the
[39:41.300 --> 39:51.180]  northern hemisphere the point is is that the the seaweed has the receptors in the
[39:51.180 --> 39:55.540]  ocean to pull in the iodine in the nascent form as well so modify lines
[39:55.540 --> 40:00.980]  great info wars store calm info wars life calm and force life calm takes you

[41:07.780 --> 41:12.420]  video that John Bowne and Leanne McAdoo put together that promotes a great way
[41:12.420 --> 41:17.980]  to wake people up this Halloween that's coming up and again I don't celebrate
[41:17.980 --> 41:23.660]  sound one or the time that the druids all over Europe burn children in pits at
[41:23.660 --> 41:29.700]  bonfires now called bonfires but you a lot of people still go out during this
[41:29.700 --> 41:34.660]  and you could actually wear the Obama skull mask that's the cover it's big
[41:34.660 --> 41:37.940]  thick cover so you put the little rubber band cut the rubber band into use it
[41:37.940 --> 41:41.220]  and then there's also pros act the killer clown on the back and it says
[41:41.220 --> 41:45.300]  pros act the killer clown on the forehead to have a conversation piece you
[41:45.300 --> 41:48.420]  could probably strike up a lot of conversations well with these masks in
[41:48.420 --> 41:51.940]  fact I'm predicting if you were already going out on Halloween you think it's
[41:51.940 --> 41:55.620]  fun and stuff to go out be a little goblin this is the way to really meet a
[41:55.620 --> 41:58.300]  lot of people and talk to folks I'll guarantee you you're gonna have a lot
[41:58.300 --> 42:05.140]  of conversations with people about this so here's the little promo piece we put
[42:05.140 --> 42:09.460]  together and of course it's heavily political and heavily anti the tyrant
[42:09.460 --> 42:12.380]  Obama by the way did you hear Obama wants to change the name of the red
[42:12.380 --> 42:15.940]  skins he says it's racist he actually does say that if he owned it he changed
[42:15.940 --> 42:22.140]  the name but he wants to change the name well he's debating will it be the
[42:22.140 --> 42:28.260]  Bolsheviks or will it be the tyrants or should it be the scumbags or maybe the
[42:28.260 --> 42:33.180]  criminals or maybe the fraudsters I mean you guys got any ideas for names in
[42:33.180 --> 42:38.340]  fact send me it real Alex Jones on Twitter send me links you know send me
[42:38.340 --> 42:41.660]  text well what should we change the name of the Washington Redskins to the
[42:41.660 --> 42:49.700]  Washington serpents the Washington Pirates Pirates is a good name the
[42:49.700 --> 42:55.420]  Washington skulls skull and bones the Washington skull and bones the Washington
[42:55.420 --> 43:01.980]  Satan's the Washington exterminators the Washington
[43:01.980 --> 43:10.140]  warmongers the Washington how about the Washington death skins it could just be
[43:10.140 --> 43:13.260]  like a rotten dead baby on the side of their helmet and a boarded chopped up
[43:13.260 --> 43:18.580]  baby on the side that would be trendy that would be cool I'm trying to be
[43:18.580 --> 43:22.660]  trendy here I mean it could just be Obama as the devil I mean that could be
[43:22.660 --> 43:27.900]  on the side of the helmet the Washington con artist is probably the best name so
[43:27.900 --> 43:32.300]  here's that video of your radio listener you go to info wars calm and I'm
[43:32.300 --> 43:37.460]  gonna have the folks post the video up on the main site but here it is we take

[45:39.780 --> 45:44.100]  don't think they use the best shot of Jake doing a body snatcher deal cuz me
[45:44.100 --> 45:47.140]  and Jake joke around back there one of the great guys in shipping and he he
[45:47.140 --> 45:51.900]  likes to do that body snatcher stare he goes are like and so I got him to do it

[46:10.820 --> 46:14.300]  one in telegraph I thought I'd just get to that second headline I didn't finish
[46:14.300 --> 46:19.340]  up with that let me get into the economy right now I just go over some of these
[46:19.340 --> 46:23.420]  headlines for radio listeners out there the toll-free number to join us is
[46:23.420 --> 46:35.620]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 it's not like the Obamacare line it doesn't
[46:35.620 --> 46:41.260]  really spell anything out you know the Obamacare line says 1-800 literally
[46:41.260 --> 46:46.420]  f you it's what it's about and of course it's all on purpose I'm telling you it's
[46:46.420 --> 46:51.500]  all such a sick joke hurting those poor people as badly as they could you know
[46:51.500 --> 46:55.620]  last Thursday I saw that headline on Drudge and it didn't click I thought it
[46:55.620 --> 47:00.620]  was like a joke or something saying it's it's 1-800-FU and then plus I try to
[47:00.620 --> 47:03.860]  have a family show so I didn't go there for whatever reason and then after the
[47:03.860 --> 47:16.100]  show I looked at it I went wait a minute it actually does spell that out and
[47:16.100 --> 47:20.580]  Obama always does that thing that her older Rivera did and I got arrested
[47:20.580 --> 47:23.940]  protesting him where he actually he's scratching his eye but flips you off he
[47:23.940 --> 47:30.260]  just does that to his constituents and the hotline set up for those waiting to
[47:30.260 --> 47:34.420]  learn more about insurance options made available under the portable car actually
[47:34.420 --> 47:37.620]  that that name's a joke it's already doubled the prices spells out an
[47:37.620 --> 47:47.660]  unfortunate insult on the telephone keep that man I tell you they even
[47:47.660 --> 47:53.340]  spelled it out twice in code all right that's enough just just I can't deal
[47:53.340 --> 48:01.820]  with it anymore let's get into the big the big hammering they're giving us
[48:01.820 --> 48:08.420]  markets tumbling all around the world economy set to slow debt ceiling crisis
[48:08.420 --> 48:12.500]  grows yes and they're saying that if you don't up the debt ceiling and don't give
[48:12.500 --> 48:16.620]  them obama care that that's why the world markets are set to tumble even though
[48:16.620 --> 48:20.460]  everybody knew with the QE 3 the markets have continued to really be
[48:20.460 --> 48:25.780]  degenerating even though there's a sugar high of above 15,000 points that's
[48:25.780 --> 48:30.220]  now gone below on the Dow Jones industrial average and remember they're
[48:30.220 --> 48:37.620]  buying all of those stocks and bonds and things with devalued dollars so the
[48:37.620 --> 48:41.060]  stock market really is about 7,000 points according to a lot of economists
[48:41.060 --> 48:45.420]  we've talked to I mean I took my children rock climbing one of those indoor
[48:45.420 --> 48:51.820]  rock climbing places guess how much the bottle water was it in the vending
[48:51.820 --> 49:02.420]  machines it was $3 $3 folks a Gatorade was $4 $4 and I know why it's $4 it's
[49:02.420 --> 49:08.100]  because the dollar isn't worth what it used to be it's lost 93% of its value
[49:08.100 --> 49:13.580]  from 1913 to 2008 guess what the dollar you can pull up the dollar graph from
[49:13.580 --> 49:20.180]  1913 actually show it to viewers since they devalued the currency you know that
[49:20.180 --> 49:25.940]  last 3% of what people thought the dollar's value was that's why you could
[49:25.940 --> 49:30.540]  go in the 50s and get a hamburger and fries and a bottomless coca-cola for
[49:30.540 --> 49:36.980]  25 cents now that'd be like $10 if you're lucky at a nice hamburger place
[49:36.980 --> 49:45.340]  15 bucks see quarter 15 bucks quarter $10 brand-new Mustang the 1950s was
[49:45.340 --> 49:51.780]  couple thousand dollars maybe now it's 40,000 if you want to load it up yes
[49:51.780 --> 49:57.020]  there is the devaluation of the dollar up till 2002 and you can see they're a
[49:57.020 --> 50:03.420]  95% reduction but by 2008 it was 97% reduction and if you look at one of the
[50:03.420 --> 50:12.380]  new graphs it is now 99% and we're all just holding on to that last 1% and the
[50:12.380 --> 50:15.660]  media is up there the controlled globalist media saying there's no
[50:15.660 --> 50:22.660]  devaluation the dollars strong as ever I shouldn't laugh but at least the real
[50:22.660 --> 50:28.180]  estate's up again in many areas yeah because of the inflation and because the
[50:28.180 --> 50:32.100]  inflation and property tax government wants to keep valuing it up and up and
[50:32.100 --> 50:36.420]  so does the other marketers I'm telling you when the economy goes belly up it is
[50:36.420 --> 50:42.180]  going to be spectacular it may even be the breakdown of society the Swiss army
[50:42.180 --> 50:45.820]  thinks that's going to happen so they're bolstering their forces for Europe to
[50:45.820 --> 50:50.340]  collapse and they have orders to mow the Germans and the French and the
[50:50.340 --> 50:56.260]  Italians and others down when they try to pour in telling you Switzerland might

[54:43.500 --> 54:47.860]  park rangers ordered to keep visitors out of privately run businesses they're
[54:47.860 --> 54:54.900]  closing pull-offs to bar views of Mount Rushmore not even federal property but
[54:54.900 --> 54:59.500]  it doesn't matter just wait till they've got full control over the economy which
[54:59.500 --> 55:06.140]  they've almost got and it continues 83% of federal government still operating
[55:06.140 --> 55:10.300]  only the parts that the slaves get and by the way when you go to a national park
[55:10.300 --> 55:14.740]  they literally henpeck you and treat you like trash to let you know you're
[55:14.740 --> 55:20.460]  scum openly that's why they the park services calling for all the beaches to
[55:20.460 --> 55:24.900]  be shut down nationwide that humans not be allowed to hurt the ocean oh the
[55:24.900 --> 55:30.780]  proposal two years ago was to shut them all down to swimming but they just said
[55:30.780 --> 55:36.220]  no no we'll have in one area 80% of the beach will be off limits to swimming to
[55:36.220 --> 55:42.300]  give the ocean a rest no it's all about dominating you and teaching you what
[55:42.300 --> 55:49.020]  scum you are and so again they blocked Mount Rushmore and now they've actually
[55:49.020 --> 55:57.540]  blocked miles away the pull-offs the pull-offs so you can't pull off and see
[55:57.540 --> 56:03.060]  it do you understand scum because they have to have the illusion that something's
[56:03.060 --> 56:07.100]  being shut down nothing's being shut down trillions every few months are
[56:07.100 --> 56:10.260]  sucked out to foreign banks I watched the banking hearings in the House and

[56:48.060 --> 56:52.180]  in control we need to make them more poor we need him and finally they turned
[56:52.180 --> 56:55.460]  against him that's what they do and they're shutting down our power plants

[57:56.740 --> 58:02.100]  banks while he publicly afterwards said he was against it and is more on

[1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:42.300]  ahead Alex Jones I'm a nurse in California I live in Placerville I commute 50
[1:01:42.300 --> 1:01:49.180]  miles down to Sacramento every day six days a week I have on my car impeachment
[1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:55.980]  stickers I have info wars prison planet I'm going to be making a bumper sticker
[1:01:55.980 --> 1:02:03.700]  that says got truth and then underneath it info wars calm so I'm basically an
[1:02:03.700 --> 1:02:10.260]  advertisement for info wars all that sounds pretty racist yeah and I just
[1:02:10.260 --> 1:02:17.100]  want to wake up my fellow nurses I it's pretty pathetic I work for a major HMO
[1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:22.420]  and most of the nurses just don't have a clue they're clueless let me ask you
[1:02:22.420 --> 1:02:26.980]  this what is your take as an expert is living it on Obamacare and we know the
[1:02:26.980 --> 1:02:32.980]  premiums are already doubling but how is this affecting your patients well I
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:38.020]  actually I'm trained emergency room but I work at a call center now because of
[1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:45.220]  an injury and we have to give out advice that I just it it's pathetic because a
[1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:50.140]  lot of the advice is you know on vaccines and things that are really not
[1:02:50.140 --> 1:02:54.940]  healthy and trying to wake up the nurses I have stickers on my desk about
[1:02:54.940 --> 1:03:01.860]  fluoride aspartame I can't put anything on vaccines or I'd probably lose my job
[1:03:01.860 --> 1:03:07.260]  but there will eventually be forced vaccines for the workers for the
[1:03:07.260 --> 1:03:13.420]  everybody that works in the clinics and I know that's coming I don't know you
[1:03:13.420 --> 1:03:22.300]  know what I can do about it but well I mean what do you think you should do
[1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:28.300]  well I I'm doing the best I can trying to get the word out what I would
[1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:32.940]  recommend their nurses to do or any students in any any college if they're
[1:03:32.940 --> 1:03:37.780]  giving research papers presentations I would highly recommend that they do
[1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:44.500]  research papers on things like chemtrails fluoride the phenol A aspartame
[1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:48.780]  just try to get the word out that way so people can start to wake up and see
[1:03:48.780 --> 1:03:56.180]  that our government is corrupt EPA and FDA are totally corrupt and just try to
[1:03:56.180 --> 1:04:00.940]  get the word out that way absolutely absolutely we'll just keep it up and
[1:04:00.940 --> 1:04:04.100]  God bless you good to hear from me we're gonna come back ladies and gentlemen
[1:04:04.100 --> 1:04:08.020]  everything just clicked for me while she was talking I wasn't ignoring her but I
[1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:12.820]  was halfway listening just because it's so stunning I saw this headline was
[1:04:12.820 --> 1:04:16.700]  government amber alert offline notice of fake I'm not even gonna try to call

[1:04:38.220 --> 1:04:41.980]  fake and this is what I noticed I'm no IT guy but I've learned a lot about it
[1:04:41.980 --> 1:04:45.420]  about the National Park Services shutting down all their sites and saying
[1:04:45.420 --> 1:04:49.460]  it shut down the sites are all still there they're still running they just
[1:04:49.460 --> 1:04:54.700]  block access to it and that's what the Justice Department got caught doing they
[1:04:54.700 --> 1:05:00.140]  went and deliberately shut it down they've been caught wow this is big

[1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:45.300]  prisonplanet.com by Steve Watson and as the overall omnibus director or editor
[1:08:45.300 --> 1:08:51.380]  chief cook and bottle washer I didn't even try to contact Steve Watson in
[1:08:51.380 --> 1:08:55.300]  England in Albion in Britannia a great writer and political scientist that he
[1:08:55.300 --> 1:09:01.500]  is I just ran into a Don Salazar and had him change the headline because it's
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:06.620]  not hardcore enough all the data just clicked and we've got to add this to the
[1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:10.700]  story I've got a Don adding it right now or if Steve's listening he can talk to
[1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:15.820]  a Don he can do it but I know there's six hours ahead Steve probably just got off
[1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:19.700]  his brother won't be getting off till midnight because wild horses can't drag
[1:09:19.700 --> 1:09:24.260]  old Paul Watson away he is absolutely in it to win it Steve's awesome as well
[1:09:24.260 --> 1:09:28.460]  just as smart as his brother's as he doesn't work 18 hours a day like Paul my
[1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:34.940]  point is and I'm digressing this is so massive ladies and gentlemen you know
[1:09:34.940 --> 1:09:43.460]  it's come out that they're blocking memorials World War two Korea Vietnam
[1:09:43.460 --> 1:09:47.140]  that aren't even federally paid for a run they're blocking Mount Vernon that's
[1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:50.340]  privately contracted and run they're blocking the Grand Canyon that has
[1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:54.820]  privately contracted and run to hotels and security and everything else they
[1:09:54.820 --> 1:10:01.100]  are blocking hundreds of resorts scores of monuments and now Mount Rushmore the
[1:10:01.100 --> 1:10:04.580]  joke started last week will Obama have a white sheet in front of it with
[1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:10.620]  helicopters so you can't see the four presidents carved into stone well guess
[1:10:10.620 --> 1:10:16.580]  what's happened they have gone on non-federal property miles away and are
[1:10:16.580 --> 1:10:22.220]  putting up barricades on mountain pull-offs so that families can't pull off
[1:10:22.220 --> 1:10:28.900]  and can't see it and I'm telling you that is the spirit now at the Grand Canyon
[1:10:28.900 --> 1:10:35.140]  and at the Texas Coast the last two national parks I've been to Grand Canyon
[1:10:35.140 --> 1:10:42.100]  Big Bend the Texas Coast I guess that's three they will come out of their way to
[1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:45.580]  treat you like garbage I mean they will come over and I thought well it's just
[1:10:45.580 --> 1:10:51.980]  because I'm a man one-time hiking no they go up to women families boss people
[1:10:51.980 --> 1:10:57.260]  around I mean it's like North Korea in fact I've never been anywhere in the
[1:10:57.260 --> 1:11:02.180]  world where they treat people this this bad first place I ever saw it was a
[1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:07.740]  decade ago in DC where you'd be taking video of the Washington Monument in the
[1:11:07.740 --> 1:11:11.860]  middle of a field and the cops would walk over and say you can't film who
[1:11:11.860 --> 1:11:16.300]  you filming for and I'm like well I'm actually have a TV show oh you need a
[1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:21.980]  permit well no they don't give permits in DC don't get smart with me buddy I'm
[1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:27.220]  like but you know that he goes I don't care get out of here and you're like
[1:11:27.220 --> 1:11:32.620]  wow you really are a tyrant they put their hand on their gun they go listen
[1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:35.820]  you want to do this the easy way or the hard way and then you see them do it to
[1:11:35.820 --> 1:11:40.980]  families with kids I mean this country is so pathetic I mean we are not the land
[1:11:40.980 --> 1:11:45.140]  of the free home of the brave we will put up with anything and people think
[1:11:45.140 --> 1:11:48.940]  groveling the government gets the government to be nice to you no it's
[1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:56.380]  the opposite I'll never forget being in New York again ten years ago maybe 11
[1:11:56.380 --> 1:12:03.500]  years ago and asking a cop sir do you know where this is and the guy yelling
[1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:11.660]  and saying do I look like a phone book you don't talk to God Moses had to do it
[1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:16.620]  through a burning bush and only saw God's you know from the angle yeah I
[1:12:16.620 --> 1:12:20.580]  mean I believe now that we probably should be executed if we look at a
[1:12:20.580 --> 1:12:26.540]  government person I'm serious they are God they are king they made the sun come
[1:12:26.540 --> 1:12:31.940]  up they had me they built the planet they did it all George Washington as the
[1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:37.140]  Army training manual say is a bad man I agree with him this isn't absurd this
[1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:41.780]  isn't satire what is I'm not this is not absurdist this is not satire they're
[1:12:41.780 --> 1:12:48.060]  really doing all of this I said I'd go to your calls just my brain exploded into
[1:12:48.060 --> 1:12:55.540]  a kaleidoscope a cornucopia a spectrum a galaxy of points when I saw the headline
[1:12:55.540 --> 1:13:02.260]  up on info wars.com was government amber alert offline notice of fake and the
[1:13:02.260 --> 1:13:06.100]  headline doesn't exactly make sense because it was a fake by the Justice
[1:13:06.100 --> 1:13:10.340]  Department but it makes it sound like it was a fake total so I've had it
[1:13:10.340 --> 1:13:14.100]  changed it should be up by now tell them go ahead and update it before the
[1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:18.460]  stuff I wrote I had them record something I want to add to the article but I
[1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:20.900]  don't want to wait I want to just change the headline now and then update it
[1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:25.660]  later because then I read it and then I saw what the tech people were saying and
[1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:31.900]  and went and looked at it and indeed it's just a fake screen up there with a
[1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:36.940]  whole amber alert site behind it and any type of web person knows how to go
[1:13:36.940 --> 1:13:42.140]  find the root and actually find the site so the sites up the sites running it's
[1:13:42.140 --> 1:13:45.380]  actually there the amber alerts are still running it's part of essential
[1:13:45.380 --> 1:13:51.860]  functions 83% of the government and they just put that up to create the hoax the
[1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:55.940]  fraud these are criminals that ship guns to Mexico to kill people so they could
[1:13:55.940 --> 1:14:01.420]  blame the Second Amendment. I mean this is so incredible and I just got a
[1:14:01.420 --> 1:14:09.500]  massive headache basically when I saw the article because it made me so
[1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:13.540]  incredibly angry there it is that the article has been changed justice
[1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:18.260]  department caught in amber alert takedown hoax website restored after public
[1:14:18.260 --> 1:14:25.620]  discovered sites were up but being rerouted unbelievable note from Alex
[1:14:25.620 --> 1:14:29.540]  Jones man I don't wrote that fast off my recording this is part of a criminal
[1:14:29.540 --> 1:14:33.860]  pattern of obstruction to taxpayer funded services as with Mount Rushmore
[1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:40.300]  highway pull-offs and boat ramps on the Mississippi are being blocked you
[1:14:40.300 --> 1:14:45.300]  probably want to say as in Mount Rushmore in the state it's in and highway
[1:14:45.300 --> 1:14:49.380]  pull-offs and boat ramps in Mississippi being blocked the system wants to make
[1:14:49.380 --> 1:14:53.620]  the shutdown as painful for the American people as possible as National Park
[1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:57.460]  Service Rangers have admitted this is outright criminal because the amber
[1:14:57.460 --> 1:15:01.460]  alert site is still up they're simply blocking it and then we're going to add
[1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:05.940]  a link in there to the good Park Service person who I bet will get audited or
[1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:09.500]  killed I'm not kidding when you work for them and you go against them they will
[1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:13.100]  kill you I'm not kidding it's like you belong to them now they have these weird
[1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:16.860]  rules and they've had senior Park Rangers say it's disgusting we've been
[1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:20.180]  ordered to make things painful because they're not all criminals and I've
[1:15:20.180 --> 1:15:23.180]  still run into Park Rangers that are high how you doing oh don't give me
[1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:27.060]  directions that are nice but compared to how they were just 10 15 years ago when
[1:15:27.060 --> 1:15:33.380]  I would go is night and day when I was a kid the Park Rangers were so cool and
[1:15:33.380 --> 1:15:38.260]  and would it would help you and tell you cool stories and now I mean it's just
[1:15:38.260 --> 1:15:41.700]  disgusting there it is National Park Rangers ordered to keep visitors out
[1:15:41.700 --> 1:15:46.260]  of privately run businesses and they go on to say it is disgusting and that they've
[1:15:46.260 --> 1:15:52.020]  been quote ordered the headline is ordered to make it uncomfortable and I've
[1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:56.380]  got so much news folks Obama is holding the country hostage now going on and
[1:15:56.380 --> 1:16:00.420]  giving a speech last Thursday making statements yesterday that we're going to
[1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:03.900]  default if they don't raise the debt limit or they keep the government shut
[1:16:03.900 --> 1:16:08.940]  down which of course when the president starts talking about defaults and bad
[1:16:08.940 --> 1:16:12.620]  markets of course the stock market went down today stock markets went on
[1:16:12.620 --> 1:16:17.700]  everywhere and then he says see I told you so when he's the one signaling it
[1:16:17.700 --> 1:16:22.900]  outrageous they are threatening to scuttle everything if we don't give him
[1:16:22.900 --> 1:16:25.700]  what they want but here's the deal they're gonna scuttle it anyways they're
[1:16:25.700 --> 1:16:29.860]  gonna wreck us anyways so all we got to do is say go ahead you little terrorist
[1:16:29.860 --> 1:16:36.980]  go ahead and shut down whatever you want scum you've ever been in a
[1:16:36.980 --> 1:16:39.700]  relationship
[1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:47.020]  where where where somebody says who you thought was nice and they get really
[1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:51.140]  nasty and they threaten you and that's when the relationship's over for good
[1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:59.740]  with me bam boom it's over and I had a couple girlfriends out of many many
[1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:03.940]  people I dated it was always when you were really serious with somebody and
[1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:07.780]  repeatedly it's like if you leave me I'm gonna call the police on you and say
[1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:11.700]  you're beating me I had that happen twice and I went you're the person that
[1:17:11.700 --> 1:17:15.380]  punches me and that's why I don't like this and claws at me and stuff and throws
[1:17:15.380 --> 1:17:20.980]  things at me I'm I am you know don't come over to my house anymore my
[1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:28.300]  apartment anymore and when someone tries to hold you hostage it just absolutely
[1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:34.620]  makes you angry so I'm like good column you liar and the point is is that this
[1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:38.740]  is what this is like but I can't leave Obama I can't get the government out of
[1:17:38.740 --> 1:17:42.780]  my life I can't get him off my back I mean if some restaurant gives you bad
[1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:46.260]  service you don't go back there if some company cheats you you don't do business
[1:17:46.260 --> 1:17:53.460]  again and you speak out against them give them bad word of mouth but I mean
[1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:57.380]  the New World Order is I can't get it out of my life and I know you're sick of
[1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:01.020]  it too you can't get them out of your life and and that's the feeling of being
[1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:06.220]  trapped with this abusive relationship with these people that live off of us
[1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:09.860]  and then treat us like garbage at the same time we're going exactly through
[1:18:09.860 --> 1:18:13.620]  what our founders went through and so many other cultures went through it's
[1:18:13.620 --> 1:18:17.660]  called slavery folks just like black people being slaves in this country or
[1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:22.660]  Europeans being feudal surf slaves or in the Navy the British the French that
[1:18:22.660 --> 1:18:26.940]  all the major navies of Europe went and grabbed men and children off the street
[1:18:26.940 --> 1:18:31.260]  and they called it impress me because it's illegal to have a white slave you
[1:18:31.260 --> 1:18:34.340]  just you just chain them up and beat them if they don't do the work you want
[1:18:34.340 --> 1:18:39.220]  cat or nine tails same deal I mean they were doing impress me when in England
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:43.980]  get rid of impressmen I think it was in 1812 I think because another war
[1:18:43.980 --> 1:18:49.020]  happened with England partially over that the war of 1812 and I think England
[1:18:49.020 --> 1:18:52.420]  got rid of impressmen in 1812 let's look it up but what do you think the draft is
[1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:56.220]  that's another form of impressmen but we put up with it if a foreign enemies
[1:18:56.220 --> 1:18:59.460]  attacking us well we've got to do this you shouldn't have to be drafted you
[1:18:59.460 --> 1:19:05.500]  should go join you see but the elites never want to be part of the fighting
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:10.340]  once you you have a corrupt system in the old days people wouldn't go to war
[1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:14.620]  unless the king saddled up at the head of the troops ladies and gentlemen plus
[1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:18.340]  it was the form of entertainment to be in war those are real men back then they
[1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:21.660]  wanted to go being a fight I mean you wanted to go start wars just so they
[1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:25.860]  could go kill each other but see now we have fluoride in our water maybe that
[1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:30.060]  argument is it's good for us that they've dumbed us down yep there you go
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:33.460]  the impressmen of semen for American ships caused serious tensions when
[1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:36.740]  Britain the United States in the years leading up to the war of 1812 and after
[1:19:36.740 --> 1:19:41.420]  the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 Britain ended the practice and never resumed it
[1:19:41.420 --> 1:19:46.060]  but they really officially ended it in 1814 but there were so many riots over
[1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:49.500]  impressmen in London and dad's going crazy when their 10-year-old got grabbed
[1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:54.020]  up the front porch my point is it's the same deal get off our backs you don't
[1:19:54.020 --> 1:19:59.540]  own us we are awake and we're tired of it I'm not your slave get it through your

[1:24:17.940 --> 1:24:25.060]  did a bad-bad thing bad-bad thing baby did a bad-bad thing yeah it's called
[1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:29.140]  Obamacare baby did a bad-bad thing it's called putting fluoride the water baby
[1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:33.460]  it's called putting cancer viruses in the vaccines
[1:24:35.060 --> 1:24:40.300]  well no I don't love the new world order and I wish they were off my back I don't
[1:24:40.300 --> 1:24:44.380]  want them to be here abusing me I want them out of my life off the planet
[1:24:44.380 --> 1:24:51.820]  preferably on a deserted island with themselves I'm trying to find my stack
[1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:55.300]  that I was said I was gonna mention I'm going to your calls right now I have a
[1:24:55.300 --> 1:25:01.140]  whole stack of persecution of the press and persecution of people for their
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:05.420]  religious beliefs I'm gonna get to that I'm going to find that but the reason I
[1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:09.180]  raised it is it has the new ATF book about fast and furious where they're
[1:25:09.180 --> 1:25:12.900]  threatening to not let the book come out and even talking about prosecuting
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:17.540]  people if they released that it was premeditated and done on purpose that's
[1:25:17.540 --> 1:25:23.220]  already known anyways but it just shows what a group of criminals they are using
[1:25:23.220 --> 1:25:27.860]  so-called laws to persecute the press and I for one have had enough of it let's
[1:25:27.860 --> 1:25:34.140]  go to Carl in Washington Carl you're on the air welcome hey Alex can you hear me
[1:25:34.140 --> 1:25:39.620]  I can hear you loud and clear all right I have a couple questions did you see
[1:25:39.620 --> 1:25:47.300]  anything about this the New Republic and Obama talking about resolving Congress
[1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:52.980]  here in the next couple weeks if they don't solve this debt ceiling thing
[1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:57.860]  and I'll ask you the other question if you want to watch the headline from New
[1:25:57.860 --> 1:26:01.900]  Republic just something like Obama to dissolve Congress guys check that thank
[1:26:01.900 --> 1:26:06.940]  you yeah yeah there's two or two or three of them online there I just just
[1:26:06.940 --> 1:26:10.420]  found it to give myself well I haven't seen that yet but that sounds like
[1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:14.380]  something they do I mean they've said before if Congress won't act on guns
[1:26:14.380 --> 1:26:18.180]  we'll just do it or if Congress won't let us attack a country we'll just do it
[1:26:18.180 --> 1:26:22.300]  it's all part of the ongoing power grabbing that's happening just that
[1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:28.980]  happened about 20 years ago in Russia actually where they actually even
[1:26:28.980 --> 1:26:35.820]  turned guns on the building because of the Congress and everything we're
[1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:42.660]  refusing to leave yeah no that was in 1991 Boris Yeltsin and all that yeah and
[1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:48.420]  Boris Yeltsin on top the tanks but but that was the new elected government
[1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:56.100]  kicking out the old Politburo, Duma, Communists that were ignoring the
[1:26:56.100 --> 1:27:00.980]  election it's the opposite and I'm not calling for this I mean it's grand
[1:27:00.980 --> 1:27:04.740]  juries need to do it of course they'll kill whoever tries it you should have
[1:27:04.740 --> 1:27:08.900]  Obama and his cohorts should be arrested the problem and then all the
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:13.180]  corruption comes down and the power structure doesn't want that but they're
[1:27:13.180 --> 1:27:18.300]  gonna have to do it at some point because tyranny will wreck everything even
[1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:22.620]  the good deal the criminals have going criminals always eat through the hull
[1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:26.420]  of the ship and then the whole thing sinks and that's basically what's
[1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:29.580]  happening but we'll check that that's New Republic and what was the headline
[1:27:29.580 --> 1:27:38.140]  we're gonna look it up Obama could dissolve Congress Obama should dissolve
[1:27:38.140 --> 1:27:43.140]  Congress all right I'll look that up and I guess that'd be in the news function
[1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:49.180]  folks if you want to look for it that way go ahead I ran into this a couple of
[1:27:49.180 --> 1:27:53.980]  times in the last two weeks and before that it never even heard of it but you
[1:27:53.980 --> 1:28:00.740]  know anything about the I'm gonna say cook brother KOC eight and how they
[1:28:00.740 --> 1:28:05.940]  relate to the tea party say that again sir I wasn't ignoring you I was pulling
[1:28:05.940 --> 1:28:10.020]  up the article I hear what that you're talking about say that again yeah I ran
[1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:13.700]  into this couple couple times in the last two weeks the other before that
[1:28:13.700 --> 1:28:19.540]  never even heard of it but the cook brothers KOC eight or and how they
[1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:23.100]  relate to the tea party oh you're talking about the coke brothers yeah the
[1:28:23.100 --> 1:28:30.060]  coke brothers have funded the Democrats as well as the Republicans and they're
[1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:34.300]  just basically a political but they're not complete communist and they own
[1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:38.820]  their own big empire in oil and gas and plastic and paper and you name it and
[1:28:38.820 --> 1:28:43.260]  there's other mafias trying to muscle them out but they've had their pipeline
[1:28:43.260 --> 1:28:46.620]  down to Texas shut down which I'd like to have a pipeline like that more oil
[1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:51.900]  from Canada I said a Saudi Arabia but regardless it becomes a political
[1:28:51.900 --> 1:28:55.140]  boogeyman for the controlled left to act like they're actually running
[1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:58.940]  everything when they're just part of it and part of the power structure but
[1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:03.140]  they actually supported Bill Clinton they were big supporters of Bill Clinton
[1:29:03.140 --> 1:29:07.660]  they rode that train to fame and power I mean any big combine is going to be
[1:29:07.660 --> 1:29:10.860]  working in government to protect their interests but also shut down their
[1:29:10.860 --> 1:29:17.540]  competition but of all the virulent forms of centralized mega rich they're on a
[1:29:17.540 --> 1:29:22.380]  scale of 1 to 10 of being inside operators I'm making about a 4 or as
[1:29:22.380 --> 1:29:27.300]  Warren Buffett's a 10 David Rockefeller's a 10 Lord Rothschild's a 10 I mean
[1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:32.020]  they're in there driving the agenda the globalists hate the coke brothers because
[1:29:32.020 --> 1:29:36.380]  they're not for carbon taxes because that would hurt their business I mean it
[1:29:36.380 --> 1:29:39.780]  really comes down to that and it gets even more sophisticated than that but I
[1:29:39.780 --> 1:29:44.500]  hope that answers your question but yeah here it is New Republic calling for
[1:29:44.500 --> 1:29:48.780]  Obama to dissolve Congress we'll give you more about that when we come back

[1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:22.260]  Texas and over in the UK as well as many other great contributors the news sites
[1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:27.580]  are info wars.com and prisonplanet.com by the way info wars is an eight-year-old
[1:34:27.580 --> 1:34:31.660]  design Kurt Nemo did a great job redesigning in eight years ago he's
[1:34:31.660 --> 1:34:35.740]  working about 20 feet away from around to that wall but we are redesigning
[1:34:35.740 --> 1:34:39.780]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com to the latest design with all the latest
[1:34:39.780 --> 1:34:43.380]  functions we're just always so busy doing other stuff we never get around to it
[1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:48.900]  we'll first have prisonplanet in the next couple weeks beta testing something
[1:34:48.900 --> 1:34:53.500]  and then we're going to move it over to info wars.com and it basically looks
[1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:59.420]  like time magazine meets the London Guardian so folks should certainly like
[1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:04.500]  that where's the contents different we're not you know having stuff about how
[1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:08.060]  great it is to euthanize old people or anything and there we're not trendy we're
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:12.700]  not humanitarians we're not for killing innocent people and forced testing on
[1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:18.460]  the population and eugenics so we're we're kind of bad folks speaking of that
[1:35:18.460 --> 1:35:24.140]  ladies and gentlemen nason iodine from all the scientists and medical doctors
[1:35:24.140 --> 1:35:28.460]  and nutritionists that I've talked to that you've heard on air it just keeps
[1:35:28.460 --> 1:35:33.100]  coming up that this is the stuff and you can't find this in stores it's
[1:35:33.100 --> 1:35:36.820]  something that's only really been rediscovered since the mid 90s we're
[1:35:36.820 --> 1:35:40.180]  actually talking to the guy that repopularized it back in the mid-1990s
[1:35:40.180 --> 1:35:46.100]  we're gonna have him on soon because this is the the atomic form of iodine by
[1:35:46.100 --> 1:35:50.860]  atomic it's not radioactive it is on the periodic table or on the you know
[1:35:50.860 --> 1:35:56.740]  breakdown of minerals and things the body needs it is pure it is it is the
[1:35:56.740 --> 1:36:01.380]  actual you know elemental form not something made artificially in a
[1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:05.660]  laboratory okay you know regular iodine you put it on something will rust
[1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:09.420]  through metal basically this doesn't do that this is real iodine we have double
[1:36:09.420 --> 1:36:14.500]  strength at half the cost info wars store.com to find the modifying seaweed

[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:45.740]  trying to make things better and I'm living a fulfilled life I'm not gonna
[1:37:45.740 --> 1:37:49.780]  let the globalists get me down I'm gonna beat them and that's the attitude you
[1:37:49.780 --> 1:37:52.780]  need to have I know a lot of you do have that attitude these people have jumped
[1:37:52.780 --> 1:37:57.180]  the collective shark and they're out of control in fact I found the stack of news
[1:37:57.180 --> 1:38:01.420]  that I had that I'll get into with our guest about the persecution of the press
[1:38:01.420 --> 1:38:04.860]  and the government and the media most people in the federal government are
[1:38:04.860 --> 1:38:08.380]  actually awake and aren't that bad actually from the numbers I've seen they
[1:38:08.380 --> 1:38:12.220]  are just absolutely under a reign of terror and and and the globalists I
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:16.100]  think have miscalculated with all this abuse the tighter they squeeze the more
[1:38:16.100 --> 1:38:19.500]  people are going to wake up we're going to get into all of that I wanted to get
[1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:24.860]  Michael Bolden on the founder and director of the Tent Amendment Center
[1:38:24.860 --> 1:38:27.620]  because they do a lot of great work and we've interviewed his folks before
[1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:34.700]  intimatecenter.com because it really is about states rights and sure enough a
[1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:39.860]  caller called in free republic free republics a great online website a new
[1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:44.860]  republic is the socialist establishment new world order trendy crowd and the
[1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:49.580]  magazine they did actually come up with an article calling for Obama to basically
[1:38:49.580 --> 1:38:54.740]  attack Congress like Boris Yeltsin attacked the Russian Parliament and I
[1:38:54.740 --> 1:39:01.220]  guess blow it up the it's two Russians walk into a parliamentary crisis and
[1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:05.420]  then it's got a big image of Yeltsin and they say that's the way to handle it
[1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:13.060]  just have Obama take over so and he keeps saying you know if Congress wasn't
[1:39:13.060 --> 1:39:16.660]  there I could get this stuff done and then watchdog.org says did the new
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:21.180]  Republic call for Obama to dissolve Congress apparently that is what the
[1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:27.220]  Republic thinks about our old Republic in a post Wednesday afternoon Julie
[1:39:27.220 --> 1:39:34.860]  Awful Julie Ioff I think say said but she is an awful person made a not so
[1:39:34.860 --> 1:39:38.220]  subtle suggestion about how she thinks the chief executive should handle
[1:39:38.220 --> 1:39:42.780]  opposition from democratically elected legislators she goes in showing the
[1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:49.700]  parliament blown up on fire wow and it's a serious article I mean these people are
[1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:54.860]  authoritarian fruits by the way they already tell us that the states don't
[1:39:54.860 --> 1:39:58.900]  even exist they're not even vestigial they never matter I mean states have no
[1:39:58.900 --> 1:40:03.340]  rights but to be toilet paper for the executive run by foreign banks well now
[1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:08.260]  they're saying the Congress shouldn't even be there mommy is it true that once
[1:40:08.260 --> 1:40:13.140]  there was a three ranches of government and not our supreme leader Kim Jong on
[1:40:13.140 --> 1:40:17.860]  the 19th honey that's a thought crime the monitor systems picked it up you'll
[1:40:17.860 --> 1:40:25.820]  be sent for reeducation but by the way I didn't know that
[1:40:26.420 --> 1:40:29.620]  cross John
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:34.980]  you know I'm gonna get to that later some have one of those moments Larry
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:42.660]  Grafwald no it's no it's Larry Grafwald last night that do called me at about
[1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:47.420]  eight o'clock at night and said hey you want to get Larry Grafwald back on the
[1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:50.260]  show he's the guy that the special forces guy that blew the whistle on the
[1:40:50.260 --> 1:40:53.420]  weather underground wanting to put 50 million Americans in forced labor and
[1:40:53.420 --> 1:40:56.220]  killed 25 million of us and all came out in federal court and all their
[1:40:56.220 --> 1:41:01.940]  documents their plans I said I want to get him on for Obama deception too now
[1:41:01.940 --> 1:41:04.780]  that I'm extending it out and we're gonna release it early next year I have a
[1:41:04.780 --> 1:41:11.020]  little bit more time and he's dead and I was trying to like pull up the name it's
[1:41:11.020 --> 1:41:15.620]  it's Larry Grafwald you know he's the guy that famously he's the guy that
[1:41:15.620 --> 1:41:21.140]  famously yeah blew the whistle on Bill Ayres and all the rest of it and he
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:24.900]  reportedly died last summer I don't even know about it again folks this is
[1:41:24.900 --> 1:41:27.860]  teleprompter free I'm like here on air I got a guest holding waiting to come on
[1:41:27.860 --> 1:41:31.420]  and I'm just got stuff popping into my head that I'd forgotten about that's it
[1:41:31.420 --> 1:41:35.740]  this is the opposite of calculated radio you need to understand that and then I
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:41.660]  feel the loss again realizing he's dead I think we we interviewed him shortly
[1:41:41.660 --> 1:41:46.220]  before he died we need to dig that up rear of that on the nightly news because
[1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:49.500]  he talked about how their real plan is all they ever talk about is how they
[1:41:49.500 --> 1:41:52.980]  want to kill everybody and take over and take our kids and and I've been with
[1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:56.500]  communists high-level ones before who I didn't know were communists you know
[1:41:56.500 --> 1:42:01.700]  well-known socialist and people who off record think I'm their buddy cuz back
[1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:04.820]  during the bush years and go you know we're not gonna kill you and we take
[1:42:04.820 --> 1:42:07.700]  over I'm like you're joking no the plan is we're gonna murder apply we want to
[1:42:07.700 --> 1:42:11.220]  kill people and I'm like and it's like every time I go have a beer with them
[1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:14.500]  they start talking about killing everybody and I'm like who I mean it's
[1:42:14.500 --> 1:42:18.100]  really creepy I'm like well I don't want to kill people I'm not a you're a
[1:42:18.100 --> 1:42:22.220]  libertarian communist is what they'll tell me I'm like what it's just bizarre
[1:42:22.220 --> 1:42:27.340]  anyways I'm gonna shut up Michael Bolden at entertainment center dot com hey
[1:42:27.340 --> 1:42:32.060]  forget what you're saying states rights the new republic just says blow up the
[1:42:32.060 --> 1:42:36.020]  Congress how's that sound well Congress has been a rubber stamp for a long time
[1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:39.980]  Alex whether it's been a bush or a Clinton or an Obama in office and they
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:44.180]  don't want us to know that we actually have power we have powers that in as
[1:42:44.180 --> 1:42:47.660]  individuals in our communities and in our states to actually make something
[1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:51.300]  happen that's why I was so excited to see Julie Wilson's report on your site
[1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:55.980]  last week talking about what happened here in California visa v indefinite
[1:42:55.980 --> 1:43:00.060]  detention under the National Defense Authorization Act that is the power the
[1:43:00.060 --> 1:43:04.220]  government claims to be able to snatch anybody off the street if they claim that
[1:43:04.220 --> 1:43:08.940]  you're an enemy in other words government sanctioned kidnapping you don't get
[1:43:08.940 --> 1:43:13.540]  access to a lawyer no trial no court no nothing they don't like you it's V for
[1:43:13.540 --> 1:43:16.940]  vendetta black bag and you're gone that's what they claim the power to do
[1:43:16.940 --> 1:43:21.700]  but thankfully people realize that following James Madison's advice you
[1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:25.820]  know the father of the Constitution to resist these people is really the path
[1:43:25.820 --> 1:43:29.900]  forward and it has nothing to do with whatever Obama or his rubber stamp
[1:43:29.900 --> 1:43:36.940]  Congress has to say we have the power in states break down what this country was
[1:43:36.940 --> 1:43:42.020]  founded on versus the authoritarians that say no all power flows out of the
[1:43:42.020 --> 1:43:47.940]  chief executive well we can do an exact 180 what we have today is totally
[1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:52.500]  opposite that whenever there's something wrong we go to the federal Imperial
[1:43:52.500 --> 1:43:57.700]  Congress or the Imperial executive to tell us how to fix things every single
[1:43:57.700 --> 1:44:01.920]  thing they want us to go to them but the truth of the matter is is as James
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:05.620]  Madison wrote in federal 45 the powers delegated the federal government are
[1:44:05.620 --> 1:44:10.100]  quote you and defying and those reserved to the states are numerous and
[1:44:10.100 --> 1:44:13.700]  indefinite the people of the states are supposed to have the power to do
[1:44:13.700 --> 1:44:17.740]  whatever they want basically I mean set up their society the way they want this
[1:44:17.740 --> 1:44:22.060]  is the only system where you can have a huge number of economic political and
[1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:26.340]  religious ideologies all living together under a big defense umbrella in
[1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:31.100]  peace when you have this one-size-fits-all solution this idea that one side
[1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:34.780]  one controlled opposition side or the other controlled opposition side is
[1:44:34.780 --> 1:44:40.020]  gonna take over the whole enchilada we all lose and it's it's exciting to see
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.540]  that some people are learning that we aren't supposed to beg at the altar of
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:47.140]  federal power to live free we need to learn how to live free whether they
[1:44:47.140 --> 1:44:50.860]  want us to or not but you know what Michael Bolton of the 10th Amendment
[1:44:50.860 --> 1:44:55.500]  Center I don't need to be intellectual to debate with you I can be like those
[1:44:55.500 --> 1:44:59.860]  Obama supporters in the Mark Dice videos that don't even know what party he's in
[1:44:59.860 --> 1:45:04.460]  all I've got to do is call you racist and then that makes me intellectually
[1:45:04.460 --> 1:45:08.300]  superior to you it doesn't matter if you've said nothing about race and you're
[1:45:08.300 --> 1:45:13.100]  actually for liberty and freedom for all and and for the individual empowerment
[1:45:13.100 --> 1:45:16.620]  it doesn't matter I'm gonna call you a racist right now and now I'm better than
[1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:19.740]  you well and this is what they've been doing the Southern Poverty Law Center who
[1:45:19.740 --> 1:45:24.300]  I know you've documented for many years these crooks and criminals and liars they
[1:45:24.300 --> 1:45:28.620]  named me one of the 25 racist radical leaders of the right in the last couple
[1:45:28.620 --> 1:45:32.620]  of years very racist yes so I guess that's oh I guess I've been told this is a
[1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:36.300]  badge of honor if they call you out you're obviously doing something good
[1:45:36.300 --> 1:45:39.300]  but the whole point is we're the opposite of race I follow your work of
[1:45:39.300 --> 1:45:42.620]  everybody they've said Ron Paul's a racist all this stuff I mean it's but
[1:45:42.620 --> 1:45:46.820]  with him at least there was some vague newsletter when he had like 14 brands out
[1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:50.620]  you know like two articles out of 5,000 that they could claim was something I
[1:45:50.620 --> 1:45:55.620]  mean this this is getting insane where they'll use comments on my website as
[1:45:55.620 --> 1:46:00.580]  proof by some anonymous commenter and or have MSNBC say I'm deeply racist and
[1:46:00.580 --> 1:46:04.260]  behind the Boston bombing with no proof I mean it really shows a
[1:46:04.260 --> 1:46:08.460]  desperateness well here at the the 10th Amendment Center and like you we act
[1:46:08.460 --> 1:46:12.180]  like with the freight train mentality no matter what they throw at us we're not
[1:46:12.180 --> 1:46:15.460]  gonna get distracted by their garbage because their goal is to distract us in
[1:46:15.460 --> 1:46:19.380]  this little petty debate over who's racist and who's not no no no I agree I'm
[1:46:19.380 --> 1:46:26.220]  only bringing it up to show what what a moral lawless bankrupt intellectually
[1:46:26.220 --> 1:46:31.020]  really bad nasty race pimps they are I mean they're what they're accusing us of
[1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:34.820]  sure and it's harder and harder for them to do that as we talk about the
[1:46:34.820 --> 1:46:40.180]  success of a left-right coalition in California to pass Assembly Bill 351
[1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:43.860]  rejecting the policy of that's why we got you back because they want to divide
[1:46:43.860 --> 1:46:47.860]  us along left and right instead of all Americans should be against secret arrest
[1:46:47.860 --> 1:46:53.340]  certainly kidnapping is bad murder is bad unconstitutional undeclared wars is
[1:46:53.340 --> 1:46:57.620]  bad it's very hard for them to call us that the more we get this out but
[1:46:57.620 --> 1:47:02.540]  certainly as AB 351 was signed by Jerry Brown I mean you don't expect anything
[1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:07.500]  good to come out of California but it did because of a massive left-white right
[1:47:07.500 --> 1:47:12.620]  coalition between Tea Party and Occupy ACLU 10th Amendment Center old keepers
[1:47:12.620 --> 1:47:16.060]  all across the board there's no way to resist that when you get enough people
[1:47:16.060 --> 1:47:22.460]  standing up and saying we want to say no it's gonna happen well again I'm not
[1:47:22.460 --> 1:47:25.740]  gonna debate the federal takeover I'm just gonna say that you're probably a
[1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:32.060]  bad man and probably an extremist and and that I'm more intellectual than you
[1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:35.180]  because I'm an idiot well that's the attitude they throw at us and when Bush
[1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:39.180]  was in office I'll tell you our organization started in 2006 and when
[1:47:39.180 --> 1:47:42.420]  Bush was in office we used to get called by neocons hey you communists go back
[1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:45.820]  to Cuba because we were opposing federal power oh yeah yeah whoever's in power
[1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:48.420]  the right always calls you a communist that's what they call me the
[1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:52.980]  establishment neocon right called me a hardcore commie and then as soon as the
[1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:57.300]  Democrats come in I'm now a racist fascist exactly I went to your event
[1:47:57.300 --> 1:48:00.940]  here in Los Angeles a number of years ago when you hosted that event and I you
[1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:04.260]  know back then the neocons hated you now they're starting to learn and I think
[1:48:04.260 --> 1:48:08.500]  the goal in these type of situations is every time the the power changes hands
[1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:11.980]  from one side of the other we keep bringing a few more people from the
[1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:14.980]  ground I was about to say this isn't working like it used to except for the
[1:48:14.980 --> 1:48:18.220]  dumbest people on the left and right you're talking about my big 9-11 event
[1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:22.940]  with a couple thousand people at it yeah all these top scientists people like
[1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:26.860]  dr. Bob Bowman Charlie she was there too and the whole point is is that yeah
[1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:30.300]  that was called a hardcore communist event what was really a libertarian event
[1:48:30.300 --> 1:48:33.660]  right I mean and it brought so many different types of people together and
[1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:36.340]  I think this is the message that you've been talking about will you talk about
[1:48:36.340 --> 1:48:39.140]  the 10th Amendment Center what Ron Paul has been talking about liberty is
[1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:43.100]  popular you can reach people on single issue coalitions like we did here in
[1:48:43.100 --> 1:48:48.860]  California Union racism black Hispanic white Asian old young Jewish German
[1:48:48.860 --> 1:48:54.020]  Palestinian Chinese all together this is hardcore racism well James Madison
[1:48:54.020 --> 1:48:58.540]  wrote in Federalist paper number 46 that we actually can succeed in pushing
[1:48:58.540 --> 1:49:02.780]  back against the federal government if we take four steps not in Congress not
[1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:06.900]  in the federal courts and not in the executive branch four steps in our state
[1:49:06.900 --> 1:49:09.980]  we're supposed to repudiate we're supposed to stand up and oppose federal
[1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:14.060]  actions call on our governors to speak out against it and then most importantly
[1:49:14.060 --> 1:49:18.620]  the last two things use state legislative devices to quote refuse to
[1:49:18.620 --> 1:49:23.020]  cooperate with officers of the union we need to start standing down no longer
[1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:26.460]  allow our state and local officials to enforce federal gun control and again
[1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:29.460]  what the feds do and I want to go over these solutions when we come back what
[1:49:29.460 --> 1:49:33.300]  the feds themselves run by globalists do so I just bypass that and say look they
[1:49:33.300 --> 1:49:36.420]  can have their federal argument all day there is some jurisdiction in some
[1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:40.300]  issues they're lying and claiming total jurisdiction when on record that's not
[1:49:40.300 --> 1:49:45.340]  the case they're actually globalist far and run by big banks that brag they've
[1:49:45.340 --> 1:49:49.100]  pretty much conquered the federal government so our redress is now in
[1:49:49.100 --> 1:49:52.780]  balance the states and if the states get out of control then the feds come in
[1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:57.500]  that's the give and take in the federalist system but look at how the
[1:49:57.500 --> 1:50:02.220]  governor of Wisconsin when they blocked fishing docks and things that weren't
[1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:06.860]  even federally paid for or built but are on federal land boat launches they've
[1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:10.940]  just removed the federal barricades and the feds had to back down so that's why
[1:50:10.940 --> 1:50:15.020]  the states are there sure if we just totally lay down the feds will run over
[1:50:15.020 --> 1:50:18.580]  and become imperial but they're trying this corporate board of you will be
[1:50:18.580 --> 1:50:22.020]  assimilated the opposite is happening I'm seeing a huge awakening are you
[1:50:22.020 --> 1:50:26.100]  seeing that absolutely this example in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and other
[1:50:26.100 --> 1:50:29.380]  places where people are just defying these federal orders to shut down parks
[1:50:29.380 --> 1:50:34.060]  this is nullification in action when enough people stand up and say no they
[1:50:34.060 --> 1:50:38.340]  can't ram their laws regulations or mandates down our throats but you know
[1:50:38.340 --> 1:50:41.820]  how I counter that putting on the hat of a trendy intellectual authoritarian
[1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:47.260]  races races races races races races Michael Bolton races race I just want to
[1:50:47.260 --> 1:50:52.020]  show an intellectually bankrupt they are races races races races races races
[1:50:52.020 --> 1:50:54.980]  races we'll be right back and we're gonna get into the fact that they're
[1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:58.300]  calling him the new Abraham Lincoln and again saying he should blow up

[1:54:18.180 --> 1:54:25.380]  frustrated we're going back to Michael Bolden and I make the joke about the
[1:54:25.380 --> 1:54:30.900]  racist stuff because it's not a joke it's very serious authoritarianism the
[1:54:30.900 --> 1:54:35.460]  people doing it want to paralyze speech and demonize the First Amendment that's
[1:54:35.460 --> 1:54:40.620]  why they're ban the term brown bag folks brown bag I looked it up has never had
[1:54:40.620 --> 1:54:45.060]  any connotation to race it means cheap paper the type of paper you use in
[1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:52.220]  groceries that's what it means it's very expensive to stain paper white that's
[1:54:52.220 --> 1:54:57.540]  what people thought white bread a hundred years ago was fancy here is a
[1:54:57.540 --> 1:55:01.060]  white napkin I have ladies and gentlemen I will assure you this is not
[1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:05.100]  because I'm being racist but again this is the new mental illness they're
[1:55:05.100 --> 1:55:10.380]  trying to install shifting gears out of that we've been hearing that Obama should
[1:55:10.380 --> 1:55:13.900]  just be the the new Lincoln they said this eight years ago he was first
[1:55:13.900 --> 1:55:21.940]  running for office two years out we was just exploratory in like 2006 2007
[1:55:21.940 --> 1:55:26.020]  that oh he'll be like the new Lincoln and he'll crush the states and he'll show
[1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:31.420]  anybody that tries to block him they've really been spoiling for this fight
[1:55:31.420 --> 1:55:35.300]  Michael Bolden what are the solutions to counter this what should we be doing at
[1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:39.940]  the state level the solution is through following the founding fathers advice
[1:55:39.940 --> 1:55:43.340]  we've been talking a little bit about James Madison and his four steps
[1:55:43.340 --> 1:55:47.980]  primarily using state or local legislative devices to refuse cooperation
[1:55:47.980 --> 1:55:51.380]  with officers of the union check out this report this is breaking news from
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:55.420]  eastern Kansas they just passed an ordinance for binding law in eastern
[1:55:55.420 --> 1:56:00.660]  Kansas no agency of the city of eastern Kansas shall provide material support
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:05.300]  for or participate in any way in the enforcement of any act law treaty order
[1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:09.460]  rule or regulation regarding personal firearms firearm accessories or
[1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:13.140]  ammunition within the boundary of the city of eastern Kansas you can take
[1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:16.900]  action on your county your city your town level to get an ordinance passed
[1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:20.500]  saying we're not going to abide by federal gun control measures and judge
[1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:24.140]  Andrew Napolitano was on I think Fox Business earlier this year he said if a
[1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:28.420]  state would just stand down and not help the federal government carry the stuff
[1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:34.020]  out it would make those laws as Judge Knapp said nearly impossible to enforce
[1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:37.660]  and I'll sure take nearly impossible to enforce over what Obama and his gang
[1:56:37.660 --> 1:56:43.740]  want to do today well take the converse of that they illegally violate the
[1:56:43.740 --> 1:56:48.620]  Constitution and 800 plus cities and 20 something states and will not arrest
[1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:52.420]  illegal aliens even when they're committing crimes so that makes them
[1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:56.660]  above the law because no one will deport them that's an example of
[1:56:56.660 --> 1:57:01.780]  nullification right there well as long as we stop complying stop helping them
[1:57:01.780 --> 1:57:06.740]  and get our states to pass like here in California AB 351 to make the policy
[1:57:06.740 --> 1:57:11.420]  here of the state of California to not participate in indefinite detention under
[1:57:11.420 --> 1:57:16.380]  NDAA or any other law which purports to authorize indefinite detention of a
[1:57:16.380 --> 1:57:20.820]  person here in California or against gun control measures or you get a state to
[1:57:20.820 --> 1:57:24.820]  pass a law saying hey we're not going to implement these exchanges for Obamacare
[1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:28.860]  or the 21 states that have refused to comply with the federal government on
[1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:33.620]  marijuana laws this is a very effective path James Madison said when you get a
[1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:37.580]  bunch of states to refuse to cooperate with officers of the union it would
[1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:42.100]  create basically roadblocks that he said would the federal government would be
[1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:46.980]  hardly willing to encounter and I think Madison was a pretty smart guy sure and
[1:57:46.980 --> 1:57:50.300]  what people would follow him we would have great effect sure well here's the
[1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:56.460]  problem they're using states rights to try to get guns to let illegals practice
[1:57:56.460 --> 1:58:01.100]  law to let illegals have drivers license and vote in California but then
[1:58:01.100 --> 1:58:06.380]  saying there's no states rights if libertarians want to nullify federal gun
[1:58:06.380 --> 1:58:10.660]  laws or nullify federal spying or nullify the federal currency and have
[1:58:10.660 --> 1:58:13.860]  your own state currency that's constitutional they're there trying to
[1:58:13.860 --> 1:58:18.540]  block that but there's an example of Governor Jerry Brown under real
[1:58:18.540 --> 1:58:22.580]  federalism the federal government should not be allowing him to legalize all
[1:58:22.580 --> 1:58:26.260]  the illegals because that is one of the three things that where there's federal
[1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:30.660]  purview so they have a word for it but it's slightly profane with children
[1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:34.820]  listening but it it's something backwards begins with an A ends with an S
[1:58:34.820 --> 1:58:43.820]  it's a SS backwards this whole thing is a SS backwards you are listening to GCN

[2:00:26.420 --> 2:00:30.460]  all right it's the final segment with Michael Bolden on the Tents of Image
[2:00:30.460 --> 2:00:37.580]  Center.com then we've got McAvie scheduled to be joining us to get into the
[2:00:37.580 --> 2:00:43.940]  NSA but again ladies and gentlemen the federal government is completely run
[2:00:43.940 --> 2:00:49.220]  by the globalist who want to bankrupt this country drive down the wages I'm
[2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:55.660]  all for free market you can't have free trade with slave nations like China you
[2:00:55.660 --> 2:00:59.980]  can't do that or you will become bankrupt you will become impoverished this is
[2:00:59.980 --> 2:01:03.780]  not free market I don't want to get off into that digressing it's a libertarian
[2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:09.060]  debate but I think it's pretty much settled the issue here is I don't think
[2:01:09.060 --> 2:01:14.020]  anybody ever makes this point the Democrats are using nullification already
[2:01:14.020 --> 2:01:18.700]  to set up their own little empires what's your take on that Michael well I
[2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:22.540]  think everybody uses constitutional tools when it advances them and they
[2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:26.900]  ignore it when it doesn't so these guys are gonna do good things when well or
[2:01:26.900 --> 2:01:30.580]  bad things when it furthers their own interests that's all we can expect from
[2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:34.940]  the imperial Congress on both sides of the political spectrum but we're really
[2:01:34.940 --> 2:01:39.460]  trying to implement basically what would be a reverse clover heaven strategy if
[2:01:39.460 --> 2:01:42.740]  Kansas says no we're not going to participate in federal gun control
[2:01:42.740 --> 2:01:45.660]  measures in California says we're not going to participate in federal
[2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:50.100]  unconstitutional federal drug law measures or the indefinite detention in
[2:01:50.100 --> 2:01:54.140]  other state does Obamacare another state does this it basically throws it all
[2:01:54.140 --> 2:01:57.980]  back on the federal government and they don't have the manpower to carry out all
[2:01:57.980 --> 2:02:02.140]  their stuff without us complying they just can't do it even the National
[2:02:02.140 --> 2:02:06.820]  Governors Association just last week put out this scare thing about the the so
[2:02:06.820 --> 2:02:11.300]  called shutdown saying hey states help the federal government implement what
[2:02:11.300 --> 2:02:16.740]  they said most federal programs they all know that they rely on us locally and in
[2:02:16.740 --> 2:02:21.180]  our states to participate in that's right that's right compliant people will
[2:02:21.180 --> 2:02:25.700]  be slaves yeah I mean we we comply and think that's a free society no the
[2:02:25.700 --> 2:02:31.500]  government's broken the social contract on purpose it's time to stop working with
[2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:35.460]  them whenever you can and this is why Gucci Artie should be a hero really
[2:02:35.460 --> 2:02:39.660]  because he didn't you know just bow down and say don't follow those signs as he
[2:02:39.660 --> 2:02:43.860]  drove into the NSA data center there in Utah last week he said I'm gonna go do
[2:02:43.860 --> 2:02:47.260]  this I'm gonna try to exercise my rights to free speech and he did it to the
[2:02:47.260 --> 2:02:50.700]  point where they're gonna use violence on him but this is the type of step that
[2:02:50.700 --> 2:02:54.700]  more and more people need to take but just Anthony Gucci Artie doing it on
[2:02:54.700 --> 2:02:58.660]  his own we're not gonna have freedom we need to follow that type of courage and
[2:02:58.660 --> 2:03:02.780]  have more and more people take that type of action so as regards to the NSA the
[2:03:02.780 --> 2:03:07.700]  NSA data center in Utah requires 1.7 million gallons of water to operate
[2:03:07.700 --> 2:03:10.540]  every single day to keep those supercomputers cool well who's that
[2:03:10.540 --> 2:03:15.020]  provided by a political subdivision of the state of Utah well Utah doesn't have
[2:03:15.020 --> 2:03:18.860]  to give them the water they can turn off the water and then there's no more NSA
[2:03:18.860 --> 2:03:24.220]  data set and by the way folks we could take over Utah politically it's already
[2:03:24.220 --> 2:03:28.500]  happening and shut the water off because that's not the US government there
[2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:34.020]  that is a globalist crime syndicate setting up a technocratic technocracy we
[2:03:34.020 --> 2:03:37.180]  don't have there's nothing in the Constitution that requires us to help
[2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:42.020]  the Fed violate our rights there the NSA data center opening up in San Antonio
[2:03:42.020 --> 2:03:46.660]  well the electricity is going to be provided by the city of San Antonio why
[2:03:46.660 --> 2:03:50.460]  does San Antonio have to do that turn off the switch make it as difficult as
[2:03:50.460 --> 2:03:54.020]  possible create as many impediments for them to violate and by the way that's
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:57.380]  what they're doing to us under Cloward and Pithon and Gen 21 they're making it
[2:03:57.380 --> 2:04:02.300]  difficult for us and saying they want to make us poor to control us absolutely
[2:04:02.300 --> 2:04:05.900]  but their strategies are very effective as we see year in and year out they make
[2:04:05.900 --> 2:04:09.940]  it more and more difficult so we learn from their evil strategies flip it
[2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:13.260]  around on them just like James Madison advice and we're gonna have a lot of
[2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:17.580]  success I agree every way you can without breaking laws or whatever and
[2:04:17.580 --> 2:04:21.380]  of course individually whatever you think is best folks sabotage the enemy by
[2:04:21.380 --> 2:04:25.300]  not complying and then just speak out like whenever I see aspartame gum I
[2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:28.900]  speak out the at the checkout whenever I see people that are pregnant I go over
[2:04:28.900 --> 2:04:32.820]  and tell them how deadly vaccines are I just fight fight fight fight fight and
[2:04:32.820 --> 2:04:37.220]  and know you're winning every time you do it alright 10th Amendment Center comm

[2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:28.620]  yeah he did go to the highest level and wow look how everything he talked
[2:08:28.620 --> 2:08:36.740]  about come true I don't think he's a liar
[2:08:36.740 --> 2:08:53.700]  you know this song is really funny I'm not attacking it I'm just exposing it
[2:08:53.700 --> 2:08:58.740]  they say that the Christians in this stole the God from the Jews and the
[2:08:58.740 --> 2:09:09.540]  Muslims when Christ obviously came out of Israelite Jewish covenant Old
[2:09:09.540 --> 2:09:14.540]  Testament into the New Testament but then is a new covenant for the Gentiles
[2:09:14.540 --> 2:09:19.020]  so you could say stole it from the Jews which isn't really stealing but to say
[2:09:19.020 --> 2:09:23.500]  the Muslims that came hundreds of years later and it's also say they follow the
[2:09:23.500 --> 2:09:29.220]  same God just amazing what these rock star people come up with the ridiculous
[2:09:29.220 --> 2:09:34.980]  anti-christian stuff you know it's a good song
[2:09:34.980 --> 2:09:40.540]  all right that's enough we're getting Maccabee on the line here working on
[2:09:40.540 --> 2:09:44.580]  getting him on John Maccabee to give us his take on the NSA situation and dark
[2:09:44.580 --> 2:09:50.020]  web rising Maccabee founder to launch new NSA killer privacy device so we'll
[2:09:50.020 --> 2:09:55.580]  let's see what's going on with him he's been on the show before but it's always
[2:09:55.580 --> 2:10:01.980]  a kettle of fish getting him on before I go any further here are some of the
[2:10:01.980 --> 2:10:08.700]  news articles up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com seal team six
[2:10:08.700 --> 2:10:12.900]  raids more war on terror theatrics getting into all the fake propaganda
[2:10:12.900 --> 2:10:17.620]  still team six is ordered to be part of when the argument is well you're in the
[2:10:17.620 --> 2:10:23.860]  psyops now so we do lie to the public justice department caught in amber alert
[2:10:23.860 --> 2:10:28.140]  takedown hoax that that is really big folks the amber alert still up still
[2:10:28.140 --> 2:10:33.180]  operating for missing children that they've now expanded anti-gun stuff and
[2:10:33.180 --> 2:10:36.740]  things as I told you they would was always set up for that 15 years ago but
[2:10:36.740 --> 2:10:41.180]  the larger issue is is that it's still operating the Justice Department just
[2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:46.260]  blocked access to the website the site still up everything a total fraud very
[2:10:46.260 --> 2:10:51.140]  important article to show the scams they're involved in upon info wars dot
[2:10:51.140 --> 2:10:55.980]  com they shut it down just like all the park service sites and others sites are
[2:10:55.980 --> 2:11:00.660]  still there they just block access to the kids games and everything else put the
[2:11:00.660 --> 2:11:04.220]  shopping carts they're still open the feds to make money it's everything else
[2:11:04.220 --> 2:11:10.380]  is closed photos the Grand Canyon you name it also leader of former Syrian
[2:11:10.380 --> 2:11:17.980]  Communist Party and member of CIA controlled by SNC arrested and that's
[2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:22.060]  a story getting into now these terrorist leaders and reported terrorist
[2:11:22.060 --> 2:11:26.100]  leaders early work of the CIA also a very important article by Paul Joseph
[2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:30.420]  Watson Americans more interested according to Google searches in Miley
[2:11:30.420 --> 2:11:37.500]  Cyrus football then Obamacare or government shutdown and see I'd say
[2:11:37.500 --> 2:11:42.660]  about half the public doesn't even know what planet they're on and those are the
[2:11:42.660 --> 2:11:46.300]  people that are voting to take our guns open the borders up drive down their
[2:11:46.300 --> 2:11:50.500]  wages get double-charged for Obamacare these are the people that Obama's
[2:11:50.500 --> 2:11:55.220]  laughing at and then you've got all the right wingers who are awake now because
[2:11:55.220 --> 2:11:58.700]  they don't like Democrats as soon as a Republican gets in most of her gonna go
[2:11:58.700 --> 2:12:02.540]  back to sleep and it's time that people not be this gullible on this stupid
[2:12:02.540 --> 2:12:07.860]  though I've got to say folks the average Democrat I was wondering why Democrats
[2:12:07.860 --> 2:12:12.100]  celebrate how smart they are and talk about how high their IQs are and talk
[2:12:12.100 --> 2:12:16.060]  about how everybody else is dumb and it's like a celebration of how smart they
[2:12:16.060 --> 2:12:21.140]  are it's because they know they're dumb down cattle like domesticated
[2:12:21.140 --> 2:12:30.300]  followers they know that they have the most pathetic domesticated dumb down
[2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:34.300]  people following them so yes it's true that the intelligentsia of the
[2:12:34.300 --> 2:12:39.540]  Democratic Party may have two or three or four degrees and basically usually
[2:12:39.540 --> 2:12:44.020]  work for government or for higher education and then they run around
[2:12:44.020 --> 2:12:49.180]  saying everyone else is dumb who doesn't accept what what they believe but it
[2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:54.660]  really is a religion I mean I was on the New Republic site that's calling for
[2:12:54.660 --> 2:12:59.900]  Obama to have a coup d'etat over Congress and blow up the Congress building
[2:12:59.900 --> 2:13:06.180]  like Yeltsin did the Duma or the Russian Parliament back in 1991 they
[2:13:06.180 --> 2:13:09.900]  would show photos of the burning building and it's the doesn't say satire on
[2:13:09.900 --> 2:13:14.700]  the article they say that's how Russians handled it and of course that was a
[2:13:14.700 --> 2:13:18.420]  group that hadn't been elected they've been voted out so then they were illegitimate
[2:13:18.420 --> 2:13:23.940]  this is the opposite this is Congress and more diversified 500 plus people and
[2:13:23.940 --> 2:13:27.300]  they're bucking what Obama's doing and doing a better job they're still
[2:13:27.300 --> 2:13:33.220]  terrible but overall the lesser of two evils and he's saying well this writer
[2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:36.740]  is saying this woman is saying it's time to you know take the gloves off well
[2:13:36.740 --> 2:13:40.420]  they want him to be like Lincoln and arrest 30-something members of Congress
[2:13:40.420 --> 2:13:44.620]  they want them to shut down members of the news they want them to arrest
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:49.420]  members of the press I'm gonna go to your phone calls while we're waiting to
[2:13:49.420 --> 2:13:56.580]  line up McAfee but here's what I'm talking about when I say they want him
[2:13:56.580 --> 2:14:03.180]  to do that he is doing that they're persecuting the pastors and priests
[2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:07.620]  saying you'll be arrested if you volunteer off hours and minister to
[2:14:07.620 --> 2:14:15.620]  troops the archdiocese that handles that has gone public with the memo do you
[2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:20.900]  understand that that is that is Soviet Union right there that is Soviet Union
[2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:27.060]  that is Soviet Union these men are employed by the government to ensure
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:30.420]  that a priest is available when an active duty Catholic chaplain is not
[2:14:30.420 --> 2:14:36.100]  present to Catholics or military bases worldwide are not permitted to work not
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:40.220]  even to volunteer during the shutdown it is illegal for them to minister on base
[2:14:40.220 --> 2:14:44.660]  and they risk being arrested if they attempt to do so and this is what the
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:50.260]  federal government has told them this is the magnitude of them persecuting
[2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:56.900]  thousands of churches hundreds of pro-life grips AP reporters and then
[2:14:56.900 --> 2:15:03.620]  here it is in the news today why reporters fear team Obama New York Post
[2:15:03.620 --> 2:15:07.420]  here's another one New York Times reporter Obama administration most
[2:15:07.420 --> 2:15:12.180]  closed controlled freak administration have ever covered ATF tries to block
[2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:16.220]  whistleblower agents fast and furious book they're threatening to not let it
[2:15:16.220 --> 2:15:19.940]  be published and threatening to arrest people this is the type of stuff we're
[2:15:19.940 --> 2:15:28.420]  talking about here okay Obama advisor
[2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:32.460]  demand overwhelmed Obama care they're lying and saying I mean this is the type
[2:15:32.460 --> 2:15:40.340]  of tyranny but then here's the other one I wanted to get into looking at the New
[2:15:40.340 --> 2:15:44.820]  Republic saying basically attack Congress they're already attacking
[2:15:44.820 --> 2:15:48.500]  Congress they're already using NSA to blackmail people they're already
[2:15:48.500 --> 2:15:51.900]  persecuting the press and persecuting the clergy and getting right in the
[2:15:51.900 --> 2:15:55.860]  middle of the First Amendment and telling Christian charities you're gonna
[2:15:55.860 --> 2:16:00.060]  pay for abortions I mean this is outrageous what we're already putting
[2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:05.340]  up with he's already doing what Lincoln did but Lincoln didn't go after the
[2:16:05.340 --> 2:16:10.140]  clergy Lincoln didn't say what they could pray I mean this is in many ways
[2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:15.900]  worse than the tyranny that Lincoln was involved in and I'm not debating whether
[2:16:15.900 --> 2:16:19.620]  Lincoln was good or bad that the British stirred the South up the North was
[2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:23.100]  doing some bad trade tactics to him both sides were wrong it was a plan to
[2:16:23.100 --> 2:16:26.620]  break the country up he said that's full spectrum analysis folks both sides were
[2:16:26.620 --> 2:16:33.020]  wrong it was Jackson that actually stopped a war the first time a few
[2:16:33.020 --> 2:16:36.820]  decades before when he was president between the North and the South fighting
[2:16:36.820 --> 2:16:42.020]  with each other the point is is that it just hit me today man we this is worse
[2:16:42.020 --> 2:16:45.780]  than I even thought and he's getting away with it which means even if Obama
[2:16:45.780 --> 2:16:50.020]  leaves office later which he'll probably will doesn't stage some terror attack
[2:16:50.020 --> 2:16:53.660]  the precedent set to go after whistleblowers and free speech in this
[2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:56.660]  country and we do now have him on the line after he leaves us we'll go to your
[2:16:56.660 --> 2:17:02.860]  phone calls John McAfee of course doesn't need any introduction the inventor
[2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:10.180]  of the multi-billion dollar antivirus software McAfee and the new articles
[2:17:10.180 --> 2:17:17.060]  out on infoworks.com dark web rising McAfee founder to launch new NSA privacy
[2:17:17.060 --> 2:17:20.020]  device and I want to get into that with him we got to go to break in a minute
[2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:25.340]  we're late getting him on first I want to ask how he's been doing since he was
[2:17:25.340 --> 2:17:30.900]  tried to be set up down there in famously piratical beliefs and then of
[2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:33.020]  what else has happened since we haven't talked to him in about four or five
[2:17:33.020 --> 2:17:36.340]  months John thank you so much for coming on with us sir
[2:17:36.340 --> 2:17:40.820]  well thank you for having me Alex I would enjoy being on your program again who
[2:17:40.820 --> 2:17:45.540]  is McAfee.com is that the best website that's the best website sir okay we're
[2:17:45.540 --> 2:17:48.340]  going to break here in a few minutes just update us on how you've been doing
[2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:52.620]  since you got out of that terror operation down there I would add months
[2:17:52.620 --> 2:17:57.580]  after you were on Ryerson plots did come out in the news out of Belize
[2:17:57.580 --> 2:18:01.940]  really boosting your credibility well yes a lot of things to come out they
[2:18:01.940 --> 2:18:05.860]  they just got rid of their minister by internal security because he was selling
[2:18:05.860 --> 2:18:11.020]  passports to the Koreans and got caught by Interpol so anyway I've been doing
[2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:15.180]  fine I've been working on my my new project I'm very alarmed with what's
[2:18:15.180 --> 2:18:19.380]  happening in privacy in America and the of the invasive tactics of the NSA and
[2:18:19.380 --> 2:18:24.340]  I have been working on this device for a number of years I've accelerated it in
[2:18:24.340 --> 2:18:28.180]  the past few months and will have a prototype working in six months it
[2:18:28.180 --> 2:18:32.140]  prevents the NSA or any government agency from accessing anything that you
[2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:37.620]  wish to do electronically very exciting can you give us any tidbits on how it
[2:18:37.620 --> 2:18:42.100]  works or or the the basically it's a little hardware device which is a
[2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:47.060]  communicator there's no screen on it to drop it in a pocket and an application
[2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:51.020]  that runs on your iPhone or for your Android or or whatever whatever device
[2:18:51.020 --> 2:18:56.460]  you're using including laptops and and iPads and it basically turns your
[2:18:56.460 --> 2:19:00.940]  cell phone into two devices one which connects to the internet normally for
[2:19:00.940 --> 2:19:07.340]  for whatever and the other which creates a completely secure local web which is
[2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:14.580]  relayed across the world the local web there nothing can identify you as as
[2:19:14.580 --> 2:19:19.020]  where you are what your name is so nothing no ID even to the hardware
[2:19:19.020 --> 2:19:23.820]  device so it's a proxy device it's a proxy device but it's a completely secure
[2:19:23.820 --> 2:19:27.540]  proxy device the encryption is something that I personally have developed the
[2:19:27.540 --> 2:19:33.460]  NSA nor any other agency is involved and that's the problem now the NSA help
[2:19:33.460 --> 2:19:38.780]  abuse the wording quote every technology company develop their encryption
[2:19:38.780 --> 2:19:43.180]  techniques well what idiocy is of course they can break them well yeah in
[2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:46.620]  fact I've read about them pressuring people saying it's a disruptive
[2:19:46.620 --> 2:19:49.420]  technology they don't let them put a backdoor in it you're of course an
[2:19:49.420 --> 2:19:52.340]  expert on this I couldn't think of a better guest to break down what's
[2:19:52.340 --> 2:19:57.060]  happening with the NSA then Mr. McAfee who is McAfee.com is the

[2:23:59.940 --> 2:24:16.700]  well one of the pioneers of internet security worked for NASA Xerox then
[2:24:16.700 --> 2:24:24.340]  started McAfee who is McAfee.com John agreed to come on our show first and
[2:24:24.340 --> 2:24:29.860]  that and Joe Rogan second because he was told by people he trusted that he
[2:24:29.860 --> 2:24:33.620]  could trust us and I got to be honest with you I mean I believe most what he
[2:24:33.620 --> 2:24:38.100]  was saying but it was so wild about the passports and about the certain Arab
[2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:43.040]  groups even named what groups by name and then it all came out in the press he
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:46.900]  was being accurate later and all I can say is he's really blessed to be alive
[2:24:46.900 --> 2:24:50.940]  John this is a short segment I know you want to get into Obamacare from what I've
[2:24:50.940 --> 2:24:55.740]  seen it's the legalization of the NSA it data minds everything I know you've been
[2:24:55.740 --> 2:25:00.260]  writing about that as an expert tell us about that and I can't wait till this
[2:25:00.260 --> 2:25:05.740]  device comes out as well the problem with Obamacare and this is just from a
[2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:12.380]  technological standpoint Alex is that there is absolutely no security at all
[2:25:12.380 --> 2:25:20.380]  for example I can create a website playing to be an agent and ask you know
[2:25:20.380 --> 2:25:24.180]  let you log on and because it's a healthcare system I can ask you the
[2:25:24.180 --> 2:25:28.620]  most intimate questions and you're going to answer them online I will then get
[2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:32.140]  your social security number your birthdate all the information I need to
[2:25:32.140 --> 2:25:36.300]  assume your identity and empty your bank accounts the following day and yet
[2:25:36.300 --> 2:25:41.100]  there's nothing in this central system that I can go to to verify that this is
[2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:45.540]  a legitimate website it's insane it is insane beyond belief and I don't know
[2:25:45.540 --> 2:25:49.380]  who thought this thing up but they have to be a complete idiot or they want to
[2:25:49.380 --> 2:25:52.780]  bring down the whole ID system and force everyone on the biometrics via brain
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:25:57.020]  waves which is what Toyota and others are going to well you know I don't have a
[2:25:57.020 --> 2:26:01.140]  clue about that but I know that it is the most insecure thing for Americans
[2:26:01.140 --> 2:26:05.860]  after signing up for Obamacare you have no idea if it's a legitimate website and
[2:26:05.860 --> 2:26:09.900]  I can tell you now the cost to the consumers to the American public in
[2:26:09.900 --> 2:26:13.620]  terms of identity theft and their bank accounts being wiped out it's going to
[2:26:13.620 --> 2:26:18.420]  be many times the entire cost of the Obamacare program this is insane
[2:26:18.420 --> 2:26:22.860]  sure my point is is they're coming out with cars that start via your brain
[2:26:22.860 --> 2:26:27.260]  wave fingerprint well now they're just going to steal the signature of your
[2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:31.620]  brain wave or cut your finger off to get into these iPhone 5's you as a top
[2:26:31.620 --> 2:26:37.580]  security expert for decades what what is the best form of internet security you
[2:26:37.580 --> 2:26:43.340]  know common sense is number one okay for example issues Obamacare I would you
[2:26:43.340 --> 2:26:47.500]  know if you're gonna be signing up at all you know to make sure that it's a
[2:26:47.500 --> 2:26:52.660]  legitimate site number two never ever give out information that's private to
[2:26:52.660 --> 2:26:56.060]  you even if your own bank calls you and you and you're sure that it's the same
[2:26:56.060 --> 2:26:59.980]  bank that should be on file we do already why are you calling look at how
[2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:06.140]  Academy Sporting's goods always ask for your for your number your zip code
[2:27:06.140 --> 2:27:09.820]  somebody could be listening right there steal your credit cards and then use
[2:27:09.820 --> 2:27:25.620]  your credit cards with that zip code
[2:27:25.620 --> 2:27:29.820]  the government must be safe or you know it's my bank calling me it must be okay
[2:27:29.820 --> 2:27:34.420]  well it's very seldom safe never give out anything about yourself not your
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:38.420]  home address not the name of your wife not the name of your parents not where
[2:27:38.420 --> 2:27:43.220]  you were born nothing and if people ask for it be suspicious be really
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:46.900]  suspicious well you know how much is obviously you know but for listeners
[2:27:46.900 --> 2:27:52.180]  thieves all over the world now sit with scanners picking up all the cordless
[2:27:52.180 --> 2:27:56.340]  phone traffic where you're on the bank giving them all your info that's how
[2:27:56.340 --> 2:28:00.260]  they're stealing all the identities absolutely it's one of the ways they're
[2:28:00.260 --> 2:28:04.580]  stealing it every every sort of way but now the government is actually one of
[2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:08.900]  the hackers in my mind I mean they're they're they're wanting inside your head
[2:28:08.900 --> 2:28:12.260]  they're wanting to know your intentions they want to know who you live who your
[2:28:12.260 --> 2:28:16.460]  friends are why your friends with them something is seriously wrong your
[2:28:16.460 --> 2:28:21.900]  privacy in my mind is one of our unique and inalienable rights the right to
[2:28:21.900 --> 2:28:27.620]  privacy we have lost as American citizens we were all brought up to the
[2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:33.180]  Soviet Union 1984 fiction you know this nightmare we're beyond 1984 aren't we
[2:28:33.180 --> 2:28:41.180]  John 1984 when it reaches the point that I can be in some remote part of the
[2:28:41.180 --> 2:28:44.540]  world calling another friend of mine in some remote part of the world and our
[2:28:44.540 --> 2:28:49.380]  government is capable of listening in but you know it remember 1984 there were
[2:28:49.380 --> 2:28:53.140]  actually safe parts of the world where they were all government spying but
[2:28:53.140 --> 2:28:57.300]  that's not the case in this case no matter where you are you can be seen
[2:28:57.300 --> 2:29:02.700]  watched and heard but then if I try to go to the NSHR my reporters do just ask
[2:29:02.700 --> 2:29:07.500]  questions at the front gate they flip out and act like we're terrorists well
[2:29:07.500 --> 2:29:11.780]  also you're probably gonna get audited well I mean he just shows they they want
[2:29:11.780 --> 2:29:17.220]  all their privacy from us but we have no privacy absolutely that's the government
[2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:20.980]  what it's doing and you become an enemy yet you try to keep the government
[2:29:20.980 --> 2:29:25.660]  knowing what you do then you become the enemy as well it's like insane so there's
[2:29:25.660 --> 2:29:30.660]  there's no hope in the system until we retain some inalienable rights in our
[2:29:30.660 --> 2:29:36.020]  constitution the founding father of internet security the founding father
[2:29:36.020 --> 2:29:39.180]  internet security John McAvie you can really say that he's one of the founding
[2:29:39.180 --> 2:29:43.020]  fathers internet security and an incredible character to boot sir final
[2:29:43.020 --> 2:29:46.620]  segment with you I want to talk about whatever you're into what you think is

[2:33:12.380 --> 2:33:20.380]  I'm just an average man with an average life I work from nine to five hell I pay the price
[2:33:20.380 --> 2:33:28.180]  all I want is to be left alone in my average home but why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight soon
[2:33:28.180 --> 2:33:37.100]  you're not in the twilight zone you're in the New World Order where the inmates
[2:33:37.100 --> 2:33:44.860]  run the asylum John McAfee is our guest who is McAfee.com all right there's so
[2:33:44.860 --> 2:33:48.420]  much going on in the world let's get into the NSA let's get into the power grab
[2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:53.820]  the Panoptagon the technocracy they're trying to build sir and and how you
[2:33:53.820 --> 2:33:59.100]  think culturally we can change this and stop this and what you think is also
[2:33:59.100 --> 2:34:02.860]  most positive about what's happening right now after you cover what's most
[2:34:02.860 --> 2:34:08.460]  negative all right I think the first time I'd like to say it's what's needed
[2:34:08.460 --> 2:34:15.060]  Alex is we need to stop being afraid for example that it's here that allowed
[2:34:15.060 --> 2:34:23.180]  us to to let the government at the end of 9-11 create the Homeland Security of
[2:34:23.180 --> 2:34:26.580]  all of the things that they're getting on the airplane now you know I travel a lot
[2:34:26.580 --> 2:34:31.220]  so it's like I get halfway undressed five times a week just to travel
[2:34:31.220 --> 2:34:36.180]  somewhere so that they can make sure I'm not a threat to America we're afraid
[2:34:36.180 --> 2:34:39.900]  that many of us they're using that against it's what my product for
[2:34:39.900 --> 2:34:46.140]  example Sony advises has called my father my intended product a dangerous
[2:34:46.140 --> 2:34:52.460]  product because it will allow the crypts and hackers of the world to not be
[2:34:52.460 --> 2:34:56.060]  seen well you know people also use telephones that you know as the
[2:34:56.060 --> 2:35:00.980]  criminals use telephones we get rid of but the hackers already know all this
[2:35:00.980 --> 2:35:05.300]  stuff so this is for the general public to protect themselves it's the same
[2:35:05.300 --> 2:35:08.780]  argument against guns saying you can't have a gun you might hurt somebody know
[2:35:08.780 --> 2:35:13.900]  I need a gun to protect myself absolutely and we need a privacy to
[2:35:13.900 --> 2:35:18.020]  protect ourselves and so of course well anything that we bring which is positive
[2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:21.900]  is going to be used by the criminal elements of society we can't stop it
[2:35:21.900 --> 2:35:26.140]  they use telephones they use they use cars to get away from bank robberies
[2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:30.300]  what we do we take cars away from people so this is insane to use it's not this
[2:35:30.300 --> 2:35:34.700]  this this rationale for no but don't let Mac if you put that product because it's
[2:35:34.700 --> 2:35:38.860]  dangerous it's gonna let books get away with things well it's also gonna let me
[2:35:38.860 --> 2:35:42.820]  be private and you be private and all of us be private so what we do is we
[2:35:42.820 --> 2:35:47.700]  sacrifice our privacy for the illusion of safety but can't be safety without
[2:35:47.700 --> 2:35:56.220]  privacy Alex John are we gonna be able to turn this around you know I'm not
[2:35:56.220 --> 2:36:00.540]  sure it's gonna stand on all of us isn't it I mean this is still America we still
[2:36:00.540 --> 2:36:04.340]  have the right to vote and we still have the right to think for ourselves
[2:36:04.340 --> 2:36:09.300]  it will stand up and go I'm not going to be afraid anymore and go to that dude
[2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:15.340]  and vote these people out all 100% across the board and bring in
[2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:21.300]  people who say yes we've become crazy as a society we have got to return to
[2:36:21.300 --> 2:36:25.340]  sanity it's up to us Alex we have to do something we can't sit back and let
[2:36:25.340 --> 2:36:28.900]  somebody else do it for us I'll be willing to do that that is the question
[2:36:28.900 --> 2:36:33.540]  well as you know most great empires and cultures end up committing suicide by
[2:36:33.540 --> 2:36:39.260]  madness those who the gods would destroy they first make mad and we really are
[2:36:39.260 --> 2:36:43.060]  collectively I've talked a lot of executives a lot of people and they
[2:36:43.060 --> 2:36:48.700]  say general craziness and self-destructiveness is increasing are
[2:36:48.700 --> 2:36:53.940]  you seeing that of course it is I mean absolutely across the board we're
[2:36:53.940 --> 2:36:58.740]  becoming a very insane society here self-destructive society it's obvious
[2:36:58.740 --> 2:37:03.460]  open our eyes to look around you you see it I see it everybody has to see it
[2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:08.200]  we're closing our eyes to it sometimes because it requires courage to see the
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:13.380]  truth do we have the courage let me ask you this question because it this is
[2:37:13.380 --> 2:37:17.660]  what I dread at 3 a.m. in the morning it's not the smart evil tyrants we face
[2:37:17.660 --> 2:37:22.140]  because they've got to be dealt with but the general morass and laziness and
[2:37:22.140 --> 2:37:28.340]  dumbed-downness not of the whole public but of a sizable 30 40% of people who
[2:37:28.340 --> 2:37:33.420]  don't even know what party Obama's in in Malmstreet interviews we've done and
[2:37:33.420 --> 2:37:38.180]  others have done but support it or who don't even know their state capital who
[2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:42.780]  don't even know one branch of government much less three but they have this
[2:37:42.780 --> 2:37:46.900]  arrogance to them where they don't care and they politically want to take our
[2:37:46.900 --> 2:37:51.860]  guns they want the state to raise our kids they are flaming authoritarians
[2:37:51.860 --> 2:37:56.420]  posing as so-called liberals when Thomas Jefferson would literally spit on
[2:37:56.420 --> 2:37:58.980]  them and then you've got the fake conservatives that are a bunch of
[2:37:58.980 --> 2:38:02.360]  tyrants as well but I got to say I've never been a partisan guy the
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:06.580]  Democrats though are really making their move right now how do what do we do as
[2:38:06.580 --> 2:38:11.140]  producers when all these stupid parasites that literally can't tie their
[2:38:11.140 --> 2:38:16.780]  shoelaces want to run our lives what do we do about that well you know the
[2:38:16.780 --> 2:38:21.540]  reason that many people are indifferent is because it's easy to be indifferent it's
[2:38:21.540 --> 2:38:26.500]  easy not to know what's going on not to know but what the party the president
[2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:31.180]  is in because if you don't know it can't scare you that's what my dad said
[2:38:31.180 --> 2:38:35.380]  last night no then you can that you can imagine anything that you want and
[2:38:35.380 --> 2:38:38.740]  pretend that that's true that's where we put that's what happened here and that's
[2:38:38.740 --> 2:38:43.260]  what what this world has become we don't want to know many times because if we
[2:38:43.260 --> 2:38:46.980]  know we have to do something we don't want to do anything because doing
[2:38:46.980 --> 2:38:51.620]  something is scary but I think that's the fundamental problem we have to bring
[2:38:51.620 --> 2:38:55.460]  a mirror in and then look themselves to look at the truth as well for what's
[2:38:55.460 --> 2:39:00.100]  really happening here I had dinner with my dad I'm not a sociologist I can do
[2:39:00.100 --> 2:39:03.340]  a product which is what I'm doing that you can drop in your pocket that's going
[2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:07.780]  through privacy but I can't change the way people think unfortunately sure no
[2:39:07.780 --> 2:39:10.980]  I mean I had dinner with my dad last night and I said why are they so dumb
[2:39:10.980 --> 2:39:15.500]  why don't they care and he said no they don't want to know they're scared they're
[2:39:15.500 --> 2:39:21.300]  delusional and they want to just be left alone and and I guess what you said is
[2:39:21.300 --> 2:39:25.540]  absolutely true that's it they think they're protected by not caring but
[2:39:25.540 --> 2:39:30.460]  they're not caring is what's allowing the evil to take over absolutely and that
[2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:38.460]  is the problem here you know I mean if I will I will do anything to help people
[2:39:38.460 --> 2:39:43.020]  have the right to protect themselves they have a gun to do you know to their own
[2:39:43.020 --> 2:39:48.860]  privacy you know but the world is full of them frighteningly indifferent people
[2:39:48.860 --> 2:39:54.940]  now and if I frankly I just don't know Alex I just don't know yeah well I'm here
[2:39:54.940 --> 2:39:58.100]  to tell you to all these indifferent people that think they're gonna run my
[2:39:58.100 --> 2:40:02.580]  life it's over we the working thinking people are done with you and all your
[2:40:02.580 --> 2:40:06.780]  bureaucrats what do you make of the persecution of reporters and the and
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:11.220]  they've told priest if they minister to people on the military base during the
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:14.940]  shutdown even if somebody's had a family member die they will be arrested I
[2:40:14.940 --> 2:40:20.060]  mean just to see what a tyrant Obama's turned into he's a thousand times
[2:40:20.060 --> 2:40:39.020]  beyond Nixon and getting away with all of it what's next wow wow I don't know
[2:40:39.020 --> 2:40:42.260]  what to say anymore you know after you leave us in five minutes I know you'll
[2:40:42.260 --> 2:40:45.300]  think of something important you wish you would have said always ask this
[2:40:45.300 --> 2:40:49.500]  question what else is on your mind John it said to me asking my feeble questions
[2:40:49.500 --> 2:40:55.180]  well you know what's on my mind now this is how I can I can position my new
[2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:59.620]  product so that they'll actually let me build it here in America you know as it
[2:40:59.620 --> 2:41:05.580]  looks right now I can show you the music industry the movie industry the are
[2:41:05.580 --> 2:41:09.180]  going to be radically against it because it means that the feeling that stuff is
[2:41:09.180 --> 2:41:13.220]  going to be easier but you know get a clue you know if you're building
[2:41:13.220 --> 2:41:17.220]  something look at the way the world is moving and protect yourself don't don't
[2:41:17.220 --> 2:41:20.820]  make me stop producing something that gives this part you can't have prior
[2:41:20.820 --> 2:41:25.940]  constraint yeah you can't have prior constraint of everybody like like we
[2:41:25.940 --> 2:41:28.860]  can't have privacy because we might do something wrong that's like saying your
[2:41:28.860 --> 2:41:32.220]  house has got to be glass because you might do something with your privacy
[2:41:32.220 --> 2:41:35.540]  this is the essence of authoritarianism that was my question actually wanted to
[2:41:35.540 --> 2:41:38.460]  ask you and I forgot to ask they're gonna try to stop you and call it
[2:41:38.460 --> 2:41:43.420]  disruptive technology but there's no way I mean that they can stop you because
[2:41:43.420 --> 2:41:49.100]  people really want this unless they kill you well that's another issue you know
[2:41:49.100 --> 2:41:54.540]  people call me paranoid well maybe but you know I'm still breathing and and I
[2:41:54.540 --> 2:41:58.140]  think I have a good reason to be paranoid I'm always out on the edge doing
[2:41:58.140 --> 2:42:01.380]  things that people don't want me to do because I'm sure the government does not
[2:42:01.380 --> 2:42:05.220]  want me to do something which is going to make the NSA powerless to get into your
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:09.620]  life well you know the option to try to stop me legally by saying well what
[2:42:09.620 --> 2:42:13.460]  you're producing is is not good but I'm gonna let you do it well then I'm gonna
[2:42:13.460 --> 2:42:16.700]  produce it somewhere else so I'm gonna sell it somewhere else but the
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:20.660]  technology is coming because people have to have privacy we have no
[2:42:20.660 --> 2:42:25.940]  individuality we become a machine I don't want that you don't want that and
[2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:29.620]  ultimately the world's like we look at itself and say wait a minute we get done
[2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:34.260]  crazier and things will change yeah for those that don't know sociologists
[2:42:34.260 --> 2:42:38.220]  anthropologists psychologists historians all have found one element that is the
[2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:43.100]  most important for freedom and creativity and that's privacy privacy they
[2:42:43.100 --> 2:42:46.220]  don't even fully understand it but but if you don't have privacy you're a slave
[2:42:46.220 --> 2:42:55.260]  it's a very simple equation why is that John John McAfee why why do we have to
[2:42:55.260 --> 2:43:01.700]  have privacy why is it so important because without privacy sir we have
[2:43:01.700 --> 2:43:07.260]  because we're humans and because we are imperfect we get judged all right one of
[2:43:07.260 --> 2:43:10.580]  these certain things in privacy what because you know we know that what we're
[2:43:10.580 --> 2:43:15.380]  doing here might offend somebody sensibilities somewhere else what
[2:43:15.380 --> 2:43:19.020]  we're doing here someone may not want us to do because of who knows what
[2:43:19.020 --> 2:43:23.780]  competition greed all of the things that humans have privacy is our
[2:43:23.780 --> 2:43:28.700]  protection against ourselves all humans have the same thing we are all at the
[2:43:28.700 --> 2:43:33.260]  some extent greedy for all to some extent jealous we are all to some extent
[2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:38.180]  lustful and all of the other things and given that fact privacy is our
[2:43:38.180 --> 2:43:42.620]  protection against ourselves when we can go and do things which really are
[2:43:42.620 --> 2:43:49.100]  innocent it's not people becoming afraid of what we might be doing and so we
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:54.620]  all have to have it it's the necessity of life if we are to be individuals now
[2:43:54.620 --> 2:43:58.140]  if we're in some communist state where we don't think alike and dress alike and
[2:43:58.140 --> 2:44:01.700]  there is no change oh you don't need privacy but then there are people as
[2:44:01.700 --> 2:44:08.940]  well we are robots the question is is do we have the courage to remain human I
[2:44:08.940 --> 2:44:14.220]  don't know I'm gonna do my part well I want to apologize to you John you
[2:44:14.220 --> 2:44:17.460]  probably don't even know why the few times you came on our show first I was
[2:44:17.460 --> 2:44:21.860]  respectful I was nice to you but the story was so wild I was hedging my
[2:44:21.860 --> 2:44:25.500]  bets thinking I know the guy's really smart you know he's really successful I
[2:44:25.500 --> 2:44:28.260]  know it's the mainstream media demonizing him so I'll give him the
[2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:32.500]  benefit of the doubt but I was still you know a little sarcastic a little
[2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:36.460]  hesitant but now seeing everything you talked about coming out and turning out
[2:44:36.460 --> 2:44:40.620]  to be true it's so fantastic it actually happened the way you said what an adventure
[2:44:40.620 --> 2:44:45.220]  and now you're saying things that are so profound here on air I really admire
[2:44:45.220 --> 2:44:48.940]  the work you're doing standing up against these tyrants so so I
[2:44:48.940 --> 2:44:53.820]  apologize for doubting you no need to apologize now she was actually the kind
[2:44:53.820 --> 2:44:58.620]  of all people to me during that time we really were so I thank you again Wow
[2:44:58.620 --> 2:45:02.180]  well John have you ever come through awesome we like to get you in studio in

[2:45:46.020 --> 2:45:51.180]  amazing I again I gotta be honest I mean I said this on air too I mean it was so
[2:45:51.180 --> 2:45:56.340]  fantastic what he was saying Ryerson Chinese he was even saying the names of
[2:45:56.340 --> 2:45:59.660]  the of the Muslim groups that were there getting all this and that's why they
[2:45:59.660 --> 2:46:03.740]  came after him and then it all came out later than indeed just what he said was
[2:46:03.740 --> 2:46:08.580]  going on we've been sat on a TV interview with him once for like a month
[2:46:08.580 --> 2:46:12.540]  just because I didn't even know if I could air it it was so wild and then it
[2:46:12.540 --> 2:46:17.420]  turned out it was true but that guy's just super smart folks you can just hear
[2:46:17.420 --> 2:46:21.220]  him he has that you know like a lot smarter than I am like I kind of get
[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:25.020]  like that manic you can tell he's a really smart guy and there's the way he
[2:46:25.020 --> 2:46:29.460]  boils down privacy and what it means and why it's so important I'm really mad at
[2:46:29.460 --> 2:46:33.580]  my shelf because I get the latitude if I don't care they know what I'm doing
[2:46:33.580 --> 2:46:36.940]  now of course that's their argument well if you don't care that's on the NSA
[2:46:36.940 --> 2:46:40.620]  website if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear if you're not
[2:46:40.620 --> 2:46:45.500]  doing anything wrong don't worry it actually says that that is the essence
[2:46:45.500 --> 2:46:48.980]  of caring but then I double down on it and go I know you crooks are watching
[2:46:48.980 --> 2:46:53.580]  me I know you're raping my privacy alright whatever you know but still
[2:46:53.580 --> 2:46:58.660]  being macho about it is wrong I should be doing everything I can to protect my
[2:46:58.660 --> 2:47:03.460]  privacy I should be protecting my security like it's a macho that I just
[2:47:03.460 --> 2:47:06.740]  strut around in public with no bodyguards not caring I don't even do it
[2:47:06.740 --> 2:47:10.700]  on purpose I really am not afraid it is wild like I've had like police
[2:47:10.700 --> 2:47:14.380]  detectives here and FBI people and others going man you're crazy to go to
[2:47:14.380 --> 2:47:17.620]  the stuff you do you know by yourself with no security and all the stuff and
[2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:22.860]  the more I think about it is I have a responsibility to protect my privacy I
[2:47:22.860 --> 2:47:27.500]  have a responsibility to protect my safety and I think that's the essence of
[2:47:27.500 --> 2:47:33.060]  why America has fallen so far is that we just think yeah so what have you scum
[2:47:33.060 --> 2:47:36.820]  are doing that or we'll muddle through it we have to stop just muddling through
[2:47:36.820 --> 2:47:43.300]  it and putting up with it we've got to really take it personal and get off the
[2:47:43.300 --> 2:47:46.580]  grid as much as we can and then we go interface with the internet because
[2:47:46.580 --> 2:47:48.660]  this is a great tool to fight the globalist but they're gonna try to shut
[2:47:48.660 --> 2:47:52.660]  this down we've got to be creating alternatives we've got to be trying to be
[2:47:52.660 --> 2:47:57.180]  privacy oriented we've got to use cash as much as possible it's not that we've
[2:47:57.180 --> 2:48:00.820]  done something wrong we got to keep cash alive once they get the cash was
[2:48:00.820 --> 2:48:04.060]  grid and they could tax the daylights out of us track us control us and they
[2:48:04.060 --> 2:48:07.620]  admit that's their plan I mean you could hear McAfee you know with bated
[2:48:07.620 --> 2:48:10.060]  breathes I can't believe it's happening I can't believe it's happening because
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:13.900]  it's really happening they're really arresting reporters they're really
[2:48:13.900 --> 2:48:17.540]  telling Catholic priests will arrest you if you pray with somebody on military
[2:48:17.540 --> 2:48:22.700]  bases they're really telling volunteers you can't meet with troops off base when
[2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:27.940]  they have a family member die you can't go to give a funeral for somebody's
[2:48:27.940 --> 2:48:33.460]  family you can't give military burials oh yeah they're not telling people my
[2:48:33.460 --> 2:48:37.380]  great uncle had a military burial two months ago they had guys come out into
[2:48:37.380 --> 2:48:43.220]  the 21 guns salute and you know do the army you know style thing where they
[2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:47.340]  walk in with a coffin and fold up the they're talking about restricting those
[2:48:47.340 --> 2:48:51.220]  and if we catch you in uniform volunteering we're it's already
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:56.500]  volunteered anyways I mean it's disgusting what these people get away
[2:48:56.500 --> 2:49:02.140]  with it how we've let them walk all over us I feel dirty I feel pathetic that's
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:05.300]  why so many times you'll say oh you're so great you're so wonderful folks I am
[2:49:05.300 --> 2:49:10.700]  not it's not that I don't like being complimented it's okay it's that I am so
[2:49:10.700 --> 2:49:14.580]  upset that I'm not doing enough and then I can't do enough that when people
[2:49:14.580 --> 2:49:19.580]  tell me how great I am all day I I don't want you to do that I'm not great
[2:49:19.580 --> 2:49:24.020]  folks we as a people are great if we rediscover our greatness and liberty
[2:49:24.020 --> 2:49:28.820]  we've got to go out and fight these people I mean I want to go out and stick
[2:49:28.820 --> 2:49:31.700]  up bumper stickers all over town to wake people up I want to go out and
[2:49:31.700 --> 2:49:36.620]  confront police running checkpoints I want to go out and protested in the
[2:49:36.620 --> 2:49:40.500]  abortion clinic I want to go to Fort Hood and walk into a general's office and
[2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:44.860]  say how dare you follow illegal orders then all that people have church now
[2:49:44.860 --> 2:49:48.220]  during a government shutdown and tell them doesn't matter of the priest in the
[2:49:48.220 --> 2:49:51.700]  case of the Catholics from public you know minister to people this is
[2:49:51.700 --> 2:49:55.780]  outrageous we should be saying out and you know the pipe on some list saying
[2:49:55.780 --> 2:49:59.580]  we should go get in the general's face I'm a terrorist for speaking out I mean
[2:49:59.580 --> 2:50:04.580]  it's disgusting everything good has been listed as terrorism under the fake
[2:50:04.580 --> 2:50:09.500]  threat of al-Qaeda when they run al-Qaeda publicly they run the drugs
[2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:13.780]  publicly and again 95% of the government's not involved in the
[2:50:13.780 --> 2:50:17.660]  corruption but they sit there and stand down and ignore it and are
[2:50:17.660 --> 2:50:22.100]  compartmentalized which makes you complicit but here's another big epiphany

[2:50:27.780 --> 2:50:32.740]  along with it you're now complicit on record it's gone way past the point of

[2:50:36.660 --> 2:50:40.540]  big epiphany this is the biggest secret yet I know you already know this in your
[2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:44.780]  gut but we haven't said it if they get away with all this now with it being so

[2:55:50.100 --> 2:55:53.700]  Dylan thank you for calling in what's on your mind today
[2:55:53.700 --> 2:56:01.740]  hello Alex I'd like to talk to you about HR 3210 bill called pay our military
[2:56:01.740 --> 2:56:08.660]  act it was signed on the 30th of September by President Obama stating you
[2:56:08.660 --> 2:56:13.060]  know trying to get the military paid because as of right now active duty
[2:56:13.060 --> 2:56:19.420]  military the reserves in the National Guard are no longer going to be paid it
[2:56:19.420 --> 2:56:23.380]  says here that military members cannot be paid for duty performed after the
[2:56:23.380 --> 2:56:30.700]  expiration of the current CRA on September 30th yes I'm familiar with
[2:56:30.700 --> 2:56:34.660]  that and that basically just keeps Obamacare going it's it's all deadlock
[2:56:34.660 --> 2:56:37.740]  with both sides trying to act like they're the ones that are trying to get
[2:56:37.740 --> 2:56:42.060]  the government going it is Obama that is obstructing it is the Republicans that
[2:56:42.060 --> 2:56:48.500]  are trying to strip out the really criminal stuff in the in the Obamacare
[2:56:48.500 --> 2:56:54.900]  but what's your overall take on this overall it's it's kind of unbelievable
[2:56:54.900 --> 2:56:59.340]  and it says here they're going to be paid up until September 30th and after
[2:56:59.340 --> 2:57:03.700]  that there is no money going to active duty reserve or National Guard members
[2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:08.340]  yeah well Obama says he's gonna sign that bill so that means it's passed here
[2:57:08.340 --> 2:57:11.940]  it is from Politico President Obama plans to sign a last-minute bill
[2:57:11.940 --> 2:57:15.540]  authorizing paychecks for troops the Republicans are sending a bunch of like
[2:57:15.540 --> 2:57:19.900]  tailored bills that they can all agree on I mean that they're up there
[2:57:19.900 --> 2:57:23.180]  actually trying to get that stuff passed the house passed the bill to ensure the
[2:57:23.180 --> 2:57:27.860]  military is paid was approved without dissent and the Senate on Monday a rare
[2:57:27.860 --> 2:57:31.300]  bipartisan agreement what are Democrats telling you that still hasn't gone
[2:57:31.300 --> 2:57:36.740]  through I'm not sure who's telling me it exactly but it says here that however
[2:57:36.740 --> 2:57:42.700]  there is no Treasury warrant to allow payments all right well the issue is the
[2:57:42.700 --> 2:57:46.940]  bill was was passed a week ago and signed by Obama so there you go I
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:53.060]  appreciate your call sounds like more Democratic disinfo to me being put out
[2:57:53.060 --> 2:57:55.860]  there but we'll have to track it let's jam in one more before we're gonna break

[3:00:41.140 --> 3:00:44.860]  CIA's involved Bill Clinton is orchestrated the bushes are the biggest
[3:00:44.860 --> 3:00:50.780]  Nazis that ever entered our by the way I have a 1937 New York Times showing the
[3:00:50.780 --> 3:00:56.140]  10 FEMA regions even though FEMA wasn't set up till 1979 I have that New York
[3:00:56.140 --> 3:01:00.100]  Times article it's all a total plan you're absolutely right it's absolutely
[3:01:00.100 --> 3:01:03.580]  a plan that's in its end games we're at five minutes to midnight on the death
[3:01:03.580 --> 3:01:07.980]  clock if you don't wake up and start protesting and get your children out of
[3:01:07.980 --> 3:01:11.460]  school and the last thing I'm going to say right here right now and I'm not
[3:01:11.460 --> 3:01:15.580]  playing games here from everything I've read is that when Dick Cheney discussed
[3:01:15.580 --> 3:01:21.660]  dirty bombs in this country in 2008 they are here there are a dozen plus of them
[3:01:21.660 --> 3:01:30.300]  and they're going to use them in the next 24 months guaranteed yeah they got a
[3:01:30.300 --> 3:01:33.340]  lot of nasty stuff playing for us and we'll have to watch the people that did
[3:01:33.340 --> 3:01:37.700]  it poses saviors on TV that's why everybody's really getting upset deep
[3:01:37.700 --> 3:01:41.900]  down people know we are five minutes to midnight you're absolutely right March
[3:01:41.900 --> 3:01:47.900]  1st 2014 March 1st talk later I've been doing this for three years I got a jump
[3:01:47.900 --> 3:01:51.540]  and get to other people I promised you but here's the deal people like but that
[3:01:51.540 --> 3:01:55.060]  will ruin things that'll make things bad we're being conquered this is a
[3:01:55.060 --> 3:01:59.740]  military globalist operation they don't care if they kill 200 million of us to
[3:01:59.740 --> 3:02:05.140]  take over they're that bad okay it's conscious evil I cannot explain that to
[3:02:05.140 --> 3:02:10.140]  people enough these are evil people running things let's talk to Gary in
[3:02:10.140 --> 3:02:21.660]  New York listing on XM 244 go ahead an idea that possibly could happen I was
[3:02:21.660 --> 3:02:25.780]  doing I'm starting to learn a little bit more about Russian history if I'm not
[3:02:25.780 --> 3:02:32.140]  mistaken didn't they let the prisoners out of you know out of jail and what
[3:02:32.140 --> 3:02:36.780]  not yeah linen linen linen took the prisoners and then use them as frontline
[3:02:36.780 --> 3:02:42.020]  torture trips against the the the Russian Christians but then Stalin took
[3:02:42.020 --> 3:02:46.900]  him in World War two and made them the commanders okay so now if they were to
[3:02:46.900 --> 3:02:52.900]  do that same thing here do the prisons do they coincide with the FEMA camp
[3:02:52.900 --> 3:02:56.900]  regions could they you know I mean you know back then it was like bank robbers
[3:02:56.900 --> 3:03:00.660]  swindlers people people for key positions most prisoners stayed in jail
[3:03:00.660 --> 3:03:05.060]  most our prisoners are there on victimless crimes or wimps I mean no I mean
[3:03:05.060 --> 3:03:08.420]  if you're a hardcore psychopathic killer that you know as a master criminal
[3:03:08.420 --> 3:03:12.540]  they'll hire you and then kill you after a few years of service but yes they will
[3:03:12.540 --> 3:03:17.620]  hire criminals they already are they are criminals they are we are run by a
[3:03:17.620 --> 3:03:22.620]  criminal enterprise totally great I just think that the you know I've always
[3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:27.460]  wondered why there are there are a lot of people that are in jail are allowed to
[3:03:27.460 --> 3:03:31.540]  be in there lifting weights and you know they're better conditioned than you
[3:03:31.540 --> 3:03:35.580]  know Americans outside well they want them big and strong people come out and
[3:03:35.580 --> 3:03:39.060]  abuse people they have actuaries where they release the violent criminals to
[3:03:39.060 --> 3:03:42.260]  abuse people so they can call for more police it's all been scientifically
[3:03:42.260 --> 3:03:46.860]  broken down and that's all been published yes your good points actually
[3:03:46.860 --> 3:03:49.460]  that they haven't with whites and stuff so they don't kill each other but but
[3:03:49.460 --> 3:03:53.780]  but that that is part of it clockwork orange is about that the book Barry in
[3:03:53.780 --> 3:03:58.220]  Illinois you're on the air go ahead mr. Jones is a pleasure to speak to you
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:02.460]  today yes sir we got one minute brother um as a veteran called out of the
[3:04:02.460 --> 3:04:07.540]  military to be a pastor for God and fight the government these times one of our
[3:04:07.540 --> 3:04:12.700]  founding fathers said give me liberty or give me death well when I turn on the
[3:04:12.700 --> 3:04:16.980]  TV and I see they've shut down the Statue of Liberty they've not been allowed
[3:04:16.980 --> 3:04:21.420]  to get near the Liberty Bell I don't understand why this is not our country's
[3:04:21.420 --> 3:04:25.020]  cry right now and I fear that our country is on the wrong side of Bible
[3:04:25.020 --> 3:04:29.300]  prophecy but I want to give the people hope and let them to remember that if the
[3:04:29.300 --> 3:04:33.140]  victory is not in our hands the fight is among us but the victory is gonna be
[3:04:33.140 --> 3:04:36.900]  with Jesus he's gonna come back he's gonna defeat this evil because we battle
[3:04:36.900 --> 3:04:41.740]  not against flesh and bones but against principalities and spirits and I agree
[3:04:41.740 --> 3:04:45.340]  with you like none of us we can be given a reprieve if our churches weren't run
[3:04:45.340 --> 3:04:49.420]  by the devil and that's why it's important for lay pastors and people to go
[3:04:49.420 --> 3:04:53.860]  out and and be the salt of the earth because the churches are now eyes of
[3:04:53.860 --> 3:05:22.140]  Mordor most of them serving the New World Order and its agenda
