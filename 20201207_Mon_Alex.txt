[00:00.000 --> 00:14.080]  The Chinese virus takedown of America doesn't appear to be slowing down.
[00:14.080 --> 00:21.240]  Quite the contrary, nearly 200,000 small businesses have closed 60% of them permanently.
[00:21.240 --> 00:27.960]  Yelp is publishing some worrying data here that shows a 23% increase since mid-July in
[00:27.960 --> 00:32.240]  the number of businesses on Yelp that have permanently closed.
[00:32.240 --> 00:39.840]  According to the company, permanent enclosures are reaching 97,966, plus 98,000 here, representing
[00:39.840 --> 00:43.600]  about 60% of closed businesses that won't be reopening.
[00:43.600 --> 00:48.080]  City Sheriff's deputies came to the bar performing surveillance after they received reports that
[00:48.080 --> 00:52.640]  Max Public House was reopening after it was ordered closed.
[00:52.640 --> 00:57.880]  Now a deputy tried to arrest Presti right here at the scene.
[00:57.880 --> 01:02.760]  It was at that moment where the deputy was clipped by his car forced to cling to the
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.760]  hood.
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.240]  Presti was apprehended about 100 yards down the street and was taken to the 122 precinct
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.120]  here on Staten Island, but earlier in the night he spoke with us about why he's remaining
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.120]  open.
[01:15.120 --> 01:22.560]  This is an act of defiance and we're just going road, this is to bring awareness and
[01:22.560 --> 01:29.920]  say where we're struggling and a lot of people in all these businesses, we've lost a lot.
[01:29.920 --> 01:30.920]  We open today?
[01:30.920 --> 01:31.920]  Absolutely.
[01:31.920 --> 01:38.520]  I believe you have already been given a warning about being open, not being open.
[01:38.520 --> 01:45.480]  This is an order from the mayor or from the governor through the mayor that he is considered
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.040]  non-essential should not be open and if we keep coming back and we see him open, he's
[01:51.040 --> 01:59.440]  going to get another ticket and also he runs the risk of getting his business license revoked
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.840]  by the city and he will be able to open it all.
[02:02.840 --> 02:03.840]  It's criminal?
[02:03.840 --> 02:05.080]  Yes, it's a class 3 misdemeanor.
[02:05.080 --> 02:06.080]  Why?
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.640]  I don't know, I don't make the law.
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.840]  Now the globalists are chomping at the bit to stick the needle in, boosting profits in
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.320]  the interest of their big pharma cohorts.
[02:15.320 --> 02:19.680]  As soon as she walked out, I thought, oh, she's sick, but like sick in a good way.
[02:19.680 --> 02:21.640]  Do you end up putting your mask back on?
[02:21.640 --> 02:23.560]  Do you end up putting your mask back on?
[02:23.560 --> 02:27.520]  Several companies raced to get a vaccine approved, but early trials show you may need
[02:27.520 --> 02:29.360]  to prepare for side effects.
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.400]  Liza Lucas joins us from the bridge and Liza, these side effects are expected to be mild
[02:33.400 --> 02:35.640]  but could really impact your daily life.
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.840]  Yes, it depends on how you react and how you take that feeling of feeling crummy because
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.320]  that is what the early data is suggesting that several of these vaccines may make you
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.680]  feel crummy for a couple of days and then you got to go and get that second dose.
[02:49.680 --> 02:56.320]  But if the frontline workers experience adverse side effects or worse, the only possible solution
[02:56.320 --> 03:02.160]  would be a full blown takeover by the United Nations World Health Organization oversight
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.520]  of the CDC-guided federal government that is already toying with COVID camps.
[03:08.520 --> 03:15.360]  As the CDC website explains, the shielding approach aims to reduce the number of severe
[03:15.360 --> 03:22.920]  COVID-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe
[03:22.920 --> 03:25.680]  disease and the general population.
[03:25.680 --> 03:32.600]  High risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or green zones established
[03:32.600 --> 03:36.480]  at the household, neighborhood, camp, sector or community level.
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.360]  They would have minimal contact with family members and other low risk residents.
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.760]  Older population groups make up a small percentage of the total population.
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.480]  For this reason, the shielding approach suggests physically separating high risk individuals
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.360]  from the general population to prioritize the use of the limited available resources
[03:58.360 --> 04:03.640]  and avoid implementing long term containment measures among the general population.
[04:03.640 --> 04:10.920]  Meanwhile, we face a vaccine rollout as autism cases rise exponentially every year as Psychology
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.240]  Today reported at the start of the millennium, the rate of ASD reported by the U.S. Centers
[04:17.240 --> 04:23.040]  for Disease Control, starting in 2004 there has been an increase announced every two years,
[04:23.040 --> 04:33.360]  one in 125 in 2004, one in 110 in 2006, one in 88 in 2008, one in 68 in 2010 and 2012,
[04:33.360 --> 04:35.920]  one in 59 in 2014.
[04:35.920 --> 04:43.040]  In 2020, the rate stands now at one in 54 with boys four times more likely to succumb
[04:43.040 --> 04:44.120]  to autism.
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.960]  The pain and suffering and sheer damage of the COVID vaccinations could turn out to be
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.400]  the greatest federal government failure in human history.
[04:53.400 --> 04:59.000]  But this of course is how the globalists kill us all.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.080]  Prepare with Alex.com is a special website with my patriot because they have agreements
[05:05.080 --> 05:09.080]  with other distributors that they all sell the same low price, high quality, storeable

[06:25.160 --> 06:29.400]  Well President Trump said he made his most important speech of his presidency last week
[06:29.400 --> 06:33.760]  and I agree with him, but subsequent speeches are going to be even more important as he
[06:33.760 --> 06:38.960]  decides to fight the gaslighting, the media fraud, the scam that the system has put in
[06:38.960 --> 06:45.080]  place telling us that Joe Biden is the president and that we can't challenge that though Joe
[06:45.080 --> 06:51.200]  Biden said that he was going to be challenging the election because he believed he was going
[06:51.200 --> 06:57.680]  to lose and he was going to wait until it got certified by the electors and that even
[06:57.680 --> 07:04.280]  then he would try to stop the inauguration of Trump on the 20th and Matthew McConaughey
[07:04.280 --> 07:09.600]  has come out, we'll play the clip later in the hour on Russell Brands podcast and said
[07:09.600 --> 07:13.800]  you know that's really hypocritical for them to act like it's crazy that the Trump people
[07:13.800 --> 07:15.960]  are challenging this.
[07:15.960 --> 07:20.080]  That's all the Democrats did four years ago and for the next three years saying he was
[07:20.080 --> 07:26.760]  a Russian agent and then it's so incredibly condescending, exactly, they think we have
[07:26.760 --> 07:32.000]  no memory plus they said Trump was a Russian agent and there was Russian collusion, none
[07:32.000 --> 07:39.920]  of that was ever found, but in the case of fraud in this election and Chinese connections
[07:39.920 --> 07:46.640]  you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit corruption and chai con involvement.
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.360]  Now, let me just up front tell you what we're covering, it'll take this segment to tell
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.040]  you what's coming up and I'm getting chills right now because this is the most important
[07:56.040 --> 07:59.760]  broadcast I've ever done and tomorrow will be even more important and then the next even
[07:59.760 --> 08:05.560]  more important because the quickening, wow, wow, that's super chill.
[08:05.560 --> 08:12.360]  The quickening is here, we are at an incredible point in history and revelation and all of
[08:12.360 --> 08:17.560]  that unfolding I believe is only a decade or so away, but this is the beast system, the
[08:17.560 --> 08:25.400]  world government preparing us with calamities to come to accepting this evil world government
[08:25.400 --> 08:29.520]  anti-human system which you don't have to read out of the Bible, you can see it in the
[08:29.520 --> 08:32.920]  news and what they're pushing against us.
[08:32.920 --> 08:37.840]  So let me give you the ultra massive news that I will detail in the next segment, this
[08:37.840 --> 08:43.160]  will be the first news we hit, but just let me give you the headlines now, Alito moves
[08:43.160 --> 08:47.560]  up deadline for Supreme Court briefing in Pennsylvania case, bringing within safe harbor
[08:47.560 --> 08:51.480]  window to intervene.
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.160]  Number three weeks ago, they moved Supreme Court justices around to put the conservative
[08:55.160 --> 09:00.400]  ones over the five battleground states, unprecedented so that they would immediately be able to
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.480]  swoop in and accelerate Trump's appeals, wouldn't do that if they hadn't seen evidence
[09:05.480 --> 09:14.360]  of fraud, wouldn't do that if they weren't planning to say no Biden, you're not the president,
[09:14.360 --> 09:21.800]  did it again, did it again, did it again, did it again, now you talk about edge of
[09:21.800 --> 09:30.960]  my seat, whoa, sorry, I've been preparing for a day for this broadcast, every one of
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.640]  these articles, I've either looked at it or read the whole damn thing, I mean, you wait
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.360]  till I get to what I've gotten the COVID stack, it's all just isn't crazy, they admit it sterilizes
[09:42.360 --> 09:49.400]  women in the damn medical reports and they admit it doesn't even protect you, I've got
[09:49.400 --> 09:54.080]  all that right here in the stack.
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.840]  So let me go through these headlines for you right now.
[09:56.840 --> 10:02.000]  Go moves up deadline for Supreme Court briefing in Pennsylvania case, bringing within safe
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.760]  harbor, window to intervene, but wait, it's even crazier, Pelosi for the first time since
[10:09.760 --> 10:18.040]  the mid 1980s, the Democrats have filed an emergency injunction announcing they plan
[10:18.040 --> 10:26.800]  under civil rights to overturn the 15 Republican wins in the House, they bring them within
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.160]  two or three seats of getting the house, wow, wow.
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.520]  So they're saying that their election that isn't even certified as legitimate, but they're
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.560]  going after House races, Republicans won and say they're going to reverse them, whoa.
[10:44.560 --> 10:50.360]  And again, this is barely even making the news.
[10:50.360 --> 10:57.040]  Pelosi wants her House election losses overturned by the Perkins Coe in New York, Iowa and other
[10:57.040 --> 10:58.040]  areas.
[10:58.040 --> 11:02.600]  I mean, folks, they get Biden in, they're going to pack the court.
[11:02.600 --> 11:05.040]  They are in an insane asylum move right now.
[11:05.040 --> 11:07.680]  I mean, this is just bum rush zombie attack.
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.680]  It's insane.
[11:08.680 --> 11:09.680]  No, no.
[11:09.680 --> 11:10.680]  Sorry, I'm already kind of getting to it.
[11:10.680 --> 11:11.680]  Let me just show you.
[11:11.680 --> 11:15.760]  A let toe moves up deadline for Supreme Court briefing in Pennsylvania case, bringing within
[11:15.760 --> 11:18.360]  safe harbor, window to intervene.
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.480]  Of course, what says Supreme Court may rule to let legislators pick alternate electors.
[11:22.480 --> 11:25.880]  Yep, that's where it's going told you that on the day before the election, I said that's
[11:25.880 --> 11:26.880]  where it's going.
[11:26.880 --> 11:30.400]  AG bar may reside before the year end.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.400]  That's good news.
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.480]  Let's get some money in their hardcore.
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.440]  We need a war conciliatory breaking huge major national security issues identified
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.200]  relative to China's connection to Dominion voting machines where special software was
[11:42.200 --> 11:48.560]  brought in by Dominion attached to it illegally from China.
[11:48.560 --> 11:51.160]  I won't be able to be interviewed.
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.160]  I need attorney.
[11:52.160 --> 11:57.880]  George's Ruby Friedman lawyers up and it turns out they found out who was in command
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.200]  and who told the news that it was a water main that broke Ralph Jones.
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.040]  Ralph Jones was the field marshal.
[12:08.040 --> 12:15.400]  This is bigger than me, George's Ruby Friedman lawyers up, cancels interview bigger than
[12:15.400 --> 12:16.400]  me.
[12:16.400 --> 12:17.400]  Huge.
[12:17.400 --> 12:22.640]  We caught them criminal conspiracy revealed third suspect in George's suitcase candle
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.160]  is also the same man who spread the lies that the water main broke in the state farm
[12:27.160 --> 12:29.480]  center says gateway punna.com.
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.840]  Think about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.840]  Think about this long and hard.
[12:35.840 --> 12:39.280]  You have them saying it's closed, the counting stopped.
[12:39.280 --> 12:41.560]  They kick everyone out.
[12:41.560 --> 12:47.160]  Then they all run in there like busy beavers like chickens with their heads cut off, cramming
[12:47.160 --> 12:49.960]  these special suitcase ballots in.
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.200]  It all spikes on that exact hour up for Biden.
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.600]  Triple whatever else had been in there that day or more than triple just insane.
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.960]  And then it's the dude doing it who said the water main broke when it didn't and it turns
[13:04.960 --> 13:05.960]  out I'm sorry.
[13:05.960 --> 13:06.960]  I hadn't told you that yet.
[13:06.960 --> 13:09.520]  Oh, oh, oh, we'll tell you all next segment.
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.960]  Turns out he's the head of the Democratic Party and a whole sector and is the main spokesperson
[13:14.960 --> 13:20.640]  for one of the Democrats Senate candidates, Warnock.
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.520]  And of course, Stacey Abrams.
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.520]  Wow.
[13:23.520 --> 13:24.520]  Wow.
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.320]  Might as well just have Hillary Clinton in there saying the water main broke.
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.800]  I mean, we have them so damn open and shut.
[13:32.800 --> 13:37.520]  Oh, but the FBI won't do a thing because the globalist packed it.
[13:37.520 --> 13:43.880]  They've been packing it since Bush senior and Trump never got control of it.
[13:43.880 --> 13:53.040]  And now the Democrats can do anything, anything, anything, or at least they think there's a
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.920]  whole lot of dirt getting ready to come out on all these people breaking third suspect
[13:57.920 --> 14:03.200]  from State Farm Center's suitcase scandal in the fight is Ralph Jones senior.
[14:03.200 --> 14:11.840]  Woo, top Democrat, whoo, WikiLeaks email reveals Dominion's ties to John Podesta Hillary
[14:11.840 --> 14:13.840]  Clinton campaign.
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.360]  Oh, agents raid home in Maricopa County and voted out of that investigation confiscate
[14:18.360 --> 14:21.720]  eight hard drives, 13 computers and a bag of USB sticks.
[14:21.720 --> 14:24.000]  Oh, get way pundit.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.920]  So at least we got some local governments doing something.
[14:26.920 --> 14:30.000]  Yeah, folks, move against the globalist.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.400]  Domino's Wisconsin is next state to announce public hearings to election following PAAZ
[14:34.400 --> 14:41.600]  MINGA breaking expert and advise 200,000 votes hijacked from Trump to Biden in Georgia at
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.360]  the precinct level.
[14:44.360 --> 14:48.320]  Deep state threat governor Kim's daughter's boyfriend killed in fiery explosion wreck
[14:48.320 --> 14:50.800]  last night.
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.320]  Trump reportedly mulling skipping Biden inauguration stage grand finale exit opposition rally that
[14:55.320 --> 14:57.240]  should not happen.
[14:57.240 --> 15:02.680]  Georgia Dems off off war not campaign with anti-Semite fair Jews to termites.
[15:02.680 --> 15:06.800]  DOJ notified of Pakistani link to Nevada's election email system.
[15:06.800 --> 15:07.800]  Yep.
[15:07.800 --> 15:10.760]  Oh, but it gets more delicious.
[15:10.760 --> 15:18.000]  George Soros appoints chair of smartmatic parent company to lead open society foundations
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.640]  and they've been heavily involved in scams and fraud.
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.880]  And of course, they're heavily involved with Dominion Soros is but oh, see it.
[15:24.880 --> 15:30.120]  In fact, checked it and said that Hitler has nothing to do with the Nazis either and that
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.760]  foxes don't have red fur.
[15:33.760 --> 15:34.760]  And it continues.
[15:34.760 --> 15:38.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, oh, I haven't even scratched the surface of it all.
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.760]  But Pelosi says the elections in the House real legitimate and they're going to use a
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.840]  bizarre law where they can overturn elections and give it to Democrats.
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.640]  Oh, but Trump with all the red-handed evidence, oh, it's preposterous.
[15:50.640 --> 15:51.640]  It's insane.
[15:51.640 --> 15:52.640]  It's crazy.
[15:52.640 --> 15:56.400]  Trump has a good chance of beating these monsters, but it's up to us.
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.240]  You know, something very sad is happening and it's very sad because it was all avoidable
[16:00.240 --> 16:04.960]  two and a half years ago and info wars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.400]  I warn everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that
[16:09.400 --> 16:15.200]  they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.560]  was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and populists.
[16:20.560 --> 16:21.880]  And now that's happened.
[16:21.880 --> 16:25.800]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that
[16:25.800 --> 16:31.880]  demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump knew to get out front
[16:31.880 --> 16:35.520]  and fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax.
[16:35.520 --> 16:40.200]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand
[16:40.200 --> 16:43.000]  that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.600]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to serve up the American people and
[16:46.600 --> 16:47.600]  divide us.
[16:47.600 --> 16:50.600]  And they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy to try to control
[16:50.600 --> 16:51.600]  us.
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.640]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air, tell me what's coming
[16:55.640 --> 16:56.640]  next.

[18:00.080 --> 18:27.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:27.080 --> 18:35.400]  The year is 2020, I'm your host Alex Jones, very honored and thankful to be here with
[18:35.400 --> 18:36.400]  you today.
[18:36.400 --> 18:41.160]  I want to remind you we're in an information war, the enemy, the multinational corporations,
[18:41.160 --> 18:44.760]  allied with the chai comms are working around the clock to try to suppress information or
[18:44.760 --> 18:48.240]  communications so they can gaslight us and steal our entire future.
[18:48.240 --> 18:55.160]  If they're able to hustle their Soros chai com robot into the White House, they are
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.960]  going to never take their boot off of our neck again and we will have to go down the
[18:59.960 --> 19:08.720]  road of secession and some type of political, cultural, noncompliance, mass civil disobedience,
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.880]  they will then get violent and we will go into a physical civil war, which is the last
[19:12.880 --> 19:19.080]  thing I want and which I have worked tirelessly against because I understand the false flags
[19:19.080 --> 19:22.560]  and stuff they're going to pull and that the public is very weak minded these days and
[19:22.560 --> 19:30.240]  it's going to be beyond a, you know, what show begins with S H and dash T.
[19:30.240 --> 19:36.720]  So we're here, but let me give you the really good news and I'll get into the bad news next
[19:36.720 --> 19:41.480]  segment and what we're facing and the fact that it's all official now, a lockdown is
[19:41.480 --> 19:43.160]  never going to end.
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.560]  And once they've got the resources taken away from you, they're going to make you take
[19:46.560 --> 19:52.680]  all their vaccines and send your children for transgender and anti-white, anti-american
[19:52.680 --> 19:53.680]  training.
[19:53.680 --> 19:54.680]  It's all being announced.
[19:54.680 --> 19:55.920]  That's why they want you on welfare.
[19:55.920 --> 19:59.160]  That's why they want control of you so you can be a disadvantaged group.
[19:59.160 --> 20:01.720]  They're going to take care of like they do the black people.
[20:01.720 --> 20:04.080]  They take real good care of them.
[20:04.080 --> 20:07.320]  Let me tell you, and that's who gets the vaccine first is Africans.
[20:07.320 --> 20:14.480]  Oh, in Africa and in America, oh, Bill Gates loves you.
[20:14.480 --> 20:20.840]  And then we have all the proof here that the mRNA vaccine sure as hell, we knew what happened.
[20:20.840 --> 20:25.480]  Top scientists have come out, head of the European Union's own medical commission, Wolfgang
[20:25.480 --> 20:28.080]  Wudarg, the top doctor.
[20:28.080 --> 20:30.000]  And guess what he said?
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Guess what he said?
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.240]  Oh, just so happens that it looks like it attacks the placenta.
[20:35.240 --> 20:36.240]  That's right.
[20:36.240 --> 20:41.240]  It makes your cells produce a protein to have an autoimmune response and oh, guess what
[20:41.240 --> 20:43.520]  it hits?
[20:43.520 --> 20:45.240]  It hits the placenta.
[20:45.240 --> 20:49.680]  That's where when the egg and the sperm meet and they start replicating at a certain point,
[20:49.680 --> 20:50.680]  it becomes a zygote.
[20:50.680 --> 20:57.960]  And then the zygote goes down into the lining of the uterus that it looks like blood, but
[20:57.960 --> 21:00.160]  under a microscope, it's not.
[21:00.160 --> 21:05.320]  It's basically fertilizer woman produces for the baby to have nutrients to get enough
[21:05.320 --> 21:11.840]  nutrient off of that first level, that first meal of those cells it's able to absorb to
[21:11.840 --> 21:18.320]  then start programming the wall of the uterus to send in blood vessels.
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.680]  And then once the little sweetie cake attaches itself in there, the leftists call it a parasite.
[21:23.680 --> 21:27.560]  They call themselves a parasite, I guess I don't know where they are, but not the baby.
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.400]  They're projecting themselves onto the child and then it begins to get the nutrients.
[21:31.400 --> 21:39.520]  But sorry, baby attaches and then huge proteins are attacked by the antibodies and babies cut
[21:39.520 --> 21:42.360]  off like an astronaut with an air hose out in space.
[21:42.360 --> 21:45.960]  You're just like clip, bye, bye, 2001 space Odyssey.
[21:45.960 --> 21:50.040]  Let's show 2001 space Odyssey, the astronaut being killed.
[21:50.040 --> 21:54.320]  Let's show how 9,000 goes, oh, you don't need that, do you?
[21:54.320 --> 21:55.320]  Oh, liberal show.
[21:55.320 --> 21:57.720]  And it's like, oh, it's for black people.
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.720]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[21:58.720 --> 22:02.000]  I already said I'd get to that next segment, didn't I?
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  Oh, boy.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  Oh, boy.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  Oh, boy.
[22:05.000 --> 22:06.000]  Oh, boy.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  Oh, boy.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.880]  Well, Jones, you're a hypocrite, you don't want open borders with Africa and, you know,
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.360]  there aren't a lot of Africans.
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.360]  Yeah, doesn't mean I want to kill them all.
[22:15.360 --> 22:19.000]  I want to build up their countries and industrialize it and treat them like I want to be treated
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.520]  because that's how God works.
[22:20.520 --> 22:24.880]  And if you start treating people like trash, it comes back on you and I care about those
[22:24.880 --> 22:25.880]  people.
[22:25.880 --> 22:30.920]  Not because I'm a bleeding heart because I have a connection to God.
[22:30.920 --> 22:37.800]  Now, that's the part where they shoot the astronaut, shoots himself out of the capsule
[22:37.800 --> 22:41.280]  to get it and turn the hell of 9,000 off.
[22:41.280 --> 22:46.920]  It's the scene where the astronaut is killed in 2001 Space Odyssey, he's out there working
[22:46.920 --> 22:52.400]  on the ship, computers lied to him, sent him out there, and then it uses the pod to cut
[22:52.400 --> 22:55.920]  his air cord and shoot him off into space.
[22:55.920 --> 22:56.920]  But it doesn't matter.
[22:56.920 --> 22:57.920]  I already described it.
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.280]  Let me just say this, let's do it this way.
[23:02.280 --> 23:04.280]  I'm going to start over now.
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.360]  And when we come back, a little distracted with the mass sterilization program that's
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.440]  just lovingly rolled out.
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.400]  Oh, but don't worry, white people will get your sterilization too.
[23:14.400 --> 23:19.280]  And like Bill Gates said, it might take five shots for the protein to work, but you're
[23:19.280 --> 23:20.280]  going to be sterile.
[23:20.280 --> 23:21.280]  Oh, guess what?
[23:21.280 --> 23:22.600]  They have a lot of different vaccines.
[23:22.600 --> 23:28.680]  They give other animals to make them sterile, and it's the same program.
[23:28.680 --> 23:34.960]  It's a virus that programs the cells to then either attack or produce a protein.
[23:34.960 --> 23:38.760]  And we'll be going over all the medical literature for you coming up last segment of the shower.
[23:38.760 --> 23:43.200]  You know, you might want to know what it's really meant to do.
[23:43.200 --> 23:44.600]  And I've got all the human admissions.
[23:44.600 --> 23:45.600]  See this?
[23:45.600 --> 23:46.600]  I actually read this.
[23:46.600 --> 23:51.840]  I actually, the last week went over all this, I actually read the medical papers.
[23:51.840 --> 23:57.720]  I spent 15 hours this weekend reading over 20 medical papers at home and in that office
[23:57.720 --> 23:58.720]  right over there.
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.400]  So, so when I, when I tell you this stuff, I've called up medical doctors and genetic
[24:03.400 --> 24:05.960]  engineers and scientists to ask them what the hell all this is.
[24:05.960 --> 24:08.400]  And they said, no, Jones, you've got, that's what it is.
[24:08.400 --> 24:10.400]  It's exactly where it is.
[24:10.400 --> 24:13.000]  So it's not like I've come to these conclusions.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.200]  We have the head of the European Union Advisory Medical Commission saying this, saying this
[24:17.200 --> 24:19.920]  is Nuremberg, Nazi level stuff, boys.
[24:19.920 --> 24:22.040]  What the hell are you up to?
[24:22.040 --> 24:25.840]  Oh, but be a hero where your COVID mask.
[24:25.840 --> 24:26.840]  That's right.
[24:26.840 --> 24:28.640]  Well, this is shorter segment, longer segment coming up.
[24:28.640 --> 24:37.520]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to get into the big Supreme Court and election news
[24:37.520 --> 24:40.880]  and tell you what's going down and how we can defeat these guys.
[24:40.880 --> 24:41.880]  But here's what's going to happen.
[24:41.880 --> 24:45.040]  If he doesn't get a good attorney general in and if we don't start arresting these
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.880]  Chai-Com globalists for their espionage, their takeover, they believe through corporate
[24:49.880 --> 24:54.240]  fraud, agreements and treaties that they own this country, that they own you and they're
[24:54.240 --> 24:55.480]  not going to stop.
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.960]  So even if Trump gets past this fraud, there'll be another one and another one because they
[24:59.960 --> 25:03.560]  never get in trouble for what they're doing.
[25:03.560 --> 25:09.680]  And it ties into the UN and the mRNA vaccine, all the rest of this.
[25:09.680 --> 25:12.200]  These people say we need to depopulate.
[25:12.200 --> 25:14.640]  They run UN commissions on depopulations.
[25:14.640 --> 25:23.000]  Those commissions put out reports calling for vaccines that target the placenta.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.880]  And then they produce it and say it's for COVID-19 and they say they're coming to try
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.160]  to make you take it.
[25:31.160 --> 25:36.280]  The people doing this are real life hitlers in the flesh, okay?
[25:36.280 --> 25:43.160]  I mean, the real deal, not some dude in a sheet out on a farm somewhere who hates black
[25:43.160 --> 25:46.600]  people because once he went into the town and got beat up by racist black people, I
[25:46.600 --> 25:49.160]  mean, let's just get down to what that is.
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.160]  These are real dudes that are coming after everybody.
[25:53.160 --> 25:57.720]  All right, I'm going to come back and get into the election stuff for you.
[25:57.720 --> 26:02.680]  And I'm going to break it all down on the other side.
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.840]  This is the last day, and it is the last day to do promo code PATRIOT and get an additional
[26:07.840 --> 26:09.840]  10% off all the discounts.
[26:09.840 --> 26:12.240]  If something's 30% off, get an additional 10%.
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.480]  If it's 60, additional 10% and free shipping because we were doing accounting this weekend,
[26:16.480 --> 26:21.320]  I was also doing accounting and for year-end stuff and Christmas bonuses and things like
[26:21.320 --> 26:23.240]  that, trying to figure out how much money we've got.
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.320]  And it's not a lot, but thank God we're still on air and still able to operate.
[26:28.320 --> 26:35.320]  And I was going over it all of it and I was realizing we can't do this promo code PATRIOT
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.320]  anymore.
[26:36.320 --> 26:39.880]  So people like it, you're taking advantage of it, but it makes some things loss leaders.

[26:48.280 --> 26:49.280]  Your next order is 10% off.
[26:49.280 --> 26:50.280]  Well, they're right back.
[26:50.280 --> 26:51.280]  infowarstore.com.
[26:51.280 --> 27:01.240]  The globalists and their minions want to play God, Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton,
[27:01.240 --> 27:02.240]  Barack Obama.
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.920]  You look at these sacks of garbage that you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[27:06.920 --> 27:15.480]  Why do they love death because they hate themselves, they project their own disgust with their soul
[27:15.480 --> 27:16.480]  on to us.
[27:16.480 --> 27:22.560]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[27:22.560 --> 27:24.160]  That's why they hate info wars.
[27:24.160 --> 27:25.280]  We believe in humanity.
[27:25.280 --> 27:26.480]  We think you're beautiful.
[27:26.480 --> 27:28.320]  We think you're amazing.
[27:28.320 --> 27:33.560]  Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[27:33.560 --> 27:37.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here, it's now upon us.
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.320]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever when
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.360]  the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[27:43.360 --> 27:44.920]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[27:44.920 --> 27:45.920]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.040]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done because God's
[27:50.040 --> 27:55.520]  on our side and the globalists know it.
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.840]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[27:59.840 --> 28:06.360]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, the trajectory of the species
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.520]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving liberal technocrats and that if we just sit
[28:12.520 --> 28:16.360]  back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans
[28:16.360 --> 28:20.440]  are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out.
[28:20.440 --> 28:27.000]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.360]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.440]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.920]  is that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our own systems,
[28:41.920 --> 28:48.480]  we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[28:48.480 --> 28:52.240]  But instead we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans and
[28:52.240 --> 28:53.240]  us as cattle.
[28:53.240 --> 28:54.880]  And that's the trick.
[28:54.880 --> 28:57.880]  The great reset, where have I heard of that before?
[28:57.880 --> 29:05.360]  Oh, the great leap forward, Mao Zedong ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically
[29:05.360 --> 29:09.960]  shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities
[29:09.960 --> 29:12.880]  and go under communist, commune control.
[29:12.880 --> 29:13.880]  And that's all this is.
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.600]  The big megabanks want to break us into the same ones that put Mao Zedong into power and
[29:17.600 --> 29:20.320]  they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and bringing in the new
[29:20.320 --> 29:25.520]  economy where everything's free because when you're a prisoner, well, everything's free
[29:25.520 --> 29:27.040]  but you're also a slave.
[29:27.040 --> 29:31.800]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level.
[29:31.800 --> 29:35.840]  But of course you got to take those vaccines, you can't have any kids and oh, don't worry
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.320]  though, all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well.
[29:40.320 --> 29:41.320]  I'm not kidding.
[29:41.320 --> 29:45.080]  So they give me some free paper, they give me enough money to basically live in a tiny
[29:45.080 --> 29:47.880]  apartment but they own you, they control you.
[29:47.880 --> 29:48.880]  That's the great reset.
[29:48.880 --> 29:54.040]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at infowars.com.
[30:18.880 --> 30:40.800]  All right, folks, again, this country is fighting for its life.
[30:40.800 --> 30:46.560]  This entire world is fighting for its life.
[30:46.560 --> 30:53.320]  We have a very greedy, hateful group of technocrat predators who are establishing a world corporate
[30:53.320 --> 30:54.320]  government.
[30:54.320 --> 30:55.320]  It's now out in the open.
[30:55.320 --> 30:59.360]  They're announcing world government, world IDs, world travel passports, world medical
[30:59.360 --> 31:03.200]  passports, official brainwashing of your children.
[31:03.200 --> 31:07.360]  YouTube is announcing they're going to suppress all white people's videos and communications
[31:07.360 --> 31:12.420]  because whites are essentially bad and of course it's the same big tech running death
[31:12.420 --> 31:13.720]  camps in China.
[31:13.720 --> 31:17.160]  They're just using that to turn us against each other while they engage in an attack
[31:17.160 --> 31:18.680]  on humanity in general.
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.680]  This is all divide and conquer.
[31:19.680 --> 31:25.880]  We're going to be breaking it all down here today, life and death information that we
[31:25.880 --> 31:32.400]  can and must override, we can and must defeat and we must bring the globalist to justice.
[31:32.400 --> 31:37.600]  Now let's go ahead and play a clip and coming up next hour, I've got some more of these
[31:37.600 --> 31:46.840]  clips of President Trump in Georgia in an extremely powerful speech this weekend where
[31:46.840 --> 31:50.760]  he laid out that, hey, I could go play golf.
[31:50.760 --> 31:52.240]  I could go and join myself.
[31:52.240 --> 31:54.680]  I'm 74, 75 years old.
[31:54.680 --> 31:57.200]  He goes, you know, I like to hang out with my family.
[31:57.200 --> 32:02.520]  I like to have a good time, but he said they stole this election and I'm not going to let
[32:02.520 --> 32:07.560]  them steal it and in a couple of weeks, the media is not going to be too happy about what
[32:07.560 --> 32:09.200]  is about to happen.
[32:09.200 --> 32:10.200]  Here's part of what he had to say.
[32:10.200 --> 32:12.960]  You see the money these people have raised?
[32:12.960 --> 32:20.240]  I mean, it's really, it's very, well, of course, I just raised $250 million and I shoot
[32:20.240 --> 32:21.240]  that.
[32:21.240 --> 32:22.240]  I didn't raise it.
[32:22.240 --> 32:26.760]  It just, I said, how are we doing in that front, you know, because we didn't get great
[32:26.760 --> 32:27.760]  publicity.
[32:27.760 --> 32:32.240]  But they were so happy these guys don't, you might not be happy in a few weeks.
[32:32.240 --> 32:40.640]  You know, you might know they were so happy.
[32:40.640 --> 32:42.040]  So what is he talking about?
[32:42.040 --> 32:45.360]  Well, I'm not someone that wants to produce false hope.
[32:45.360 --> 32:50.080]  I'm not someone telling you that Hillary and all them are secretly in Gitmo and everything's
[32:50.080 --> 32:51.240]  okay.
[32:51.240 --> 32:56.120]  But we have President Trump winning in a landslide victory, getting double triple or even
[32:56.120 --> 33:01.840]  more points of victory in those swing states that he got four years ago.
[33:01.840 --> 33:04.040]  Most of the states he won by half a point or a point.
[33:04.040 --> 33:10.160]  He was winning some of those at six points, five points, four points, three points when
[33:10.160 --> 33:13.120]  they closed those polls.
[33:13.120 --> 33:17.640]  And he won other states like Texas and others by even bigger margins than he did last time
[33:17.640 --> 33:20.360]  despite the massive incredible fraud.
[33:20.360 --> 33:25.000]  But as soon as those polls close, you know what happened now.
[33:25.000 --> 33:26.000]  That's anecdotal.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.880]  Then you've got Dominion and you've got the Chinese software and you've got all the corruption.
[33:29.880 --> 33:32.200]  That's strong.
[33:32.200 --> 33:35.920]  But then you've got all the eyewitnesses in the thousands of affidavits seeing the same
[33:35.920 --> 33:37.800]  scams in all these states.
[33:37.800 --> 33:39.800]  That is powerful.
[33:39.800 --> 33:42.200]  That stuff that's admissible in court.
[33:42.200 --> 33:47.760]  Then you get what you got in Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania and now Nevada and Arizona.
[33:47.760 --> 33:50.080]  I'm getting chills again.
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.280]  And I mean, it's we're closing the water main break at 1am.
[33:54.280 --> 33:55.280]  Everybody out.
[33:55.280 --> 33:58.720]  They pull the suitcases out, look around, start cramming them as fat, working three times
[33:58.720 --> 34:02.760]  faster for hours, and all of a sudden there's a giant spike and Biden wins.
[34:02.760 --> 34:05.240]  It happened in a bunch of counties.
[34:05.240 --> 34:09.240]  And now we're getting footage of multiple counties, not just Atlanta.
[34:09.240 --> 34:12.800]  And then the guy running, it's the one that said the water main broke and it turns out
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.080]  he's a top Democrat operative.
[34:16.080 --> 34:17.560]  It's the same spike.
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.560]  It's the same thing in every one of the states.
[34:20.560 --> 34:24.000]  My God, they almost did it at the same time.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.280]  But when they weren't able to get it stuff that night, they kept the polls open.
[34:28.280 --> 34:32.240]  They kept the counting going for another four or five days, so they declared him the winner
[34:32.240 --> 34:33.240]  on Saturday.
[34:33.240 --> 34:36.440]  Who declared him the winner?
[34:36.440 --> 34:43.520]  Not the Congress, not the electors, not the states, not the voters, but the MSM.
[34:43.520 --> 34:51.400]  And remember Chris Matthews, Chris Wallace, excuse me, and another show on Fox, the first
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.400]  debate with Trump and Biden.
[34:53.400 --> 34:59.600]  He was like, will you agree, Mr. President, to not declare yourself the victor until the
[34:59.600 --> 35:06.920]  Electoral College has voted and you are the President-elect?
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.640]  And he said, well, no, I won't do that.
[35:08.640 --> 35:10.360]  They say they're going to contest it no matter what.
[35:10.360 --> 35:11.920]  I see fraud, I'm going to talk about it.
[35:11.920 --> 35:14.080]  And Joe Biden goes, I will.
[35:14.080 --> 35:17.920]  I won't say it until the Electoral College on January 6th.
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.880]  I mean, we got the damn tape and he did a bunch of interviews saying, I think that's
[35:22.880 --> 35:23.880]  outrageous.
[35:23.880 --> 35:26.960]  I'll wait till it's certified by the Electoral College.
[35:26.960 --> 35:33.160]  Now they hope you just forget all that and go, he is the President-elect and then Chris
[35:33.160 --> 35:38.360]  Wallace has Trump administration officials on his Sunday show with no viewers on Fox
[35:38.360 --> 35:39.360]  to look at them.
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.280]  I'm not going to bore you with this kind of sitting voice.
[35:41.280 --> 35:42.280]  Would you like to hear it?
[35:42.280 --> 35:43.280]  We play the clip.
[35:43.280 --> 35:45.160]  He's like, you listen here.
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.920]  He's not Vice President Biden.
[35:46.920 --> 35:47.920]  He is the President.
[35:47.920 --> 35:49.840]  Say he's the President.
[35:49.840 --> 35:51.040]  The President-elect.
[35:51.040 --> 35:53.040]  Say it.
[35:53.040 --> 35:59.480]  And the Trump Secretary, he said, we're on there like, nope, not going to do it.
[35:59.480 --> 36:00.480]  Wow.
[36:00.480 --> 36:10.960]  I mean, the level of fraud there, the level of chicanery, Mr. President, will you promise
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.520]  that you will not declare yourself the victor until the Electoral College is voted?
[36:15.520 --> 36:19.920]  No, I won't because you guys are engaged in a bunch of fraud.
[36:19.920 --> 36:25.920]  So let me get into the good news here.
[36:25.920 --> 36:29.920]  I already mentioned this, but it's big.
[36:29.920 --> 36:33.640]  And I don't think the Supreme Court would just toy with the President like this.
[36:33.640 --> 36:37.320]  No, they've got major evidence.
[36:37.320 --> 36:40.720]  And they've got all the evidence of fraud coming out and all these witnesses and the
[36:40.720 --> 36:41.720]  video of it.
[36:41.720 --> 36:45.480]  And it's not just in Georgia, but you have them kicking all the poll watchers out and
[36:45.480 --> 36:50.240]  putting up brown paper boxes so you can't look in.
[36:50.240 --> 36:56.800]  I mean, imagine if you took your kids to a daycare and they said, you can't come back
[36:56.800 --> 37:00.200]  here and look at the daycare or see what food we feed them or look what's happening.
[37:00.200 --> 37:01.960]  We're going to, in fact, don't try to look at the window.
[37:01.960 --> 37:03.520]  We're putting cardboard up.
[37:03.520 --> 37:04.520]  You'd call the police.
[37:04.520 --> 37:06.520]  You'd say something's going on in there.
[37:06.520 --> 37:07.520]  They're hiding it.
[37:07.520 --> 37:10.200]  They got brown cardboard up.
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.680]  And oh, when it's your voting, it's a good thing.
[37:15.680 --> 37:21.040]  Oh, you want to look at what we're doing in Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania?
[37:21.040 --> 37:23.040]  Oh, you can't do that.
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.240]  Oh, and they just caught them in Wisconsin illegally.
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.840]  She ordered them a few days after their Secretary of State to erase all the computers and all
[37:31.840 --> 37:36.400]  the thumb drives and all the evidence because they couldn't get rid of that evidence fast
[37:36.400 --> 37:38.320]  enough, baby.
[37:38.320 --> 37:45.040]  In all that, bare minimum, the Supreme Court could rule that this election was fraudulent
[37:45.040 --> 37:48.080]  and here's where it was all violated.
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.840]  You can't make law via agreements with Democrat Party lawyers.
[37:52.840 --> 37:53.880]  Governors can't make law.
[37:53.880 --> 37:54.880]  It's legislatures.
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.080]  And the Supreme Court can rule it unconstitutional and order a new election.
[38:00.080 --> 38:03.840]  Now, that's what the Democrats were always shooting for.
[38:03.840 --> 38:07.560]  Bare minimum, they wanted to have their inauguration, say that they didn't accept Trump.
[38:07.560 --> 38:09.480]  They said they were going to do that, remember?
[38:09.480 --> 38:13.120]  John Podesta, New York Times.
[38:13.120 --> 38:18.520]  But they stole it, declared that they'd want it in a scythe, in a confidence game.
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.120]  So what is Alan Dershowitz, say what you want about him, he's a top lawyer, smart guy.
[38:22.120 --> 38:27.760]  What is he saying about Alito and the fact that he's come in and accelerated this appeal
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.040]  so that it's within the deadlines?
[38:30.040 --> 38:36.040]  They're shepherding the appeal up to the Supreme Court because the evidence is unbelievable.
[38:36.040 --> 38:43.560]  And then they're like, you know, remember just a few weeks ago, Carlson's like, we
[38:43.560 --> 38:45.240]  need to see the evidence.
[38:45.240 --> 38:48.240]  Don't just say you have it, show it to us, Powell.
[38:48.240 --> 38:51.720]  And Powell's like, we're suing to try to get the damn hard drives, but we can look at the
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.120]  Secretary of State numbers in the States and see that 100% votes come in in the middle
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.600]  of the night when something's shut down and you can see the statistics.
[38:58.600 --> 39:01.880]  We have statisticians say that's impossible and then you have these Dominion servers
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.840]  decertified to the States, we need, and then Carlson's finally like, oh, I get it now.
[39:06.840 --> 39:12.960]  Okay, there is massive election fraud.
[39:12.960 --> 39:14.960]  So good for him.
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.120]  But that's how this is working.
[39:19.120 --> 39:26.160]  And so it's our job to not concede, and let me say this and I hope you got your ears open.
[39:26.160 --> 39:29.880]  You got to get to DC this Saturday and this Sunday, I'm going to be there.
[39:29.880 --> 39:32.080]  Big marches, big events all over.
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.000]  I'm going to be at all the big marches, all the big events.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.280]  I'll see you there.
[39:36.280 --> 39:38.840]  This is more important than what happened three weeks ago.
[39:38.840 --> 39:40.240]  You've got to have massive numbers.
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.600]  It's got to be even bigger and tell everyone you know to get there.
[39:43.600 --> 39:44.800]  Trump has not lost.
[39:44.800 --> 39:46.120]  We are turning the tide.
[39:46.120 --> 39:47.720]  This is a Psyop there running.
[39:47.720 --> 39:48.720]  This is a confidence game.
[39:48.720 --> 39:49.880]  We've got to call their bluff.
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.240]  The Emperor's new clothes, Operation Toto.
[39:53.240 --> 39:57.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.400]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[40:02.400 --> 40:03.720]  That's the state-admitted plan.
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.520]  Justin Trudeau is on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors.
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.200]  They admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[40:12.200 --> 40:16.240]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[40:16.240 --> 40:17.720]  power and total control.
[40:17.720 --> 40:20.320]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world.
[40:20.320 --> 40:21.320]  You're in the U.S.
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.040]  Thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns.
[40:24.040 --> 40:25.840]  People are finally starting to fight back.
[40:25.840 --> 40:28.040]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[40:28.040 --> 40:33.000]  We have high-quality, storeable food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.480]  containers ready to ship.
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.400]  But when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll be long lines again to get
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.240]  storeable food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.
[40:41.240 --> 40:44.480]  So get your orders in today at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.840]  You get an additional 10% off when they're ready to ship.
[40:47.840 --> 40:51.240]  The sale ends next Wednesday, or I guess that's December 2nd.
[40:51.240 --> 40:54.040]  So get your orders in now, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[40:54.040 --> 40:59.320]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.320]  There's a headline out from Zero Hedge that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[41:03.320 --> 41:09.240]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December.
[41:09.240 --> 41:12.880]  It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[41:12.880 --> 41:18.720]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[41:18.720 --> 41:19.720]  We'll see.
[41:19.720 --> 41:21.920]  That'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control.
[41:21.920 --> 41:24.120]  It's the same in every single industry.
[41:24.120 --> 41:26.560]  And the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.040]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up.
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.760]  For pennies on the dollar, that's why the great stock market crash in 29 later turned
[41:33.760 --> 41:35.760]  out was engineered by some central banks.
[41:35.760 --> 41:38.840]  This is how the global estate control.
[41:38.840 --> 41:43.960]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, its economic warfare, and
[41:43.960 --> 41:49.840]  it gives cover to the big megabanks to create thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives.
[41:49.840 --> 41:55.400]  Only the truth will set us free in FullWars.com.
[41:55.400 --> 42:02.600]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[42:02.600 --> 42:06.280]  due to a virus scare to bring in world government.
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.000]  That also came out in the North American Union documents that Judicial Watch and Lou Dobbs
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.640]  got more than 15 years ago as well.
[42:13.640 --> 42:14.640]  So we know their plan.
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.360]  And if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to cause not just a worldwide
[42:18.360 --> 42:22.800]  situation, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions have already starved
[42:22.800 --> 42:25.560]  to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[42:25.560 --> 42:29.960]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared for all over the world.
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.640]  But we have high-quality swarble food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years, and prepare
[42:34.640 --> 42:35.640]  with Alex.com.

[42:54.080 --> 42:55.080]  God bless.
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.720]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.080]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.360]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[43:17.360 --> 43:20.840]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[43:20.840 --> 43:22.920]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[43:22.920 --> 43:25.200]  I suggest band.video.
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.800]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[43:29.800 --> 43:30.800]  to stop it.
[43:30.800 --> 43:34.920]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.120]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.120]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[43:43.120 --> 43:45.840]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[43:45.840 --> 44:15.160]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[44:15.160 --> 44:42.680]  I
[44:42.680 --> 44:45.440]  talk a lot about the Stockholm syndrome.
[44:45.440 --> 44:49.520]  It's something that's always happened in humans, particularly women.
[44:49.520 --> 44:54.200]  Of course, back in the 60s, there were cases where people were kidnapped and held by their
[44:54.200 --> 44:58.560]  captors, and after being held for a few months, they would become defenders of their kidnappers,
[44:58.560 --> 45:02.120]  servants of their kidnappers, worshipers of their kidnappers.
[45:02.120 --> 45:04.080]  The Milgram experiment found the same thing.
[45:04.080 --> 45:07.480]  The Stanford Research Institute studies found the same thing.
[45:07.480 --> 45:14.160]  Where US universities were able to get over 90% of their graduate students to murder people
[45:14.160 --> 45:17.680]  if ordered to by a professor.
[45:17.680 --> 45:19.000]  That's an oversimplification.
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  It's actually worse than that.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.400]  I'm going to say that again.
[45:22.400 --> 45:29.760]  In the 60s, the psychology departments were able to get people, in one of the studies,
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.200]  they believed they were actually murdering people, and they would murder people with
[45:34.200 --> 45:38.720]  electrocution in order to do so by their supervisor.
[45:38.720 --> 45:46.120]  Now, only very immoral, sick, evil people would use psychology like this, but that's
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.320]  what they're doing with the mask.
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.820]  That's what they're doing with the lockdowns.
[45:49.820 --> 45:52.760]  That's what they're doing with all of this stuff is getting the general public that are
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.440]  followers to believe that they're saving the earth and believe that they have to do horrible
[45:57.440 --> 45:58.600]  things to do it.
[45:58.600 --> 46:04.120]  They are whipping up the mob, the crowd, which is extremely dangerous and will behave like
[46:04.120 --> 46:14.640]  psychotic piranhas if whipped into a malice type force.
[46:14.640 --> 46:21.440]  So what the 1960s psychology got wrong about the human capacity for evil, look at Antifa
[46:21.440 --> 46:27.720]  beating men, women and children, attacking old ladies, firebombing people, and then going,
[46:27.720 --> 46:34.800]  you're Nazis, when they work for a famous Nazi collaborator, and they don't care about
[46:34.800 --> 46:39.520]  Apple with slave camps in China, they don't care about real atrocity, they are just low
[46:39.520 --> 46:45.560]  level evil followers who want power, and they've been told by the establishment, you can do
[46:45.560 --> 46:46.560]  it now.
[46:46.560 --> 46:54.520]  This is all a revolution of evil against good people, because we've taken so much of it,
[46:54.520 --> 46:55.520]  it's going to the next level.
[46:55.520 --> 46:59.560]  What I'm going to do is, I'm a little behind, I'll get into the huge COVID news, the forced
[46:59.560 --> 47:04.440]  sterilization news, the incredible confirmations, this could not be more bombshell, more earth
[47:04.440 --> 47:06.960]  shattering, more dangerous.
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.440]  And that's why they thought they'd have everybody off the air by the time they rolled this out.
[47:11.440 --> 47:15.280]  Why they thought they'd have their AI sensor systems to control everything.
[47:15.280 --> 47:21.880]  And I actually, two plus years ago, predicted COVID, and I actually laid out the full 11
[47:21.880 --> 47:29.160]  minute video, see what Alex Jones predicted COVID-19 in 2018.
[47:29.160 --> 47:32.720]  I'm paraphrasing the headline, we can probably pull it up.
[47:32.720 --> 47:41.320]  I lay out the full video on June 17th, 2018, how they were putting in censorship kill switches
[47:41.320 --> 47:49.240]  that would take over news feeds if you questioned during the outbreak of disease X, how that
[47:49.240 --> 47:51.840]  would be used to bring in world government censorship.
[47:51.840 --> 47:59.320]  How did I call it exactly as it happened?
[47:59.320 --> 48:06.240]  Because I was reading disease X drill, I was reading lockstep, I was reading the British
[48:06.240 --> 48:12.640]  Ministry of Report 2007, I was reading the UN's admissions, I'm reading them on air,
[48:12.640 --> 48:15.480]  I'm showing them to you.
[48:15.480 --> 48:21.480]  See, that's the thing, you tune in here, you're not getting some dude's opinion that he regurgitates
[48:21.480 --> 48:22.960]  from somebody else's opinion.
[48:22.960 --> 48:27.440]  This is original research.
[48:27.440 --> 48:30.040]  No one does this stuff except the enemy.
[48:30.040 --> 48:34.200]  And they call you done animals and say, Jones, they'll never listen to you, they're animals.
[48:34.200 --> 48:36.480]  I don't think you're animals.
[48:36.480 --> 48:45.200]  But regardless, I metaphysically have a responsibility to warn you and your family, because it gets
[48:45.200 --> 48:46.840]  really bad.
[48:46.840 --> 48:49.960]  They're not just going to kill and sterilize the Africans, which is bad enough and I'm
[48:49.960 --> 48:51.680]  against that.
[48:51.680 --> 48:57.600]  They have a plan for a fully post-human world and they've now publicly unveiled that, no,
[48:57.600 --> 48:58.840]  we're getting rid of everybody.
[48:58.840 --> 49:05.600]  First, it was 50%, 80%, 95%, I showed you all those quotes last week where you can find
[49:05.600 --> 49:06.600]  them.
[49:06.600 --> 49:09.400]  Prince Philip wrote books about it, Ted Turner wrote books about it, Prince Charles wrote
[49:09.400 --> 49:10.400]  books about it.
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.640]  They're all saying this is the great reset to teach you to not have children.
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.640]  They're ultra rich people that think they own the earth that are coming to kill you.
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.240]  Do you understand that?
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.400]  And their response is, see, Jones, they don't even care.
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.440]  Actually, there's a famous saying, no one knows who first said it and I'll butcher it,
[49:32.440 --> 49:42.000]  but if their propaganda and their takeover was working, they wouldn't need to be pressing
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.600]  so hard to shut us up and I just butchered it, but if their plan was working, they wouldn't
[49:47.600 --> 49:50.400]  need all the propaganda and censorship.
[49:50.400 --> 49:51.400]  It's not working.
[49:51.400 --> 49:52.560]  It's not going to work.
[49:52.560 --> 49:53.560]  It's failed.
[49:53.560 --> 49:54.560]  It's going to fail.
[49:54.560 --> 50:03.760]  John on Patmos told us that 2,000 years ago.
[50:03.760 --> 50:09.920]  Now the bar owner on Staten Island who got arrested for saying they shouldn't be locked
[50:09.920 --> 50:13.640]  down, he got set up like they set up the Proud Boys this weekend.
[50:13.640 --> 50:19.680]  They have major inside baseball, horrible story, and it's a microcosm of what's coming.
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.680]  They had a group of thugs waiting for him, vigilantes, that attacked him and when he
[50:24.680 --> 50:30.280]  defended himself, the evil police, special political unit were waiting and arrested
[50:30.280 --> 50:37.320]  him and now they're trying to set him up like the Proud Boys to put him in prison.
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.360]  So he's unable to come on, but his buddy is and another business owner who owns the local
[50:41.360 --> 50:44.400]  jiu-jitsu club where they both train.
[50:44.400 --> 50:56.360]  So that's coming up, Joseph Kudenz is going to be coming on the transmission with us.
[50:56.360 --> 50:59.800]  So this is a big deal.
[50:59.800 --> 51:02.440]  All the big mega stores can be open.
[51:02.440 --> 51:04.920]  Your little store can't and you're like, that doesn't make sense.
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.760]  That's pure authoritarianism.
[51:06.760 --> 51:10.600]  That's pure censorship.
[51:10.600 --> 51:11.920]  That's pure discrimination.
[51:11.920 --> 51:13.240]  Of course it is.
[51:13.240 --> 51:19.320]  You're like, well, that's oxymoronic, but see, Toto has to call the fraud and pull back
[51:19.320 --> 51:22.840]  the curtain and show the scam.
[51:22.840 --> 51:26.640]  That's why I call this Operation Toto.
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.600]  That's why going to DC and calling their bluff and having two, three million people there,
[51:30.600 --> 51:35.840]  not just 800,000.
[51:35.840 --> 51:42.080]  The emperors knew clothes again, these weavers came into town who were the best, it was an
[51:42.080 --> 51:43.560]  allegory for the fashion industry.
[51:43.560 --> 51:46.880]  They even had thousands of years ago.
[51:46.880 --> 51:54.640]  They said only royalty can see this gold thread that we have.
[51:54.640 --> 51:58.200]  And when the emperor couldn't see it and when his aides couldn't see it, they thought, well,
[51:58.200 --> 51:59.480]  maybe we're not royal.
[51:59.480 --> 52:02.200]  We better say that we do see it.
[52:02.200 --> 52:09.560]  And so they spin the king, this robe, he gives them all the jewels and diamonds and gold.
[52:09.560 --> 52:13.760]  And then finally he's in a parade in his underwear.
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.920]  And the ministers now are naked too, because they've all are wearing the royal garb and
[52:18.920 --> 52:25.400]  a three year old walks out and says, look, the emperor is naked.
[52:25.400 --> 52:29.640]  The emperors new clothes, he's not wearing any.
[52:29.640 --> 52:34.760]  And that's how you counter these frauds of Trump's a Russian agent, Alex Jones is a
[52:34.760 --> 52:36.440]  Russian agent.
[52:36.440 --> 52:37.440]  Trump didn't really get elected.
[52:37.440 --> 52:38.440]  He's a fraud.
[52:38.440 --> 52:39.440]  Oh, Ukraine.
[52:39.440 --> 52:40.440]  Oh, he's this.
[52:40.440 --> 52:41.440]  Oh, he's that.
[52:41.440 --> 52:43.840]  Oh, Biden is the president-elect.
[52:43.840 --> 52:50.680]  They're all just thinking you're stupid announcing this.
[52:50.680 --> 52:55.640]  And the Supreme Court is teeing it up now, but they're politically watching and they see
[52:55.640 --> 52:59.120]  the evidence of fraud coming out and they're watching how angry you are.
[52:59.120 --> 53:04.080]  And they're thinking, can we give this to Trump when he clearly won and have the political
[53:04.080 --> 53:06.400]  rightness in it to be the right thing?
[53:06.400 --> 53:11.880]  So they just see the evidence of fraud, which they're seeing they just see you by the millions
[53:11.880 --> 53:12.880]  in the streets.
[53:12.880 --> 53:17.040]  And if you can't be in DC, then at your capital, even if it's one that they quote didn't steal,
[53:17.040 --> 53:18.640]  if it's a blue state, they stole it.
[53:18.640 --> 53:20.040]  No one likes the Democrats.
[53:20.040 --> 53:21.040]  No one.
[53:21.040 --> 53:24.240]  Biden can't get, he got a thousand people Saturday on his stream.
[53:24.240 --> 53:25.240]  He did it in an event.
[53:25.240 --> 53:26.800]  They have like 10 people there.
[53:26.800 --> 53:30.320]  Trump on one stream had a quarter million, a half million on another stream.
[53:30.320 --> 53:33.880]  I mean, it's a joke, folks.
[53:33.880 --> 53:35.560]  No one is coming out for them.
[53:35.560 --> 53:39.360]  I'm going to break a lot more election fraud news coming up.
[53:39.360 --> 53:41.800]  At first, I'm going to hit the really big news.
[53:41.800 --> 53:45.920]  And that is a sterile into the vaccines, all the documents, all the proof is absolutely
[53:45.920 --> 53:46.920]  insane.
[53:46.920 --> 53:47.920]  Everyone's got to be tuned into this.
[53:47.920 --> 53:53.120]  This is the most important next hour of radio ever yet because it's all coming to a head.
[53:53.120 --> 53:54.600]  We're inside the new order now.

[55:45.120 --> 55:49.280]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes, then
[55:49.280 --> 55:54.080]  picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s,
[55:54.080 --> 55:56.720]  is all about corporate global governance.
[55:56.720 --> 55:57.720]  And now you're seeing it.
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.720]  It's not just the blue states, the blue cities, the communist and socialist nations all working
[56:01.720 --> 56:06.680]  in unison under UN control, establishing medical planetary dictatorship.
[56:06.680 --> 56:12.640]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations, themselves funded by a handful of private
[56:12.640 --> 56:17.080]  central banking families, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty,
[56:17.080 --> 56:19.000]  being at the very heart of that.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.040]  Only you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time,
[56:23.040 --> 56:30.640]  but they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[56:30.640 --> 56:34.160]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.920]  They're involved in poting the world economy, that's what the social distancing, the mask
[56:37.920 --> 56:38.920]  are all about.
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.760]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your
[56:42.760 --> 56:43.760]  own destruction.
[56:43.760 --> 56:44.760]  Wake up.
[56:44.760 --> 56:51.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:51.760 --> 57:08.360]  You know, you cut the tension with the knives.
[57:08.360 --> 57:15.560]  I went in to see my dentist about getting this crown redone and he said, he said, Alex,
[57:15.560 --> 57:16.560]  it's crazy.
[57:16.560 --> 57:19.720]  You know, people are really waking up and he said, but we're having like triple the
[57:19.720 --> 57:22.440]  numbers of people breaking their crowns and breaking their teeth because of the stress
[57:22.440 --> 57:23.440]  of COVID.
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.360]  I was like, yeah, people know they're being robbed.
[57:26.360 --> 57:28.360]  They know they're being enslaved.
[57:28.360 --> 57:30.360]  They know they're being taken over.
[57:30.360 --> 57:31.880]  And so I don't want to bring you all this negative news.
[57:31.880 --> 57:32.880]  It's scary.
[57:32.880 --> 57:33.880]  I want to bring this negative news.
[57:33.880 --> 57:34.880]  We can do something about it.
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.440]  Nothing against Joel Oldstein, man, but my God, the, the planet could be under nuclear
[57:38.440 --> 57:39.440]  war.
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.360]  He'd tell you everything was fine.
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.680]  It's okay to be positive sometimes, but you need to be honest about things.
[57:44.680 --> 57:47.320]  You can do something about it.
[57:47.320 --> 57:48.800]  God helps those that helps themselves.
[57:48.800 --> 57:49.800]  Here's a special report.
[57:49.800 --> 57:53.040]  We'll come back with a big news.
[57:53.040 --> 57:56.920]  The Biden cabinet continues to grow like a cancer.
[57:56.920 --> 58:02.200]  After announcing globalists and Obama zealots, the Biden administration is now lifting the
[58:02.200 --> 58:08.440]  veil on new members responsible for terrorizing the United States with Marxist overtones
[58:08.440 --> 58:10.840]  over the ominous year of 2020.
[58:10.840 --> 58:17.640]  The leaders of public policy and advocacy organization recently Biden named near a Tandon
[58:17.640 --> 58:23.240]  head of the Soros funded center for American progress as his nominee to lead the White
[58:23.240 --> 58:25.560]  House office of management and budget.
[58:25.560 --> 58:30.800]  The key thing to know about near a Tandon is that she is ultimately a handmaiden to
[58:30.800 --> 58:32.520]  the billionaires who pay her salary.
[58:32.520 --> 58:35.640]  Tandon runs a think tank called the center for American progress.
[58:35.640 --> 58:39.520]  Center for American progress has taken millions of dollars from Wall Street financiers, Silicon
[58:39.520 --> 58:44.680]  Valley executives like Mark Zuckerberg, lobbyists, banks and defense contractors.
[58:44.680 --> 58:48.640]  She's censored her own researchers criticism of Mike Bloomberg while going on television
[58:48.640 --> 58:51.680]  to hyperventilate about Russia collusion that never existed.
[58:51.680 --> 58:56.520]  You see it in detail that Russia interfered with this election to help elect Donald Trump
[58:56.520 --> 59:00.120]  and you see it in detail after detail.
[59:00.120 --> 59:06.440]  This sets the predicate there was criminality behind what Russia was doing and the next
[59:06.440 --> 59:11.800]  set of questions that Bannon and other people including Donald Trump can answer is what
[59:11.800 --> 59:15.120]  kind of collusion the Trump campaign was part of.
[59:15.120 --> 59:18.560]  She's totally unqualified for this position like she's not an economist.
[59:18.560 --> 59:22.400]  She went to law school, she worked for Hillary Clinton and then all she's done at this think
[59:22.400 --> 59:27.000]  tank for the last 10 years is raise millions of dollars from Silicon Valley, Wall Street,
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.440]  Desperate and in the Gulf States, which is the real base of the Democratic Party.
[59:31.440 --> 59:35.720]  So they want her to oversee the regulatory and budgetary and economic policy of the administration
[59:35.720 --> 59:40.680]  on behalf of their real constituencies, which is all those people from whom she's been raising
[59:40.680 --> 59:41.680]  millions of dollars.
[59:41.680 --> 59:45.200]  But the thing is Tucker, that just makes her an ordinary Democrat.
[59:45.200 --> 59:48.040]  She's just a swamp creature in that regard.
[59:48.040 --> 59:50.400]  She's a deranged and dangerous person.
[59:50.400 --> 59:55.800]  I don't mean just politically, I mean like behaviorally when she was working with Hillary
[59:55.800 --> 59:59.680]  Clinton to get Hillary Clinton elected, one of her own reporters at this think tank was
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:03.080]  arranged to have an interview with Hillary and asked Hillary about the Iraq war and
[1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:07.920]  your attendant was so angry, she punched him and then later she claims she merely pushed
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:08.920]  him.
[1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:13.560]  And now the prospect of George Soros installing himself in the Harris Biden administration
[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:20.520]  lurks in the shadows as open society foundation president Patrick Gasper steps down, opening
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.720]  up the possibility of becoming Biden's labor secretary.
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:31.560]  In a statement, Gasper said, after four profound years of service to this extraordinary institution
[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:36.720]  and at a critical juncture for the democracy that is my home, I am compelled to charge
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:40.400]  once more unto the breach in a new political moment.
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:45.640]  In a New York Times article celebrating the millions dumped into a clout and piven style
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:51.160]  movement to once and for all destroy the United States, Patrick Gasper, the president of the
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:55.800]  open society foundation at the time said that the group believed the investment was about
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:01:01.520]  harnessing the momentum toward racial justice, but also giving organizations room to think
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:02.640]  long term.
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:07.560]  Now he said is the moment we've been investing in for the last 25 years.
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.120]  He added, the demands being made now will not be met overnight and we know the gaze
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:17.120]  of media and elected officials will turn in other directions, but we need these moments
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:23.440]  to be sustained if we're going to say black lives matter, we need to say black organizations
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:25.320]  and structures matter.
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:31.120]  By the time Biden's anti-American cabinet has finished its roll call, every conceivable
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:36.720]  foreign terror and domestic terror organization could quite possibly be represented.
[1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:53.200]  John Bowne reported.
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:00.200]  Chinese and the United Nations.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:05.960]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.040]  of complete lockdowns so you can't even leave your house for months and months are being
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:15.480]  announced and in Germany the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:19.960]  blast men, women and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:20.960]  them under her control.
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:25.640]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years and the same thing is
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  coming here to the United States.
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.120]  This is world government.
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:33.840]  In Philadelphia they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:35.960]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:40.320]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like, to bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:45.920]  process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:47.920]  How long have we warned you about this?
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:51.320]  But you can fight back, America is the last bastion.
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:03:07.120]  Stop submitting.
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:17.480]  All right, I'm about to hit extremely important information on the COVID front.
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:23.840]  I'm going to give you a wide spectrum analysis and then I'm going to drill into why they
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:29.760]  want this particular mRNA vaccine delivered to you and what it does to women.
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:31.040]  This is unbelievable information.
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:33.120]  We're about to cover it here in a moment.
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:37.960]  But first let's look at the psychology on the ground.
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:42.880]  The media and Facebook promote this video so it gets millions of views.
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:48.600]  They just say, oh, a concerned citizen was out at the Trump rally in Georgia begging
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:51.800]  people Saturday to wear a mask and be a hero.
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:56.400]  It's a good virtue signal thing you can do while people get bacterial pneumonia and people
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:57.400]  commit suicide.
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:04.840]  The whole culture collapses and 20 times the people die from starvation, the die of COVID.
[1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:09.280]  But notice this group, the Good Liars, is funded by the Democrats and Soros Connective
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.280]  Groups.
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:16.560]  What a proper name for them, the Good Liars, so this is the type of propaganda they subject
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:17.560]  people to.
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:18.560]  You guys got masks?
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:19.560]  No?
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:20.560]  Why not?
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:21.560]  Because I don't need it.
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:22.560]  Why do you need it?
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:23.560]  Yeah, you should wear one because there's a global pandemic going on.
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:24.560]  Well, you got yours.
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:25.560]  I got mine on.
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:26.560]  Yeah, I'm trying to be safe.
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:27.560]  Okay.
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.560]  But you could infect somebody else and they could get sick.
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:30.560]  Why don't you leave them alone?
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:41.560]  Will you please wear a mask?
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:42.560]  No.
[1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:43.560]  Please?
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:44.560]  No.
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:49.560]  For the sake of other people, please wear one.
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:50.560]  Please.
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:51.560]  I'm begging you.
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:52.560]  Please.
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:05:00.360]  He's begging you to buy into the social distancing, particularly where all over the U.S., small
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:08.400]  mom and pop businesses are still at 25% capacity, meaning they're going bankrupted, and upwards
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:12.160]  of 45% have closed and will never reopen.
[1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.120]  And now the U.N. says, oh, this is going to go on forever.
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:15.640]  So there's the psychology.
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:16.640]  They're a hero.
[1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:17.640]  You're not.
[1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:22.400]  And if you say something to a mask, because the new symbol of America and the new symbol
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:30.120]  of the white flag is the mask, it's the ostrich head in the ground.
[1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:33.440]  It's the symbol of your subservience.
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:37.240]  It's the symbol that you buy into everything and you're going to comply with everything
[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:38.740]  else that comes with it.
[1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:42.560]  And I'll show you the evidence of that in a moment.
[1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:48.120]  But here is a Oregon teacher has complete meltdown at anti-lockdown protesters.
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:49.720]  Tell them to kill yourself.
[1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:55.520]  Look, but she pulls down her mask, though, to yell and spit at you because you're going
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:05:57.520]  to kill people, but she's a hero.
[1:05:57.520 --> 1:05:58.520]  What are you doing?
[1:05:58.520 --> 1:05:59.520]  You're killing.
[1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:04.200]  Meanwhile, we'd point out that 1.2 million people die a year on average of TV, but the
[1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:07.840]  kids coming across the border, unaccompanied, aren't even getting a TV test.
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:10.760]  They're putting public schools and give your kids it.
[1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:16.080]  The left's like, oh, that's xenophobic when you talk about immigrants having diseases.
[1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:23.240]  But when it's they're made up, exaggerated COVID-19, and they're caught in the PCR test,
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:28.240]  jacking them up 45 times the normal level to have 96% false positives, oh, that's all
[1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:29.240]  okay.
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:37.080]  That's right, CDC issues, new guidance for universal mask wearing and all activity outside
[1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:43.200]  of home, all activity, the CDC and where they get the orders, the UN, because they think
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:44.200]  Trump's gone.
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:46.720]  So Fauci is like back in charge.
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:48.520]  Everybody else is resigning atlas.
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:53.280]  Everybody else is leaving as if Trump isn't going to be there.
[1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:55.920]  Talk about mind control.
[1:06:55.920 --> 1:07:00.200]  Talk about brainwashing, so it's a foregone conclusion that if Trump challenges it and
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:04.280]  has all the evidence, he's the bad guy, despite the fact they're the ones stealing it in front
[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.320]  of God and the rest of the world.
[1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:10.880]  So if you're ready, listen, you're lucky and look at the hate in this woman's eyes.
[1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:13.120]  But you want to see Stockholm syndrome.
[1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.720]  You want to see somebody loving her new world order pimp.
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:16.720]  Here it is.
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:26.720]  It's just a joke.
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:37.720]  Why are you f***ing kidding me?
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:38.720]  I want it.
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:39.720]  I am a teacher.
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:40.720]  I change the students.
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:41.720]  I'm a teacher.
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:46.720]  I'm a teacher.
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:51.160]  Are you f*** morons, you morons?
[1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:52.640]  She's like, you are not essential, going to your health.
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:53.640]  I said die.
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:54.960]  Man, she's saying, I hope you die.
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:55.960]  Die.
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:56.960]  Die.
[1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:57.960]  Die.
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:07:58.960]  She's the spirit of Clauss Schw Crewe.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:07.480]  Who wants us to die?
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:09.480]  Jesus, she's in charge.
[1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:15.680]  So, they're out there protesting, being non-essential, their business is being shut, and they're
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:17.840]  going bankrupt, and she is pissed.
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:20.160]  She's like, I've been charged.
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:27.760]  Now, let's show her, and let's show the good liars, the soy boys that goes and, you know,
[1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:32.600]  begs everybody to wear the mask, be in the cult, don't show people on national TV that
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:35.280]  you're all in there together, not wearing your mask.
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:38.840]  By the way, Rudolph Giuliani's been working his ass off 20 hours a day.
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:44.360]  He's 70 plus, almost 80 years old, and they said, oh, it's a precaution put him in the
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:45.360]  hospital.
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:55.040]  I hope they don't intubate him and kill him by, kill him by asphyxiation as they've been
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:08:58.600]  doing most of the people with the ventilators.
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:01.400]  Okay, so let me just show you these headlines.
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:03.000]  We're going to come back and drill into these.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:09.360]  Think of this big giant stack of the most critical information ever.
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:13.840]  COVID pandemic measures could push over a billion people worldwide into extreme poverty,
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.360]  UN admits, they go on in a big report, carried by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal,
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:22.720]  and Full Wars has the report linked to it right there, that 200 million are set to starve
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:27.200]  to death in the next nine years, an extra 15 million this year, 3 million is the new
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.480]  number that we're already starved to death.
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:31.480]  That's okay.
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:32.480]  It's to stop the spread.
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:36.560]  It's a very virtuous people to wear your mask, stay six feet apart so your business can't
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:41.960]  reopen, all be neurotic and scared, so that we all go bankrupt and the big banks who are
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:45.600]  basically tax exempt, they can consolidate the whole economy, which big tech and the
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:46.600]  big banks are doing.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.480]  I mean, this is a fact.
[1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:52.960]  They came up with this to lock down society because they know you'll follow orders and
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:56.440]  you don't have a guardian class of warriors to protect the sheep anymore.
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:09:57.440]  And here's what's scary.
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:02.440]  They're organizing the sheep into a stampede to willfully destroy themselves and us with
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:03.440]  them.
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:09.680]  Here it is, Newsmax, UN warrants 2021 shaping up to be humanitarian catastrophe with a billion
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:16.000]  extra in poverty, collapse of the world system, but don't worry, they've got a UN plan to
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.160]  fix it.
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:23.280]  Scientists have discovered a way to store a patient's vaccination history under the skin
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:28.160]  at the same time as they vaccine, oh, and they're pushing it, oh, but it was a conspiracy
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:31.400]  theory when we told you in March.
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:37.520]  Here it is from MIT, World Health Organization, Envoy that runs the global cover response.
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:39.280]  He goes and tells the companies what to do.
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:43.160]  Life won't return to normal for at least two years, and then after that, it never will.
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:44.160]  See?
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:46.680]  They're all on private jets and exempt.
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:48.760]  Merkel pushes national lockdown for Germany.
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:50.880]  UK starts emergency COVID vaccinations.
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:58.080]  Oh, yes, Merkel wasn't popular, either was Le Cron, so now what's going to happen?
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.280]  Well, you see what's happening.
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:06.440]  When everyone gets into their dirty, their bad, your toxic, you need to be disappeared,
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:11.160]  wear a mask over your head, wear a burqa, and even men now don't want to have their burqas
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:12.160]  touched.
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:14.280]  You know, the average woman in Islam loves the burqa.
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:15.960]  She loves being covered.
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:18.200]  She's ashamed of herself.
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:24.640]  All psychology departments of the globalist wrecking us with the Stanford and Milgram
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:25.640]  experiments.
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:26.640]  Look into them.
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:33.920]  But here's some good news, Florida requiring labs to report critical cycle thresholds for
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:35.240]  COVID-19 tests.
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:36.240]  Why is that so huge?
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:40.560]  Because on average, they're turning them up 25 percent in areas like New York other places
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:41.560]  when they want to show higher numbers.
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:47.320]  They turn them up 45 percent, same thing in the UK, show that a tabletop is positive.
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:48.320]  The air is positive.
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:49.320]  A tomato is positive.
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:55.080]  A papaya, a goat, a horse, a man, a woman, a child, it's all fraud.
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:56.080]  They admit it.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.480]  They turn up PCR tests said, you turn it up 10 times, everything's false positive.
[1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:04.800]  They turn it up 45 times, baby.
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:08.120]  And now when you don't pass the test, you can't travel.
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:11.280]  It's all computerized, so liberal, so loving.
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.320]  And if you'll just wear the mask and be a hero, it'll be over soon.
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:19.600]  And that's going to be the argument, oh, we wanted to end it in 2021, but there were
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:22.960]  people that didn't wear their mask and didn't stay in their houses, so none of you could
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:23.960]  come out.
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:25.440]  They caused the global depression.
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:26.440]  They caused the collapse.
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:27.440]  No.
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:31.480]  The globalists did with their plan, with their lockdown, you have to reject it all, say no
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:33.640]  to it all now, or we don't have a hope.
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:38.520]  This is a psychological warfare operation, a PSYOP, you have to reject it all or they
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:39.520]  take over.
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:45.320]  Now, the advisory board of the European Union has come out and said it's a sterilant in
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:46.320]  the vaccines.
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.620]  We'll tell you about that on the other side of Mt.
[1:12:48.620 --> 1:13:17.600]  This is the InfoWare.
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:18.600]  This is economic domination.
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:19.600]  This is economic war.
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  We are being consolidated.
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:21.600]  We are being taken over.
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:26.100]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:30.980]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely
[1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:35.540]  to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[1:13:35.540 --> 1:13:37.340]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[1:13:37.340 --> 1:13:38.980]  That's what the great reset is.
[1:13:38.980 --> 1:13:41.580]  Clow Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[1:13:41.580 --> 1:13:45.660]  That's what social distancing is, so your business is only at 25 percent for several
[1:13:45.660 --> 1:13:48.860]  more years, no small businesses will be there.
[1:13:48.860 --> 1:13:50.940]  This is a master plan, say no.
[1:13:50.940 --> 1:13:54.740]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:13:54.740 --> 1:13:59.060]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:13:59.060 --> 1:14:03.780]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:07.940]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:14:07.940 --> 1:14:13.060]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:14:13.060 --> 1:14:18.820]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[1:14:18.820 --> 1:14:24.820]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:14:24.820 --> 1:14:31.460]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:14:31.460 --> 1:14:36.060]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:14:36.060 --> 1:14:41.820]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:14:41.820 --> 1:14:44.660]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:53.540]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:14:53.540 --> 1:15:06.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:12.060]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, again, thank you for joining us on this December
[1:15:12.060 --> 1:15:14.620]  7th, 2020 Monday Transmission.
[1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:22.380]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones, live from
[1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:29.100]  Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:34.940]  All right, let's get right into the meat potatoes right now.
[1:15:34.940 --> 1:15:40.020]  You have robber baron eugenicist and since the time of the ancient Greeks, they believe
[1:15:40.020 --> 1:15:45.020]  there were too many people, replay those republics, that got picked up right out of the future.
[1:15:45.020 --> 1:15:48.540]  And you can argue some Caribbean islands are overpopulated.
[1:15:48.540 --> 1:15:53.300]  You can go to areas of Africa, areas of Asia, go to areas of India, it's nightmarish and
[1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:58.060]  starving kids everywhere and you see that suffering and you say, hey, let's just kill
[1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:02.580]  most of these people and then it's like killing feral cats, they won't continue to produce
[1:16:02.580 --> 1:16:06.100]  more kittens.
[1:16:06.100 --> 1:16:11.340]  But then you study the globalist, they're trying to dumb everybody down and poison everyone
[1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:16.700]  and trying to sexualize children and her Satanist.
[1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.780]  So they have these excuses for the medical system of why they're doing all this, but
[1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:23.300]  that's not really why they're doing.
[1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:29.540]  Meanwhile, you can't even get the general public to admit this is going on because they
[1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:32.900]  hear there's some big, powerful thing over them.
[1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:35.860]  That's why people are rebellicants, God, because they don't want God up there.
[1:16:35.860 --> 1:16:39.540]  They sure as hell don't want to hear that there's a big secret of evil system because
[1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:41.020]  that doesn't make them feel good.
[1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:47.980]  They just go, oh, I choose not to believe that.
[1:16:47.980 --> 1:16:52.420]  And then it becomes very, very political.
[1:16:52.420 --> 1:16:57.140]  I remember being on air 15 years ago when Gardasil couldn't get approved because it was
[1:16:57.140 --> 1:17:05.660]  creating autoimmune responses to normal proteins in the body that were in the uterus and in
[1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:09.700]  the cervix and in the ovaries.
[1:17:09.700 --> 1:17:10.700]  It's very simple.
[1:17:10.700 --> 1:17:17.500]  You just say it's for a virus, but viruses have a lot of the same proteins as body parts.
[1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:21.220]  And then you just create an autoimmune response in those body parts.
[1:17:21.220 --> 1:17:25.380]  And so many women have called me, so many letters, so many women.
[1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:33.340]  I mean, I was in a store about three months ago, and this woman looked like she was 30.
[1:17:33.340 --> 1:17:35.540]  I guess when you get old, it's weird.
[1:17:35.540 --> 1:17:39.460]  She's like, I was like 15 years old when you were warning everybody, and my mom got me
[1:17:39.460 --> 1:17:42.900]  the shot, and now I'm sterile, now that all sorts of problems, and she was a beautiful
[1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:43.900]  woman.
[1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:44.900]  And I was like, man, I'm getting old.
[1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:45.900]  This is like a 30-year-old woman.
[1:17:45.900 --> 1:17:49.820]  This is a full-grown woman here, and she's talking about, listen to me, years after when
[1:17:49.820 --> 1:17:54.740]  she got sterilized with a Gardasil shot, and that's in the literature, too.
[1:17:54.740 --> 1:18:02.780]  But I mean, there are two people that work in this office whose children died from vaccines,
[1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:06.060]  and they told them the vaccine killed.
[1:18:06.060 --> 1:18:13.660]  So all I'm saying is, this is very serious business, and now they're moving with a very,
[1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:17.500]  very aggressive system against you and your family.
[1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:20.900]  And I studied just one of the vaccines this weekend.
[1:18:20.900 --> 1:18:22.300]  I was given this information on Friday.
[1:18:22.300 --> 1:18:26.180]  I covered it, and then as soon as everybody went to bed on Friday night, I got it out,
[1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:27.180]  read it.
[1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:28.180]  I came back Saturday.
[1:18:28.180 --> 1:18:33.180]  I came back Sunday, and I was telling you, I spent at least 10 hours reading the literature.
[1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:38.060]  That means in the white paper put out by medical doctor, and this major EU advisory board,
[1:18:38.060 --> 1:18:46.020]  Wolfgang Wudard, and everything he said is true, except he would couch it very where
[1:18:46.020 --> 1:18:48.420]  he would say, it appears this is going on.
[1:18:48.420 --> 1:18:55.500]  You go actually read the finding, it's crystal clear, absolutely crystal clear what's going
[1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:56.500]  on.
[1:18:56.500 --> 1:19:00.620]  The article to see the full video, top EU scientist warrants COVID-19 vaccine link to
[1:19:00.620 --> 1:19:05.580]  sterilization of women, they have a link to the paper, and my hour long emergency report
[1:19:05.580 --> 1:19:09.740]  that Gregory said a great job putting together on Saturday night.
[1:19:09.740 --> 1:19:13.260]  We worked all day on that.
[1:19:13.260 --> 1:19:15.060]  And this, it's not about the credit.
[1:19:15.060 --> 1:19:20.340]  I'm saying, we're not playing games here.
[1:19:20.340 --> 1:19:25.540]  They know you're only spending a few seconds looking at things, oh, oh, Snoop says that
[1:19:25.540 --> 1:19:28.740]  Soros isn't involved with Smartmatic.
[1:19:28.740 --> 1:19:32.020]  He appoints the head of Smartmatic to run his global foundation, and the former head
[1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:38.060]  of it's going to run the White House under Biden, basically owns the damn thing.
[1:19:38.060 --> 1:19:41.500]  And that's in all the SEC filings, the same thing with Dominion, but it doesn't matter,
[1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:45.020]  it's go, oh, Snoop, so it's not true, oh, oh, there's claims.
[1:19:45.020 --> 1:19:48.300]  That this causes sterilants.
[1:19:48.300 --> 1:19:53.380]  But the official write up on the mRNA vaccine says that's not its main goal.
[1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:56.260]  They don't even study that.
[1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:04.140]  But medical doctors can go look at the United Nations reports going back to 1990, 91, 92,
[1:20:04.140 --> 1:20:09.540]  93, there was a big push at the UN to fund over 100 pharmaceutical companies to find
[1:20:09.540 --> 1:20:14.980]  a ethical, in their words, way to sterilize women.
[1:20:14.980 --> 1:20:19.020]  And they found, well, if you attacked their ovaries itself, you can make them really sick.
[1:20:19.020 --> 1:20:22.900]  If you attacked their uterus, it makes them sick, they already had those.
[1:20:22.900 --> 1:20:25.300]  Let's have one that just attacks the placenta.
[1:20:25.300 --> 1:20:29.900]  And sure as hell, that's how Wolfgang Wudarg and others go, let's look at this protein.
[1:20:29.900 --> 1:20:33.180]  Let's check this very rare, oh, it's placenta protein.
[1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:35.900]  Nothing to do with COVID-19.
[1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:41.060]  And then he explains in the paper that what's really evil is you can create an active antibody
[1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:46.500]  or a passive antibody, and that what's happening with this in the trials, they skipped animal
[1:20:46.500 --> 1:20:53.900]  trials in the human trials is it's causing the passive antibody, which actually then makes
[1:20:53.900 --> 1:20:58.100]  you have a bigger cytokine storm, autoimmune response.
[1:20:58.100 --> 1:21:02.220]  If you come in contact with a similar virus, this is the most common virus family there
[1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:03.220]  is.
[1:21:03.220 --> 1:21:10.660]  And so exactly like the Spanish flu killed 50 to 100 million people in 1918-19 was because
[1:21:10.660 --> 1:21:16.220]  for whatever reason, they'd already been close to a virus before, gotten passive antibodies.
[1:21:16.220 --> 1:21:20.180]  So when the similar virus hit them, it caused them to have an autoimmune response like being
[1:21:20.180 --> 1:21:25.380]  stung by bees or are a peanut allergy, and then you die.
[1:21:25.380 --> 1:21:27.140]  And it's all in the literature.
[1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:28.540]  What do you think a vaccine does?
[1:21:28.540 --> 1:21:31.260]  It causes an autoimmune response.
[1:21:31.260 --> 1:21:34.940]  Well, what happens when you have a bad autoimmune response?
[1:21:34.940 --> 1:21:35.940]  You die.
[1:21:35.940 --> 1:21:40.500]  And in these hospitals, when they give a newborn baby five, six shots, they start having a
[1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:41.500]  convulsion.
[1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:42.860]  They go, oh, that's fine.
[1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:43.860]  That's a side effect.
[1:21:43.860 --> 1:21:45.540]  They don't even give them benadryl.
[1:21:45.540 --> 1:21:50.740]  They let them convulse to their little brain's bleed to brain damage the little sweet seeds
[1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.580]  because they couldn't kill them in the womb.
[1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:54.140]  The mother didn't kill in the womb.
[1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:56.580]  They couldn't convince her to keep it comfortable and kill it.
[1:21:56.580 --> 1:21:57.580]  More doublespeak.
[1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:03.780]  So they kill it with the damn vaccine or they brain damage it, which is even better because
[1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:04.780]  now it's a zombie.
[1:22:04.780 --> 1:22:09.780]  You got to take care of it for 40 years.
[1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:16.180]  Man, that's cold-blooded, baby.
[1:22:16.180 --> 1:22:19.860]  So I suggest you go to m4wars.com.
[1:22:19.860 --> 1:22:23.740]  We link directly to the European Union website, the government website.
[1:22:23.740 --> 1:22:26.540]  And I suggest you put your little thinking cap on.
[1:22:26.540 --> 1:22:32.860]  If you're a Google engineer, a bureaucrat or a smarty pants, do you really want to sign
[1:22:32.860 --> 1:22:33.860]  on?
[1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:34.860]  You scroll down and show them.
[1:22:34.860 --> 1:22:35.860]  We have the video and the links.
[1:22:35.860 --> 1:22:36.860]  Do you really?
[1:22:36.860 --> 1:22:37.860]  Keep scrolling.
[1:22:37.860 --> 1:22:42.040]  I'm going to show folks the link right there because we've got a link to the paper right
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:43.040]  there.
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:44.040]  There it is.
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:45.540]  Do you really?
[1:22:45.540 --> 1:22:46.540]  Do you really?
[1:22:46.540 --> 1:22:52.700]  Do you really want to be part of this because you're pretending that you're the man.
[1:22:52.700 --> 1:22:56.140]  You're pretending you're part of this big, well, there are too many people, Alex, and
[1:22:56.140 --> 1:22:58.940]  what we do hurts some folks, but it's for a greater good.
[1:22:58.940 --> 1:23:01.940]  Well, why don't I come switch your throat for the greater good?
[1:23:01.940 --> 1:23:03.140]  Oh, oh, you're a human.
[1:23:03.140 --> 1:23:05.540]  The bioethics board said you're a human.
[1:23:05.540 --> 1:23:09.020]  And all these Africans, all these Indians, all these little kids, all these women you
[1:23:09.020 --> 1:23:10.020]  sterilize.
[1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:16.660]  And by the way, Bill Gates lies a lot and I'm against hurting the Africans as much as
[1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:17.660]  I hurt anybody else.
[1:23:17.660 --> 1:23:20.100]  So just as important as anybody is more important.
[1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:23.060]  Every soul is precious to God's eyes.
[1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:26.260]  But Bill Gates told Japanese TV goes, oh, we're giving different vaccines the third
[1:23:26.260 --> 1:23:27.500]  world than you.
[1:23:27.500 --> 1:23:28.780]  They're not.
[1:23:28.780 --> 1:23:32.980]  They're coming right at the United States with the worst MRNA ones right away.
[1:23:32.980 --> 1:23:36.980]  Oh, don't worry, Black Lives Matter, Bill Gates funds it.
[1:23:36.980 --> 1:23:50.340]  He said blacks get it first because he cares about you.
[1:23:50.340 --> 1:23:55.780]  The globalists and their minions want to play God, Chuckie Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack
[1:23:55.780 --> 1:23:56.780]  Obama.
[1:23:56.780 --> 1:24:01.220]  You look at these sacks of garbage that you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[1:24:01.220 --> 1:24:02.220]  Why do they love death?
[1:24:02.220 --> 1:24:10.740]  Because they hate themselves, they project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:16.860]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[1:24:16.860 --> 1:24:18.460]  That's why they hate info wars.
[1:24:18.460 --> 1:24:19.460]  We believe in humanity.
[1:24:19.460 --> 1:24:20.460]  We think you're beautiful.
[1:24:20.460 --> 1:24:22.620]  We think you're amazing.
[1:24:22.620 --> 1:24:27.500]  Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[1:24:27.500 --> 1:24:30.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[1:24:30.260 --> 1:24:31.260]  It's now upon us.
[1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:34.660]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever when
[1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:37.700]  the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:39.260]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:40.260]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[1:24:40.260 --> 1:24:44.340]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done, because God's
[1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:50.140]  on our side and the globalists know it.
[1:24:50.140 --> 1:24:55.620]  Imagine a dystopic novel or dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[1:24:55.620 --> 1:25:00.580]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[1:25:00.580 --> 1:25:04.780]  with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[1:25:04.780 --> 1:25:07.660]  Well, that's where you are in the year 2020.
[1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:10.860]  Global government of the United Nations, all of the authoritarian groups admit they're
[1:25:10.860 --> 1:25:11.860]  doing it.
[1:25:11.860 --> 1:25:17.300]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even
[1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.020]  worried about COVID-19.
[1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:21.420]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[1:25:21.420 --> 1:25:25.380]  Think about how it's say that as big techs got to track you, they've got to trace you,
[1:25:25.380 --> 1:25:26.380]  they've got to control you.
[1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:28.380]  You've got to have absolutely your house.
[1:25:28.380 --> 1:25:33.660]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you, because my God, this thing has one tenth
[1:25:33.660 --> 1:25:39.060]  of a percent chance of killing you, give your ability to have cancer or heart attack.
[1:25:39.060 --> 1:25:40.980]  This is their takeover.
[1:25:40.980 --> 1:25:44.980]  Imagine on America's death certificate, killed by the fear of the common cold.
[1:25:44.980 --> 1:26:11.180]  Yeah, that's fear monitoring, that's mind control.
[1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:14.660]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:16.780]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:19.060]  I suggest band.video.
[1:26:19.060 --> 1:26:23.660]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[1:26:23.660 --> 1:26:24.660]  to stop it.
[1:26:24.660 --> 1:26:28.780]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:32.980]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:37.020]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[1:26:37.020 --> 1:26:40.820]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:52.860]  Be sure and share band.video.
[1:26:52.860 --> 1:27:12.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:12.780 --> 1:27:13.780]  That's another big thing.
[1:27:13.780 --> 1:27:16.900]  Look at the world we're killing.
[1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:22.100]  The technocrats say they've got to exterminate 95% of the world population.
[1:27:22.100 --> 1:27:27.580]  These 10 turner officially at the good groups, findings with Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, David
[1:27:27.580 --> 1:27:29.300]  Rockefeller, the rest of them.
[1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:32.940]  That's Wall Street Journal, by the way, when I looked that up, 95% he wants to kill you.
[1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:36.780]  Imagine if I was in the newspaper like, well, we need a world government to carry out 95%
[1:27:36.780 --> 1:27:37.780]  reduction.
[1:27:37.780 --> 1:27:44.260]  People say, we got to watch that guy, but oh, if you're a big billionaire and you meet
[1:27:44.260 --> 1:27:49.220]  with other billionaires and you actually run the world health system, it's like, well,
[1:27:49.220 --> 1:27:54.100]  let's just move on from there.
[1:27:54.100 --> 1:27:58.420]  They protect these people in their actions against us.
[1:27:58.420 --> 1:28:06.300]  It's like three years ago, George Soros was getting $2 billion a year from the U.S. State
[1:28:06.300 --> 1:28:07.300]  Department.
[1:28:07.300 --> 1:28:08.300]  Trump didn't know about it.
[1:28:08.300 --> 1:28:10.860]  He hadn't cut the money off.
[1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:16.180]  And they were giving through that $2 billion program, tens of millions of people, $1,000,
[1:28:16.180 --> 1:28:24.180]  $2,000, $3,000 debit cards that just had cash on them, no name, to fly in and get on
[1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:30.140]  boats and get to U.N. refugee centers on the European or U.S. borders.
[1:28:30.140 --> 1:28:39.060]  Now that was in Reuters with George Soros smiling, bragging about how he did it.
[1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:42.820]  But when I covered it and Lou Dobbs covered it and Sean Hannity covered it, the media
[1:28:42.820 --> 1:28:48.380]  said it was fake news and they went after judicial watch saying it was made up.
[1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:52.580]  It's like saying, Jones is wearing a navy blue blazer.
[1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:56.300]  And I am wearing a navy blue blazer and then later I go, no, I'm not.
[1:28:56.300 --> 1:29:00.180]  And go, Fox News, apologize for saying Jones was wearing a navy blue blazer.
[1:29:00.180 --> 1:29:05.740]  Yeah, there it is, George Soros Mastercard to partner in aid migrant refugees.
[1:29:05.740 --> 1:29:10.020]  That's a year before they did it, then they do it, we cover it.
[1:29:10.020 --> 1:29:14.500]  But the reason they were pissed is a bunch of those operatives are skippin' money off
[1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:15.500]  that.
[1:29:15.500 --> 1:29:21.660]  $2 billion of State Department money going to fund a U.N. operation that he was privately
[1:29:21.660 --> 1:29:23.380]  running.
[1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:28.900]  Now he's taken the head of that operation to be the chief of staff for Biden.
[1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:33.460]  And the new guy is the former head of Smartmatic that just helped steal the election.
[1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:37.620]  That again, George Soros has no connection to.
[1:29:37.620 --> 1:29:40.300]  And again, they don't love these third world populations.
[1:29:40.300 --> 1:29:44.300]  They're depopulating them, poisoning them, getting rid of their jobs and then flooding
[1:29:44.300 --> 1:29:46.460]  our borders that where they collapse them.
[1:29:46.460 --> 1:29:51.100]  And then the U.N. has got to be the world authority, just like with COVID-19, the world
[1:29:51.100 --> 1:29:56.060]  authority to handle the giant migrant rush that's already accelerated.
[1:29:56.060 --> 1:30:00.340]  And they say by the middle of 2021, we'll be three times what it was five years ago
[1:30:00.340 --> 1:30:01.820]  at its last peak.
[1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:03.980]  Did you hear me?
[1:30:03.980 --> 1:30:07.820]  That was all a beta test for being flooded by the third world.
[1:30:07.820 --> 1:30:11.580]  Do I want the third world here getting free stuff, being taught whites are evil, being
[1:30:11.580 --> 1:30:12.900]  taught to hate America?
[1:30:12.900 --> 1:30:13.900]  No.
[1:30:13.900 --> 1:30:17.740]  Do I want them to be free and build up their own countries and then care about them?
[1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:18.740]  Yes.
[1:30:18.740 --> 1:30:19.740]  I don't want them sterilized.
[1:30:19.740 --> 1:30:20.740]  I don't want to kill them.
[1:30:20.740 --> 1:30:25.660]  But the globalists force you into that because after they're done hammering us and killing
[1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:29.460]  whites in mass, it's going to be pretty much public knowledge what we're going to do to
[1:30:29.460 --> 1:30:34.620]  them, we're going to hit them with a bio weapon that kills almost everyone who isn't Anglo.
[1:30:34.620 --> 1:30:37.820]  And then let me tell you what comes next.
[1:30:37.820 --> 1:30:39.620]  The Chinese have already agreed to this.
[1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:40.620]  They don't like anybody else.
[1:30:40.620 --> 1:30:42.340]  They're going to close their borders while it goes now.
[1:30:42.340 --> 1:30:45.380]  And they're just trying to get all the nuclear powers on board for this.
[1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:47.220]  And then they're going to kill the Middle East.
[1:30:47.220 --> 1:30:48.540]  They're going to kill Africa.
[1:30:48.540 --> 1:30:51.780]  They're going to kill all the subgroups in Asia.
[1:30:51.780 --> 1:30:56.940]  And they've got to have a total lockdown mode during this operation.
[1:30:56.940 --> 1:31:01.220]  So you can either listen to me now or you can listen to me later.
[1:31:01.220 --> 1:31:05.940]  When they're done, Africa isn't going to have 1% of the people on it.
[1:31:05.940 --> 1:31:08.620]  It's going to be a barren wasteland.
[1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:14.980]  Now, if you think God isn't going to destroy you, if you go along with that, why do you
[1:31:14.980 --> 1:31:15.980]  think I'm on air?
[1:31:15.980 --> 1:31:21.860]  I've prayed a lot about this and I knew this a long time ago because God wants you to hear.
[1:31:21.860 --> 1:31:22.860]  I'm certainly not God.
[1:31:22.860 --> 1:31:23.860]  I'm an imperfect vessel.
[1:31:23.860 --> 1:31:24.860]  I'm nobody.
[1:31:24.860 --> 1:31:30.140]  God wants you, not just you that are good, but those that are bad to know the cost of
[1:31:30.140 --> 1:31:33.420]  what you're signing on to to get the whole story.
[1:31:33.420 --> 1:31:36.540]  The devil gives you fine print and you know, flim flam and you know, but still want you
[1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:37.540]  to sign the contract.
[1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:38.540]  But still, hold on.
[1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:39.540]  Look over here.
[1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:40.540]  Just go ahead and sign there.
[1:31:40.540 --> 1:31:41.540]  The dancing girls here right here.
[1:31:41.540 --> 1:31:44.060]  I'm here to make sure over and over again.
[1:31:44.060 --> 1:31:48.080]  I like to look at the fine print look at the fine print look at the fine print look at the
[1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:52.700]  fine print look at the fine print look at the fine print look at the fine print look at
[1:31:52.700 --> 1:31:53.700]  the fine print.
[1:31:53.700 --> 1:31:54.700]  Look at the fine print.
[1:31:54.700 --> 1:31:57.460]  I'm not here to just entertain you and cover all this other BS.
[1:31:57.580 --> 1:31:59.100]  I'm going to tell you about the big plan.
[1:31:59.940 --> 1:32:01.980]  And let me tell you, I'm not a perfect person.
[1:32:02.180 --> 1:32:02.980]  I love my kids.
[1:32:02.980 --> 1:32:03.700]  I love my own life.
[1:32:03.700 --> 1:32:06.660]  I'm kind of like, man, I could kind of apologize.
[1:32:06.660 --> 1:32:09.060]  The globalists that go on apology tour and say they're right.
[1:32:09.060 --> 1:32:10.700]  And I could actually join them.
[1:32:10.700 --> 1:32:13.580]  I think the door is still open and I'm not actually thinking about that.
[1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:16.420]  But I'm wargaming at my brain can't help it.
[1:32:17.500 --> 1:32:21.420]  And man, I feel the Holy Spirit even entertaining it.
[1:32:21.420 --> 1:32:26.380]  He goes, haha, no, no, no, no, give me that, no, please don't know.
[1:32:26.540 --> 1:32:30.100]  No, no, no, no, no, no, please, I'll do it.
[1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:30.420]  Do it.
[1:32:30.420 --> 1:32:34.860]  I mean, I cannot imagine these people that are into Satanism.
[1:32:34.980 --> 1:32:38.420]  They want to be with that spirit because I've tasted both of them.
[1:32:38.660 --> 1:32:41.620]  I want to be with Jesus Christ of Nazareth and his daddy.
[1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:43.300]  That's who I'm with.
[1:32:43.300 --> 1:32:44.340]  I'm going there.
[1:32:44.340 --> 1:32:45.300]  I'm with that.
[1:32:45.300 --> 1:32:48.780]  That gives me all the discernment, all the health, all the goodness, all the life,
[1:32:48.900 --> 1:32:49.740]  all the strength.
[1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:50.740]  It's Jesus.
[1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:51.740]  It's not the devil.
[1:32:53.780 --> 1:32:56.900]  But I'm here to talk to those that have been sold out to the devil.
[1:32:57.460 --> 1:33:00.100]  Here, let's just go to this clip where I wonder about the covid launch
[1:33:00.900 --> 1:33:03.420]  in June of 2018.
[1:33:03.420 --> 1:33:04.540]  Let's get that queued up here.
[1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:06.380]  The full clips at Bandai video.
[1:33:06.380 --> 1:33:08.100]  It's 11 minutes long, but here it is.
[1:33:10.300 --> 1:33:14.580]  We have been following very closely for several years, disease X
[1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:18.340]  that the UN World Health Organization
[1:33:18.340 --> 1:33:22.940]  has predicted could wipe out humanity.
[1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:25.940]  Now, there's a spectrum of disease X type
[1:33:26.300 --> 1:33:30.900]  pathogens in the virus family that they would call a disease X,
[1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:34.900]  mainly the bird flu variety, the mouse pox variety
[1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:38.140]  and also what would be known as airborne.
[1:33:41.380 --> 1:33:42.380]  Ebola.
[1:33:43.500 --> 1:33:45.740]  I have four children.
[1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:47.740]  I love my family.
[1:33:47.740 --> 1:33:49.860]  I have studied history in great detail.
[1:33:51.180 --> 1:33:53.740]  And I understand how big a threat this is.
[1:33:54.340 --> 1:33:57.100]  Now, Zero Hedge has an incredibly important article
[1:33:57.380 --> 1:34:00.580]  that's a boil down from the World Health Organization
[1:34:01.140 --> 1:34:04.660]  and just mentions and blurbs out of the Chinese news
[1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:07.380]  that they're basically keeping quiet.
[1:34:08.980 --> 1:34:11.980]  And the story is also posted in full info wars dot com
[1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:16.380]  that a new strain of bird flu that kills 40 percent
[1:34:16.380 --> 1:34:19.820]  of humans that contracted it just showed up this week
[1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:24.100]  and has already killed a hundred people plus.
[1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:25.780]  And that's old news.
[1:34:26.420 --> 1:34:28.860]  Previous bird flu is that they thought were incredibly deadly,
[1:34:28.860 --> 1:34:31.820]  only killed 1 percent, then 3 percent, then 6 percent.
[1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:33.580]  The last one was 9 percent.
[1:34:34.340 --> 1:34:36.860]  Remember decades ago when they were worried it might go airborne.
[1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:41.620]  We have a graphic from the UN showing that it is now airborne.
[1:34:41.820 --> 1:34:44.140]  This is so incredible, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:46.460]  because this should be the top news story in the world.
[1:34:47.460 --> 1:34:50.860]  Now, remember about a decade ago, our own Pentagon
[1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:54.500]  and the CDC put out the blueprint
[1:34:55.260 --> 1:34:59.580]  via the UN for the mouse pox that kills 99 percent
[1:34:59.580 --> 1:35:01.420]  of mice that come in contact with it.
[1:35:01.700 --> 1:35:04.460]  And with a few genetic changes, it can be made to be airborne
[1:35:04.460 --> 1:35:06.820]  for humans and kill 99 percent of humans.
[1:35:07.020 --> 1:35:10.500]  It is seen as the most deadly potential
[1:35:10.500 --> 1:35:13.460]  because it's already at 99 percent.
[1:35:13.460 --> 1:35:14.780]  I'm going to explain that again.
[1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:19.460]  99 percent of people that get a human variant mouse pox
[1:35:19.460 --> 1:35:21.220]  die a horrible death.
[1:35:21.220 --> 1:35:23.220]  This is 38.3.
[1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:24.620]  This is an emergency, folks.
[1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:25.940]  Because if we don't treat like an emergency,
[1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:27.100]  no one will know what's going on.
[1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:28.580]  And then it's just something in the background
[1:35:28.580 --> 1:35:29.580]  and we don't get ready for it.
[1:35:29.580 --> 1:35:31.700]  What did I and Dr. Group and others,
[1:35:31.700 --> 1:35:34.140]  and Dr. Blalock, who's a brain surgeon,
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:36.300]  what have we talked about in the past here on the air?
[1:35:36.300 --> 1:35:39.180]  That the globalists have said in their white papers,
[1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:40.740]  in their own UN documents,
[1:35:40.740 --> 1:35:44.340]  that they want to create race-specific bioweapons
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:46.500]  and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:47.620]  They teach that everywhere,
[1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:49.300]  that the world without humans would be great.
[1:35:49.300 --> 1:35:50.300]  We need to depopulate.
[1:35:50.300 --> 1:35:53.700]  China's been the center of one-child policy, all of this.
[1:35:53.700 --> 1:35:56.060]  And that it would be good to call the planet.
[1:35:56.060 --> 1:35:57.860]  A lot of this from my sources is
[1:35:57.860 --> 1:36:01.900]  that they're preparing to release bioweapons,
[1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:04.900]  claim that they're naturally occurring.
[1:36:04.900 --> 1:36:07.140]  And then use that as the cover
[1:36:07.140 --> 1:36:10.340]  for civil emergencies, societal control,
[1:36:10.340 --> 1:36:12.140]  crackdowns on free speech.
[1:36:12.140 --> 1:36:15.100]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago.
[1:36:15.100 --> 1:36:17.100]  And when he got confronted by Congress, he said,
[1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:20.820]  well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[1:36:20.820 --> 1:36:22.100]  Just type that in.
[1:36:22.100 --> 1:36:24.460]  CDC says internet kill switch
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:26.900]  is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out
[1:36:26.900 --> 1:36:28.500]  and they have to control panic
[1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:30.900]  and direct every website in the U.S.
[1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:32.900]  to one government announcement
[1:36:32.900 --> 1:36:34.900]  and we looked at every angle and believed
[1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:37.900]  a bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release
[1:36:37.900 --> 1:36:39.500]  to bring in a world government
[1:36:39.500 --> 1:36:40.900]  to counter a global problem.
[1:36:40.900 --> 1:36:43.300]  And the U.N. has said that a global pandemic
[1:36:43.300 --> 1:36:45.900]  is the only thing that may save their...
[1:36:45.900 --> 1:36:49.500]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year,
[1:36:49.500 --> 1:36:52.900]  just wait until you see the year 2021.
[1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:53.900]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:36:53.900 --> 1:36:54.900]  I started in full wars,
[1:36:54.900 --> 1:36:57.300]  but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[1:36:57.300 --> 1:36:59.700]  And now in full wars is more important than ever
[1:36:59.700 --> 1:37:01.900]  because you're not going to be able
[1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:02.900]  to do that than ever
[1:37:02.900 --> 1:37:04.900]  because the general population of the planet
[1:37:04.900 --> 1:37:06.900]  is weighing up the fact that we've done our research
[1:37:06.900 --> 1:37:07.900]  and we've been dead on.
[1:37:07.900 --> 1:37:10.900]  That's why it's so important for those of you out there
[1:37:10.900 --> 1:37:12.900]  that have supported the broadcast and the websites
[1:37:12.900 --> 1:37:15.900]  and the films and all the rest of the information we put out
[1:37:15.900 --> 1:37:17.900]  to realize how important your work has been
[1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:18.900]  and to redouble your efforts.
[1:37:18.900 --> 1:37:20.900]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:22.900]  Also, as Christmas is almost here,
[1:37:22.900 --> 1:37:23.900]  don't wait.

[1:37:34.900 --> 1:37:35.900]  that enriches your life.

[1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:40.900]  storable food, locket pockets, privacy pouches,
[1:37:40.900 --> 1:37:43.900]  and so much more at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:43.900 --> 1:37:45.900]  And again, thank you all for your support
[1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:47.900]  and Merry Christmas Couples.
[1:37:47.900 --> 1:37:49.900]  The project for world government developed
[1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:51.900]  by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes
[1:37:51.900 --> 1:37:53.900]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family
[1:37:53.900 --> 1:37:56.900]  and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s
[1:37:56.900 --> 1:37:59.900]  is all about corporate global governance.
[1:37:59.900 --> 1:38:00.900]  And now you're seeing it.
[1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:02.900]  It's not just the blue states, the blue cities,
[1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:03.900]  the communists and socialists,
[1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:06.900]  nations all working in unison under UN control
[1:38:06.900 --> 1:38:09.900]  to establish a medical planetary dictatorship.
[1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:12.900]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations
[1:38:12.900 --> 1:38:16.900]  themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families,
[1:38:16.900 --> 1:38:18.900]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[1:38:18.900 --> 1:38:21.900]  the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[1:38:21.900 --> 1:38:23.900]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty
[1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:25.900]  aren't even Dutch or British at the same time,
[1:38:25.900 --> 1:38:28.900]  but they go back to the literal count Dracula
[1:38:28.900 --> 1:38:32.900]  and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[1:38:32.900 --> 1:38:36.900]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[1:38:36.900 --> 1:38:38.900]  They're involved in plotting the world economy.
[1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:41.900]  That's what the social distancing, the master all about.
[1:38:41.900 --> 1:38:43.900]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses
[1:38:43.900 --> 1:38:44.900]  and those that comply,
[1:38:44.900 --> 1:38:46.900]  are complying with your own destruction.
[1:38:46.900 --> 1:38:47.900]  Wake up.
[1:38:48.900 --> 1:38:53.900]  PrepareWithAlex.com is a special website with my patriot
[1:38:53.900 --> 1:38:55.900]  because they have agreements with other distributors
[1:38:55.900 --> 1:38:59.900]  that they all sell the same low price, high quality, storeable food.
[1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:03.900]  But occasionally they can do promotions on their own platform
[1:39:03.900 --> 1:39:05.900]  and that's what we've set up with them is
[1:39:05.900 --> 1:39:09.900]  at PrepareWithAlex.com is a sub domain of my patriot.

[1:39:13.900 --> 1:39:16.900]  at infowarstore.com where you can normally get it
[1:39:16.900 --> 1:39:19.900]  at very good prices and those prices are still there.

[1:39:27.900 --> 1:39:29.900]  and on a bunch of other great items.
[1:39:29.900 --> 1:39:33.900]  Huge discounts that will be ending next Wednesday.
[1:39:33.900 --> 1:39:36.900]  That is December 2nd.
[1:39:36.900 --> 1:39:39.900]  So you've got this week and a little bit of next week
[1:39:39.900 --> 1:39:40.900]  to get your orders in.
[1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:41.900]  They're ready to ship to you right now
[1:39:41.900 --> 1:39:43.900]  and the profit that comes in funds the info war.
[1:39:43.900 --> 1:39:44.900]  So it's a 360 win.
[1:39:44.900 --> 1:39:46.900]  You need storeable food to fight the great reset.
[1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:47.900]  Get prepared now.
[1:39:47.900 --> 1:39:51.900]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:54.900]  They've always been part of the establishment
[1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:55.900]  and it's only going to get worse.
[1:39:55.900 --> 1:39:59.900]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office
[1:39:59.900 --> 1:40:01.900]  for second term on January 20th,
[1:40:01.900 --> 1:40:04.900]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever
[1:40:04.900 --> 1:40:05.900]  on this republic.
[1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:07.900]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[1:40:07.900 --> 1:40:09.900]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[1:40:09.900 --> 1:40:11.900]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the US.
[1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:14.900]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:16.900]  This is economic domination.
[1:40:16.900 --> 1:40:17.900]  This is economic war.
[1:40:17.900 --> 1:40:18.900]  We are being consolidated.
[1:40:18.900 --> 1:40:19.900]  We are being taken over.
[1:40:19.900 --> 1:40:22.900]  The democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[1:40:22.900 --> 1:40:26.900]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population
[1:40:26.900 --> 1:40:28.900]  and bring them absolutely to heal
[1:40:28.900 --> 1:40:31.900]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[1:40:31.900 --> 1:40:32.900]  and property.
[1:40:32.900 --> 1:40:34.900]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[1:40:34.900 --> 1:40:35.900]  That's what the great reset is.
[1:40:35.900 --> 1:40:38.900]  Cloud swab and these other criminals admit it.
[1:40:38.900 --> 1:40:40.900]  That's what social distancing is.
[1:40:40.900 --> 1:40:43.900]  So your business is only a 25% for several more years.
[1:40:43.900 --> 1:40:45.900]  No small businesses will be there.
[1:40:45.900 --> 1:40:46.900]  This is a master plan.
[1:40:46.900 --> 1:40:47.900]  Say no.
[1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:54.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:07.900 --> 1:41:09.900]  Some heads are going to roll.
[1:41:09.900 --> 1:41:11.900]  Defending the republic from enemies,
[1:41:11.900 --> 1:41:13.900]  foreign and domestic.
[1:41:13.900 --> 1:41:15.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:41:18.900 --> 1:41:19.900]  Okay.
[1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:21.900]  So let's get right into it right now.
[1:41:21.900 --> 1:41:24.900]  Because we're going over a lot of other political news next hour.
[1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:27.900]  Here it is right here.
[1:41:27.900 --> 1:41:30.900]  Wolfgang Wudard is the chair of the Parliamentary Assembly
[1:41:30.900 --> 1:41:32.900]  of the Council of Europe Health.
[1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:37.900]  And this is an official advisory board to the United Nations EU whole system.
[1:41:39.900 --> 1:41:42.900]  And he's been a very moral good guy with a group of scientists for years.
[1:41:42.900 --> 1:41:44.900]  And medical doctors exposing things.
[1:41:44.900 --> 1:41:50.900]  Here is their petition to the European Union, European Medicines Agency,
[1:41:50.900 --> 1:41:54.900]  Committee for Human Medical Products,
[1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:57.900]  COVID-19 EMA, Pandemic Task Force,
[1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:00.900]  Domenico, Secretariat 6.
[1:42:00.900 --> 1:42:02.900]  It's all UN as you see.
[1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:05.900]  Even though it's EU, it's all UN nomenclature.
[1:42:06.900 --> 1:42:10.900]  Petition motion for administrative regulatory action regarding
[1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:15.900]  confirmation of advocacy and points used for the data in connection
[1:42:15.900 --> 1:42:17.900]  with the following clinical trials.
[1:42:17.900 --> 1:42:21.900]  And then they have a huge medical paper written up by a bunch of prestigious
[1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:25.900]  scientists and medical doctors saying,
[1:42:25.900 --> 1:42:28.900]  okay, you're violating international law, Geneva Convention,
[1:42:28.900 --> 1:42:31.900]  Nuremberg Code, US law, EU law,
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.900]  waving all these trials.
[1:42:33.900 --> 1:42:36.900]  And then what you admit in the trials is super deadly and dangerous.
[1:42:36.900 --> 1:42:39.900]  I mean, this is, that's what I'm saying, folks.
[1:42:39.900 --> 1:42:44.900]  This is like a collapse of, of, of tax imbalances.
[1:42:44.900 --> 1:42:48.900]  This isn't just a waiver or legislative protection or liability protection.
[1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:51.900]  This is, you can do anything you want.
[1:42:53.900 --> 1:42:55.900]  And then there's whole areas with top virologists going,
[1:42:55.900 --> 1:43:00.900]  we don't know why you don't say why you add jellyfish DNA in here.
[1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:04.900]  And you have the body replicate bioluminescence.
[1:43:04.900 --> 1:43:06.900]  So we glow.
[1:43:06.900 --> 1:43:08.900]  What the hell is that?
[1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:13.900]  But Dr. Woodard goes, we're guessing it's about tracking so that once
[1:43:13.900 --> 1:43:16.900]  your body grows these luminescence cells,
[1:43:16.900 --> 1:43:19.900]  remember like 20 years ago you could buy a racist monkey in South Korea
[1:43:19.900 --> 1:43:21.900]  for like $5,000 that glows in the dark,
[1:43:21.900 --> 1:43:23.900]  because it's been crossed with jellyfish.
[1:43:23.900 --> 1:43:25.900]  That was even in like Wired Magazine.
[1:43:25.900 --> 1:43:26.900]  People didn't believe me back then.
[1:43:26.900 --> 1:43:29.900]  Guys, type in, buy glow-in-the-dark monkeys.
[1:43:29.900 --> 1:43:31.900]  I'm not joking.
[1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:33.900]  Well, now you're going to be a glow-in-the-dark monkey
[1:43:33.900 --> 1:43:37.900]  because they call it a vaccine, but what it is is gene therapy.
[1:43:37.900 --> 1:43:40.900]  Well, it's one thing if you take some kid that has autoimmune problems,
[1:43:40.900 --> 1:43:42.900]  you give a mama's bone marrow if it matches,
[1:43:42.900 --> 1:43:45.900]  and the kid learns to have immune system, and it's a miracle.
[1:43:45.900 --> 1:43:50.900]  But what about, well, we're just going to put some racist monkey in you.
[1:43:50.900 --> 1:43:54.900]  How about some glow-in-the-dark jellyfish?
[1:43:54.900 --> 1:43:56.900]  That's in there.
[1:43:56.900 --> 1:43:57.900]  Can I keep that?
[1:43:57.900 --> 1:43:58.900]  Reading this?
[1:43:58.900 --> 1:44:00.900]  Because I was just going to read the paper.
[1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:03.900]  And once I saw that, I said, okay, I got to read all this.
[1:44:03.900 --> 1:44:07.900]  There it is, MIT technology, glowing monkeys inherent jellyfish genes.
[1:44:07.900 --> 1:44:09.900]  Do you hear that?
[1:44:09.900 --> 1:44:15.900]  This gives you the genes of the jellyfish so you will glow too.
[1:44:15.900 --> 1:44:17.900]  I'm sorry, man.
[1:44:17.900 --> 1:44:20.900]  I just can't even, like, this is like aliens attacking.
[1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:22.900]  I mean, it might as well have flying saucers landing.
[1:44:22.900 --> 1:44:24.900]  That'd be easier to deal with because we can fight them.
[1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:27.900]  I mean, this is what the hell is going on here.
[1:44:27.900 --> 1:44:29.900]  Sorry.
[1:44:29.900 --> 1:44:31.900]  Overhead shot, please.
[1:44:31.900 --> 1:44:36.900]  At a certain point, I just find, folks, if you want this, just go ahead and do it.
[1:44:36.900 --> 1:44:40.900]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:44:40.900 --> 1:44:42.900]  I'm not cracking up.
[1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:45.900]  I just, this is getting too out of control.
[1:44:45.900 --> 1:44:47.900]  Let's go to the paper.
[1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:50.900]  It goes into how the PCR test is fake, and the inventor of it says it's fake.
[1:44:50.900 --> 1:44:54.900]  It's 96% in exaggeration, and then they turn it up way higher than it's supposed to be.
[1:44:54.900 --> 1:44:55.900]  And it's all false.
[1:44:55.900 --> 1:44:56.900]  It's all based on a lie.
[1:44:56.900 --> 1:44:59.900]  So how do they know that these vaccines actually protected somebody from a PCR test?
[1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:00.900]  It's a fraud.
[1:45:00.900 --> 1:45:04.900]  Then they admit that the actual studies of the mRNA vaccines here, they list them here,
[1:45:04.900 --> 1:45:07.900]  don't even actually protect you, and they admit it doesn't protect you,
[1:45:07.900 --> 1:45:09.900]  and they admit it doesn't cause a stop to spread.
[1:45:09.900 --> 1:45:11.900]  And I didn't just believe this report.
[1:45:11.900 --> 1:45:14.900]  I went and looked it all up, and it was true.
[1:45:14.900 --> 1:45:16.900]  You hear what I just said?
[1:45:16.900 --> 1:45:24.900]  I know you're probably still stuck on cell reprogramming that will make you release proteins
[1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:29.900]  that glow in the dark.
[1:45:29.900 --> 1:45:34.900]  And how they skip the animal trials, statement of grounds for the suit,
[1:45:34.900 --> 1:45:36.900]  trying to block it.
[1:45:36.900 --> 1:45:38.900]  I read all this on a Saturday show for a full hour.
[1:45:38.900 --> 1:45:41.900]  I've got a whole damn thing for you on air.
[1:45:41.900 --> 1:45:46.900]  And how they get liability protection, how dangerous it is.
[1:45:46.900 --> 1:45:49.900]  They just don't care anymore, folks.
[1:45:49.900 --> 1:45:51.900]  And here's a really key point.
[1:45:51.900 --> 1:45:55.900]  How you've got this super common virus family.
[1:45:55.900 --> 1:46:01.900]  And so if you take this, in 70% of people, it causes an excitokine storm.
[1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:07.900]  The next time you come into a virus that's similar to this, now because this isn't giving you immunity,
[1:46:07.900 --> 1:46:15.900]  what it does is causes you to have an autoimmune response that can then kill you or cause brain damage.
[1:46:15.900 --> 1:46:22.900]  ADE is a major reason for many previous vaccine trials for others' problems, the reason they failed.
[1:46:22.900 --> 1:46:25.900]  Reason other studies fail with the coronavirus.
[1:46:25.900 --> 1:46:28.900]  Major safety concerns were observed in animal models.
[1:46:28.900 --> 1:46:34.900]  If ADE occurs in the individual, the response to the virus can be worse than the response
[1:46:34.900 --> 1:46:38.900]  if they had never developed an antibody in the first place.
[1:46:38.900 --> 1:46:45.900]  This can cause hyper-inflammatory response, a cytokine storm, and generally, dysregulation of the immune system.
[1:46:45.900 --> 1:46:50.900]  So it can shut your immune system down or cause a giant immune system over-blow that kills you.
[1:46:50.900 --> 1:46:56.900]  But if your immune system shuts down, the first time a cell replicates wrong, your body doesn't stop it and you die of cancer.
[1:46:56.900 --> 1:47:03.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, I went and read the white paper and I went and read the papers that it's attached to.
[1:47:03.900 --> 1:47:05.900]  And it's even scarier.
[1:47:05.900 --> 1:47:07.900]  Now, I'm three pages into this.
[1:47:07.900 --> 1:47:09.900]  Now you know why I'm going crazy.
[1:47:09.900 --> 1:47:13.900]  In fact, if you want to die, just take it and die. My God.
[1:47:13.900 --> 1:47:16.900]  What the hell is going on here?
[1:47:16.900 --> 1:47:18.900]  I mean, that's the thing.
[1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:24.900]  Sitting up here and talking about this and just acting normal and like, oh, by the way, they got sterile into the vaccine.
[1:47:24.900 --> 1:47:26.900]  Oh, well.
[1:47:29.900 --> 1:47:32.900]  You know, Joe Rogan was in here last week. He's a really nice guy.
[1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:38.900]  He's like, Alex, just project your goodness onto others and just believe and don't be tribal and we'll all just come together.
[1:47:38.900 --> 1:47:44.900]  We'll all cut what? Obviously, I could sell out the globalist and live in a $50 million house, Joe.
[1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:45.900]  Not an $18 million.
[1:47:45.900 --> 1:47:47.900]  And I'm not even saying Joe's a bad guy.
[1:47:47.900 --> 1:47:57.900]  But my God, man, I sit here and I report the reality and Bill Gates is developing an MIT and under the skin injection with the vaccine to track everything you do.
[1:47:57.900 --> 1:48:07.900]  Then they come out and say, Jones is crazy. It doesn't exist. I have the MIT scientist on video and the grants. I have it.
[1:48:07.900 --> 1:48:11.900]  It's just like when they're sitting there saying, oh, there's no evidence of fraud.
[1:48:11.900 --> 1:48:19.900]  No, you just have the entire chain of fraud in Georgia all caught on a video camera.
[1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:23.900]  Sorry, I haven't gotten to page five or six yet. Let's go to those. Sorry.
[1:48:23.900 --> 1:48:28.900]  Oh, it just gets better.
[1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:31.900]  They go on and just beg them to do something and point out how dangerous this is.
[1:48:31.900 --> 1:48:33.900]  And it's a crime against humanity.
[1:48:33.900 --> 1:48:35.900]  And it totally is.
[1:48:35.900 --> 1:48:51.900]  Now the Pfizer bio mRNA vaccine with 70% of people will again attack the placenta if you're having an auto immune response or the production of these.
[1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:56.900]  Passive antibodies or non passive antibodies.
[1:48:56.900 --> 1:49:01.900]  You really want to go read point six on page five.
[1:49:01.900 --> 1:49:08.900]  And then you're not just reading this from one of the chief medical officers in the EU.
[1:49:08.900 --> 1:49:12.900]  Who's highly respected.
[1:49:12.900 --> 1:49:15.900]  We've got the actual paper here.
[1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:25.900]  External peer review to the RT PCR and it just goes through every exhibit with links to all these mainline studies and even EU findings that the PCR test is a fraud.
[1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:36.900]  And that this thing's cost sterilization in similar studies of UN studies they did with similar vaccines for the admitted purpose of sterilization.
[1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:38.900]  Again, how do you think Wolf came?
[1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:45.900]  Wudar, Dr. Wudar knew to go look this up. He already goes and knows there's a UN sterilization operation.
[1:49:45.900 --> 1:49:47.900]  So then he goes and studies their admitted vaccines are developing.
[1:49:47.900 --> 1:49:50.900]  He's like, holy hell, it attacks the same protein.
[1:49:50.900 --> 1:49:52.900]  They're claiming this is for the SARS family.
[1:49:52.900 --> 1:49:56.900]  It's not the target is the woman's uterus.
[1:49:56.900 --> 1:50:05.900]  When it produces that protein, which is fast growing like a virus to grow those tentacles out and grab that zygote and go mind.
[1:50:05.900 --> 1:50:08.900]  Mama shoots those out.
[1:50:08.900 --> 1:50:11.900]  And it's going to hit that and stop that right there deadness tracks.
[1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:22.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, talk about satanic, your body reaching out lovingly to that zygote, that baby, your genetics, all your ancestors, your husband's ancestors, all of you in this magic moment.
[1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:26.900]  And they're like Darth Vader going, no, and just slicing through it.
[1:50:26.900 --> 1:50:28.900]  God, that's satanic.
[1:50:28.900 --> 1:50:31.900]  And if you let him do it, you deserve it.
[1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:35.900]  But I'm putting Bill Gates of the New World Order and all of them on notice.
[1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:40.900]  You don't have a right to do this to me and your 5G and your GMO and you're assaulting me.
[1:50:40.900 --> 1:50:46.900]  And all I'm saying is you're assaulting everybody on earth and your enemies of humanity.
[1:50:46.900 --> 1:50:48.900]  You're committing crimes against humanity.
[1:50:48.900 --> 1:50:57.900]  And I pray to God Almighty, the name of his son, Jesus Christ, that you be visited with an awakening or that God stop you.
[1:50:57.900 --> 1:51:02.900]  However, God sees fit and it's in God's hands, but we must call on God.
[1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:09.900]  We must call on God to visit whatever angel God sees fit upon these people.
[1:51:09.900 --> 1:51:14.900]  Or you can sit there and you can take it because I've even gotten into all the U.N. vaccines when they admit sterilized people.
[1:51:14.900 --> 1:51:16.900]  You understand?
[1:51:16.900 --> 1:51:18.900]  And by the way, the global threat mean all the stuff.
[1:51:18.900 --> 1:51:20.900]  That means nothing to me, nothing.
[1:51:20.900 --> 1:51:22.900]  I just thank God every morning.
[1:51:22.900 --> 1:51:26.900]  I'm not you because you're the ones that ought to be afraid because God of the universe.
[1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.900]  Hates your degenerate ass for playing God.
[1:51:29.900 --> 1:51:32.900]  You little slimy monsters that would destroy free will.
[1:51:32.900 --> 1:51:58.900]  You will be destroyed, not us.
[1:51:58.900 --> 1:52:03.900]  Now, this is undoubtedly the biggest sales of the year.
[1:52:03.900 --> 1:52:05.900]  It's been a year full of sales because the country's in an emergency, the economy's breaking down.
[1:52:05.900 --> 1:52:11.900]  But I want you to get your ultimate fish oil, your ultimate turmeric bodies formula, your DNA Force Plus, your X2, your X3, your Ultra 12.
[1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:15.900]  I want you to get back in stock after being sold out for a year with the COVID shutdown.
[1:52:15.900 --> 1:52:17.900]  We couldn't get it out of the power.
[1:52:17.900 --> 1:52:18.900]  It's all there discounted.
[1:52:18.900 --> 1:52:24.900]  And with promo code PATRIOT at checkout, you get an additional 10% off with the free shipping, everything else.
[1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:29.900]  Check advantage of it now at infowarstore.com with promo code PATRIOT at checkout.
[1:52:29.900 --> 1:52:58.900]  That's promo code PATRIOT at checkout at infowarstore.com and it funds the info war.
[1:52:58.900 --> 1:53:06.900]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:08.900]  That's why they hate info wars.
[1:53:08.900 --> 1:53:09.900]  We believe in humanity.
[1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:10.900]  We think you're beautiful.
[1:53:10.900 --> 1:53:11.900]  We think you're amazing.
[1:53:11.900 --> 1:53:17.900]  Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[1:53:17.900 --> 1:53:20.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[1:53:20.900 --> 1:53:21.900]  It's now upon us.
[1:53:21.900 --> 1:53:27.900]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever, when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[1:53:27.900 --> 1:53:29.900]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[1:53:29.900 --> 1:53:30.900]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[1:53:30.900 --> 1:53:33.900]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[1:53:33.900 --> 1:53:40.900]  Because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:47.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:47.900 --> 1:53:57.900]  If you think it's bad to shut down a business around the country, what happened at Staten Island?
[1:53:57.900 --> 1:54:06.900]  We've got the inside baseball in chapter two and three of what happened when the private mafia thugs of Cuomo went into that business and they attacked the man that stood up to them and what happened.
[1:54:06.900 --> 1:54:09.900]  You're going to see the exclusive footage and a lot more coming up.
[1:54:09.900 --> 1:54:16.900]  But let's get our guests on the line right now from Staten Island and what's happened there.
[1:54:16.900 --> 1:54:23.900]  Joseph Canidso, let's go ahead and play a few clips of what Trump had to say in Georgia that the media is trying to suppress.
[1:54:23.900 --> 1:54:30.900]  So we know the Democrats are planning to cheat and we can't let them do it again.
[1:54:30.900 --> 1:54:33.900]  And we're going to pull ours out one way or the other.
[1:54:33.900 --> 1:54:39.900]  But we have to be vigilant because I don't want these two to work like I, you know, I thought we were going to easily win.
[1:54:39.900 --> 1:54:48.900]  And that maybe for the first time in a long time, I'd go take a nice little vacation for about two days and then we go back.
[1:54:48.900 --> 1:55:00.900]  And instead I probably worked harder in the last three weeks that I've ever worked in my life doing this.
[1:55:00.900 --> 1:55:06.900]  A friend of mine said, oh, don't worry about it, sir. You're way up in the polls. You'll win in 2024.
[1:55:06.900 --> 1:55:10.900]  I don't want to wait till 2024. I want to go back three weeks.
[1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:17.900]  Our fight to drain the Washington swap and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[1:55:17.900 --> 1:55:22.900]  We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in.
[1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:31.900]  We will never give up and we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender.
[1:55:31.900 --> 1:55:57.900]  Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.
[1:55:57.900 --> 1:56:06.900]  You see the money these people have raised? I mean, it's really, it's very, well, of course, I just raised $250 million.
[1:56:06.900 --> 1:56:14.900]  I didn't raise it. I said, how are we doing in that front? You know, because we didn't get great publicity.
[1:56:14.900 --> 1:56:23.900]  Boy, they were so happy, these guys. You might not be happy in a few weeks. You know, you might not.
[1:56:23.900 --> 1:56:33.900]  No, they were so happy. And you know this and you see it, but they're trying to take it from us through rigging fraud, deception and deceit.
[1:56:33.900 --> 1:56:39.900]  That's what we saw in the election. That's what's going on and it's happening right now in our country.
[1:56:39.900 --> 1:56:44.900]  And we will do something about it and we're going to do something about it quickly.
[1:56:44.900 --> 1:56:53.900]  No, we continue to fight. We've had some great moments. We just need somebody with courage to do what they have to do.
[1:56:53.900 --> 1:57:01.900]  Because everyone knows it's wrong. We need somebody with courage, somebody that makes decisions and we'll be going up to the Supreme Court very shortly.
[1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:14.900]  And we really, if we have courage and wisdom, I think you know what the answer is going to be.
[1:57:14.900 --> 1:57:17.900]  Because you can't let people get away with what they got away with.
[1:57:17.900 --> 1:57:34.900]  Think of it, with over 74 million votes over, think of that, more than, I got more votes than any sitting president in history, 11 million more votes than we got in 2016.
[1:57:34.900 --> 1:57:39.900]  And we thought that if we could get 68 million, 67 million, that would be the end.
[1:57:39.900 --> 1:57:52.900]  All of our great brilliant geniuses said, you'd win if you get 67 or 68, it's over. We got 74 million plus and they're trying to convince us that we lost. We didn't lose.
[1:57:52.900 --> 1:57:59.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:57:59.900 --> 1:58:23.900]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened. Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[1:58:23.900 --> 1:58:29.900]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:58:29.900 --> 1:58:45.900]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:58:45.900 --> 1:58:57.900]  Back in 1996, the head of the world food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns due to a virus care to bring in world government.
[1:58:57.900 --> 1:59:04.900]  That also came out in the North American Union documents that judicial watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well.
[1:59:04.900 --> 1:59:12.900]  So we know they're playing and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions.
[1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:16.900]  Millions have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[1:59:16.900 --> 1:59:21.900]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared all over the world.
[1:59:21.900 --> 1:59:27.900]  But we have high quality, trouble food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare with Alex.com.
[1:59:27.900 --> 1:59:31.900]  There's an additional 10% off a very rare sale is going right now.

[1:59:45.900 --> 2:00:14.900]  God bless.
[2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:21.900]  Well, you got a lot of attention in Staten Island, New York.
[2:00:21.900 --> 2:00:23.900]  We're going to be breaking it down.
[2:00:23.900 --> 2:00:28.900]  Right now, a business owner ran into some serious situations.
[2:00:28.900 --> 2:00:37.900]  Danny Prezzi at his bar, Max, and the police came in and arrested him once.
[2:00:37.900 --> 2:00:39.900]  Well, now they arrested him again.
[2:00:39.900 --> 2:00:47.900]  It wasn't the local police that told us the sheriff's department, they're kind of the goons of the governor and of the mayor.
[2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:49.900]  Because, hey, he's not Walmart.
[2:00:49.900 --> 2:00:51.900]  He's not Costco.
[2:00:51.900 --> 2:00:53.900]  You know, he's not Disney World.
[2:00:53.900 --> 2:00:54.900]  He's not essential.
[2:00:54.900 --> 2:00:56.900]  So he's got to go out of business.
[2:00:56.900 --> 2:01:08.900]  Well, the answer with this type of thuggish behavior, in my view, is have all the businesses reopened and stop complying with this crap that, again, is all based on overblown fraud.
[2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:11.900]  But Joseph Kanitso is a good friend of his.
[2:01:11.900 --> 2:01:16.900]  He owns a local jiu-jitsu dojo or training facility there.
[2:01:16.900 --> 2:01:19.900]  They're friends.
[2:01:19.900 --> 2:01:22.900]  Danny can't come on right now because of what happened this weekend.
[2:01:22.900 --> 2:01:30.900]  Nobody knows about what happened where they actually had a mob of thugs try to attack him and then the police or the sheriff's department arrested him.
[2:01:30.900 --> 2:01:35.900]  We got some exclusive footage of what actually happened inside when Danny got arrested and more.
[2:01:35.900 --> 2:01:40.900]  So Joseph is the head instructor at Staten Island, jiu-jitsu dojo.
[2:01:40.900 --> 2:01:44.900]  And he is here to talk about what they're facing, what they're dealing with, what it's like.
[2:01:44.900 --> 2:01:45.900]  I've seen the videos.
[2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:47.900]  I've talked to folks that live in New York.
[2:01:47.900 --> 2:01:49.900]  They say everybody's basically going bankrupt.
[2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:52.900]  It's a ghost town unless you're a big chain store or whatever.
[2:01:52.900 --> 2:01:57.900]  So get into what really happened, the big picture for people across the country.
[2:01:57.900 --> 2:01:59.900]  And what happened this weekend?
[2:01:59.900 --> 2:02:00.900]  For sure.
[2:02:00.900 --> 2:02:03.900]  Alex, first, I just want to thank you for having me on your show.
[2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:06.900]  Things have been pretty crazy over here.
[2:02:06.900 --> 2:02:12.900]  As business owners, we're doing everything that we can to try to comply with the ever-changing mandates in the state.
[2:02:12.900 --> 2:02:18.900]  But we've been basically left out to starve from that federal government.
[2:02:18.900 --> 2:02:26.900]  And we'll put it with our backs against the wall in a position where we need emergency money because we can't wait anymore or we have no choice but to open up our businesses.
[2:02:26.900 --> 2:02:29.900]  It has to be one or the other and they can't have it both ways.
[2:02:29.900 --> 2:02:40.900]  You could go to the Staten Island Mall right now and people have tested back waiting at retail stores to buy big ticket items.
[2:02:40.900 --> 2:02:42.900]  But small business owners were starving.
[2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:50.900]  And I think that there's a big movement to suppress our speech and what we're trying to do.
[2:02:50.900 --> 2:02:52.900]  The news is not publicizing it.
[2:02:52.900 --> 2:02:55.900]  The mainstream media is not publicizing it the way that it should be.
[2:02:55.900 --> 2:03:00.900]  Because this small business is all across the country that are not only just desperate and then shambles.
[2:03:00.900 --> 2:03:10.900]  And I mean, if this continues to go on the way that it is, all you're going to have is a big box stores left over and the small businesses are not going to be able to come back.
[2:03:10.900 --> 2:03:13.900]  Well, we know that Jeff Bezos has doubled his money.
[2:03:13.900 --> 2:03:21.900]  All the other big tech companies have made record profits because they basically wrote the rules internationally where they're essential.
[2:03:21.900 --> 2:03:22.900]  We're not.
[2:03:22.900 --> 2:03:25.900]  I went and tried to look at the bailout money and they said, no, you're not eligible.
[2:03:25.900 --> 2:03:28.900]  I don't even want bailout money, but I wanted to see if we could get it.
[2:03:28.900 --> 2:03:29.900]  Surprise, surprise.
[2:03:29.900 --> 2:03:30.900]  We couldn't.
[2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:33.900]  And so most people got less than they were told or nothing.
[2:03:33.900 --> 2:03:34.900]  Now there's nothing there.
[2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:38.900]  You can't tell somebody, hey, we're taking your land without paying you for it.
[2:03:38.900 --> 2:03:41.900]  You can't tell somebody, hey, your business is not essential.
[2:03:41.900 --> 2:03:45.900]  Well, like you said down the street, the Staten Island Mall is just full of people.
[2:03:45.900 --> 2:03:46.900]  This is sick.
[2:03:46.900 --> 2:03:47.900]  It's cynical.
[2:03:47.900 --> 2:03:48.900]  It's all right out of the Davos group.
[2:03:48.900 --> 2:03:50.900]  I think it's time for folks to stand up.
[2:03:50.900 --> 2:03:52.900]  Describe what happened.
[2:03:52.900 --> 2:04:04.900]  And when you talk about what we're also this exclusive video, when they actually arrested your friend the first time and now what's coming out of this and the incredible thing that happened this weekend, absolutely out of control.
[2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:07.900]  Tell us about Danny Presti.
[2:04:07.900 --> 2:04:10.900]  Okay, Danny decided to open up his bar.
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:12.900]  His bar is listed in an orange zone.
[2:04:12.900 --> 2:04:15.900]  Staten Island is only, I believe it's 13 by seven miles.
[2:04:15.900 --> 2:04:19.900]  It's very small, but they split it in half and one half is an orange zone and one half isn't.
[2:04:19.900 --> 2:04:29.900]  So if two blocks away, you can go in and sit down and eat a hamburger and have a beer, but in his location, you're not allowed to do that.
[2:04:29.900 --> 2:04:34.900]  So with his back against the wall, because he has no money, he has an autistic kid at home.
[2:04:34.900 --> 2:04:37.900]  He's doing trying to do everything he can to support his family.
[2:04:37.900 --> 2:04:38.900]  He decided to open.
[2:04:38.900 --> 2:04:41.900]  He opened up and he was arrested by sheriffs.
[2:04:41.900 --> 2:04:46.900]  After the arrest, there was a little bit of a dialogue between the sheriffs and himself.
[2:04:46.900 --> 2:04:57.900]  And he decided that he was going to open again and he did it with some mainstream media broadcasting from within the location.
[2:04:57.900 --> 2:05:05.900]  So I guess the sheriffs didn't decide to go in at that moment and arrest everyone that was in there, including him and the patrons and the news.
[2:05:05.900 --> 2:05:08.900]  So they waited for him.
[2:05:08.900 --> 2:05:16.900]  I think it was last night to leave the night before last, perhaps, to leave the bar.
[2:05:16.900 --> 2:05:21.900]  And then I guess there was some events that led to him and being arrested.
[2:05:21.900 --> 2:05:24.900]  That's pretty much it.
[2:05:24.900 --> 2:05:30.900]  And then there's the whole vigilante angle of this where they came and attacked him outside at his car and then he got arrested.
[2:05:30.900 --> 2:05:36.900]  We'll cover that next segment, but let's show this exclusive video of you guys inside at Max Bar and Grill.
[2:05:36.900 --> 2:05:46.900]  It's a nice place and there are people throwing bottles and attacking the doors that you're open, but they're out in a group and churches are closed, but the airlines are open.
[2:05:46.900 --> 2:05:48.900]  I mean, this tells us everything we need to know.
[2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:52.900]  This is a big corporate takeover and Klaus Schwab admits it's a vertical takeover.
[2:05:52.900 --> 2:05:54.900]  They admit it's a fraud.
[2:05:54.900 --> 2:05:56.900]  This is modern war, folks.
[2:05:56.900 --> 2:06:01.900]  But what's really crazy is how vicious they turn the citizens into.
[2:06:01.900 --> 2:06:04.900]  Here it is.
[2:06:04.900 --> 2:06:06.900]  We're in Max right now.
[2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:17.900]  Smashing bottles of beer all over the door.
[2:06:17.900 --> 2:06:19.900]  I should call 911.
[2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:34.900]  They're the Irish who died in the potato famine because you choose a new British loyalist and on and on and on.
[2:06:34.900 --> 2:06:40.900]  So this is the total mental illness of people wanting to come attack a small business because they've been told they can't.
[2:06:40.900 --> 2:06:41.900]  They've been waiting.
[2:06:41.900 --> 2:06:43.900]  The same number of folks that rounded up Jews in Nazi Germany.
[2:06:43.900 --> 2:06:47.900]  Same type of KKK that would attack black people when it was cool to do it.
[2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:50.900]  They're just waiting for an excuse to come attack.
[2:06:50.900 --> 2:06:51.900]  Let's play a clip of this.
[2:06:51.900 --> 2:06:55.900]  This is an Oregon teacher and they're having an anti lockdown demonstration.
[2:06:55.900 --> 2:07:00.900]  She pulls up, pulls down her mask, screams, yells, says, I hope you kill yourself.
[2:07:00.900 --> 2:07:01.900]  I hope you die.
[2:07:01.900 --> 2:07:03.900]  I'm a school teacher because she's a hero.
[2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:04.900]  You're not.
[2:07:04.900 --> 2:07:05.900]  Here it is.
[2:07:05.900 --> 2:07:28.900]  I am a teacher.
[2:07:28.900 --> 2:07:29.900]  I am a teacher.
[2:07:29.900 --> 2:07:41.900]  I am a teacher.
[2:07:41.900 --> 2:07:42.900]  So she's the hero.
[2:07:42.900 --> 2:07:43.900]  She's good.
[2:07:43.900 --> 2:07:44.900]  She's wonderful.
[2:07:44.900 --> 2:07:45.900]  She's a school teacher.
[2:07:45.900 --> 2:07:48.900]  Your children belong to her.
[2:07:48.900 --> 2:07:53.900]  Joseph, you've got your business.
[2:07:53.900 --> 2:07:55.900]  Danny Presti has his.
[2:07:55.900 --> 2:07:59.900]  Looking at these crazed moms, looking at men beat up women in stores not wearing masks.
[2:07:59.900 --> 2:08:01.900]  Where do you think this is going next?
[2:08:01.900 --> 2:08:08.900]  I'll say there was a very, very peaceful protest at max a couple of nights ago.
[2:08:08.900 --> 2:08:12.900]  There was so much support from the community that came.
[2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:13.900]  So many business owners.
[2:08:13.900 --> 2:08:15.900]  There were African Americans.
[2:08:15.900 --> 2:08:18.900]  There were a Hasidic Jews there that spoke.
[2:08:18.900 --> 2:08:24.900]  We all the entire standout community came together to speak about what's happening to our businesses.
[2:08:24.900 --> 2:08:26.900]  The mainstream media covered it.
[2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:38.900]  And they started, they started saying that there were extremist right groups that were there and that all these wild fanatics are endorsing his cause and that he's aligned with these wild fanatical groups.
[2:08:38.900 --> 2:08:45.900]  So then as a response to that, you get crazy other fanatical groups that are coming in and doing all this wild erratic behavior.
[2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:47.900]  Oh, this is political warfare.
[2:08:47.900 --> 2:08:51.900]  You know, I will come to max public house for folks don't know what that means.
[2:08:51.900 --> 2:08:53.900]  He may not even know what the history of it means.
[2:08:53.900 --> 2:08:55.900]  Most restaurants were private clubs in England.
[2:08:55.900 --> 2:08:58.900]  That's a very revolutionary American type deal.
[2:08:58.900 --> 2:09:03.900]  George Washington didn't like the fact you had to be a member of a club or part of the British aristocracy to be able to get into most restaurants.
[2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:07.900]  So usually a place called a public's house means this is a place for commoners.
[2:09:07.900 --> 2:09:10.900]  Is that what he meant by the name?
[2:09:10.900 --> 2:09:17.900]  I'm not exactly sure what he meant with the name, but he's never asked any specific group to come to his bar.
[2:09:17.900 --> 2:09:19.900]  He loves everyone equally, you know, as do I.
[2:09:19.900 --> 2:09:25.900]  That's what I'm saying is that name is like the original libertarian thing people didn't know that used to like established restaurants.
[2:09:25.900 --> 2:09:30.900]  Taverns on the road were different. Everybody could go to those, but a public's house meant everybody's welcome.
[2:09:30.900 --> 2:09:32.900]  You know, commoners, you name it.
[2:09:32.900 --> 2:09:34.900]  So that's that's that's great.
[2:09:34.900 --> 2:09:35.900]  I want to come there.
[2:09:35.900 --> 2:09:38.900]  We ought to have a demonstration there because I'm telling you, you guys are the front line of the fight.
[2:09:38.900 --> 2:09:44.900]  Let's come back and talk about the latest thing happened this weekend is getting really no attention when the mafia showed up from the governors.
[2:09:44.900 --> 2:09:51.900]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands.
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:55.900]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you think it was magic.
[2:09:55.900 --> 2:09:59.900]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:03.900]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit.
[2:10:03.900 --> 2:10:08.900]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and any other species of animal,
[2:10:08.900 --> 2:10:14.900]  know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born. They're following magnetic lines.
[2:10:14.900 --> 2:10:16.900]  They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[2:10:16.900 --> 2:10:19.900]  We don't know what's going on. There's even a lot more than that.
[2:10:19.900 --> 2:10:23.900]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[2:10:23.900 --> 2:10:25.900]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[2:10:25.900 --> 2:10:29.900]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system,
[2:10:29.900 --> 2:10:34.900]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people.
[2:10:34.900 --> 2:10:38.900]  And that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it
[2:10:38.900 --> 2:10:43.900]  because it is a consciousness manipulated in the space-time continuum.
[2:10:43.900 --> 2:10:50.900]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year 2021.
[2:10:50.900 --> 2:10:55.900]  I'm Alex Jones. I started in full wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[2:10:55.900 --> 2:11:00.900]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet
[2:11:00.900 --> 2:11:03.900]  is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on.
[2:11:03.900 --> 2:11:07.900]  That's why it's so important for those of you out there that have supported the broadcast
[2:11:07.900 --> 2:11:11.900]  and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out
[2:11:11.900 --> 2:11:14.900]  to realize how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.
[2:11:14.900 --> 2:11:16.900]  It's my solution, I thank you.

[2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:23.900]  Well, we appreciate Joseph Canidso from Staten Island,
[2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:27.900]  right there in the birthplace of America, George Washington, the big battles, everything,
[2:12:27.900 --> 2:12:30.900]  joining us here in this fight.
[2:12:30.900 --> 2:12:34.900]  The bad news is the globalists are powerful, they've got control of the money.
[2:12:34.900 --> 2:12:37.900]  The good news is humanity's awake and what they're doing is totally illegal.
[2:12:37.900 --> 2:12:41.900]  This is a corporate takeover, the Deimos Global Reset, they claim it's for the people,
[2:12:41.900 --> 2:12:44.900]  it's to consolidate power, it's to bankrupt the middle class,
[2:12:44.900 --> 2:12:47.900]  it's to create a giant subclass, they control their own words.
[2:12:47.900 --> 2:12:52.900]  So when you look at this and go, this is horrible, this isn't reasonable, this is evil, it is.
[2:12:52.900 --> 2:12:57.900]  And it's about getting blue states and blue cities and communists and socials controlled areas,
[2:12:57.900 --> 2:13:04.900]  Germany, Australia, everywhere to absolutely lock people up and train us to be slaves.
[2:13:04.900 --> 2:13:10.900]  And so Joseph's one of the head guys and co-owners there at the local jujitsu place,
[2:13:10.900 --> 2:13:16.900]  he's friends with the man that's now been arrested for a second time, Danny Pretzi,
[2:13:16.900 --> 2:13:21.900]  for simply opening his business and saying, I'm essential, I have rights,
[2:13:21.900 --> 2:13:24.900]  just like Rosa Parks said, I'm not sitting at the back of the bus, my feet are tired,
[2:13:24.900 --> 2:13:27.900]  I'm sitting wherever I want, I'm as good as anybody else on this bus.
[2:13:27.900 --> 2:13:32.900]  I'm as good as Target or Walmart, I'm as good as the local Staten Island Mall,
[2:13:32.900 --> 2:13:37.900]  the Steamed Essential, or I'm as good as Governor Newsom's Restaurants and Wineries
[2:13:37.900 --> 2:13:39.900]  he owns that stayed open.
[2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:45.900]  This is sick, but I'm as good as Mayor Lightfoot that says she can go get her haircut
[2:13:45.900 --> 2:13:47.900]  because she said, I'm important.
[2:13:47.900 --> 2:13:50.900]  I mean, these people are really pushing it.
[2:13:50.900 --> 2:13:58.900]  They're not tone deaf, they've been told do this and get us used to the fact we're second class citizens.
[2:13:58.900 --> 2:14:01.900]  So tell us and we'll show some of the video while you talk about it,
[2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:06.900]  what happened to Danny Pretzi this weekend, where now that he's become, you know, a leader,
[2:14:06.900 --> 2:14:09.900]  one arrest wasn't enough, boy, they're trying to set him up,
[2:14:09.900 --> 2:14:13.900]  they sent him out to beat him up, then special group working with the governor, I'm told,
[2:14:13.900 --> 2:14:17.900]  from my sources, I haven't talked to you yet, I came to arrest him and now,
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:20.900]  now they're telling him don't even talk, he's unbelievable, go on the air at this point,
[2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:24.900]  faces some type of bigger charge, we saw the Proud Boys got attacked by Antifa,
[2:14:24.900 --> 2:14:27.900]  they were sent to jail for five years apiece, last time I checked.
[2:14:27.900 --> 2:14:31.900]  So talk about what you're dealing with and the next level,
[2:14:31.900 --> 2:14:36.900]  recrimination for saying I'm essential too.
[2:14:36.900 --> 2:14:41.900]  Alex, the Amazon train is driving through your town on the wood and steel salvage
[2:14:41.900 --> 2:14:44.900]  from the shambles of bankrupt small businesses in America.
[2:14:44.900 --> 2:14:47.900]  It's fueled by COVID and the conductor is our government asleep at the wheel.
[2:14:47.900 --> 2:14:53.900]  We really need to get everyone in this country to understand that if we don't start doing things now,
[2:14:53.900 --> 2:14:57.900]  there's going to be only a handful of stores that we're going to be able to shop at.
[2:14:57.900 --> 2:15:02.900]  One will be Walmart, Amazon, maybe our kids and grandkids won't know
[2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:06.900]  what it's like to walk into a bakery and buy a cookie or go to a mom and pop shop.
[2:15:06.900 --> 2:15:12.900]  Danny's been doing great things, I've been trying to help out as much as I can
[2:15:12.900 --> 2:15:18.900]  because I truly feel like the mass media is not publicizing the struggles of small businesses throughout this country.
[2:15:18.900 --> 2:15:23.900]  I've read statistics that more than 30% of small businesses have closed.
[2:15:23.900 --> 2:15:28.900]  My martial arts school has been on Staten Island since 1962.
[2:15:28.900 --> 2:15:32.900]  I've been fighting tooth and nail to try to survive and I've only lasted this long
[2:15:32.900 --> 2:15:37.900]  just through the support of the community that I've been servicing and my students.
[2:15:37.900 --> 2:15:40.900]  Danny is doing everything that he can.
[2:15:40.900 --> 2:15:46.900]  He's been getting nine out of ten calls on the phone are very supportive.
[2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:50.900]  Let's be clear though, the globalists are really trying to hold you underwater
[2:15:50.900 --> 2:15:55.900]  and folks in places like Texas or North Dakota or South Dakota where we're still somewhat free,
[2:15:55.900 --> 2:15:57.900]  we don't get how desperate it is.
[2:15:57.900 --> 2:15:59.900]  You are under savage attack.
[2:15:59.900 --> 2:16:02.900]  This makes me never want to shop at a big box store again.
[2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:04.900]  In fact, I've told my crew and I still see it show up here.
[2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:08.900]  No more Amazon, man, because they are orchestrating this whole damn thing.
[2:16:08.900 --> 2:16:10.900]  It's sick.
[2:16:10.900 --> 2:16:12.900]  I hope your viewers also do realize that.
[2:16:12.900 --> 2:16:16.900]  I know it's difficult because Amazon gets everything to your house quickly,
[2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:18.900]  but where you spend your money is important.
[2:16:18.900 --> 2:16:22.900]  It could be driven into a young child's tuition.
[2:16:22.900 --> 2:16:27.900]  It'd be like if Hitler was dropping bombs on London and you're buying your shoes from Hitler.
[2:16:27.900 --> 2:16:31.900]  Imagine Hitler's dropping bombs on your town, shutting down your businesses,
[2:16:31.900 --> 2:16:35.900]  but you're buying, you're putting your money in Hitler's bank.
[2:16:35.900 --> 2:16:38.900]  Why would you do that? I'm serious.
[2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:40.900]  Keep going, sorry.
[2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:45.900]  All I could say is that the unfortunate events that happened with Danny recently,
[2:16:45.900 --> 2:16:48.900]  he has a great criminal defense attorney.
[2:16:48.900 --> 2:16:52.900]  He was in and out of jail in under 24 hours.
[2:16:52.900 --> 2:16:54.900]  Tell folks what happened.
[2:16:54.900 --> 2:16:57.900]  A mob showed up to attack him and then he got arrested.
[2:16:57.900 --> 2:16:59.900]  Tell me what happened.
[2:16:59.900 --> 2:17:03.900]  Well, from what his attorney has said publicly,
[2:17:03.900 --> 2:17:08.900]  is that he left the bar, walked up the street,
[2:17:08.900 --> 2:17:14.900]  made a turn, and then two people jumped out from behind a car and said,
[2:17:14.900 --> 2:17:17.900]  hey, Presti, and started running towards him.
[2:17:17.900 --> 2:17:22.900]  And then after that, I don't have the details of the specifics of it.
[2:17:22.900 --> 2:17:26.900]  But like I said, he's a friend of mine.
[2:17:26.900 --> 2:17:30.900]  Anytime that the sheriffs have ever tried to detain him or speak to him or even arrest him,
[2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:32.900]  he's willfully complied.
[2:17:32.900 --> 2:17:35.900]  I think it's a very dangerous situation for him right now.
[2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:41.900]  And I'm sure he's acting in self-defense.
[2:17:41.900 --> 2:17:44.900]  Now, I'm told this wasn't the local police, the New York police.
[2:17:44.900 --> 2:17:46.900]  Or am I incorrect?
[2:17:46.900 --> 2:17:50.900]  This was a special group controlled by the governor through the county.
[2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:54.900]  Well, in New York, we don't have sheriffs the way that they are in other counties throughout America.
[2:17:54.900 --> 2:18:02.900]  They usually handle health code violations or miscellaneous matters.
[2:18:02.900 --> 2:18:05.900]  These are regulators.
[2:18:05.900 --> 2:18:08.900]  Well, there's considered sheriffs.
[2:18:08.900 --> 2:18:10.900]  They're considered New York sheriffs.
[2:18:10.900 --> 2:18:14.900]  But they are appointed by the mayor.
[2:18:14.900 --> 2:18:17.900]  So that's basically how this is set up from what I know.
[2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:20.900]  Okay, so I was reading online the governor was involved too, but obviously it was the communist mayor.
[2:18:20.900 --> 2:18:25.900]  So communist mayor sent his handpicked thugs.
[2:18:25.900 --> 2:18:29.900]  Well, like I said,
[2:18:29.900 --> 2:18:33.900]  I try not to say too much.
[2:18:33.900 --> 2:18:38.900]  I'd like to just advocate for the small businesses, advocate for our cause.
[2:18:38.900 --> 2:18:43.900]  I know people are very frustrated with the mayor and the governor and our state for a lot of different reasons.
[2:18:43.900 --> 2:18:47.900]  You know, one of them was there was some federal unemployment that came through.
[2:18:47.900 --> 2:18:51.900]  And the mayor, I'm sorry, the governor didn't want to throw in an extra $100 for everybody.
[2:18:51.900 --> 2:18:54.900]  So, you know, there's a lot of different things going on.
[2:18:54.900 --> 2:19:00.900]  You know, Pelosi blocked Trump's aid package. They're all monsters.
[2:19:00.900 --> 2:19:05.900]  Well, in the end of the day, it comes down to the small business and the person who's sitting home.
[2:19:05.900 --> 2:19:08.900]  And if you don't work for a big corporation and you've been self-employed,
[2:19:08.900 --> 2:19:12.900]  or maybe you've been a server at a restaurant, or maybe you've been a bartender,
[2:19:12.900 --> 2:19:16.900]  or maybe you're an artist, or maybe you're a musician, or maybe you have a martial art school,
[2:19:16.900 --> 2:19:19.900]  you can't feed yourself.
[2:19:19.900 --> 2:19:21.900]  Well, Joseph, let's remember this.
[2:19:21.900 --> 2:19:26.900]  We were told, get rid of our industrial, get rid of our farms, be service people. We did.
[2:19:26.900 --> 2:19:29.900]  And now they're taking our service economy away saying we're not essential.
[2:19:29.900 --> 2:19:35.900]  I mean, they're telling you you're not essential, brother. You are essential. Screw them.
[2:19:35.900 --> 2:19:40.900]  Every day it's just getting hotter and hotter to try to continue on. I'll be perfectly honest with you.
[2:19:40.900 --> 2:19:46.900]  I get messages from other business owners every single day saying that we're, you know...
[2:19:46.900 --> 2:19:51.900]  You can't give up. You're going to wake up homeless on the continent. You're forbearers of Congress. I know it's tough.
[2:19:51.900 --> 2:19:56.900]  Everybody, listen, I'm calling for this. I mean this now. We can only support local businesses now.
[2:19:56.900 --> 2:20:00.900]  I tell my crew, I tell my wife, I say you order directly from where you're ordering the clothes,
[2:20:00.900 --> 2:20:03.900]  or where you're directly going to order food online. Go get it from a small place.
[2:20:03.900 --> 2:20:06.900]  There's a little grocery store with these Indians down the street from me.
[2:20:06.900 --> 2:20:09.900]  It's got a big selection, small grocery store from India.
[2:20:09.900 --> 2:20:13.900]  They're listeners. I go to their place. Stuff costs 20% more, but it's even better.
[2:20:13.900 --> 2:20:17.900]  More and more, I am not going to spend money with the big system. I'm not doing it.
[2:20:17.900 --> 2:20:21.900]  Yeah, I mean they have, you know, it's two sets of rules.
[2:20:21.900 --> 2:20:24.900]  You know, if we're all created equal, start treating us that way.
[2:20:24.900 --> 2:20:28.900]  You know, it's hard enough to run a small business, especially in New York City, with all the city tax, state tax, federal tax...
[2:20:28.900 --> 2:20:31.900]  They're absolutely right. Let's talk about... I want you to vent. I want you to rage on them
[2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:33.900]  and play some clips of the speeches that we're giving when we come back,
[2:20:33.900 --> 2:20:37.900]  and I want to talk about solutions straight ahead as they tell us we're not essential.
[2:20:37.900 --> 2:20:41.900]  I say the globalists are not essential. I say they should be put present.
[2:20:41.900 --> 2:20:46.900]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes,
[2:20:46.900 --> 2:20:51.900]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s,
[2:20:51.900 --> 2:20:53.900]  is all about corporate global governance.
[2:20:53.900 --> 2:20:55.900]  And now you're seeing it.
[2:20:55.900 --> 2:20:58.900]  It's not just the blue states, the blue cities, the communists and socialist nations,
[2:20:58.900 --> 2:21:03.900]  all working in unison under UN control to establish a medical planetary dictatorship.
[2:21:03.900 --> 2:21:07.900]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations,
[2:21:07.900 --> 2:21:11.900]  themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families,
[2:21:11.900 --> 2:21:16.900]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[2:21:16.900 --> 2:21:20.900]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time,
[2:21:20.900 --> 2:21:27.900]  but they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[2:21:27.900 --> 2:21:31.900]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[2:21:31.900 --> 2:21:33.900]  They're involved in plotting the world economy,
[2:21:33.900 --> 2:21:38.900]  that's what the social distancing, the master all about, it's about bankrupting local small businesses.
[2:21:38.900 --> 2:22:04.900]  Those that comply or comply with your own instruction, wake up.
[2:22:09.900 --> 2:22:13.900]  You can normally get it at very good prices and those prices are still there.
[2:22:13.900 --> 2:22:19.900]  But an additional 10% off right now at preparewithoutlets.com on their one month,
[2:22:19.900 --> 2:22:23.900]  their three month or six month, their year and on a bunch of other great items,
[2:22:23.900 --> 2:22:30.900]  huge discounts that will be ending next Wednesday, that is December 2nd.
[2:22:30.900 --> 2:22:33.900]  So you've got this week and a little bit of next week,
[2:22:33.900 --> 2:22:35.900]  get your orders in, they're ready to ship to you right now,
[2:22:35.900 --> 2:22:38.900]  and the profit that comes in funds the info war, so the 360 win.
[2:22:38.900 --> 2:22:41.900]  You need horrible food to fight the great reset, get prepared now.
[2:22:41.900 --> 2:22:45.900]  You know something very sad is happening, it's very sad because it was all avoidable.
[2:22:45.900 --> 2:22:50.900]  Two and a half years ago an info war got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[2:22:50.900 --> 2:22:54.900]  I warn everybody that it was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election
[2:22:54.900 --> 2:22:59.900]  and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship
[2:22:59.900 --> 2:23:06.900]  until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and populists.
[2:23:06.900 --> 2:23:07.900]  And now that's happened.
[2:23:07.900 --> 2:23:11.900]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals
[2:23:11.900 --> 2:23:15.900]  that demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown
[2:23:15.900 --> 2:23:19.900]  and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19,
[2:23:19.900 --> 2:23:21.900]  especially an overblown hoax.
[2:23:21.900 --> 2:23:24.900]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign,
[2:23:24.900 --> 2:23:28.900]  but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[2:23:28.900 --> 2:23:32.900]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us.
[2:23:32.900 --> 2:23:36.900]  And they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy to try to control us.
[2:23:36.900 --> 2:24:02.900]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
[2:24:02.900 --> 2:24:08.900]  You know, I just watched footage that's at infowars.com when it was coming.
[2:24:08.900 --> 2:24:16.900]  They built a $10 million or whatever it was, mega bridge into Hong Kong the last five years, the Chinese mainland.
[2:24:16.900 --> 2:24:19.900]  Then they started cracking down and getting rid of the elective government.
[2:24:19.900 --> 2:24:22.900]  They started taking people's property and enslaving them.
[2:24:22.900 --> 2:24:26.900]  And now they're got busload after busload of people being taken away.
[2:24:26.900 --> 2:24:28.900]  COVID was all they needed.
[2:24:28.900 --> 2:24:33.900]  China forces Hong Kong political prisoners onto buses for reeducation camps,
[2:24:33.900 --> 2:24:38.900]  and their families beat and scream and beg as they're taken away.
[2:24:38.900 --> 2:24:40.900]  And of course, they'll be arrested next.
[2:24:40.900 --> 2:24:43.900]  Everyone wears their mask though, good little servants.
[2:24:43.900 --> 2:24:47.900]  And next comes the reeducation camp.
[2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:50.900]  They don't have a second amendment.
[2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:58.900]  Chen Ka-shek ran to Taiwan, others ran to Hong Kong, the brain trusted China,
[2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:03.900]  the richest area in the world per capita, the good people.
[2:25:03.900 --> 2:25:08.900]  And Xi Jinping is absorbing them, eating them up.
[2:25:08.900 --> 2:25:10.900]  Go ahead and play it with the audio in the video.
[2:25:10.900 --> 2:25:11.900]  Here it is.
[2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:22.900]  Apple runs death camps.
[2:25:22.900 --> 2:25:25.900]  And I've had leftists laughing and I think it's funny, you know, the guy,
[2:25:25.900 --> 2:25:28.900]  I got out of the armored vehicle and pulled his mask off.
[2:25:28.900 --> 2:25:29.900]  I was like, China runs death camps.
[2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:32.900]  He was laughing and saying FU and bowing up to me.
[2:25:32.900 --> 2:25:36.900]  They only got caught on tape once I got down.
[2:25:36.900 --> 2:25:37.900]  That's what the media edited.
[2:25:37.900 --> 2:25:41.900]  It was like, I just walk up to some random guy and pull his mask off.
[2:25:41.900 --> 2:25:44.900]  Oh, no, he was sitting there while I was giving a speech about China and death
[2:25:44.900 --> 2:25:48.900]  camps laughing and flipping me off and like doing like a gorilla thing,
[2:25:48.900 --> 2:25:51.900]  like this with his shoulders, like, come on down here, FU.
[2:25:51.900 --> 2:25:52.900]  Yeah.
[2:25:52.900 --> 2:25:54.900]  I'd be like, yeah, they're running death camps in China.
[2:25:54.900 --> 2:25:57.900]  They'd be like, yeah, yeah, we are.
[2:25:57.900 --> 2:25:59.900]  That's where Apple and all of them are based down there.
[2:25:59.900 --> 2:26:00.900]  We must work for Apple or Google.
[2:26:00.900 --> 2:26:01.900]  So I get out of the truck.
[2:26:01.900 --> 2:26:05.900]  I go over to him and he's all saucer.
[2:26:05.900 --> 2:26:07.900]  I'd like, yeah, dude, this is an MPC world.
[2:26:07.900 --> 2:26:10.900]  You're actually on the street with me and I pull his little, you know,
[2:26:10.900 --> 2:26:16.900]  his little mask down just to show that you're in the real world here, buddy.
[2:26:16.900 --> 2:26:17.900]  And sure, I shouldn't have done that.
[2:26:17.900 --> 2:26:22.900]  I don't normally put my hands on people, but he was putting out fight words.
[2:26:22.900 --> 2:26:23.900]  Crew didn't know I was going to go to that.
[2:26:23.900 --> 2:26:27.900]  If you guys just type in Alex Jones pulls off a mask of trendy or go to Twitter,
[2:26:27.900 --> 2:26:28.900]  type my name in.
[2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:30.900]  It's one of the top videos.
[2:26:30.900 --> 2:26:32.900]  Millions of views of it.
[2:26:32.900 --> 2:26:37.900]  But I was down there protesting the mayor Adler who got caught on a private jet
[2:26:37.900 --> 2:26:43.900]  commissioned by big tech flying down to Mexico for a party for his family for a
[2:26:43.900 --> 2:26:44.900]  wedding.
[2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:45.900]  They're not wearing masks.
[2:26:45.900 --> 2:26:49.900]  They're all posing for photos, but then he wants us to be shut down again.
[2:26:49.900 --> 2:26:50.900]  That's why I went down there.
[2:26:50.900 --> 2:26:53.900]  Yeah, let's go ahead and back this up and play it with audio if you have the time.
[2:26:53.900 --> 2:26:58.900]  Cue that up and we'll go to our guests because this all ties together.
[2:26:58.900 --> 2:27:00.900]  I'm out there.
[2:27:00.900 --> 2:27:02.900]  He's being edited one.
[2:27:02.900 --> 2:27:03.900]  There was a lot of cussing by them.
[2:27:03.900 --> 2:27:05.900]  And again, he's by my truck.
[2:27:05.900 --> 2:27:07.900]  I've had an armored truck is the left of taxes.
[2:27:07.900 --> 2:27:09.900]  Hammers, bricks, steel rods.
[2:27:09.900 --> 2:27:10.900]  You name it.
[2:27:10.900 --> 2:27:13.900]  And he's saying F you and I'm like, you know, we need to stand against big tech running
[2:27:13.900 --> 2:27:14.900]  death camps in China.
[2:27:14.900 --> 2:27:16.900]  Oh, F you come on down here.
[2:27:16.900 --> 2:27:17.900]  Come on down here, boy.
[2:27:17.900 --> 2:27:20.900]  And I said, well, hell, let me see what happens when I come down there.
[2:27:20.900 --> 2:27:23.900]  Because the guy could have been 65 weight, 300 pounds out of still gone down there to
[2:27:23.900 --> 2:27:24.900]  see what he was doing.
[2:27:24.900 --> 2:27:29.900]  But he didn't weigh like 170 pounds of all beanstalk talk.
[2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:32.900]  And he didn't know what to do once I got down there.
[2:27:32.900 --> 2:27:37.900]  But again, the media all edited from our own video at the point where I grab his mask.
[2:27:37.900 --> 2:27:39.900]  Like I just randomly grabbed some dude's mask.
[2:27:39.900 --> 2:27:45.900]  No, he was down there for five minutes, laughing about Hong Kong, laughing about
[2:27:45.900 --> 2:27:47.900]  Taiwan, laughing about China.
[2:27:47.900 --> 2:27:50.900]  Because you better know, folks, people are like, why do you care so much about them?
[2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:52.900]  That's the system we're under attack by.
[2:27:52.900 --> 2:27:57.900]  That's what's coming to us next.
[2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:01.900]  Go ahead and roll the people being shipped off to reeducation camp where many won't
[2:28:01.900 --> 2:28:02.900]  ever come back again.
[2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:04.900]  Here it is in in Hong Kong.
[2:28:04.900 --> 2:28:06.900]  This is happening last night.
[2:28:06.900 --> 2:28:11.900]  Here it is.
[2:28:11.900 --> 2:28:13.900]  It's absolutely incredible what's unfolding.
[2:28:13.900 --> 2:28:15.900]  What's going on in this world.
[2:28:15.900 --> 2:28:35.900]  I'm like, Apple's running death camps.
[2:28:35.900 --> 2:28:36.900]  The left is evil.
[2:28:36.900 --> 2:28:37.900]  They're corrupt.
[2:28:37.900 --> 2:28:38.900]  They want to lock you down.
[2:28:38.900 --> 2:28:39.900]  Great reset.
[2:28:39.900 --> 2:28:42.900]  He's laughing, flipping me off and then doing gorilla things saying, come down here.
[2:28:42.900 --> 2:28:44.900]  He wants to fight, you know, bowing up with his fist.
[2:28:44.900 --> 2:28:45.900]  His shoulders.
[2:28:45.900 --> 2:28:47.900]  I said, I'll go talk to this guy.
[2:28:47.900 --> 2:28:49.900]  You know, you want to run your freaking mouth, man.
[2:28:49.900 --> 2:28:51.900]  This ain't funny, dude.
[2:28:51.900 --> 2:28:57.900]  They live on the last fumes of gas in America that our former men and women stood up for
[2:28:57.900 --> 2:28:59.900]  because women took care of the men.
[2:28:59.900 --> 2:29:02.900]  They're running on the fumes of what other people want greater than them did and they
[2:29:02.900 --> 2:29:04.900]  piss and crap all over it.
[2:29:04.900 --> 2:29:06.900]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[2:29:06.900 --> 2:29:12.900]  Now, Joseph Cadizzo and, of course, your patriot friend has been arrested again, Danny Presti.
[2:29:12.900 --> 2:29:13.900]  I just want to say this.
[2:29:13.900 --> 2:29:15.900]  When I tell you, you guys are patriots and heroes.
[2:29:15.900 --> 2:29:17.900]  I mean it because everybody else is following orders.
[2:29:17.900 --> 2:29:18.900]  You're not.
[2:29:18.900 --> 2:29:20.900]  And you're pointing out what's going on.
[2:29:20.900 --> 2:29:25.900]  And I'm seriously considering I'm already going to be in DC this weekend and I'm very
[2:29:25.900 --> 2:29:27.900]  close to New York while I'm there.
[2:29:27.900 --> 2:29:29.900]  I'm very, I need to touchstone.
[2:29:29.900 --> 2:29:32.900]  I need to come and touch the place where the rebellion starting.
[2:29:32.900 --> 2:29:35.900]  So there's a good chance I'm going to come there this week or I'm going to come there
[2:29:35.900 --> 2:29:39.900]  next week, but just in closing, you guys need support and love.
[2:29:39.900 --> 2:29:43.900]  People need to come from New York and all over and come to your businesses.
[2:29:43.900 --> 2:29:45.900]  They need to support them.
[2:29:45.900 --> 2:29:49.900]  And because the police arrest him every time he opens it, people need to bet on the modern
[2:29:49.900 --> 2:29:52.900]  day Patrick Henry or Sam Adams who owned a bar.
[2:29:52.900 --> 2:29:54.900]  They need to support him.
[2:29:54.900 --> 2:30:01.900]  And so tell us how people can support you and also support Danny Presti and what he's
[2:30:01.900 --> 2:30:04.900]  doing because it was $5, $10 or just a prayer.
[2:30:04.900 --> 2:30:06.900]  That has a big effect.
[2:30:06.900 --> 2:30:09.900]  It definitely has a huge effect.
[2:30:09.900 --> 2:30:11.900]  Danny has a GoFundMe set up.
[2:30:11.900 --> 2:30:13.900]  I have a GoFundMe set up.
[2:30:13.900 --> 2:30:16.900]  My business has been forced close since March.
[2:30:16.900 --> 2:30:19.900]  So, you know, we're hanging on by threats here.
[2:30:19.900 --> 2:30:25.900]  Up in New York, the rules are a lot stronger than anywhere else in the country.
[2:30:25.900 --> 2:30:29.900]  I mean, I just want to talk a quick second about just the overall state of affairs.
[2:30:29.900 --> 2:30:31.900]  Let's get out both your deals.
[2:30:31.900 --> 2:30:33.900]  Where do people go to support Danny?
[2:30:33.900 --> 2:30:37.900]  The two GoFundMe's we have set up.
[2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:38.900]  You've been putting them up.
[2:30:38.900 --> 2:30:40.900]  Thank you for doing that.
[2:30:40.900 --> 2:30:42.900]  Mac fights small businesses.
[2:30:42.900 --> 2:30:44.900]  You can go on to GoFundMe and search for that.
[2:30:44.900 --> 2:30:49.900]  And mine is a safe Staten Island Jujutsu Dojo.
[2:30:49.900 --> 2:30:52.900]  So, they should be pretty easy to find if you search them in Google.
[2:30:52.900 --> 2:30:54.900]  Any of this supports appreciated.
[2:30:54.900 --> 2:30:58.900]  If you could share, sharing goes a long way because getting the word out will help us
[2:30:58.900 --> 2:31:00.900]  hang on and hopefully reopen.
[2:31:00.900 --> 2:31:03.900]  Well, I know you want to get into what's happening, but it's one last thing.
[2:31:03.900 --> 2:31:06.900]  We need to get all the businesses have like a reopening day.
[2:31:06.900 --> 2:31:09.900]  I would say like next Wednesday, say we're reopening day.
[2:31:09.900 --> 2:31:13.900]  And then reopen small businesses, boycott big businesses.
[2:31:13.900 --> 2:31:18.900]  And I think you guys should just all have a block party out there and the police can burn in hell.
[2:31:18.900 --> 2:31:24.900]  The mayor's little select communist goons of that guy looks like a big fat child molester.
[2:31:24.900 --> 2:31:27.900]  Governor de Blasio or Mayor de Blasio.
[2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:29.900]  Well, you know, the government can't have it both ways.
[2:31:29.900 --> 2:31:34.900]  They can't leave us out to starve, keep our backs against the wall when we can't support our families
[2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:36.900]  and give us no subsidy.
[2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:41.900]  Every major country in this world has been taking care of the people and the businesses.
[2:31:41.900 --> 2:31:43.900]  We're left out here for dead.
[2:31:43.900 --> 2:31:46.900]  We have to either open or they have to subsidize us.
[2:31:46.900 --> 2:31:47.900]  It's one of the other.
[2:31:47.900 --> 2:31:50.900]  That guy went to Venezuela to train under Hugo Chavez.
[2:31:50.900 --> 2:31:51.900]  He's a damn shame.
[2:31:51.900 --> 2:31:53.900]  It's a fricking enemy of America.
[2:31:53.900 --> 2:31:55.900]  Giant sack of filth.
[2:31:55.900 --> 2:31:57.900]  What do you expect commies to do?
[2:31:57.900 --> 2:32:00.900]  Shut down our businesses, wage war on us.
[2:32:00.900 --> 2:32:03.900]  Damn it.
[2:32:03.900 --> 2:32:04.900]  Go ahead.
[2:32:04.900 --> 2:32:05.900]  You wanted to point something out on ranting.
[2:32:05.900 --> 2:32:06.900]  What was the other point?
[2:32:06.900 --> 2:32:10.900]  No, I think it's just it's so hard to be a business owner up here in New York.
[2:32:10.900 --> 2:32:13.900]  We have such high taxes, city tax, state tax.
[2:32:13.900 --> 2:32:17.900]  We have Staten Island is only 58 square miles.
[2:32:17.900 --> 2:32:21.900]  They have in the last year or so, they put up 750 speed cameras.
[2:32:21.900 --> 2:32:25.900]  You can almost most places you can't drive over 25 miles an hour.
[2:32:25.900 --> 2:32:32.900]  They have it's almost like this entire country is just slowly creeping closer and closer to becoming like communist China.
[2:32:32.900 --> 2:32:35.900]  I mean, all the big companies, all the big corporations are getting subsidized.
[2:32:35.900 --> 2:32:38.900]  Walmart Walmart's getting billions of dollars a year.
[2:32:38.900 --> 2:32:41.900]  You know, all their employees are on food stamps.
[2:32:41.900 --> 2:32:45.900]  You know, Amazon's getting paid to open up warehouses and locations.
[2:32:45.900 --> 2:32:51.900]  It's a predatory authoritarian takeover because we won't stand up for ourselves.
[2:32:51.900 --> 2:32:55.900]  We're trying, we're trying to do our best in Staten Island, we're doing everything we can to be vocal.
[2:32:55.900 --> 2:32:58.900]  I'm so happy that you gave us a voice on your show.
[2:32:58.900 --> 2:33:09.900]  I believe that shows like yours podcast are the only two form a meeting now because every time I give an interview, they edit it all out and they take two pieces that weren't even put together and they do this.
[2:33:09.900 --> 2:33:10.900]  So, you know,
[2:33:10.900 --> 2:33:15.900]  Oh yeah, when I said we're not doing anything, I wasn't talking about you or Danny Presti.
[2:33:15.900 --> 2:33:23.900]  All right, brother, we really appreciate you on Instagram at S I J J D. Go fund Max fight for small businesses.
[2:33:23.900 --> 2:33:25.900]  Go fund me Steve Staten Island.

[2:33:32.900 --> 2:33:34.900]  Thank you so much for having me on your show.
[2:33:34.900 --> 2:33:37.900]  If you told people 10 years ago, we'd be at this point that never believe it.
[2:33:37.900 --> 2:33:48.900]  I'm going to tell you, it's about to get a lot worse promo code, Patriot promo code, Patriot at checkout at info war store.com during cyber week.

[2:34:33.900 --> 2:34:59.900]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control. There's a headline out of zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December.
[2:34:59.900 --> 2:35:05.900]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[2:35:05.900 --> 2:35:13.900]  We'll see. That'll knock out all the smaller lines and it's all they control. It's the same in every single industry. And the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[2:35:13.900 --> 2:35:22.900]  They want to bankrupt the world economy to buy it up for pennies on the dollar. That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks.
[2:35:22.900 --> 2:35:36.900]  This is how the global estate control. It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare, and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives.
[2:35:36.900 --> 2:35:42.900]  Only the truth will set us free, infowars.com.
[2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:58.900]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple. They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats.
[2:35:58.900 --> 2:36:18.900]  And that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great. But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, non-essential, and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out. So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[2:36:18.900 --> 2:36:35.900]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom is that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our own systems, we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet, and it's systems towards our aims.
[2:36:35.900 --> 2:36:42.900]  But instead, we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle. And that's the trick.
[2:36:42.900 --> 2:36:49.900]  Fox has betrayed President Trump, as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[2:36:49.900 --> 2:36:59.900]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term on the 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[2:36:59.900 --> 2:37:08.900]  They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to the US. So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:13.900]  This is economic domination. This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We are being taken over.
[2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:26.900]  The democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[2:37:26.900 --> 2:37:39.900]  This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is. Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your business is only at 25%. For several more years, no small businesses will be there.
[2:37:39.900 --> 2:37:57.900]  This is a master plan. Say no.
[2:37:57.900 --> 2:38:14.900]  It is heartbreaking to watch the footage of pro-freedom demonstrators in Hong Kong who had an agreement under treaty until 2030 and passed.
[2:38:14.900 --> 2:38:28.900]  They don't have China in control of them and there they are being shipped away to quote reeducation camps where many will never come back again. Shocked video, China forces Hong Kong political prisoners on the buses for reeducation camps.
[2:38:28.900 --> 2:38:45.900]  The cover to introduce you to camps in Europe and the US and Canada is what they call COVID camps. They then intubate you with a device, a ventilator and then kill you that way.
[2:38:45.900 --> 2:38:54.900]  So the new guillotine is now the ventilator and the new sign of slavery, the new white flag is the face diaper.
[2:38:54.900 --> 2:39:04.900]  Sturbing video out of Hong Kong shows family members of political prisoners saying hysterical goodbyes over China rounded them up on the buses headed for education camps in the mainland.
[2:39:04.900 --> 2:39:10.900]  No one on the mainland would ever come to the camp, but you know, these folks are still free.
[2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:18.900]  The heartbreaking footage shows a group of desperate Hong Kongers banging on the barred windows of the buses as it drives away the Chinese mainland.
[2:39:18.900 --> 2:39:25.900]  So what's happening here is there's always an outside group that wants to dominate you and take you over.
[2:39:25.900 --> 2:39:31.900]  And if you don't have a history and organization and a military and armed population resistant, you will be taken over.
[2:39:31.900 --> 2:39:37.900]  And so we lived under freedom so long, we're like, wait, they're still in the election? Wait, they're just taken over?
[2:39:37.900 --> 2:39:43.900]  Wait, they got pedophiles teaching kids in public schools? I mean, because you don't stand up.
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:52.900]  And so a lot of people are saying, well, Jones, when is the time for a shooting war? Well, if you won't show up in D.C. this weekend to peacefully point out that our president won re-election,
[2:39:52.900 --> 2:40:01.900]  and he's been trying to peacefully reverse this, and if you won't show up at state capitals and if you won't donate to Info Wars and if you won't spread the word, you're never going to go put bullets in anybody.
[2:40:01.900 --> 2:40:09.900]  Okay. And here's the deal. 90% of the people who work for the globalists don't even know what they're doing. I don't want to hurt them.
[2:40:09.900 --> 2:40:19.900]  I want them to have a great future. I don't want physical conflict because the globalists have us in a modern domesticated age where it's just, it's terrible if it goes that direction.
[2:40:19.900 --> 2:40:28.900]  So I am not offensively planning anything, but I'm here to tell you, forced inoculations, global governments, seeds, saying you're not essential.
[2:40:28.900 --> 2:40:33.900]  They lock you up in your house and you starve to death. That's the form of war. You have a right to fight back.
[2:40:33.900 --> 2:40:42.900]  You have a right if a mayor locks you down and you lose your business and then you lose your house and your homeless to go to their house and live in their living room and eat their food.
[2:40:42.900 --> 2:40:49.900]  And by the way, they know that, so they're going to direct you at the middle class, not at their house. No.
[2:40:49.900 --> 2:40:59.900]  I want to sit in Mayor Adler's living room at the W. I want the homeless he brings here and gives, I want him in his house.
[2:40:59.900 --> 2:41:04.900]  They don't respect you. They've never been called out, folks. That's why they're doing this.
[2:41:04.900 --> 2:41:14.900]  The heartbreaking footage shows a group of desperate Hong Kongers begging on the barred windows as the bus as it drives away to the Chinese mainland.
[2:41:14.900 --> 2:41:30.900]  John Wong Wong, Ivan Lam and Agonis Chow, who spearheaded the umbrella movement 2019 that we have reporters on the ground covering. There's Communist China's encroachment on the Hong Kong sovereignty.
[2:41:30.900 --> 2:41:35.900]  We're among the political prisoners boarded in vans after getting sentenced last week for their roles in the mass protest by the Communist Chinese.
[2:41:35.900 --> 2:41:41.900]  There's Time Magazine reporting on it. They deserve it. It is good. You soon be in camp.
[2:41:41.900 --> 2:41:50.900]  DNI Ratcliffe says we'll see whether there is a Biden administration. He was on Fox News and didn't go along with their gaslighting.
[2:41:50.900 --> 2:42:01.900]  And again, if you just joined us, the Supreme Court has moved up the dates to hear Trump's cases so that it doesn't go to the window and then lose its constitutional authority to do it.
[2:42:01.900 --> 2:42:11.900]  So the Supreme Court is teeing it up to give it back to the legislators and demand that they choose the electors and have hearings. And they can also do more of that.
[2:42:11.900 --> 2:42:19.900]  They can throw out all those state elections and demand new elections, or they can simply certify it for Trump because of the fraud. It's that serious.
[2:42:19.900 --> 2:42:31.900]  Democrat operatives went on all five states, really six states, but five were focused on and got agreements, consent agreements outside of legislative law to accept the fake balance and no signatures and the rest of it.
[2:42:31.900 --> 2:42:39.900]  It's all fraud. Then we have the moral authority with the evidence of the fraud. They got a big problem. The worm turned.
[2:42:39.900 --> 2:42:49.900]  If you believe in Trump, if you believe in freedom, if you march in D.C., if you are aggressive, if you support the institutions fighting back, we're going to win.
[2:42:49.900 --> 2:42:56.900]  And regardless, we're going on the 20th to say he's not our president in D.C. It's like that mayor said three weeks ago.
[2:42:56.900 --> 2:43:04.900]  Oh, COVID restrictions suddenly, no one come in the city, screw you, we came in. We do what we want you dirty little commies. We know who you are.
[2:43:04.900 --> 2:43:09.900]  We've just begun to fight. We're not beginning to surrender. It's not in our vocabulary.
[2:43:23.900 --> 2:43:26.900]  The pedophiles are going to burn in hell.
[2:43:26.900 --> 2:43:32.900]  All right, let's go to D&I Ratcliffe. We'll see whether there is a Biden administration.
[2:43:32.900 --> 2:43:44.900]  Get your take on Joe Biden naming a cabinet and expecting that he is going to have a national security team and hear his Obama era picks.
[2:43:44.900 --> 2:43:49.900]  And I want to get your take on whether or not they agree with you and understand the threat.
[2:43:49.900 --> 2:43:54.900]  You've got Jake Sullivan for NSA. He sent classified emails to Hillary Clinton's server.
[2:43:54.900 --> 2:44:00.900]  He hyped the Russia gate hoax, co-authored the essay calling China an essential U.S. partner.
[2:44:00.900 --> 2:44:03.900]  Anthony Blinken for Secretary of State. These are committed criminals.
[2:44:03.900 --> 2:44:09.900]  Senator Johnson's report was in contact with Hunter Biden and his Burisma Holdings colleagues in the Ukraine impeachment drama.
[2:44:09.900 --> 2:44:17.900]  Alejandro Mayorkas for DHS found to have sold green cards to Chinese nationals on behalf of Democratic donors.
[2:44:17.900 --> 2:44:23.900]  And then there's Neera Tanden for budget director. She played a role in promoting the debunked Trump-Russia claims.
[2:44:23.900 --> 2:44:25.900]  They're bringing in sky colonizers.
[2:44:25.900 --> 2:44:32.900]  And then there's the Republicans who wants your job as DNI. He's the former deputy of John Brennan and Susan Rice, who were deeply involved.
[2:44:32.900 --> 2:44:35.900]  We understand John Brennan was in the Russia hoax.
[2:44:35.900 --> 2:44:41.900]  So does a potential incoming Biden administration agree with this about China?
[2:44:41.900 --> 2:44:44.900]  And will they change policy?
[2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:52.900]  Well, these election issues, we'll see who is in what seats and whether there is a Biden administration.
[2:44:52.900 --> 2:45:00.900]  But the point of what I've done here and how I've addressed this and why it's different for a director of national intelligence to take this approach is,
[2:45:00.900 --> 2:45:08.900]  I want to make sure that the American people are clear on the threat so that they can hold whoever holds these important national security positions is held accountable.
[2:45:08.900 --> 2:45:17.900]  So that the things that the Trump administration has done so successfully that is different than any other administration has done before,
[2:45:17.900 --> 2:45:24.900]  sanctions against China, tariffs relating to China, holding them accountable on the world stage.
[2:45:24.900 --> 2:45:30.900]  Very powerful information. I'm going to host a little bit at the next hour and then hand the baton to Gerald Salente.
[2:45:30.900 --> 2:45:32.900]  But let me just say this right now.
[2:45:32.900 --> 2:45:38.900]  Info wars has proven itself vital to the future of the Republic and vital to the future of human liberty and freedom.
[2:45:38.900 --> 2:45:42.900]  And I'm very honored to be in this position. I'm very thankful to you for keeping us in the fight.
[2:45:42.900 --> 2:45:50.900]  But I just want to ask listeners to again, recommit, count the costs and realize that if you do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com
[2:45:50.900 --> 2:45:58.900]  and take advantage of the big sales we've got going, that that funds an organization that the globalists absolutely hate.
[2:45:58.900 --> 2:46:03.900]  We are like nails on a chalkboard to them. We are over the target. We are we do not back down.
[2:46:03.900 --> 2:46:08.900]  We are unfiltered. We are historically accurate. We have incredible guests.
[2:46:08.900 --> 2:46:13.900]  We are the blood of freedom. You are the blood of freedom. We are symbiotic.
[2:46:13.900 --> 2:46:20.900]  And it's just like a family line. Just like you go back to your earliest ancestors, tens of thousands of years ago into the future.
[2:46:20.900 --> 2:46:27.900]  We are one family. We are one body together. You cannot let info wars die.
[2:46:27.900 --> 2:46:31.900]  And it's under such attack. But because of you, we've persevered.
[2:46:31.900 --> 2:46:38.900]  And now we've gone from 50, 50 people hating us and loving us to like 90%. We've hit the zeitgeist.
[2:46:38.900 --> 2:46:43.900]  And I know it's an incredible responsibility. You look at videos of me two years ago. I looked 10 years younger.
[2:46:43.900 --> 2:46:47.900]  People say, you know, Jones, you sell your supplements. You look like hell.
[2:46:47.900 --> 2:46:54.900]  I have chosen to take on everything and everything to hurt me because it gives me greater discernment.
[2:46:54.900 --> 2:47:01.900]  And I don't like it. It's psychological. It's spiritual. But I can ignore things and I can cut off pain.
[2:47:01.900 --> 2:47:06.900]  But I have chosen the way of pain and I have chosen to take all the songs.
[2:47:06.900 --> 2:47:13.900]  Well, my beard's gone gray the last year. It's why I'm, you know, I'm killing myself, but it's a good mission.
[2:47:13.900 --> 2:47:18.900]  And if one of the supplements and the rest of it, I couldn't do what I do, but I'm working 18 hours a day.
[2:47:18.900 --> 2:47:26.900]  I sleep. I have dreams about fight the new order. If there was ever anybody in modern history totally committed to fighting the operations, the new order.
[2:47:26.900 --> 2:47:32.900]  It's info war. So thank you for your support. We've got big sales at infowarstore.com.

[2:47:40.900 --> 2:47:46.900]  We brought those back just for Christmas and free shipping, but we've got to sell a lot of profit to fund ourselves.
[2:47:46.900 --> 2:47:52.900]  We saw a lot more product at a sale that big, but there's a lot less funding in each order.
[2:47:52.900 --> 2:47:55.900]  So we need to get a lot more ordered bill to fund ourselves.

[2:48:30.900 --> 2:48:34.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[2:48:34.900 --> 2:48:39.900]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[2:48:39.900 --> 2:48:44.900]  That's their stated admitted plan. Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors.
[2:48:44.900 --> 2:48:49.900]  They admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[2:48:49.900 --> 2:48:54.900]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total power and total control.
[2:48:54.900 --> 2:48:57.900]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world.
[2:48:57.900 --> 2:49:00.900]  During the U.S., thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns.
[2:49:00.900 --> 2:49:02.900]  People are finally starting to fight back.
[2:49:02.900 --> 2:49:04.900]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.

[2:49:30.900 --> 2:49:35.900]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes,
[2:49:35.900 --> 2:49:40.900]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s,
[2:49:40.900 --> 2:49:43.900]  is all about corporate global governance.
[2:49:43.900 --> 2:49:44.900]  And now you're seeing it.
[2:49:44.900 --> 2:49:47.900]  It's not just the blue states, the blue cities, the communists and socialists.
[2:49:47.900 --> 2:49:53.900]  Nations all working in unison under UN control, established in medical planetary dictatorship.
[2:49:53.900 --> 2:50:01.900]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations, themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families,
[2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:06.900]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[2:50:06.900 --> 2:50:10.900]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time,
[2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:17.900]  but they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:21.900]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[2:50:21.900 --> 2:50:23.900]  They're involved in poting the world economy.
[2:50:23.900 --> 2:50:26.900]  That's what the social distancing the masks are all about.
[2:50:26.900 --> 2:50:29.900]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply,
[2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:31.900]  are compliant with your own destruction. Wake up.
[2:50:34.900 --> 2:50:37.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:37.900 --> 2:50:44.900]  It comes a moment, and you realize it's all bigger than you.
[2:50:44.900 --> 2:50:57.900]  And you turn it over to God, and that is the moment of rebirth.
[2:50:57.900 --> 2:51:02.900]  You take a model man.
[2:51:02.900 --> 2:51:06.900]  Then all that matters is carrying out the operation faithfully.
[2:51:06.900 --> 2:51:11.900]  Because we're not taking orders from Satan, we're taking orders from God.
[2:51:11.900 --> 2:51:15.900]  If God is in us, who can be against us?
[2:51:15.900 --> 2:51:19.900]  All right.
[2:51:19.900 --> 2:51:24.900]  There's one clip from Trump's powerful Saturday speech I haven't gotten to yet.
[2:51:24.900 --> 2:51:27.900]  I'm going to play at the start of the next segment, then I'll hand the baton halfway
[2:51:27.900 --> 2:51:31.900]  of the segment to Joe Salante.
[2:51:31.900 --> 2:51:41.900]  But there's an 11-minute 30-second clip from June of 2018.
[2:51:41.900 --> 2:51:45.900]  We're not getting into the UN disease acts, the global government rollout in their plan,
[2:51:45.900 --> 2:51:47.900]  and it lays it all out.
[2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:50.900]  And I already played part of this earlier, but here's a few more minutes of it,
[2:51:50.900 --> 2:51:56.900]  just so people understand that we know what we're talking about. Here it is.
[2:51:56.900 --> 2:51:57.900]  June 17.
[2:51:57.900 --> 2:52:01.900]  What did I and Dr. Group and others, and Dr. Blalock, who's a brain surgeon,
[2:52:01.900 --> 2:52:05.900]  what have we talked about in the past here on the air?
[2:52:05.900 --> 2:52:09.900]  That the globalists have said in their white papers, in their own UN documents,
[2:52:09.900 --> 2:52:15.900]  that they want to create race-specific bio weapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:18.900]  They teach that everywhere, that the world without humans would be great.
[2:52:18.900 --> 2:52:22.900]  We need to depopulate. China's been the center of one-child policy, all of this,
[2:52:22.900 --> 2:52:25.900]  and that it would be good to call the planet.
[2:52:25.900 --> 2:52:31.900]  A lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release bio weapons,
[2:52:31.900 --> 2:52:36.900]  claim that they're naturally occurring, and then use that as the cover
[2:52:36.900 --> 2:52:42.900]  for civil emergencies, societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[2:52:42.900 --> 2:52:45.900]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago,
[2:52:45.900 --> 2:52:50.900]  not confronted by Congress. He said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[2:52:50.900 --> 2:52:51.900]  Just type that in.
[2:52:51.900 --> 2:52:56.900]  CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out,
[2:52:56.900 --> 2:53:02.900]  and they have to control panic and direct every website in the U.S. to one government announcement.
[2:53:02.900 --> 2:53:07.900]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release
[2:53:07.900 --> 2:53:10.900]  to bring in a world government to counter a global problem,
[2:53:10.900 --> 2:53:15.900]  and the U.N. has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[2:53:15.900 --> 2:53:18.900]  It may not be this year, but this is the Globalist Plan.
[2:53:18.900 --> 2:53:21.900]  I'm Alex Jones. You have been warned.
[2:53:21.900 --> 2:53:24.900]  All right, that full video is on Band-Aid video.
[2:53:24.900 --> 2:53:26.900]  I'll go into all the details in the next 10 minutes.
[2:53:26.900 --> 2:53:29.900]  Now, I was going to talk about this today, but I'm going to do it tomorrow.
[2:53:29.900 --> 2:53:32.900]  Joe Olstein. I get asked a lot about Joe Olstein.
[2:53:32.900 --> 2:53:36.900]  He's down in Houston, and he's super positive.
[2:53:36.900 --> 2:53:40.900]  And at a certain point, the globalists want you to be a victim.
[2:53:40.900 --> 2:53:42.900]  They want you to be negative.
[2:53:42.900 --> 2:53:45.900]  They want you to believe you're a failure.
[2:53:45.900 --> 2:53:47.900]  And so him saying, you're going to overcome.
[2:53:47.900 --> 2:53:50.900]  You're not a loser.
[2:53:50.900 --> 2:53:52.900]  I actually think it's extremely positive.
[2:53:52.900 --> 2:53:59.900]  I'll just be honest with you, except there's one missing ingredient.
[2:53:59.900 --> 2:54:02.900]  You can have, you know, 13 essential vitamins.
[2:54:02.900 --> 2:54:05.900]  What is it? 11 essential minerals, whatever it is, look it up.
[2:54:05.900 --> 2:54:07.900]  But if you're missing one, you die.
[2:54:07.900 --> 2:54:10.900]  You'll die of any disease in like six months.
[2:54:10.900 --> 2:54:13.900]  Well, he doesn't say you got to take action.
[2:54:13.900 --> 2:54:15.900]  So I'm not here to criticize Joe Olstein.
[2:54:15.900 --> 2:54:18.900]  I'm thinking about a message to him because I mean, you know, I thought,
[2:54:18.900 --> 2:54:21.900]  well, people are just being mean to him because I got to ask a lot about him.
[2:54:21.900 --> 2:54:25.900]  So I went about a week ago and I was on a road trip to see family.
[2:54:25.900 --> 2:54:29.900]  And about three hours down there, about three hours back, I listened to Joe Olstein.
[2:54:29.900 --> 2:54:34.900]  And man, I didn't hear one thing that was negative and one problem.
[2:54:34.900 --> 2:54:38.900]  That's like, if you're going to have to walk out in the field and I've got a flashlight saying,
[2:54:38.900 --> 2:54:39.900]  well, just everything's fine.
[2:54:39.900 --> 2:54:41.900]  You're going to step in the hole and break your leg.
[2:54:41.900 --> 2:54:47.900]  He needs to speak out and tell people, hey, abortion's wrong.
[2:54:47.900 --> 2:54:50.900]  Hey, there's a lot of pedophilia and Satanism.
[2:54:50.900 --> 2:54:54.900]  We need to hear positive believing in God and that if we take the right action,
[2:54:54.900 --> 2:54:56.900]  God will lead us the rest of the way.
[2:54:56.900 --> 2:54:57.900]  It takes us across that bridge.
[2:54:57.900 --> 2:54:58.900]  That's totally true.
[2:54:58.900 --> 2:55:02.900]  But as the better one say, trusted God would tie up your camel or as Hunter S. Thompson would say,
[2:55:02.900 --> 2:55:05.900]  pray to God, but roll away from the rocks.
[2:55:05.900 --> 2:55:12.900]  That's really my message to everybody out there is that faith without works is dead.
[2:55:12.900 --> 2:55:14.900]  And so I like Kanye going down there and speaking.
[2:55:14.900 --> 2:55:15.900]  And I like all that.
[2:55:15.900 --> 2:55:18.900]  But notice Kanye speaks out against the black genocide.
[2:55:18.900 --> 2:55:20.900]  He speaks out against the world government.
[2:55:20.900 --> 2:55:22.900]  He speaks out against how we're being drugged.
[2:55:22.900 --> 2:55:27.900]  Joe Olstein doesn't do any of that.
[2:55:27.900 --> 2:55:29.900]  And it needs to stop.
[2:55:29.900 --> 2:55:33.900]  And so I pray for Joe Olstein that God will touch his heart.
[2:55:33.900 --> 2:56:02.900]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:56:03.900 --> 2:56:04.900]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:03.900 --> 2:57:25.900]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:25.900 --> 2:57:54.900]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:55.900 --> 2:58:17.900]  We'll be right back.
[2:58:17.900 --> 2:58:46.900]  We'll be right back.
[2:58:46.900 --> 2:59:11.900]  We'll be right back.
[2:59:11.900 --> 2:59:16.900]  Remember, so many of the states, I won every one of them, every one of these states.
[2:59:16.900 --> 2:59:24.900]  And by the way, the swing states that we're all fighting over now, I won them all by a lot.
[2:59:24.900 --> 2:59:31.900]  And I have to say, if I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser.
[2:59:31.900 --> 2:59:34.900]  If I lost, I would say I lost.
[2:59:34.900 --> 2:59:40.900]  And I'd go to Florida and I'd take it easy and I'd go around and I'd say I did a good job.
[2:59:40.900 --> 2:59:48.900]  But you can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob.
[2:59:48.900 --> 3:00:04.900]  Can't accept.
[3:00:04.900 --> 3:00:10.900]  Well, the Democrats did try to steal the presidency. They're trying like hell.
[3:00:10.900 --> 3:00:12.900]  Do you ever notice the fake news today?
[3:00:12.900 --> 3:00:19.900]  He's appointing his this, his that, Sonny, his secretary of agriculture.
[3:00:19.900 --> 3:00:20.900]  Sonny, I like Sonny.
[3:00:20.900 --> 3:00:24.900]  We want Sonny was a great governor here for eight years.
[3:00:24.900 --> 3:00:25.900]  All right.
[3:00:25.900 --> 3:00:27.900]  We're gonna hand this baton to Gerald Salenta in just a moment.
[3:00:27.900 --> 3:00:28.900]  I want to ask him this question.
[3:00:28.900 --> 3:00:31.900]  But first off, I'll say it because I didn't plug in the second hour.
[3:00:31.900 --> 3:00:32.900]  We'll go bankrupt.
[3:00:32.900 --> 3:00:33.900]  We don't try to catch up.
[3:00:33.900 --> 3:00:35.900]  Promo code Patriot ends today.
[3:00:35.900 --> 3:00:37.900]  Additional 10% off whatever you already ordered.
[3:00:37.900 --> 3:00:39.900]  Whatever discounts already there in the free shipping.
[3:00:39.900 --> 3:00:41.900]  10% off the promo code Patriot checkout.
[3:00:41.900 --> 3:00:45.900]  And yeah, we've got like a million dollars.
[3:00:45.900 --> 3:00:48.900]  So right now in the bank, that sounds like a lot with 100 employees.
[3:00:48.900 --> 3:00:51.900]  This crew, that's like dead empty gas tank.
[3:00:51.900 --> 3:00:52.900]  Okay.
[3:00:52.900 --> 3:00:54.900]  The good news is I don't have to pay any taxes.
[3:00:54.900 --> 3:00:55.900]  I'm not getting any money.
[3:00:55.900 --> 3:00:57.900]  But I don't care about that.
[3:00:57.900 --> 3:01:02.900]  I care about staying on air and not letting employees go and give them a little Christmas bonus.
[3:01:02.900 --> 3:01:03.900]  Okay.
[3:01:03.900 --> 3:01:04.900]  So I'm not bitching.
[3:01:04.900 --> 3:01:05.900]  I'm not complaining.
[3:01:05.900 --> 3:01:06.900]  You know what's going on.
[3:01:06.900 --> 3:01:09.900]  But I see Jeff Bezos made a hundred billion dollars during the lockdown.
[3:01:09.900 --> 3:01:10.900]  Well, we made less money.
[3:01:10.900 --> 3:01:12.900]  It hadn't worked for us because you're going bankrupt.
[3:01:12.900 --> 3:01:13.900]  I get it.
[3:01:13.900 --> 3:01:15.900]  I got family and they see what's happening.
[3:01:15.900 --> 3:01:18.900]  Prices are going up and, you know, they're like veterans.
[3:01:18.900 --> 3:01:20.900]  They're living on a pension.
[3:01:20.900 --> 3:01:22.900]  It's a mess, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:01:22.900 --> 3:01:23.900]  It's an absolute mess.
[3:01:23.900 --> 3:01:25.900]  I want to thank you for shopping with us this Christmas.
[3:01:25.900 --> 3:01:27.900]  Get the shopping done now so you get it early.
[3:01:27.900 --> 3:01:29.900]  All the products we have are in stock, right?
[3:01:29.900 --> 3:01:31.900]  A lot of great products.
[3:01:31.900 --> 3:01:32.900]  Back in stock.
[3:01:32.900 --> 3:01:33.900]  Frosted guard.
[3:01:33.900 --> 3:01:34.900]  Back in stock.
[3:01:34.900 --> 3:01:35.900]  Alpha power.
[3:01:35.900 --> 3:01:36.900]  Back in stock.
[3:01:36.900 --> 3:01:39.900]  Ultimate turmeric formula bodies.
[3:01:39.900 --> 3:01:40.900]  X2 is essential.
[3:01:40.900 --> 3:01:41.900]  Clean iodine.
[3:01:41.900 --> 3:01:42.900]  It's so good.
[3:01:42.900 --> 3:01:44.900]  Look at the studies for that for your immune system.
[3:01:44.900 --> 3:01:48.900]  But I wanted to bring this up to Gerald Salendi, one of the top trans forecasters out there,
[3:01:48.900 --> 3:01:52.900]  author, researcher, good friend of mine, patriot.
[3:01:52.900 --> 3:01:57.900]  Watching this take place, watching this world government and now seeing the Supreme Court
[3:01:57.900 --> 3:02:03.900]  come out three weeks ago and move conservative judges in over the battleground states and
[3:02:03.900 --> 3:02:07.900]  now to have them move up the timeline so that Trump gets heard.
[3:02:07.900 --> 3:02:13.900]  I see the Supreme Court teeing this up because of all the fraud that's coming out to actually
[3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:16.900]  override the fraud in these states.
[3:02:16.900 --> 3:02:18.900]  I think it's, we was a 30% chance.
[3:02:18.900 --> 3:02:20.900]  I think it's about a 45% chance now.
[3:02:20.900 --> 3:02:23.900]  I mean, I really see the fact that there are hoax of Russia.
[3:02:23.900 --> 3:02:26.900]  There are hoax of everything else is starting to backfire.
[3:02:26.900 --> 3:02:28.900]  And Trump's pretty confident.
[3:02:28.900 --> 3:02:34.900]  I talked to not name dropping three of his top lawyers this week and they were even pessimistic
[3:02:34.900 --> 3:02:35.900]  two weeks ago.
[3:02:35.900 --> 3:02:37.900]  They're like, no, we have such evidence now.
[3:02:37.900 --> 3:02:41.900]  The Supreme Court's getting it of what's happened in Georgia and Pennsylvania and in
[3:02:41.900 --> 3:02:43.900]  Michigan, where they have the whole chain of fraud.
[3:02:43.900 --> 3:02:47.900]  The suitcases pulled out while they close the polling place, running the ballots through
[3:02:47.900 --> 3:02:51.900]  they're all for Biden, everything that this is about to blow up in their face.
[3:02:51.900 --> 3:02:57.900]  A, what do you think of that and then B, what happens then if the Supreme Court says Trump
[3:02:57.900 --> 3:02:58.900]  won?
[3:02:58.900 --> 3:02:59.900]  What does the left do?
[3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:01.900]  I mean, what is this period of time?
[3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:03.900]  Gerald Solente, we really appreciate you.
[3:03:03.900 --> 3:03:05.900]  I'm going to hand the baton to you, my friend.
[3:03:05.900 --> 3:03:06.900]  Well, thank you.
[3:03:06.900 --> 3:03:11.900]  And what I see happening, Alex, is I think it is going to go to the Supreme Court, but
[3:03:11.900 --> 3:03:17.900]  I'm concerned that the Supreme Court's been sold out as well at some levels.
[3:03:17.900 --> 3:03:24.900]  And when we saw it with that guy, Roberts, who really took the opposition's side on key
[3:03:24.900 --> 3:03:32.900]  issues, particularly the last one, giving religions the right to congregate.
[3:03:32.900 --> 3:03:35.900]  And he just went neutral on it.
[3:03:35.900 --> 3:03:40.900]  And also, they're part of the establishment and Trump is not the establishment.
[3:03:40.900 --> 3:03:42.900]  That's why they attacked him from the beginning.
[3:03:42.900 --> 3:03:44.900]  He's not a member of the club.
[3:03:44.900 --> 3:03:47.900]  The Republicans didn't want him to win.
[3:03:47.900 --> 3:03:55.900]  You remember the debates in 2016, little Marco Rubio and pushing down, putting his arm around
[3:03:55.900 --> 3:04:00.900]  little George Jeb Bush and calling him out as a little nothing that he is.
[3:04:00.900 --> 3:04:03.900]  So Trump is not their guy.
[3:04:03.900 --> 3:04:08.900]  So I don't have faith in the Supreme Court at this point because the evidence is clear
[3:04:08.900 --> 3:04:09.900]  in front of everyone.
[3:04:09.900 --> 3:04:12.900]  And as you pointed out, the lawyers keep providing it.
[3:04:12.900 --> 3:04:18.900]  So the Supreme Court, I think, is going to turn it back to the states or some way.
[3:04:18.900 --> 3:04:22.900]  They are pressured by the media.
[3:04:22.900 --> 3:04:28.900]  And you get to these positions, a lot of them is because you're a member of the club.
[3:04:28.900 --> 3:04:31.900]  And so that's my concern, Alex.
[3:04:31.900 --> 3:04:33.900]  No, I totally agree.
[3:04:33.900 --> 3:04:36.900]  But the evidence they've dug up, it's insane.
[3:04:36.900 --> 3:04:38.900]  The evidence won't mean anything.
[3:04:38.900 --> 3:04:41.900]  It never does when they don't want it to be.
[3:04:41.900 --> 3:04:43.900]  I'm talking about that guy.
[3:04:43.900 --> 3:04:44.900]  What was his name?
[3:04:44.900 --> 3:04:49.900]  George W. Bush, who lied us into the war with no evidence at all.
[3:04:49.900 --> 3:04:51.900]  Yeah, the WMDs.
[3:04:51.900 --> 3:04:55.900]  Yeah, and he has ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:04:55.900 --> 3:04:57.900]  So no, it doesn't count.
[3:04:57.900 --> 3:04:59.900]  Justice has been lost in America.
[3:04:59.900 --> 3:05:01.900]  Freedom, peace, forget it.
[3:05:01.900 --> 3:05:03.900]  They don't count anymore.
[3:05:03.900 --> 3:05:05.900]  So that's what I'm concerned about.
[3:05:05.900 --> 3:05:10.900]  I'm concerned about the Supreme Court doing a supreme sellout because the evidence of fraud
[3:05:10.900 --> 3:05:12.900]  you can't get.
[3:05:12.900 --> 3:05:16.900]  This is a lot bigger than hanging chads of 2,000.
[3:05:16.900 --> 3:05:19.900]  This is everywhere.
[3:05:19.900 --> 3:05:20.900]  I agree.
[3:05:20.900 --> 3:05:22.900]  I mean, it's almost like they wanted to get caught.
[3:05:22.900 --> 3:05:24.900]  It's ridiculous.
[3:05:24.900 --> 3:05:26.900]  I guess they just feel confident.
[3:05:26.900 --> 3:05:31.900]  Yeah, they're confident because they're con men and it's a con game.
[3:05:31.900 --> 3:05:39.900]  Liberty, freedom, justice is being robbed from us in front of our eyes
[3:05:39.900 --> 3:05:43.900]  in every way you can see it.
[3:05:43.900 --> 3:05:44.900]  I agree with you.
[3:05:44.900 --> 3:05:47.900]  You're going to take over right now, but 30 seconds.
[3:05:47.900 --> 3:05:48.900]  What is the blowback?
[3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:50.900]  I see big blowback from this.
[3:05:50.900 --> 3:05:55.900]  Yeah, it's a time for a whole new movement, a time for the end of the Republican Party,
[3:05:55.900 --> 3:05:59.900]  a whole new movement to change the course of what's going on.
[3:05:59.900 --> 3:06:05.900]  Because with Biden, oh, by the way, I'm getting blacklisted place after place
[3:06:05.900 --> 3:06:10.900]  for speaking out against things, so I have to be careful what I say.
[3:06:10.900 --> 3:06:16.900]  But with Biden, it's communism plus.
[3:06:16.900 --> 3:06:18.900]  Gerald, you're in command, brother.
[3:06:18.900 --> 3:06:19.900]  We love you.
[3:06:19.900 --> 3:06:20.900]  Gerald Slanty takes over on the other side.
[3:06:20.900 --> 3:06:38.900]  Stay with us.
[3:06:38.900 --> 3:06:39.900]  The Great Reset.
[3:06:39.900 --> 3:06:41.900]  Where have I heard of that before?
[3:06:41.900 --> 3:06:48.900]  Oh, the Great Leap Forward, Mousetown, ordering all the small towns and small farms
[3:06:48.900 --> 3:06:52.900]  to shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big
[3:06:52.900 --> 3:06:55.900]  cities and go under communist, commune control.
[3:06:55.900 --> 3:06:56.900]  And that's all this is.
[3:06:56.900 --> 3:07:00.900]  The big mega banks want to break us to the same ones that put Mousetown into power,
[3:07:00.900 --> 3:07:03.900]  and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and bringing in the
[3:07:03.900 --> 3:07:08.900]  new economy where everything's free, because when you're a president, well, everything's
[3:07:08.900 --> 3:07:10.900]  free, but you're also a slave.
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:14.900]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level.
[3:07:14.900 --> 3:07:19.900]  But of course, you got to take those vaccines, you can't have any kids and oh, don't worry
[3:07:19.900 --> 3:07:23.900]  though, all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well.
[3:07:23.900 --> 3:07:24.900]  I'm not kidding.
[3:07:24.900 --> 3:07:26.900]  So give me some free paper.
[3:07:26.900 --> 3:07:30.900]  They give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment, but they own you.
[3:07:30.900 --> 3:07:31.900]  They control you.
[3:07:31.900 --> 3:07:32.900]  That's the Great Reset.
[3:07:32.900 --> 3:07:38.900]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at infowars.com.
[3:07:38.900 --> 3:07:43.900]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year
[3:07:43.900 --> 3:07:44.900]  2021.
[3:07:44.900 --> 3:07:45.900]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:07:45.900 --> 3:07:49.900]  I started info wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[3:07:49.900 --> 3:07:54.900]  And now info wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet
[3:07:54.900 --> 3:07:57.900]  is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on.
[3:07:57.900 --> 3:08:01.900]  That's why it's so important for those of you out there that have supported the broadcast
[3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:05.900]  and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out to realize
[3:08:05.900 --> 3:08:08.900]  how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.
[3:08:08.900 --> 3:08:10.900]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:08:10.900 --> 3:08:12.900]  Also, as Christmas is almost here.
[3:08:12.900 --> 3:08:13.900]  Don't wait.

[3:08:37.900 --> 3:08:44.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:00.900 --> 3:09:05.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:09:05.900 --> 3:09:11.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:09:15.900 --> 3:09:19.900]  Thank you, thank you, thank you for having me on infowar.
[3:09:19.900 --> 3:09:25.900]  And I have to disagree with Alex.
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:28.900]  He said he wishes you a Merry Christmas.
[3:09:28.900 --> 3:09:32.900]  You're not allowed to wish anybody a Merry Christmas anymore.
[3:09:32.900 --> 3:09:36.900]  It's a whole new game.
[3:09:36.900 --> 3:09:39.900]  You better watch out.
[3:09:39.900 --> 3:09:41.900]  You better not cry.
[3:09:41.900 --> 3:09:42.900]  You better be good.
[3:09:42.900 --> 3:09:43.900]  I'm telling you why.
[3:09:43.900 --> 3:09:47.900]  Satan Claus has come into town.
[3:09:47.900 --> 3:09:48.900]  He knows when you've been sleeping.
[3:09:48.900 --> 3:09:50.900]  He knows when you're awake.
[3:09:50.900 --> 3:09:52.900]  He knows if you've been vaccinated.
[3:09:52.900 --> 3:09:57.900]  So get vaccinated for health's sake.
[3:09:57.900 --> 3:10:01.900]  Yeah, that's what's happened.
[3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:03.900]  It's gone.
[3:10:03.900 --> 3:10:04.900]  Look at this.
[3:10:04.900 --> 3:10:08.900]  Behind a shield.
[3:10:08.900 --> 3:10:13.900]  That's the way they're celebrating Christmas.
[3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:14.900]  Isn't that something?
[3:10:14.900 --> 3:10:16.900]  Temperature screening.
[3:10:16.900 --> 3:10:19.900]  Look at the little elves cleaning the thing.
[3:10:19.900 --> 3:10:20.900]  That's right.
[3:10:20.900 --> 3:10:22.900]  You could zoom online.
[3:10:22.900 --> 3:10:24.900]  It's just as good.
[3:10:24.900 --> 3:10:30.900]  Yeah, it's the Satanic Silicon Valley dead people.
[3:10:30.900 --> 3:10:35.900]  They zoom in as just as good as being there.
[3:10:35.900 --> 3:10:39.900]  You know, I sent these guys a picture of me when I was a kid
[3:10:39.900 --> 3:10:40.900]  sitting on Santa's lap.
[3:10:40.900 --> 3:10:42.900]  I want to see if they got it yet.
[3:10:42.900 --> 3:10:44.900]  Here I am.
[3:10:44.900 --> 3:10:46.900]  Look at that.
[3:10:46.900 --> 3:10:49.900]  You can't do that anymore.
[3:10:49.900 --> 3:10:52.900]  Can you imagine a heartbreak coming out of kids?
[3:10:52.900 --> 3:10:55.900]  Look what it used to be.
[3:10:55.900 --> 3:10:57.900]  Look at it.
[3:10:57.900 --> 3:10:59.900]  And now that's gone.
[3:10:59.900 --> 3:11:01.900]  Look what it is now.
[3:11:01.900 --> 3:11:06.900]  A shield separated.
[3:11:06.900 --> 3:11:11.900]  Satan is slaughtering Santa.
[3:11:11.900 --> 3:11:13.900]  You're not going to go out.
[3:11:13.900 --> 3:11:18.900]  You're not going to go travel to be with loved ones this Christmas.
[3:11:18.900 --> 3:11:20.900]  This is the order.
[3:11:20.900 --> 3:11:23.900]  This is the order.
[3:11:23.900 --> 3:11:25.900]  You will not travel.
[3:11:25.900 --> 3:11:29.900]  And look at the latest data.
[3:11:29.900 --> 3:11:36.900]  69% of the people 70% are not going to travel to be with loved ones.
[3:11:36.900 --> 3:11:42.900]  To celebrate.
[3:11:42.900 --> 3:11:47.900]  To celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[3:11:47.900 --> 3:11:52.900]  That's prohibited under law.
[3:11:52.900 --> 3:11:57.900]  Look what they're telling.
[3:11:57.900 --> 3:11:59.900]  You can't go out and shop.
[3:11:59.900 --> 3:12:05.900]  No, you can get it on Amazon.
[3:12:05.900 --> 3:12:12.900]  If you want to look at a devilish figure, boy, that cat got some look
[3:12:12.900 --> 3:12:14.900]  that ain't for me.
[3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:21.900]  And one after another, they're destroying the beauty of life.
[3:12:21.900 --> 3:12:24.900]  This is not a merry Christmas.
[3:12:24.900 --> 3:12:26.900]  And where are the people?
[3:12:26.900 --> 3:12:29.900]  How come they're not standing up?
[3:12:29.900 --> 3:12:33.900]  How come they're not saying, no, I'm not going to do this.
[3:12:33.900 --> 3:12:38.900]  Oh, and by the way, by the way, you little stupid morons,
[3:12:38.900 --> 3:12:49.900]  you little imbecilic SOBs, these little children that are now zoomed to Santa,
[3:12:49.900 --> 3:12:58.900]  they're not susceptible to the disease according to the data.
[3:12:58.900 --> 3:13:03.900]  The recovery rate of people one to 20 years old,
[3:13:03.900 --> 3:13:07.900]  according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
[3:13:07.900 --> 3:13:11.900]  Look at that is 99.997%.
[3:13:11.900 --> 3:13:12.900]  That's a fact.
[3:13:12.900 --> 3:13:15.900]  Look how freaked out the people are.
[3:13:15.900 --> 3:13:21.900]  Help. Remember when Santa used to go down the chimney?
[3:13:21.900 --> 3:13:26.900]  Now you got to get all that dust out of that chimney and make it perfectly clean
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:28.900]  and sanitize it.
[3:13:28.900 --> 3:13:33.900]  Oh, when Santa can't come into your house anymore,
[3:13:33.900 --> 3:13:38.900]  strangers are not allowed in your home anymore.
[3:13:38.900 --> 3:13:42.900]  There will be no more Santa coming down the chimney.
[3:13:42.900 --> 3:13:46.900]  Look at this. Look how freaked out the freaks are.
[3:13:46.900 --> 3:13:48.900]  How come that little kid?
[3:13:48.900 --> 3:13:50.900]  I think that kid is over two years old.
[3:13:50.900 --> 3:13:56.900]  How come it doesn't have a mask on?
[3:13:56.900 --> 3:14:00.900]  Satan Claus has come to town.
[3:14:00.900 --> 3:14:04.900]  This is not a merry Christmas.
[3:14:04.900 --> 3:14:11.900]  Imagine telling us that we must get vaccinated.
[3:14:11.900 --> 3:14:17.900]  Then they'll allow us to sit on Santa's lap.
[3:14:17.900 --> 3:14:21.900]  Telling us not to be with our loved ones.
[3:14:21.900 --> 3:14:25.900]  Man, when I was a kid, we had Christmas dinners.
[3:14:25.900 --> 3:14:27.900]  We had 25 people over.
[3:14:27.900 --> 3:14:30.900]  My aunts, my uncles, my cousins.
[3:14:30.900 --> 3:14:35.900]  We should start eating about 1.30 in the afternoon.
[3:14:35.900 --> 3:14:38.900]  We got the pasta.
[3:14:38.900 --> 3:14:41.900]  We got the lasagna.
[3:14:41.900 --> 3:14:44.900]  And then later, we got the kids to go out and play.
[3:14:44.900 --> 3:14:49.900]  And then we'd have turkey.
[3:14:49.900 --> 3:14:50.900]  We didn't finish.
[3:14:50.900 --> 3:14:53.900]  They didn't go home until like 8, 9 o'clock at night,
[3:14:53.900 --> 3:14:58.900]  partying all day long.
[3:14:58.900 --> 3:15:01.900]  And now it's all gone.
[3:15:01.900 --> 3:15:07.900]  Being stolen in front of our eyes and hearts and souls.
[3:15:07.900 --> 3:15:10.900]  For what?
[3:15:10.900 --> 3:15:12.900]  For the virus.
[3:15:12.900 --> 3:15:20.900]  It has a 99.8% recovery rate.
[3:15:20.900 --> 3:15:23.900]  Ah, they didn't close down Sweden
[3:15:23.900 --> 3:15:25.900]  and look how they're paying for it.
[3:15:25.900 --> 3:15:26.900]  Oh, yeah.
[3:15:26.900 --> 3:15:28.900]  They only have about 7,000 deaths
[3:15:28.900 --> 3:15:30.900]  and about 10 million people.
[3:15:30.900 --> 3:15:33.900]  But in the fascist state of Michigan,
[3:15:33.900 --> 3:15:41.900]  with about 9 million, maybe 500 people, 600 people,
[3:15:41.900 --> 3:15:46.900]  they have over 10,000 deaths and they're totally locked down.
[3:15:46.900 --> 3:15:48.900]  It's not a merry Christmas.
[3:15:48.900 --> 3:15:51.900]  All these bars and businesses,
[3:15:51.900 --> 3:15:54.900]  all the small retailers going under
[3:15:54.900 --> 3:15:57.900]  when the time when they make it the best.
[3:15:57.900 --> 3:16:01.900]  All the holiday parties and cheer.
[3:16:01.900 --> 3:16:05.900]  The streets outside here are dead.
[3:16:05.900 --> 3:16:09.900]  On the whole block, I counted four cars.
[3:16:09.900 --> 3:16:10.900]  Park.
[3:16:10.900 --> 3:16:15.900]  You couldn't get a parking space here.
[3:16:15.900 --> 3:16:17.900]  People walking up and down the street
[3:16:17.900 --> 3:16:23.900]  with nobody on it with masks on.
[3:16:23.900 --> 3:16:28.900]  If we don't fight for freedom,
[3:16:28.900 --> 3:16:31.900]  we're going to die in hell on Earth.
[3:16:31.900 --> 3:16:34.900]  That's what this turned into.
[3:16:34.900 --> 3:16:37.900]  This isn't my kind of America.
[3:16:37.900 --> 3:16:41.900]  Not my kind of merry Christmas.
[3:16:41.900 --> 3:16:43.900]  This is sick.
[3:16:43.900 --> 3:16:49.900]  So do what you can to support Infowars, as Alex said.
[3:16:49.900 --> 3:16:51.900]  You know, a million dollars.
[3:16:51.900 --> 3:16:53.900]  I mean, I'm in business.
[3:16:53.900 --> 3:16:55.900]  Ain't a lot of dough to have in the bank.
[3:16:55.900 --> 3:16:57.900]  Not when you have all the employees that they have.
[3:16:57.900 --> 3:17:00.900]  And do the job that they do.
[3:17:00.900 --> 3:17:02.900]  I do a lot of shows.
[3:17:02.900 --> 3:17:05.900]  They're the best of the best.
[3:17:05.900 --> 3:17:09.900]  They give everything they have to make it happen.
[3:17:09.900 --> 3:17:12.900]  So you give everything you have to make it happen.
[3:17:12.900 --> 3:17:16.900]  Unless you want to keep living hell on Earth.
[3:17:16.900 --> 3:17:21.900]  We must unite universally for freedom, peace and justice.
[3:17:21.900 --> 3:17:25.900]  Start by putting your heart and mind
[3:17:25.900 --> 3:17:27.900]  where your pocketbook is.
[3:17:27.900 --> 3:17:30.900]  And buy those great products from Infowars.
[3:17:30.900 --> 3:17:56.900]  Build your immune system. Get strong.
[3:18:00.900 --> 3:18:03.900]  And join every other answer is completely clear.
[3:18:03.900 --> 3:18:05.900]  That's why they hate Infowars.
[3:18:05.900 --> 3:18:07.900]  We believe in humanity. We think you're beautiful.
[3:18:07.900 --> 3:18:09.900]  We think you're amazing.
[3:18:09.900 --> 3:18:11.900]  Infowars knows you're fallen,
[3:18:11.900 --> 3:18:14.900]  but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[3:18:14.900 --> 3:18:17.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[3:18:17.900 --> 3:18:18.900]  It's now upon us.
[3:18:18.900 --> 3:18:20.900]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about Infowars
[3:18:20.900 --> 3:18:21.900]  now more than ever,
[3:18:21.900 --> 3:18:24.900]  when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[3:18:24.900 --> 3:18:26.900]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[3:18:26.900 --> 3:18:27.900]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[3:18:27.900 --> 3:18:30.900]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[3:18:30.900 --> 3:18:35.900]  Because God's on our side, and the globalists know it.
[3:18:35.900 --> 3:18:40.900]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns
[3:18:40.900 --> 3:18:43.900]  directed by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[3:18:43.900 --> 3:18:47.900]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient,
[3:18:47.900 --> 3:18:50.900]  the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns
[3:18:50.900 --> 3:18:52.900]  so you can't even leave your house,
[3:18:52.900 --> 3:18:54.900]  for months and months are being announced,
[3:18:54.900 --> 3:18:58.900]  and in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons
[3:18:58.900 --> 3:19:00.900]  to blast men, women, and children
[3:19:00.900 --> 3:19:04.900]  that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[3:19:04.900 --> 3:19:07.900]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[3:19:07.900 --> 3:19:10.900]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[3:19:10.900 --> 3:19:12.900]  This is world government.
[3:19:12.900 --> 3:19:16.900]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[3:19:16.900 --> 3:19:18.900]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[3:19:18.900 --> 3:19:21.900]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like.
[3:19:21.900 --> 3:19:24.900]  To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process,
[3:19:24.900 --> 3:19:29.900]  and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:31.900]  How long have we warned you about this?
[3:19:31.900 --> 3:19:32.900]  But you can fight back.
[3:19:32.900 --> 3:19:34.900]  America is the last bastion.

[3:20:12.900 --> 3:20:14.900]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[3:20:14.900 --> 3:20:16.900]  but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[3:20:16.900 --> 3:20:20.900]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[3:21:07.900 --> 3:21:11.900]  Reaping on the Alex Jones Show, and info wars,
[3:21:11.900 --> 3:21:13.900]  and again, do what you can to support the truth.
[3:21:13.900 --> 3:21:15.900]  It's being killed, destroyed in front of us.
[3:21:15.900 --> 3:21:21.580]  front of us, I'm getting more and more sensors from LinkedIn. You're not allowed to say,
[3:21:21.580 --> 3:21:27.700]  Hyal Hitler. I, um, I did a little poem, you know, get back in your house, get back in
[3:21:27.700 --> 3:21:32.500]  your house, you know, don't go out and play, get back in your house, get back in your house.
[3:21:32.500 --> 3:21:37.620]  I'll tell you where to stay. Get back in your house, get back in your house. You will obey
[3:21:37.620 --> 3:21:44.540]  Hyal Hitler. I got censored for that. I got censored for saying that if we don't fight
[3:21:44.540 --> 3:21:49.580]  liars, cowards, freaks and fools who are running and destroying our lives will continue
[3:21:49.580 --> 3:21:54.900]  to ruin it. I got censored. That was called bullying and harassment. And this just came
[3:21:54.900 --> 3:22:06.900]  in from Google. Hi, Gerald Salenty. We wanted to let you know our team reviewed your content
[3:22:06.900 --> 3:22:18.100]  and we think it violates our medical misinformation policy. We think, we think and therefore it
[3:22:18.100 --> 3:22:26.480]  is our medical misinformation policy. These people, just so everyone listening knows and
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:37.300]  understands this at the YouTube community owned by alphabet. They have the only medical
[3:22:37.300 --> 3:22:45.340]  information that is worth looking at and all the rest is misinformation. We know you may
[3:22:45.340 --> 3:22:52.260]  not have realized this was a violation of our policies. So we're not applying a strike
[3:22:52.260 --> 3:23:00.060]  to your channel. However, we have removed the following content from YouTube. The video
[3:23:00.060 --> 3:23:15.080]  was Corona hysteria, prostitutes and politicians killing economy. Corona hysteria. Oh, no,
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:21.320]  it's not hysteria. People are in hysterical. No, no, people is normal for people to wear
[3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:28.440]  masks, not to visit each other on holidays, not allow other people from other homes into
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:41.640]  their home, work from home. Don't go out at night. That's not hysteria. And prostitutes
[3:23:41.640 --> 3:23:50.880]  and politicians killing the economy. Oh, no, the economy is doing just fine. It's great.
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:24:01.360]  Yeah, look at that. I have a sister in a nursing home. I can't go see her. I call her up every
[3:24:01.360 --> 3:24:09.560]  day she cries. My sister Grace. The only way I could go see her, she has to be, I could
[3:24:09.560 --> 3:24:16.640]  go by and she could wave to me. I can't bring her food. I used to cook for all the time.
[3:24:16.640 --> 3:24:25.840]  About 90 miles away, try to, you know, go every couple of weeks. Yeah, it's not even
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:34.040]  that good luck to do it now. You can't, you're behind the door. This is craziness. It's destroying
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:40.120]  our lives in front of us. So I'm not allowed to say that. We realize this may be disappointing
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:46.840]  news, but it's our job to make sure that YouTube is a safe place for all. Oh, and matter of
[3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:52.880]  fact, I guess when I put my videos on YouTube, I should make sure I wear a mask so I could
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:58.880]  be as stupid and ignorant as all those little low life prostitutes that have a microphone
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:04.120]  in front of them and nobody around them with a mask on as my glasses are fogging up. And
[3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:10.520]  of course breathing in carbon dioxide is really good for you and you don't need fresh air.
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:21.200]  YouTube doesn't allow content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local health authorities.
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:36.040]  How's that for a big fat joke? Take a look at the health authority from Pennsylvania.
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:50.400]  How about that? Rachel Lola, L-O-L-Lola Levin. Did you ever see a picture of him, huh? Him,
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:58.160]  huh, got mad at a reporter for calling him her son. That's the health authority that
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:09.920]  they're telling us to listen to. Rachel Levin. How about that health authority from Los Angeles?
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:17.800]  There's Rachel. Now, there's a, he should, she should tell me, oh, by the way, I have
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:24.520]  an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences. First book I worked on
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:33.040]  was Natural Healing and Mr. Triple Chin Levin. Don't you tell me what to do health-wise or
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:45.680]  any other way? Fatty, slob looking, health minister of nothing. How can anybody with
[3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:55.680]  a brain bigger than a pee? Listen to that guy, girl, man, woman, whoever. And I'm not
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:01.640]  against any race creed color and all I'd translate so I could kill less. But don't shove your
[3:27:01.640 --> 3:27:07.760]  crap down my throat and think you're going to do it and get away with it. This is the
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:14.160]  clown that didn't tell people they can't go out on Thanksgiving the night before Thanksgiving.
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:19.040]  They locked down all the bars, put people out of business. This is the time when everybody
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:25.040]  goes out and has a great time, but no more. And look at that woman over there in, in,
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:38.480]  in Los Angeles. She's a skeleton, a skeleton telling us what to do. But we have to listen
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:44.800]  to health authorities or the World Health Organization guidance on social distancing
[3:27:44.800 --> 3:27:53.720]  and self-oscillation that may lead people to act against that guidance. I will do it.
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:28:08.520]  If I don't, all aboard next train to Auschwitz. Here she is. That's the health authority of
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:23.240]  Los Angeles. That is, was closing down, destroying the lives of, what, what do they have about
[3:28:23.240 --> 3:28:26.960]  California? 40 million people in the whole area. They're closing down. If it's almost
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:33.400]  now to 30 million, Los Angeles County has 10 million, but they keep expanding it. No
[3:28:33.400 --> 3:28:40.080]  Christmas shopping. No holiday spreading joy. No joy is not allowed to be spread. If you
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:49.280]  see try to spread joy, you will spread the virus. This is satanic. What's going on? And
[3:28:49.280 --> 3:28:54.880]  I'm mentioning that to you what they're doing to me, that they've done to Alex Jones. And
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:29:02.520]  only, we only put facts, hard scientific facts and data in the trends journal. We should
[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:10.440]  never have been censored for this. Never. So do what you can to support info wars and
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:25.360]  of course the trends journal. We must fight and unite for freedom, peace and justice because
[3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:31.320]  you can see what's going on in front of our eyes. The masses are marching off. They're
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:38.800]  not fighting, but does not take a majority to prevail. Rather an irate, tireless minority
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:50.960]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men and women. So Samuel Adams.
[3:29:50.960 --> 3:29:58.320]  And that's what we must do. So do what you can. This is, this is on. You cannot write
[3:29:58.320 --> 3:30:04.320]  a horror story worse than this one. If you try to sell it as a movie, no one would buy
[3:30:04.320 --> 3:30:17.720]  it. 2020 year, the world changed from life on earth to hell on earth. No fun allowed,
[3:30:17.720 --> 3:30:26.200]  no dancing, no kissing, no hugging, no squeezing, no feeling, the warmth and passion of love
[3:30:26.200 --> 3:30:35.680]  with a fellow human being. We back in just a few. Stay tuned.
[3:30:35.680 --> 3:30:39.720]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful

[3:31:52.920 --> 3:31:58.760]  Under UN control, establish a medical planetary dictatorship. At the core of it is the Fortune
[3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:05.360]  100 corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families, the Rothschilds,
[3:32:05.360 --> 3:32:09.600]  the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that. Then you
[3:32:09.600 --> 3:32:14.000]  learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time, but
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:21.080]  they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[3:32:21.080 --> 3:32:25.200]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it. They're involved in
[3:32:25.200 --> 3:32:29.240]  plotting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the masks are all about.
[3:32:29.240 --> 3:32:33.240]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your
[3:32:33.240 --> 3:32:40.760]  own destruction. Wake up. Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie
[3:32:40.760 --> 3:32:45.440]  where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you
[3:32:45.440 --> 3:32:50.760]  can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change
[3:32:50.760 --> 3:32:55.480]  your very DNA. That's where you are in the year 2020. Global government of the United
[3:32:55.480 --> 3:33:00.040]  Nations. All these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're
[3:33:00.040 --> 3:33:06.200]  doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19. That's what
[3:33:06.200 --> 3:33:11.040]  Klaus Schwab and others have said. Think about how insane that is. Oh, and big tech's got
[3:33:11.040 --> 3:33:14.840]  to track you. They've got to trace you. They've got to control you. You've got to have absolutely
[3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:19.400]  leave your house. Why? You've got to have secret police come disappear you because, my
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:23.440]  god, this thing has one-tenth of one percent chance of killing you. Give your debilitude
[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:29.320]  and cancer or a heart attack. This is their takeover. Imagine on America's dystopic,
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:36.520]  it killed by the fear of the common cold. Yeah, that's fear-mongering. That's mind control.
[3:33:36.520 --> 3:33:41.400]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:46.200]  establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:52.040]  taking office for second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder
[3:33:52.040 --> 3:33:55.960]  than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:33:59.880]  down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S. So
[3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:04.440]  it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is
[3:34:04.440 --> 3:34:08.560]  economic war. We are being consolidated. We are being taken over. The Democrats aren't
[3:34:08.560 --> 3:34:13.160]  mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to
[3:34:13.160 --> 3:34:18.120]  bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heel and then consolidate ownership of
[3:34:18.120 --> 3:34:22.600]  all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:27.640]  great reset is. Clout Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:32.880]  is. So your business is only at 25 percent for several more years. No small businesses
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:39.320]  will be there. This is a master plan. Say no.
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:35:01.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente.
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:06.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Great being back on the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:13.200]  Everything Alex is saying is 100 percent on. Bigs have taken over everything. All your
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:22.400]  little businesses get closed down. Walmart. Costco. Target. You could stay open. No social
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:30.640]  distancing. Get in there as many as you want. You know the numbers. The billionaires since
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:35.440]  this happened got trillions since they locked down everything. All the money's going to
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:42.720]  the hands of the few. All we are are plantation workers in slave landia. So if you're going
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:47.360]  to want to let freedom ring do what you can to support info wars and they have some great

[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:40.600]  to take your dollars and give them to the enemies of America. And to me they are the
[3:36:40.600 --> 3:36:46.640]  part of the whole deal. So instead of supporting the companies that seek to silence the voices
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:54.160]  of true conservative I say Patriots. You know why not support info wars. And they're the
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:37:01.080]  only organization built by and for true patriots. Well we're along with them. And that's why

[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:28.480]  off one after another. So be better. It's better to be prepared and unaware as I say
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:32.240]  you know prepare for the worst if the worst doesn't happen you lose nothing. If you don't
[3:37:32.240 --> 3:37:37.240]  prepare for the worst and the worst happens you lose everything. So support the info wars
[3:37:37.240 --> 3:37:48.200]  crew. They're terrific in their fight against tyranny today at info wars stores.com. Today
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:58.440]  December 1st. Excuse me December 7th. Twenty twenty one. Sixty nine years ago. More was
[3:37:58.440 --> 3:38:13.280]  it. More than that. But seventy nine. Pearl Harbor. December 7th. 1941. Not even a mention
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:23.960]  of it in the news. Zero not a nothing. Two thousand Americans. Killed in Pearl Harbor
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:38.280]  by the Japanese. Thousands wounded. Some eighteen ships I think five battleships sunk. Not a
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:49.480]  word about World War two. Gone. Forgotten. And I'm a lucky guy. Because. There you go.
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:55.840]  Donald Trump remembered it. We're the same age. I'm born in nineteen forty six right
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:39:05.240]  after the war. So I I really. Grew up at a really terrific time. Said sisters in their
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:11.000]  life born in the nineteen thirties. And younger ones they call ginger life kids born in the
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:20.560]  sixties. My grandparents born in the eighteen hundred. So I saw all of this. And I saw America.
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:28.760]  And it's patriotic high. After World War two. It came out with the hottest happiest music
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:36.880]  man. It was rocking and rolling time. It was time to let loose and be free. Not anymore.
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:45.400]  You will not sing. You're not even allowed to sing Christmas carols. That's how low
[3:39:45.400 --> 3:39:54.200]  America is gone. And just a few weeks ago. November twenty second. The assassination
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:40:04.920]  of JFK. Not a peep by the press. It's about it. Nothing. Not a zero. I have a photo of
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:09.680]  me John Connelly. He was the governor of Texas. It took the bullet in the back. And
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:16.520]  me and his wife. With the book depository over our shoulder. I'll show you to sometime
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:24.520]  again. We wrote about it. And it was the first time back since the assassination. Tell us
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:30.600]  what happened that day. It was parked out in front. That's the side of the building.
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:41.320]  So that's where we are in America. The greatness is gone. Gone. Fear hysteria hate and divisiveness
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:51.360]  is what sells. Merry Christmas. The lies that are being destroyed. The businesses took lifetimes
[3:40:51.360 --> 3:41:01.200]  to build wiped out. Wipe down. The bigs will get bigger. They'll throw us little pennies
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:06.680]  plantation workers. Get back in your house. Go on. Get back in there. Yeah. Get on a food
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:20.680]  line. You get some food. Just shut up. Get a job. Stacking shelves and shipping out stuff.
[3:41:20.680 --> 3:41:24.600]  Don't go to college. It's worthless anymore. You don't need a degree. We'll tell you what
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:29.600]  to do. And you can't afford one anyway. The colleges are closing down turning to ghost
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:37.800]  towns. I want to hit a few of our top trends. Do one next week. The twenty twenty one. We're
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:44.600]  going to be putting them out today in the trends journal. And so you better prepare.
[3:41:44.600 --> 3:41:50.400]  One of them is going to is the greatest oppression. It's begun. But people aren't going to see
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:56.600]  it. They're going to deny it. Just like they do in Argentina and Venezuela and other countries
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:42:01.760]  suffering all throughout Africa. The great depressions. But they'll keep the equity markets
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:07.560]  high. Keep the highs high. And the little people will think everything's fine because
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:12.640]  the prostitutes in the business media say you see we've got more jobs. Oh yeah. But how
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:16.760]  many really are unemployed. Well we won't count them because once your unemployment is over
[3:42:16.760 --> 3:42:21.960]  you're not counted anymore. So they're going to keep the illusion that things are coming
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:29.600]  back. And they won't realize the crash happens until the equity markets crash. But the gangsters
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:36.160]  the banksters will do everything to artificially prop them up. Oh and before I forget I mentioned
[3:42:36.160 --> 3:42:41.560]  the word gangster and a person that used to teach my teacher John Perkins not to John
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:47.360]  Perkins and TV another one from tech proof dot com my close combat teacher his teacher
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:54.400]  Brad Steiner who writes for us in the trends journal on survivalism. These are the top
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:43:01.280]  close combat experts in the United States just passed away this Saturday. So I'm heartbroken
[3:43:01.280 --> 3:43:08.800]  about that. And I'm learning more later. But going back to the greatest depression the
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:13.720]  gangsters are in charge and they're going to keep the fraud going. They'll keep making
[3:43:13.720 --> 3:43:19.960]  money the trillionaires will get richer as we all get poorer. That'll be until the time
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:30.120]  we unite universally the peace freedom and justice freedom peace and justice is the
[3:43:30.120 --> 3:43:37.560]  only way I see the future to be higher. Another movement we're going to see is anti tax anti
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:45.400]  tax political parties. Big resistance is going to happen with this. And when Alex asked me
[3:43:45.400 --> 3:43:51.520]  before what's the way to meet the one of the ways is we have to start a new political party.
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:56.920]  The Republicans abandoned Trump. They're not in his team. They play along with them as
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:44:02.400]  much as they can. They mentioned the Supreme Court people you don't get to those kind of
[3:44:02.400 --> 3:44:07.280]  positions without being a member of the club. And they're only going to take just so much
[3:44:07.280 --> 3:44:19.000]  pressure before they bend. Few won't. But the majority might. So we're going to see
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:28.080]  a big movement for a new way. I've never seen it better in my life. We need people to represent
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:35.160]  we the people of the United States. Not big businesses that pay off these little low life
[3:44:35.160 --> 3:44:41.120]  scum politicians. And by the way you could pay him off cheaply because they have no value
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:49.800]  of currencies. They never worked a day in their lives. So they don't care. They just
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:55.560]  get enough to live on and a lot more easy life. That's all they're concerned about.
[3:44:55.560 --> 3:45:03.040]  So again please do what you can to support info wars. We all need your help to keep
[3:45:03.040 --> 3:45:09.720]  truth alive and freedom and justice prevailing and liberty which they're locking us out of
[3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:15.360]  and locking us down to not to have any to put your money where your heart and mind is
[3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:42.360]  supported for wars. And of course you're not going to run in this kind of journals uptrend.
