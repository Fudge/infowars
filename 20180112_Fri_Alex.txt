[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  Music
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  Wow, things just get more and more explosive, more and more interesting.
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  It was two weeks ago, they had another previous hoax,
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  that Trump said everybody coming from Haiti has AIDS, or HIV.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Of course, it turns out that wasn't true.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  The same anonymous sources, you know, tell us that Trump didn't want to run for president,
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  didn't want to win, that his wife hates it.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  The same sources told us he would lose the election.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  The same sources told us he'd throw it to Hillary.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  The same sources told us he wouldn't give us tax cuts.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  The same sources said he wouldn't try to reform the VA.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  The same sources said he wouldn't pull out of the TPP.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  The same sources said that he was going to sign DACA and screw us over.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  He just didn't go with their bad plan.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  He was just trying to do a deal.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  And he's still being attacked by the trolls and the bots on infowars.com that we know are bots,
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  saying, Trump betrayed us on DACA when he didn't betray you on DACA, just as we said he wouldn't.
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  And then someone in the Oval Office, there were other witnesses say he didn't say it,
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  whispered to somebody, why aren't we only getting people from, you know what, whole countries?
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  And that's the other big controversy.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  Remember F. Lee Bailey, the famous corrupt lawyer, known for big problems,
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  a million dollar fines, you name it.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  Remember F. Lee Bailey on the OJ Simpson trial, they had a white guy do it,
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  get up and say the N-word over and over and over again to the black jury.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  And that's how they got him off.
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  He said the N-word 41 times.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  I want to go to YouTube and grab it for documentary purposes.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  They aired it on court TV, ABC, NBC, NBC.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  But I remember years later, airing it on talk radio,
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  the station manager coming and saying, you don't do that.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  And that's the big issue.
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  CNN, MSNBC, broadcast, you name it, on CBS, ABC,
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  they are saying every 10 minutes, they're playing the clip.
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  Sometimes every minute of quoting the president when he says he didn't say it,
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  saying these are SH, you know what, T countries.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  We've got Acosta saying it.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  We've got them all saying it on CNN, you name it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  Again, just like F. Lee Bailey saying the N-word over and over and over and over again.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  You can't use it, but if a liberal, fraudulent, corrupt lawyer in my view,
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  has to use it to manipulate a jury and let it can clearly a guilty man go free,
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  as we now know, if you want to do that, you are a bad person if you're not the establishment.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  But if you're the establishment, you can.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  So CNN to inflame emotions, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC,
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  they're all quoting the president as saying this and saying it to get people out of their comfort zone
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  on mainstream TV to suddenly hear them cussing.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  If I cuss or a caller slips through, our stations complain.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  We've lost affiliates before because the FCC will selectively find them
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  or Howard Stern, if he wants to say SHIT, he had to leave terrestrial radio
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  because sometimes it would slip through.
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  But now mainstream media, they can all do it
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  because the executives are saying go full bore, do whatever you want, take them out.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  That's why they've got former Democrat governors on infowars.com saying they will punch out the president.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  They'll kill Republicans.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  This is what they say.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.000]  And people are getting attacked.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Hot coffee is getting thrown on them.
[03:52.000 --> 03:53.000]  They're getting shot.
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.000]  They're getting beat up.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  They're getting their families assaulted.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  And they think it's funny as they usher this country towards civil war.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  And notice the left hadn't come out that I've seen and denied the new documents that came out from the Soros group
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  trying to trigger martial law and race riots when Obama had only a year left in office.
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.000]  See?
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  That story up on infowars.com.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  Incredible.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  I believe the president that he didn't say it, but we've seen them lie about him over and over again.
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.000]  I could say that sources say the president snorts methamphetamine in the White House off hooker's rear ends.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  Not true, but if I shed it on CNN, they would all parrot it to give it credibility.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Think about that.
[04:38.000 --> 04:47.000]  But we're also going to discuss the difference between free countries and OACs of liberty versus crap holes and hell holes.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  Because there's things even worse than crap holes.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, Haiti is a hell hole.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  That's why everybody's trying to get out of the crap hole.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  It's a fact.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  I think the president's just go with it.
[05:26.000 --> 05:38.000]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms,
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo from Peru,
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  Reach your alpha male potential with alpha power.
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  Get alpha power now at 50% off and secure your bottle today.
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, we had more fake news out of the fake news globalist media.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  They reported unnamed sources saying the president had said,
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  I don't want Haitians in America.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  They've all got AIDS.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  But nobody ever comes forward.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  There's no recordings.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  There's over 50 people in the room, but nobody's got a recording of it.
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  Well, the same thing yet again, an anonymous source that Trump calls Haiti and other third world countries,
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  SH, you know what he holds.
[06:53.000 --> 07:01.000]  And then CNN, MSNBC, NBC, they're all including broadcast TV, not just cable art saying that unedited.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  Just like F. Lee Bailey and the O.J. Simpson trial 41 times said the N-word.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  They had a white guy do it to make it worse, to have that emotional response of a white guy to black people's faces calling him the N-word.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  Not a black man, not a black woman.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  They made the decision to do it.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  They got it in their face and then they transmuted that onto the police department.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  The black jury did.
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.000]  They admitted it later.
[07:23.000 --> 07:30.000]  Some of them said they were conned onto the police department and onto the prosecution.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  And it's the same thing.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  You never hear them say those things on television.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  They're not supposed to under the FCC, but they're doing it because they want to stick the knife in, turn the edge and then put salt in the wound.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  Total manipulation.
[07:46.000 --> 07:53.000]  Separately, Trump has said he didn't say it, but no matter how many times they put out fake news and get caught, they're getting more desperate.
[07:53.000 --> 07:58.000]  They've got governors on TV, Democrats saying, I'm going to physically assault the president.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  They're trying to start uprisings in the country.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  They see the prosperity coming back.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  They see the dependency folding.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  They see black unemployment.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  The lowest it's ever been since they had the Bureau of Labor Statistics for over 70-plus years.
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  They're in full panic mode.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  They want to domesticate and control everybody.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  And that's why they're so angry right now, the poverty pimps that want to control these people.
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.000]  But let's talk about facts.
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  I don't brag about it.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  I don't make a big issue out of it.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  But I've bought hospital beds for people in Latin America and for groups.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  And I've bought hundreds of wells and hundreds of cows for people in four different African nations.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  But I picked countries that are somewhat half-stable where you have poor people who can actually help like Kenya and other areas.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  I never made a big deal about that.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  My grandmother, I tried to give her some money.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  She insisted on living in a very, very humble house and clipping coupons and all that.
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  I tried to help her and she would say, no, just give money to this Latin American group or give money to this African group.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  And I've given hundreds of thousands of dollars to that.
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  Hundreds of thousands to investigating pedophile rings that we're not going to brag about our successes here on air.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  I mean, that's what I do.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  But since we're going to get out here and say, calling Haiti or other third world crap holes, crap holes is what they are.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  It's the name for them.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  I mean, they're hell holes.
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  Go move there, Don Lemon.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Go move there, Al Sharpton.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Go move there, Hillary Clinton.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  Oh, but Hillary just has her people caught smuggling kids out of Haiti, Associated Press.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  They get convicted.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  You just have them stealing $2 billion of the $2.1 billion that got donated from the Haitians.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  But it's okay to actually steal from them.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  I've sent food shipments into Haiti, I have finance and supported multiple groups that have done it.
[09:43.000 --> 09:52.000]  I've sent my reporters in to the risk of their lives and I'm not tooting my horn, but I'm actually there helping people in the beyond of crap hole.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.000]  It's a hell hole.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  We have transported the dead and dying.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  We have funded it.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  The Clintons stole all the money.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  I have done more than the Clintons did for Haiti.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  But they're going to sit up there like Oprah sticking her tongue in Weinstein's ear and taking Weinstein, you know, to setting women up for Weinstein.
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  Seal, who I've always really liked, has come out and said she's a monster and that she's supporting the evil and that she's exactly what she claims she's fighting.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  And that's the truth.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  God bless Seal, great artist.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  Love all his music.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  The point is, is you got to have a soul to sing like that and you got to be smart.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  The point is, is that that's a real human being.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  Seal.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  Don't care if he's black or white.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  I love his truth and his justice.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  Oprah's a pig and a lying creature.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  And the media sits there and covers it up and it's sick because they know she's sold out.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  Two plus billion dollars stolen.
[10:45.000 --> 10:54.000]  And all these women are coming out that Oprah, who was always a pimp, a little girl, she admits it, was bringing women to Weinstein for him to rape them.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  You notice the media won't pick up that when I cover it. They'll just misrepresent what I'm saying and say I don't like her because she's black.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  That's the headline.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  Alex attacks Oprah for being black.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  That was the headline though last week.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  Total lie.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  Just like they're lying about the president.
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  But Seal sees through it the 10 time or whatever platinum winner.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  He sees through their lies and he's going against Hollywood and the whole thing.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  If you know they'll have repercussions against him.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  So that's why I'm angry.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  I don't care if you're black, white or whatever.
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  If you're dying, I want to try to help you.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  And I know some Haitians that are beautiful, smart, wonderful people that live in America.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  But it's been a colony of slavery.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  Never got out from under it.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  Voodoo, the occult.
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  It is a very, very wicked system there in Haiti, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  And I've been involved with groups trying to stabilize the country and actually help it with Bob Barr and others.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  But this is the reality.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  I don't get off on seeing Haiti so fallen and broke back and falling apart.
[11:51.000 --> 11:59.000]  It makes me feel bad as a human that they're in such bad situations and seem to be cursed with tsunamis and earthquakes and just...
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  I'd actually tried to do something.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  And so as President Trump, he sent more aid to Haiti than the Clintons ever did.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  But if he even made the comment of why don't we ever bring people from productive countries to build up our nation?
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  Why do we only bring people here from crap holes?
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  Which he didn't even say.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  But did he steal the money?
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  No.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  See, robbing them, killing them and taking their children, kidnapping their children.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  That's okay.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  But the media then puts out a fake statement on the President and are now calling for his impeachment.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  And they're calling for physical assaults.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  And they're calling him a racist.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  And they're playing it unedited with the low English.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  That's really all it is.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  The Norman took over England 900 years ago.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  And they said, your language is illegal.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  So that's the last few words left of it.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And they're still illegal today.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  But if you expand on that, ladies and gentlemen, that's what political correctness is.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  When you conquer a people, you get rid of their language.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  George Arwell wrote about that.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  So it's documented the Clintons did this.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  It's on record.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  The mainstream corporate media will not cover it.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  We're covering it.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  And there's so many angles to learn from this event, this teachable moment of the type of committed fraud they're involved in.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  It shows you even the economy coming back and even Trump really at 60% in real polls, they're not going to give up.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  They're never going to stop ever because they've taken control of this country.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  The globalists had run it in the ground.
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  They were setting up racial and cultural divisions to control everybody and complete our journey into third world serfdom.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  And Trump's trying to stop that while really helping people.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  And they hit him at every angle.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Oh, he's betraying you on DACA.
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  Didn't do it, did he?
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  They got all the fake conservative bots out still saying he betrayed us.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  He's over.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  They're trying that tactic with bots everywhere when he didn't betray you again.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  They preach you like you're an idiot.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  They hope you're an idiot.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  So he doesn't go with their bad DACA deal.
[14:00.000 --> 14:08.000]  He wants a reasonable one for real people that are law abiding, been here for a long time since they were little and can prove that they are vetted in a good part of society.
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  You can stay and I'm all for that. And that's what he said three years ago and two years ago and the media lied about that.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  And then they use their lies and he said he hates all the Mexicans.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  Now he says he loves them.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  He flip flopped.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  He never said that.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  They're preying on you like you don't have a memory.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  Like they think you're stupid and it isn't about defending Trump.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  It's about defending the truth.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  We would be in so much trouble.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  And now they go, oh, he betrayed it again.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  Trump may have paved the way for a DACA deal.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  Will he now sabotage it?
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  See, he just wants a reasonable thing for 800,000 we think are vetted and deport people that are three, four, five time felons.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  And they just keep misrepresenting, misrepresenting.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  And that's why they hate this broadcast because you're getting really what's going on here.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  We really do our homework.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  Here, let's play CIA officer, mentally CIA.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  They make jokes with Jones fake news as he's CIA.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  He was CIA, but now he's not.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  And you know, same guy that tells you all this other crap.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  We'll get to him in a minute.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  Let's play Jim Acosta.
[15:08.000 --> 15:15.000]  First, a guy that's always in the White House with fake news, fake tweets, you know, saying that he didn't really visit Congressman Scalise.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Then there's video of it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  He thinks you don't remember that he lies to you every day.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  Here is one of the worst liars of a group of horrible liars.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  Here's Jim Acosta.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  Jim Shudo was saying with the president talking about immigrants coming from Mexico being rapists and criminals.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  And now this comment, the president referring to Haiti and countries in Africa as being,
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  and I noticed you, Wolf, you hesitated to use that word.
[15:38.000 --> 15:46.000]  I hesitate to use it myself as an S-hole or as what the word that the Washington Post is quoting the president is saying.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  I think, Wolf, what we have to come to grips with, and I almost have to think back to the day when we were at Trump Tower.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  We'll be back.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Stay with us.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  We'll be back with the truth.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  In total lies there.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  Remember, he said there's some criminals coming from Mexico.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  And like all of you out there, I had problems sleeping.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  Pillows would go flat.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  I would flip flop all night long.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.000]  When I invented my pillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual regardless of sleep position.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  My pillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  It's about how much of that quality sleep we get.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  I have a 10-year warranty.

[19:01.000 --> 19:19.000]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[19:52.000 --> 20:20.000]  Who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[20:20.000 --> 20:44.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:44.000 --> 20:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide, and this makes me so angry at mainstream media. They are just such globalist liars.
[20:55.000 --> 21:03.000]  Just like they said weeks ago, what the president said, oh, we don't want anybody from Haiti. They've all got AIDS. Turns out that's not true.
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.000]  Now you've got this quote. The president says he didn't say it. The media is saying it over and over again like he said it.
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  Really never even saying when I've been watching what he denied it. Like they'll go for 20 minutes and say, oh, by the way, he denies it.
[21:14.000 --> 21:29.000]  But S-hole, S-hole, S-hole, S-hole. Meanwhile, the Clintons literally raped Haiti and Rwanda and other areas and carried out and backed UN extermination programs that killed 800,000 Christians in one country.
[21:29.000 --> 21:45.000]  But that's okay to fund the Arab Spring and take over four countries and kill close to a half million and put over 100,000 women and children into sex slavery and have Lyndon Sorcer marching with a hajib on leading women in America teaching them to wearing hajibs and Islam as feminist.
[21:45.000 --> 21:58.000]  But the president with a fake quote calling a third world nation's crap holes. That's the number one story in the world. And what was it really all about?
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  What was the whole point of the entire situation from the beginning?
[22:05.000 --> 22:22.000]  What was the point to distract from the number one news story, not a mainstream media, but the number one story on the Internet yesterday, Veritas, Project Veritas, James O'Keefe with eight different executives of Twitter saying we're engaged in censorship against Christians and conservatives.
[22:22.000 --> 22:37.000]  If you support Trump, you're just banned. But you don't even know you're banned. No one can ever see what you say or do again. And the smirking, sickening, anti-American control freaks, it's the number one story.
[22:37.000 --> 22:46.000]  And what do they do? They go, all right, first we're going to say the whole thing about how they've all got AIDS. Then to make it sound congruent, even though it's fake, whenever we're ready, whenever we need it.
[22:46.000 --> 23:01.000]  This is key in crisis management. To cover up a real story, you use a fake story. And this is the mother of distractions. The Moab's the mother of bombs that's conventional. This is the Moab of distractions.
[23:01.000 --> 23:09.000]  And they build it. And then you'll hear more quotes. Yeah, he said he rapes Haitian babies. Yeah, he eats them. Yeah, and well, we just keep hearing about Haitians. It must be true.
[23:09.000 --> 23:18.000]  And they always pick a subject that Clintons are weak on. If they're on board the Jerry Epstein-Lelita Express pedophile airplane. If they're involved with a bunch of pedophiles.
[23:18.000 --> 23:26.000]  If they're on people got caught shipping hundreds of kids out of Haiti for sex slavery and people get convicted for it that worked directly for the Clintons. What do you do?
[23:26.000 --> 23:36.000]  You fake fake, you file fake lawsuits with Jane Doe's who don't even show up saying Trump was with Jerry Epstein raping them on the airplane. And then it later turns out it's not true.
[23:36.000 --> 23:48.000]  That's what you do. If you're Russian agents on the Russian payroll, like Mueller, like Comey, like the Clintons, like all these people, you just say Trump is.
[23:48.000 --> 24:03.000]  If you're a race-baiting Nazi collaborator like George Soros, who said he's proud of what he did working for Nazi Germany. What do you do? You have the Southern Poverty Law Center in ADL, you funds say Alex Jones is a Nazi.
[24:03.000 --> 24:14.000]  See how that works? See how they get that done? See how they manipulate everybody and they do it over and over and over and over and over again.
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  And next you're going to hear more and more and more and then you're going to have governors, the clip's coming up next segment.
[24:20.000 --> 24:33.000]  See if I see Trump, I'm going to assault him. Democrat. I'm going to physically attack him along with the hashtag hunt Republicans in the full page ads saying rise up, drive him from power.
[24:33.000 --> 24:46.000]  Antifa and Antifa out with guns, not even letting conservatives march in Austin and holding guns up center. You scared, violating their civil rights, just not just like you don't let a little black girl in 1959 into an Arkansas school
[24:46.000 --> 25:01.000]  and Eisenhower the Republican sends in federal troops to let that little girl in school. It's the same thing not letting reporters and families go to the Capitol with men with armed guns telling our reporters you're not going in there and bumping into them.
[25:01.000 --> 25:13.000]  But it's okay because Austin's blue and they're going to teach us with their armed thugs in the streets. They run things now, period. And you're going to learn and you're going to take it.
[25:13.000 --> 25:28.000]  We put that graphic up that we've compiled of the Justice Department, the FBI, not the whole FBI, people at the top, the Democrat people that were put in by the Clinton ground machine with Obama and Lynch and coming at the top with Sally Yates and Hillary and Andrew McCabe and
[25:28.000 --> 25:45.000]  Warren, Carl and the Justice Department and Lisa Page and Peter Strock and Baker and Price Trap and then right down there putting out the fusion GPS with their own wives and husbands getting the contract for two million dollars.
[25:45.000 --> 25:57.000]  Hell, you don't just put out lies against the guy elected by the people to frustrate the voters and to stop the restoration of the Republic. You get two million dollars while you do it.
[25:57.000 --> 26:11.000]  For a 40-something page piece of fiction, proven absolutely to be filled with garbage with the main author of it, Mr. Steele, admitting it's baloney in desperate attempt not to go to prison.
[26:11.000 --> 26:24.000]  And now criminal investigations by the Justice Department have been opened. Now, that isn't exciting. I don't know what it is. People ask me why I get so upset, why I get so excited.
[26:24.000 --> 26:37.000]  Because man, this is the second American Revolution. It's 21st century. It's information war. We've got the truth. They've got pure lies and pure garbage hammering us with it 24-7 and it's going to get more weaponized.
[26:37.000 --> 26:53.000]  I've been told by high level Justice Department and Defense Department sources that if you think the program they've got with Adobe that they released last year and then pulled off the market where you can take 10 seconds to somebody's voice and then completely have a voice print novel.
[26:53.000 --> 27:02.000]  That would pass voice print of saying whatever you want to hear from that person and the word is they've got tapes ready on the president.
[27:02.000 --> 27:11.000]  But the good news is so many women have been approached to bear false witness that now more than 40 women was a few dozen a few weeks ago.
[27:11.000 --> 27:24.000]  More than 40 women have signed affidavits about top Democrat officials, lobbyists and others offering them as much as $2 million to say the president sexually assaulted them.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  Got to have a little ace in the hole, little something that nobody knows to quote the great George straight.
[27:31.000 --> 27:45.000]  So that's where we are right now and we come back. I'm going to play in the next segment could be chopped full clip after clip after clip after clip of them with the same unified message on every major corporate globalist enemy media that's captured this country.
[27:45.000 --> 27:55.000]  We're trying to take it back. This is a war. That isn't rhetoric. This is a true war where they're now saying kill the president, assault the president, get the president, get his supporters.
[27:55.000 --> 28:04.000]  He's a racist. Go after him. Do whatever it takes and they'll use whatever false quotes they need.
[28:04.000 --> 28:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, over and over and over and over again to try to bring him down.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  And the word is they're going to start putting these quotes out, have him deny it.
[28:16.000 --> 28:28.000]  And they've got so many recordings of him, you could take one of his speeches, particularly a clean one, a broadcast, and they can sit there and they can have him say, I rape Haitians.
[28:28.000 --> 28:37.000]  I murder Haitians. I drink their blood. I, you know, I went to the moon and ate purple pop tarts with an Easter Bunny.
[28:37.000 --> 28:51.000]  And Santa Claus was there with the three dwarves and the seven Easter bunnies and the tabler elves and, and, and Gleek the space monkey from the Justice League and Aquaman and three giant whales.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  I mean, they can do anything, but we know they're a pack of criminal liars.
[28:57.000 --> 29:08.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs. So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water. The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.
[29:14.000 --> 29:39.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance. Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[33:30.000 --> 33:42.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[33:42.000 --> 33:51.000]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to create race war in this country. It came out in Soros documents earlier in the week that back in 2015 they wanted them.
[33:51.000 --> 34:00.000]  And so they misquote the president. He says it's fake just like weeks ago. They said he said that the Haitians all have AIDS. Totally fake. There's no proof.
[34:00.000 --> 34:19.000]  Another line. Well, now they've got Democrats, governors coming out saying we want to physically gate, as I'm dubbing it. Shit hole gate. Is there water? I think crap gate is going to bring down the president and bring down the free press and stop our reassurgents of the republic.
[34:19.000 --> 34:37.000]  But their attempts to keep putting out fake news and to censor anybody else that responds to them and all the proof that they're engaged in this authoritarian battle to stop the American recovery with fake news and disinformation to drive a wedge into this nation and to destabilize the country will end up being their water loop.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  It will end up bringing them down.
[34:41.000 --> 34:53.000]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to have the clip of F. Lee Bailey. He said it 41 times using the N word to a black jury, a white guy to act like Simpsons enemies had done it.
[34:53.000 --> 35:05.000]  The same way they're doing this, SH, you know what T whole comment and saying it over and over and over again on the news, but then saying everybody else, you can't say it only liberals can say it on TV.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  So video Democrat governor threatens to punch out President Trump.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  You would have to pick him off the floor.
[35:14.000 --> 35:23.000]  This from the party of the KKK. This from the party of the Clintons robbing 2 billion, almost all the money from Haiti and their associates being convicted of trying to smuggle children out of the country.
[35:23.000 --> 35:42.000]  This from these monstrous lying pigs who know you're aware of them who know that you're aware of them and are desperate to force you back in. They're engaged in bigger and bigger and bigger lies to try to force you back under their control and they've got to be stopped because what they're doing now is
[35:42.000 --> 35:53.000]  they're firing a theater. They're calling for violence everywhere. Hashtag hunt Republicans. You see the examples everywhere. And then we say, look out, you keep pushing a civil war. We'll have to defend ourselves.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  Then they edit clips of me together, making it sound like I'm saying launch attacks when I'm saying don't launch offensive attacks.
[36:00.000 --> 36:11.000]  So Democrat governor threatens to punch out President Trump. You would have to pick him off the floor. Terry McAuffel.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Let's play that clip. Here it is.
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  What would you do in a debate with him if he tried that? If he come over and leaned over back to you.
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.000]  What would you do?
[36:19.000 --> 36:27.000]  You'd have to pick him up off the floor.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  Okay, okay.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  Yeah, a lot of talk, punk. Shut him down.
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  Oh, sorry. Keep going. Oh, you deck him. Keep going.
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.000]  Listen, this guy got my space. You want to get my space? I've always said, Chris, you punch me. I'm going to punch you back twice as hard.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  All right, let's stop right there.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  Total inversion of reality. Upside down world.
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.000]  They put out all the fake quotes, all the fake news. They're caught thousands of times per agency doing them. Just constant fake news every day on purpose. ABC News.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  Oh, Flynn's flipped. He admits he's a Russian agent. He met with them during the campaign. Total lie.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  You mean the list, the daily lies here?
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  Trump gave away the location of our secret submarines. They were docked in Seol.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  Look at our three fine submarines. Or they were docked on the port outside South Korea.
[37:10.000 --> 37:21.000]  Well, it's tripped the soul. It's just constant lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Oh, he's going to betray you on docking and legalize everybody.
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  Never said it, never did it, set a nice meeting. Then he doesn't do docking because they wouldn't give him a good deal.
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  And they say, oh, look, he lied to us and he lied to you when he said he would do it, then he wouldn't do it and he did do it.
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.000]  All to just short circuit things so he can't cut our taxes down to China's level.
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  He can't bring back the jobs. He can't turn down the electricity prices.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  Everything he's doing to deliver you a better way of life, that's how we win is prosperity.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  That's how we get out from under the globalist and he's in a race to do it.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  In 11 months and 20 something days, 22 days, he's done it. You've done it.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  And they are apoplectic. They don't know what to do.
[38:02.000 --> 38:09.000]  So they misrepresented and said, if he came over and leaned in and got on me and said, you know, how he hates black people, I'd deck him.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  So they make it about how he's assaulting them in a hypothetical.
[38:12.000 --> 38:20.000]  So it's a hypothetical lie about another lie from a group of known liars and a hypothetical of how he would punch back.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  But they're the ones lying about him, talking about attacking him on TV.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  Imagine if Trump said, you know, I'd punch that governor in the face. It'd be the end of the world.
[38:29.000 --> 38:37.000]  But see, they all do it, but say they did it hypothetically because Trump came over and attacked them.
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  It's like, well, Blitzer had guessed on the day that that crazy guy, you know, obviously Democrat Party operative wound up, came and shot Scalise and others.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  And Blitzer had guessed on going, well, he was a good guy standing up against you and Blitzer nodded.
[38:49.000 --> 38:58.000]  And I said, Blitzer, what are you going to do if somebody pumps rounds in you because you're a Democrat and people say, well, the person that killed you, you know, wasn't bad.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  They were fighting evil. I don't want that to happen.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  Media Matters edited that out this week, put it out that I said, go put rounds in.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  Well, Blitzer, these are a pack of scum.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  I said, Blitzer, don't start condoning shooting people because it could end up happening to you and we don't want to go there.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  They edited out where I'm saying somebody needs to go shoot.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Well, Blitzer, people say, well, then don't talk like that. They could edit it.
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  They're gonna, it's like saying, don't ever have children because one day they'll die or don't breathe air or don't even ever be born.
[39:29.000 --> 39:38.000]  I'm saying when I'm saying I'm doing what I'm doing, it stands with integrity end of the story.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Now there it is, completely edited out of context.
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  What happens when Blitzer, when somebody pumps rounds in your little pumpkin head, he says, it's just political.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  And then in the full statement, it's you're calling it, okay, political because this guy went and shot Scalise.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  Are you crazy? What happens when somebody shoots you? And then we just say it's political.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  That's crazy. Don't do that. Have some chivalry. Have some basic rules moron. They don't.
[40:02.000 --> 40:11.000]  Because George Soros, a crazy Nazi collaborator who's never been defeated and overthrows dozens of countries, gets away with everything he thinks he's invincible.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  And so do the rest of these crazies.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  That's why we got to stand up finally and be done with them because they're threatening our entire planet.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  They're threatening our entire world and it's got to stop. It's coming to an end. No big deal.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  Just that camera always gets moved. We've got the standard shot for that.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  So we'll just go back to the other shot where we won't use it. No big deal.
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.000]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen, I'll get to all the other clips in the next segment.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  I've got to settle down and just get to them during the next segment.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  I'm really wound up right now because the anatomy of this thing is so obvious.
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  Just like the O.J. Simpson, F. Lee Bailey saying inward, inward, inward, inward.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  A white guy at the jury and then pointing, pointing, pointing at the prosecution.
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  That's all this, then cussing on TV is to elicit an emotional response and act like that it's President Trump that did it.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  That clip's coming up next segment as well.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, we're in a total war. I'm totally committed to you.
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.000]  We got products you need, the very best supplements, the very best quality.
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  We had the biggest sales ever in our history that just ended.
[41:14.000 --> 41:21.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, we have several new specials and I just went over with Tim before the show
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  and I did him with him and he had him in a folder and I've got the old specials here.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  So I tried the best I can, but anyways, I'll just hire five people to do that.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  We have immune wall 25% off. We have alpha power 50% off.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  And we have the real red pill, 50% off. Info wars life, essential pack, 50% off.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  Secret 12, the super high quality, vitamin B12, survival shield X2, the good halogen.

[41:52.000 --> 41:57.000]  And then of course we have super male vitality, 50% off.
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.000]  These are all about to sell out. I had to end all the other specials because they had sold out the other dozens of items
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  so they were close to selling out because again, we're getting rid of the extra stock we had for the new year
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  before new stuff comes in. These are great, amazing best selling products.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  You really ought to try alpha power blowing people's socks off right now. X2, all of it.
[42:16.000 --> 42:25.000]  But bottom line, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple eight, two five, three, three one, three nine.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three one, three nine.

[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  and we need to every day crack the nut to fund this operation because we're not funded by globalists.

[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  Introducing cell force by infowarslife.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  Cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria,
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.000]  much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[43:38.000 --> 43:46.000]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  Boost, protect and adapt with cell force from infowarslife.
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.000]  Yeah, hey listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[44:16.000 --> 44:23.000]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  Well thank you, my favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but said it says Won't Tread on Me
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.000]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[44:41.000 --> 44:49.000]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning t-shirt. Trigger Warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign
[44:49.000 --> 45:15.000]  and then InfoWars.com on the back, that is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.000]  Prepare this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride Free Mouthwash and Super Charge Your Oral Health.
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.000]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since Aboriginal and Biblical times.
[45:28.000 --> 45:35.000]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is floated with a good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[45:38.000 --> 45:44.000]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  Xylitol, Nano Silver and Iodine.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride Free products.
[45:51.000 --> 45:58.000]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWars.com.
[45:58.000 --> 46:06.000]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life after years of research on the human microbiome.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  Not all probiotics are made the same.
[46:08.000 --> 46:17.000]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:17.000 --> 46:26.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:26.000 --> 46:33.000]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[46:33.000 --> 46:42.000]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:42.000 --> 46:50.000]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:50.000 --> 47:05.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[47:20.000 --> 47:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live and I'm really angry. I'm so angry I'm being a little bit of a jerk on air to the crew and I apologize for that.
[47:36.000 --> 47:45.000]  We're under assault, man. I deal with them in fake quotes and fake stories and fake sources all the time in the news.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  And it doesn't even make me mad that they're saying lies about me. It doesn't hurt me because everybody knows what scum they are.
[47:50.000 --> 48:06.000]  It's that they're such trash and they're getting worse and worse and worse and they're all smiley face little jerks like this weenie, this wimp governor saying he'll physically assault the president.
[48:06.000 --> 48:19.000]  It's incredible. And then you notice how F. Lee Bailey, back on the O.J. Simpson trial, 40 plus times said the n-word just like they're saying all these cuss words and saying how dare the president do this and he's so racist and by this he's racist.
[48:19.000 --> 48:27.000]  When the president says he didn't do it and there's no proof and they're known liars, it's meant to manipulate people psychologically.
[48:27.000 --> 48:36.000]  And it shows they're getting crazier and crazier and now when you see CNN or MSNBC or even broadcast, ABC or CBS start cussing.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  Oh, but see the president did it so now they can, but he didn't.
[48:41.000 --> 48:53.000]  And it just shows you there's nothing they won't do to try to stop the recovery and the fact that black unemployment is the lowest it's ever been and that Trump is delivering on every front.
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  They don't want it.
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.000]  There's the Washington Post. Again, Jeff Bezos is who put this out, should have said that up front.
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world who thinks he owns America and has horrible slave-like conditions at his facilities and factories.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  He's got factories too.
[49:07.000 --> 49:16.000]  He had his people in his $600 million CIA contract at the Washington Post said, quote, we're having all these people from crap old countries come here.
[49:16.000 --> 49:23.000]  Trump said, according to these people referring to African countries and Haiti, he then suggested that the United States and it went on.
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.000]  Get things from quote, the last country that came to visiting.
[49:28.000 --> 49:40.000]  This is the Washington Post caught publishing fake story after fake story after fake story that a guy who makes over a billion dollars every two days.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  Just what he keeps he's every two days Bezos gets a billion dollars richer.
[49:45.000 --> 49:55.000]  Couple days ago was four billion. Now it's up to like what what what it was it was 104 billion. Now it's 107 billion.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  And then Trump doesn't want to screw you over.
[49:57.000 --> 50:09.000]  So this rich jerk this this this filth Bezos who classically can't even look you straight in the eye will sit there and do this to us through that organ.
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  That's who Trump's fighting for us and it makes me mad. It makes me want to come to his aid makes me get angry.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  It makes me want to stand up because I can see what they're doing and so can you trying to rob us of our country.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  This is a war. You've got to get politically aggressive.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  You've got to start your own media. You've got to support media.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  You've got to support broadcasts that tell the truth.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  Why do they hate us so much because we cut and dry show what they're doing.
[50:36.000 --> 50:45.000]  So again here's Jim Acosta recycling another fake quote out of context that Trump said hey we got to vet people.
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  A lot of good people come in from Mexico but a lot of criminals a lot of bad people and the headline.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  Trump says all Mexicans are criminals. It doesn't exist.
[50:54.000 --> 51:02.000]  Is there a quote of me anywhere on video or audio or text saying that there are Martian slave children on Mars.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  They never said it. They just say I said it. Total frauds.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  Think of how they're your enemy. Think of how they prey on you.
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.000]  How they've captured the country and how they're pissed it's coming back. Does that make you upset.
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.000]  Don't believe anything they say. It's incredible.
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  But more than that everything they support go against it. That's what you know.
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  And you said they're analyze their lies all day. It's what we do.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  But Acosta first says oh just like you know he said everybody coming in criminals she didn't say.
[51:33.000 --> 51:40.000]  And then he goes on to his new lie saying it building it up and then we bleep it out because we're not allowed to do what he does.
[51:40.000 --> 51:46.000]  He's a liberal fake news liar. We'll get FCC fines if we play it so we're not going to but here it is.
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  Jim Shudo was saying with the president talking about immigrants coming from Mexico being rapists and criminals.
[51:51.000 --> 51:59.000]  And now this comment the president referring to Haiti and countries in Africa as being and I noticed you Wolf you hesitated to use that word.
[51:59.000 --> 52:07.000]  I hesitate to use it myself as an S hole or hole is what the word that the Washington Post is quoting the president is saying.
[52:07.000 --> 52:15.000]  I think Wolf what we have to come to grips with and I almost have to think back to the day when we were at Trump Tower when the president was commenting on Charlottesville
[52:15.000 --> 52:21.000]  and he was saying that there are very fine people on both sides saying that they're very fine people among the white supremacists in the Nazis.
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.000]  Is that the president United States just seems to have a problem here Wolf in this area and we can tiptoe around.
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.000]  No he said there were people out demonstrating there was media on both sides it was good people as bad people were bad people on both sides.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  Which is totally true he had states rights people all that out there.
[52:38.000 --> 52:46.000]  Again these are the race baiters invoking this the known liar Acosta who's been caught lying so many times it's just insane.
[52:46.000 --> 52:55.000]  Let's play Al Sharpton the super race pimp you know Annie Semite you name it says it's a racial slur.
[52:55.000 --> 53:02.000]  And again this is last night today this afternoon they're still running the same stuff most of the time they don't even say the president denied it.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  They just that's another form of fake news here it is.
[53:05.000 --> 53:15.000]  You got this flexible definition about what a racist is who do you have to spray paint the N word in the Oval Office or have a hooded in the Lincoln.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  Buddy you're the race manor from the Democratic Party that controls people through race.
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  Let's get that straight back to start the races.
[53:21.000 --> 53:34.000]  If you advocate everything whites only bring me the Norwegians bring me this or that and disparage at every opportunity whether Charlottesville whether it's immigration policy.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Every opportunity.
[53:36.000 --> 53:50.000]  They misrepresent on every front misrepresent on every front on every front never any proof never any reality just this grandstanding by these scumbags that perch on top of political system.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  That's another crap.
[53:52.000 --> 53:59.000]  I got this Don Lemon calls Trump a racist that the race baiting Don Lemon.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  Just as bad as Oprah Winfrey.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  Let's hear from no ratings lemon here he is.
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  The president of the United States is racist.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  All of us already knew that.
[54:10.000 --> 54:19.000]  Today, Don Lemon is a congenital liar in love with himself that spews race division garbage all day to turn us against each other.
[54:19.000 --> 54:25.000]  Don Lemon works for the globalist that don't want black unemployment to be the lowest it's ever been within one year.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  They don't like the fact that we're going to have prosperity.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  This is literally a parasite.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  Let me translate that for you for Don Lemon there it is.
[54:33.000 --> 54:42.000]  President Trump talking with lawmakers in the Oval Office about immigrants from Haiti from El Salvador and Africa said and I quote I'm here.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  But you know who he did say he would welcome here.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  He said the US should bring in more people from countries like Norway.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  And CNN is told that he went on to say why do we need more Haitians take them out.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Those comments are frankly disgusting.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  There's other language I'd like to use but we are on television.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  But you know what?
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  They're not shocking.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  Not even really surprising.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  We had to bleep the cussing so radio stations missed 10 seconds of that.
[55:13.000 --> 55:21.000]  Again this is they go now let's put out a false quote because they didn't buy the Haiti thing two weeks ago saying all the Haitians have HIV.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  That was fake.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  Have AIDS.
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  So let's just start using cuss words to get people's attention and maybe that'll get them to buy into it.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  And it's total FD Bailey.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  So I'm going to play this only part of it.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  There's five minutes of it of FD Bailey.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  And the jury, the black, mainly black jury said this is why they went ahead and let OJ go.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  Now they know most of them said they were wrong.
[55:41.000 --> 55:47.000]  A white guy pointing at them saying N word over and over and over again to manipulate just like they're using cuss words now.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  And you know, you know, because now they're saying he called black people bleep holes.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  When you can admit a lot of these terrible countries are hell holes.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  They're not just crap holes.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  But does that mean you hate the people?
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  No, you're like, I don't want to move to Haiti.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  It's a, you know what hole, but does it matter?
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  Trump says he didn't even say it.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  Let's go ahead and continue with let's play the FD Bailey piece.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  Here it is.
[56:08.000 --> 56:15.000]  But when you see a nigger driving with a white woman, you pull them over.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  No.
[56:17.000 --> 56:23.000]  Do you recall anyone asking you if you didn't have a reason to pull them over?
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  What would you do?
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  I don't recall anybody ever asked me that question, sir.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  Do you ever make the statement that if you needed a reason, you would find one?
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  No.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  Okay.
[56:35.000 --> 56:41.000]  Thanks paragraph.
[56:41.000 --> 56:47.000]  Did you say at any time in that recruiting station in the presence of any female, including Kathleen Bell,
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.000]  that you'd like nothing more than to see all niggers gathered together and killed?
[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  No.
[57:02.000 --> 57:12.000]  Are you aware, bottom of the page, of any complaint that was brought to the LAPD by this individual?
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  I'm not aware of any investigation.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  That's enough.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  It goes on for four more minutes.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  We're going to post it to infowars.com.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  That's exactly what's going on here.
[57:22.000 --> 57:28.000]  And so the Washington Post is literally a globalist enemy organ,
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  an ally with the Communist Chinese owned by Bezos who gets taxpayer money on every order you make,
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  total scam artist, literally trying to cause a race war in America
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.000]  and bring down the recovery and blacks having the biggest economic boom they've ever had.
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.000]  That's what they're going to hurt black people.
[57:48.000 --> 57:59.000]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Today, from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  So here's everything you need to know about SH, you know what, T-gate, crap gate.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  It's about fake news, and if we got out in front of this and exposed the history of this and the mechanics behind it,
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  it will just be one more nail in the coffin of MSM and their entire fake news system.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Remember, two weeks ago they said that Trump in a meeting said that all Haitians have AIDS.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  No proof. That didn't work. It went away. They went, wait a minute.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  Let's say that he said Haiti and other African countries, even though Haiti's in the Caribbean, they said Haiti and other African countries are SH, you know what, T-holes.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Why don't we bring people here from the nation like you just met with a Northern European leader?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And you can see how they then rolled it out and then used the SHIT on air to elicit an emotional response,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  which F. Lee Bailey and many other lawyers in the OJ Simpson trial admitted that they were going to have Johnny Cochran do it,
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  and Johnny Cochran said, listen, I'm black. That won't freak him out. A brother, in his words, using the N-word.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Because we've taken that term and turned it around. You need to do it.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  And they sent out, and he agreed, they sent out F. Lee Bailey, known corrupt lawyer.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  They'll pay big fines, you name it, to go in there and use the N-word 40-plus times to project that onto the whole investigation
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  so that OJ would get off, and it was successful. So that's what this whole exercise is,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  is trying to also change the subject from Shadow Bandgate, that was the number one story of today,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Twitter going involved in huge amounts of censorship.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  So they're desperate right now, ladies and gentlemen, and they don't want the president to go,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  oh yeah, DACA, let's try to be friendly, let's work something out. They want to take that away.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Well, acting like they were his friend, I said watch the big attacks coming.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  So that's the real key news here, and remember, the Clintons stole 99% of the money that came in from Haiti.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  They set up a system to control it where they got the money from thousands of charities.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  They and their organization got caught shipping little Haitian kids out for all sorts of horrible stuff.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Associated Press investigation. Even the Huffington Post says the Clinton Bush Haiti fund is lying to you.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  It's a fact. So robbing them and killing a bunch of black people, that's not bad.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  But an imaginary quote that the president says is fake about places being crap holes, which they are crap holes.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  People that live there will tell you they're crap holes. They're hell holes.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  They turn it around. So here's a little compilation of some of F. Lee Bailey.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  You use the word nigger in describing people. Presently. Yeah. Oh, no, sir.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  You mean if you called someone a nigger, you have forgotten it?
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  I want you to assume that perhaps at some time, since 1985 or 6, you addressed a member of the African American race as a nigger.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  And you say on your oath that you have not addressed any black person as a nigger or spoken about black people as niggers in the past 10 years, detective Furman.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  Did you say while in the recruiting station at any time during those years that when you see a nigger driving with a white woman, you pull them over?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  No.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Did you say at any time in that recruiting station in the presence of any female, including Kathleen Bell, that you'd like nothing more than to see all niggers gathered together and killed?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  I can't listen to this anymore. Turn it off.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  It doesn't mean there aren't racist black people out there that I don't like.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  There are a lot of great black people, a lot of great white people you name it out there.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  I'm not going to lower myself to feel powerful to the level of engaging in this as a white person.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  And just like the racist whites or racist blacks, you name it.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  But again, what you've seen with this whole fake quote of the president, which he's denied, then now they're saying, oh, he's calling black people crap holes.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  So they're now even extrapolating out the fakeness and saying the cuss words on TV to elicit an emotional response to manipulate you.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  And it just shows there's nowhere they won't go.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  There's no low that they won't plumb. These people are committed and they're not giving up.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  And the fight to restore the republic has just begun.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  And the victories we've had are sweet, but they're going to be so much sweeter when we finally end these people.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels, up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels. B vitamins we need every day.

[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory and lethargy.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Secret 12. Up, up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your inner cellular processes.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  Up, up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  New lows for the corporate horror media. Continually putting out fake quotes, continually putting out fake stories, continually lying on every front you can imagine.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  On purpose. I mean, when they come out and say, Flynn's flipped.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  He admits they were Russian agents controlled by the Kremlin. He met with them during the campaign. They know that's all fake.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  And then hours later, oh, we're not sure. Oh, it was a minor mistake. They think you're not paying attention.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  Just like, oh, the Haitians all have AIDS. He said, then it's not true. Well, let's just add a cuss word in there and air that and make it.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Make it try to fly. And you know, they're got all the Dovey software that anybody could buy until they pulled it off the market for a couple of thousand dollars and take whatever they want and put out fake quotes for the president.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  But they pulled that off the market last year because they try to think and what's going to happen to us when everybody can put out fake audio of whoever they want.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  We won't be able to put out fake audio on Trump and others. And then people will know, oh, that's a computer program.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  And the computer programmers will be able to study the wave files and be able to tell their fake or not.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  And they're like, well, we'll have to release this later, not right now. I mean, you can see the thinking behind all of this.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  And you know, the next shoe to drop is that they're going to come out and say that he hates black people.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  They've already said that, but they're going to try to have witnesses and they're going to use the N word.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  There's really no end to this. And notice it extracts from the best stock market ever the record low black unemployment record low unemployment.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Thousands of new companies starting millions of new jobs, huge tax cuts, huge bonuses, things roaring back.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  The Chinese in a trade war, lowering their taxes to zero on corporations trying to keep our factories and jobs over there and to keep our money over there.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  Just our money that all goes there. And then the enemy media that's so committed to bringing down this country, they come back like a bat out of hell with a new story.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  And I was watching the news last night this morning and they barely even say the president denies it. It's incredible.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  But then I started thinking, why not just own it and say, well, I didn't say that, but America's infrastructure is a SH, you know what, T whole.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  And America's education went from the best in the world 50, 60 years ago to the worst in the industrialized world.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  So for education, we're a SH, you know what, T whole. And the way we take care of our veterans, the VA is a SH, I T whole.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  And the way the Democrats lie and the mainstream media lies, they treat us like our minds are a SH, I T whole.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  And again, the mainstream media, they can use it. They can say they can play it on the radio and TV on their shows. We're not because we'll get shut down.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Because again, we're just libertarian patriots.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  The language used by me at the docket meeting was tough, but this was not the language used.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made, a big setback for DACA.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  He's trying, as he always said, to get real DACA for people that aren't criminals, that really were here when they were young,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  that can prove that they're aiding society and not people engaged in fraud, like Obama just said, you come here, you say you've been here for a while, you're legal.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  No matter how many times you've been deported, no matter how many crimes you've committed, you shine a form pledging to stop committing felonies.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  Trump goes, that's a horrible plan. A lot of criminals are coming out of Latin America and Mexico. We've got to be able to vet them and stop them.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  A lot of bad people, a lot of good people too. Then there's the headline, Trump says all Mexicans criminals.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  You're like, where's the clip? Where's the clip of Alex Jones saying he hates gays?
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  Where's the clip of me saying that there's a Mars base with slaves on it? Never said it.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  I've challenged the media. Ten million dollars you've got me saying that I believe there's a Martian base with slaves on it. What are you talking about?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  But again, this is who these people are. They're unbelievable and they've got the most dumbed down people.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  The people that live in Democratic Party, blue state, big mega city, SH-T holes. Everywhere Democrats are in control are SH-T holes.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  And every country socialists are in control of are SH-T holes.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Let's have a debate because some of them aren't just SH-T holes. They are HE double hockey stick holes.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  North Korea is a hell hole. Venezuela is a hell hole. Russia under communism is a hell hole.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  If you're not an inner party member in China, you're in a hell hole. If you're in a Foxcom factory, you're a hell hole.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  If you're in a Amazon factory, you're in a hell hole. How do you fix things? You call it a hell hole.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  A crap hole. Haiti is a literal crap hole. Haiti doesn't have indoor plumbing and 95% of it.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  And tens of thousands die every year at cholera and other waterborne diseases. There are open sewers of feces everywhere.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  If you look at a satellite photo of the island of Hispaniola, the east of it is the Dominican Republic. Very nice, green, beautiful.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  The other side, pull up satellite photos of Haiti.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Almost total deforestation, total collapse, never got free market going. A hell hole.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  A hell hole where the legend has it that the Haitians pledged themselves to Satan and sacrificed a hog.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  And they say this in their own history to free them from French rule.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  And they never got out from under colonialism of one type or another. And the Clintons preying on them and all the rest of it.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And it is the toilet of the Caribbean. Haiti is the worst place. That's what you call them is people say, why would you want to go to Calcutta, India?
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  It's a, I mean, I have Indian friends that say, oh, if you want to go to India, go here to the north of these mountains or this area is nice.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  Do not go here. It is a, because Indians, Indians, I know none of them are politically correct.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Most people that run up, oh, I love Trump. Love you, Alex. Or are Indian Americans.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  But the point is they go, oh, Alex, you know, don't ever go to India to go to these places because there's dead people on the side of the street.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  There's crap everywhere. These are SH-T holes because they are.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And if you go to China, people will tell you, don't go there. It is a SH-T hole.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  So third world places with sewage running down the street and starving children are SH-T holes in definition in common nomenclature parlance, modern, you know, dictionary.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  And let's pull up the urban dictionary. They probably already changed it. People are correct, but let's pull up SH-T hole.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  If you look at a hell hole, a hell hole is Somalia, North Korea, a collapsing society completely.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Venezuela is now a hell hole. Those are hell holes. There's maybe 25 hell holes.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  There's close to 100 SH-T holes. There are close to 100 countries that you would call.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  There is an extremely dirty, shabby or otherwise unpleasant place. This place is a bleep hole, SH-I-T hole. I hope you know that.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  So the urban dictionary, an abation of liberalism. Here, let's zoom out. Is this urban dictionary? Which one is this?
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  That's just the Oxford Living Dictionary. Well, I just said go to the common parlance. Wow, let's do a story on this.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  So the English Oxford Living Dictionary is racist. There's your headline right there. They say that an extremely dirty, shabby or otherwise unpleasant place is a SH-I-T hole.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  So there you go. In fact, let's play the audio of it. We can delay this for radio stations, but just click the little audio if you can find that little speaker and it'll play it for you.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  So we'll do it when we come back. So understand, ladies and gentlemen, you can go to the – zoom in out please for listeners. Thank you.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Viewers, just zoom in out for me. Thank you. You can go to the English Oxford – oh, the Oxford Dictionary. That's the biggest one there is, the most prestigious.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  And it calls an extremely dirty, shabby or otherwise unpleasant place. What they say, the President called it, but he says he didn't even call it that.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  So what they allege that's fake is what the Oxford Living Dictionary calls Haiti, because if Haiti isn't an SH-T hole, nothing is.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Let's roll some video maybe when we come back of our aid teams flying in food aid and also find out what's happening in Haiti.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  And we can show you, we've got photos in the town's videos of little starving children, seas of feces flowing.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  The UN, by the way, crapped in the $20 million water system the U.S. paid for, everybody diseases.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  They just had to swim in it and crap in it. Remember that?
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  But it's okay if the UN craps in the water and killed 10,000 people in Haiti.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Just don't misquote the President as calling an SH-T hole, an SH-T hole, even though he probably didn't say it and the knowing, lying, globalist, poor media said so, playing an OJ Simpson, F. Lee Bailey, inward.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water. The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  And I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglenone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.

[01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  Red pill now available at infowarslife.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  You are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Joining us for the transmission, the head of Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, who had the number one news story yesterday on Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Their infiltration of Twitter with their executives admitting we censor all conservatives, we censor WikiLeaks, we censor anything nationalistic.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  We have AI computers now coming in to end all their free speech where they can't even talk to each other.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  They think that they're talking to each other, but we blocked them with all humans and only let them talk to bots.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  Well, this is what they already do to Democrats. That's in the Facebook documents that came out last year.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  It's criminal. They have bots that were almost all your friends are bots.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  They then get your mind thinking over the years into a certain thing. Then they put you into a trough of real people who have all now been programmed and then now you're self-fulfilling.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  But then there are still bots that hurt you and control you and keep you on the reservation.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  Why would anyone want to be part of mind control like that?
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And then certain real people are then recruited by Facebook because the computer profile shows their anti-free speech, their vicious, their hateful.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  They have total cognitive dissonance. Nothing will reach them. Nothing will help them.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  They will never listen to facts. Black unemployment will be the lowest ever as it is.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  Donald Trump found the cure for cancer. He's always bad.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  They then get recruited to be moderators for no money who then go around censoring and the really good ones then get paid.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  And that's all on video and that's all in the documents. Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter, you name it.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  And we expose Seal coming out and saying that Oprah Winfrey is a horrible person that brought women to be pimped by Weinstein.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  He's credible. A very good guy, good background. One of the biggest selling artists ever.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  A black guy, African. And he'll call me a European or whatever, just a person.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  And he's the worst ever. See, and so they just, you'd think that'd be a viral video about Seal coming out, but no, you can't share it.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  You have to actually go find it on my channel, even see it. And it's the same thing they do with every video.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  It's powerful. They just shut it down. And that's why they can't stand Fox News, despite all its problems, is it doesn't go along 100% with the other establishment channels.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  It was for about the last, going back about six months ago, a year before that, in the previous year before that, with the end of the election, about six months in, they were pretty anti-Trump.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  But that hurt their ratings. They lost half their viewers. They went, whoa, this is too crazy. We're going back the way we were.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  And they flipped back to, hey, Trump's going to win. We're not going to be able to get rid of him. Sorry, which shows you how opportunistic the Rupert Murdochs are.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  But at the end of the day, most globalists have so many hundreds of billions of dollars that they don't even care.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  They'd lose a lot of that money just to get rid of Trump and be in control. For the Murdochs, when it didn't work, they were so opportunistic, they at least went back to quitting.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Which shows, I don't think they're pure evil then. A little more pragmatic, which is better than pure evil any day of the week.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  So that's why I have been so angry about this, is that to watch the Clintons rob Haiti, to watch all this go on, to watch them ship kids out of the country, to watch everything they've done.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  The Clintons back when he was president and right through robbing it, looting it, stealing all the aid money.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  With the IMF and World Bank, not just the donations, and I've given huge donations and funded aid missions and sent reporters in and exposed it.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  I'm not going, I'm goody tissues. It's just that to sit there and be criticized as a libertarian, as a Christian, as a conservative by MSM.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  And to see Trump being criticized when all he's been doing is trying to help Haiti.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And to see the massive aid that went into Puerto Rico and the media line saying he doesn't like Hispanics, because he didn't help Puerto Rico.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Well, that was all fraud. It's just to see them push the tyranny and push the lies on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  And to have all the CNN panels unloading, calling him a racist and Don Lemon and all these idiots and Phil Mudd.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  Formerly of the CIA said he wanted the president dead and he should die soon. Said I'm a proud SH-Holler.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  So you don't, oh, that's my other big challenge.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Phil Mudd, if he loves third world crap holes, according to the English Oxford Dictionary, meaning a third world place without plumbing.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  To Haiti, the Oxford Dictionary says that if Trump even said this, he's correct, but they don't care.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  He says he's a proud SH-Holler.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  Well, but you're never going to see, you're going to never see him move to Haiti.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  You're never going to see Don Lemon or Bill Clinton or any of these people.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  They just use it as a third world hellhole where they as vampires can come in and feed as much as they want, as long as they want, as hard as they want.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  And I'm not mad, but I thought all these clips were bleeped.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  We played Lemon earlier and he said, the cuss word, I'm not going to do what CNN does.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  It's no big deal, but is our Phil Mudd clip bleeped?
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  It is. Let's play Phil Mudd seeing an analyst. I'm a proud bleep-holer with the idiot Don Lemon. Here it is.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  Are you shocked or surprised by this?
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  I'm not surprised. In one way, I'm proud. I am a proud sh-holler.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  My family was called Wops and Macreleaders. I'm proud of that.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  We came when people from Ireland and Italy were seen as dirty people, dirty Catholics who didn't belong in a Protestant country.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  Sh-hollers built this country 110 years ago. They were called slopeers and slan eyes, Chinese people who built this country.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  They're pausing in. They're literally, and if you want to try to go to China at that time, they'd kill you.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  Everybody was tribal and there was huge groups and the media hype stood up bigger than it was.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  That's, I mean, most of the people in my family intermarried with Native Americans and stuff.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  But again, this is a little race-baiting film out of the CIA and the former head of counterintelligence brought him by Mueller.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  This is an enemy of the country. Up here invoking every racial slur he can to make everyone hate the president like he was there 100 years ago
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  being mean to somebody.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Oh, and by the way, I'm not against Catholics, they're great people, but cities Catholics took over.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  If you weren't Catholic, you weren't getting a job either.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  This is what people do until the American system changed it more than anybody else.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  They're now attacking the American system as if we're the worst in the world, but not Foxcom Laboratories,
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  not slave labs, not genetic engineering, not robbing Haiti.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  It's these monsters that rob everybody like Mudd who's failing and who's a filth and who's very close to going to prison with his friends like Mueller
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  who doesn't know what to do. Let's go back to it.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  It's from Japanese internment camps.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt that put some of the Japanese internment camps.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  It's the Democrats again. Again, if you know history, it's Eisenhower, it's the Republicans that did the Civil Rights Act,
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  it's the Republicans that were against slavery, you sack of garbage.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  But again, everything you say is a lie, but you think the viewers are idiots, and they are.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  They're a bunch of racist, white, black Hispanics, you name it, that tune into CNN with their race narrative,
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  and they all hate white people in general. They are the racists because the KKK was found by the Democrats.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  It's a no-brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  Call or click 1-877-99 Berkey or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  The super blue is awesome and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars life products.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  Absolutely.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win.

[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com,
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  you are funding the revolution.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  And they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Well, that's from Spinal Tap with the fictitious band playing the part of the 1970s, 1980s rock band
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  with the hit song Hellhole.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  I would have called Haiti a hellhole.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  There's probably 20 or so hellholes, maybe 80 SH-T holes.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  The English Oxford Dictionary calls any country that has squalor and doesn't have a lot of electricity
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  or running water or sewage a SH-IT hole.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  So whether the president said this or not, the English Oxford Living Dictionary would define Haiti
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  as one of the worst SH-T holes in the world.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  But Trump, just like he said two weeks ago, he said, I didn't say all the Haitians have AIDS.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  That's preposterous.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  We've sent extra aid there.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  But see, they can't have it either way.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  He just kicked 200,000 Salvadorans out of the United States and forced them back to gang violence,
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  ravage and impoverished disaster area.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  But I thought he was going to betray us on DACA.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  Now he was trying to make a real deal where you had to be vetted.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  So this is just the media telling conservatives he betrayed us on DACA, which he didn't do.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  Then putting on another fake quote, he didn't say, by the fake media famous for that.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Now we're going to go to Scott Adams, who's a linguist and expert in his own right,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  bestselling author, of course, creator of Dilbert and so much more,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  that Scott Adams says here in a moment.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  It's always great getting him on my broadcast, The War Room, Real News with David Knight.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  It's great to have him join us.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  And of course, you can visit his website as well, scottadams.com.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  I'm always just visiting him on Twitter.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  So we're going to talk to him in a moment about this and get his take.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  He was coming on about some other subjects we'll get into as well when we set him up a few days ago.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  But I wanted to play the former deputy director of the CIA, Phil Mide,
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  who said a few months ago, we're going to kill the president.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  The deep state will kill him.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  If we come a long way, they at least admit it exists.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  So now saying all of us that were Irish and all of us that came here,
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  because you know, the evil protestants, we were all the SH holds.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  I'm like, no, those are Democrat party run areas where they're closer to Haiti or whatever.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  I want to empower Haiti.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  I've said aid to Haiti.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  I've been involved.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  I didn't swendle it like the Clintons did.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  So there's reality and then there's fiction.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  And so even if the president said this, which he said he didn't,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Haiti isn't known as one of the biggest, you know what?
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  It's people that come from there.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  People I know from India call places like Calcutta, A-S-H, you know what hole they are.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  When there's open sewage, that's the definition.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  A hell hole is North Korea or a collapsing society like Venezuela.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  There's not many of those.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  But the Democrats would turn us into a hell hole like the South Side of Chicago.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  Then right next to it's prosperity and no crime.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  It's culture.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  It's media.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  It's Democrat blue state areas.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  You look at a map of the U.S.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  everywhere there's blue is where you find the hell holes and the crap holes.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  So the Democrat really are, they are the crap hole party.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  I think the president should own this and say, well, I didn't really say it,
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  but you know the dictionary says that Haiti is a S-H-T hole.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  The Democrats have robbed it, made it a worse crap hole.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  So here's that clip and we'll go to the creator of Dilbert.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  Are you shocked or surprised by this?
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  I'm not surprised.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  In one way I'm proud.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  I am a proud sh**t holder.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  My family was called WAPS and macro leaders.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  I'm proud of that.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  We came when people from Ireland and Italy were seen as dirty people.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  Dirty Catholics who didn't belong in a Protestant country.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  S**t holders built this country.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  Trump is a Catholic.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  Let's continue.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  It's all projected, but the creator of Dilbert,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  he's really the expert on this language stuff.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  I'm just kind of a natural guy that just looks at it,
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  but he's got the technicals in a moment.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Let's continue with the guy that said,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  we're going to kill the president.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  Here he is.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  They were called slopeers and slan eyes.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Did you adopt a person from a starving orphanage
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  in South Korea like my parents did?
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  No, you are another elitist scumbag
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  that's all talked on the KKK Democratic Party.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Let's continue.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  Built this country.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  S**t holders from Japanese internment camps.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  It was Democrats put up in there again.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  It was those camps as American citizens
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  and that's a legacy that we bear shame for.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  That's right.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  You were the Democratic Party,
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  but Eisenhower and the Republicans
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  and my grandfather in Texas politics
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  when nobody else in his area was a Republican,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  he got elected as a Republican
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  and they put the black kids in the schools
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  and they did it all
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  and then you turn around and tell me I'm a racist.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  No, you're part of the real crap whole party, the KKK.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  Mr. Mudd, excuse me.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  I'm ranting here.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Scott Adams blog.dilbert.com at Scott Adams on Twitter.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Thank you for joining us for this segment in the next.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  You heard me ranting the last four or five minutes.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  What do you make of this of this SH storm that's going on?
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  Well, as usual, things are not necessarily in context.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  So one of the contexts that you see left out quite often
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  is that when he said,
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  why can't we get more people from Norway?
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  Sometimes they mention it,
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  but usually they don't,
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  that he had just got done meeting with the Prime Minister of Norway
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  and he had been talking about Norway, Norway, Norway,
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  probably for an hour and a half that day.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  And so when he was trying to come up with the name of a country
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  that was prosperous, he said Norway.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  So if you leave that context down, it changes a lot.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  The other context you probably need to put on this
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  is that the damage that the president created,
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  and by the way, I could be, you know, got out to the public,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  was clearly just a mistake.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  And as mistakes go, it was sort of a 10 out of 10.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  You know, it's about as high as you can get
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  on the offensive mistake level, so I don't defend it in any way.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  But if you put it in context,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  what he said was in a room with no cameras and no recording.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  So it was a bad thing to say,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  but in the context of the room, everybody in the room
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  understood it to be his usual colorful language
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  talking about the economic situation of those countries,
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  because the whole reason they were talking about those countries
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  is because they had a bad economic situation.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  That's why they were favorite of the first place.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  He's denying he's got it, but I want you to address that,
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  but if he did, he has called our infrastructure totally crappy.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  That doesn't mean he hates America.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  Well, so here's the point I'm heading toward.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  He said it's probably something along those lines.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  You know, the details are a little less important,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  but here's the thing, whatever he did was bad,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  and I don't defend it, but it was also limited to the room.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  Whoever leaked it, and then whoever, you know,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  the writer for the Washington Post who decided to magnify it,
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  turned it from a small, bad, unfortunate comment
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  that I wish he hadn't made in a room
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  where it would have been contained into something,
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  into something that's a million times worse.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  They're the ones that brought it out and put salt in the wound
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  that a private conversation, I get your point.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  Yeah, so if you're, if you're going to,
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  there's nothing that excuses what the president said
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  because he put himself at risk for being quoted.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  There's no excuse for that, and it is offensive,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  but if you were to compare that, I like to use this analogy.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  If somebody is guilty of manslaughter, you can defend it.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  It's a 10 out of 10, it's as bad as you can get,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  but if you were to compare that to say, you know, a genocide,
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  everybody would agree that the genocide is worse.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  That the Clintons admit they were involved in a Rwanda.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Well, a genocide is bigger than a manslaughter of one person.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  So the president is certainly guilty of creating a situation
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  where this could get out, but whoever the leaker was
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  has committed a far, far more serious crime against the country,
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  not crime exactly, but offense.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  It's, it took a small offense that could have been contained
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  and turned it into a gigantic issue.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  That's a, you know, it's a bloody nose for the country.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  It's bad for our, the way we deal with our, our allies.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  It's bad on every level.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  And I think you have to hold maybe not the Washington Post responsible
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  because they do reporting for a living,
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  but leaking isn't anybody's job.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Nobody, nobody took a job to be a leaker.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Whoever did that has to share, I would say 95% of the damage.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  You know, I think they have to own that,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  but the president doesn't get off at all.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  I give him, you know, I would say that this is a bad move
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  on his part, period.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Well, he says he didn't say it, but he did say I use some harsh language.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  He should just come out and say that Clinton stole $2 billion out of Haiti,
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  even the Huffington Post admits that.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  And that this is a complete joke and more fake news.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  I mean, listen, I could say maybe he used harsh language like that,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  but what about all the other fake news they've been caught putting
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  on against him over and over again?
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Well, let's look at context again, because if you change the context,
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  you can create fake news where there is none.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  And one of the questions that I've asked the press to see if they can wrestle
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  with today is the question of if the president got his preference
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  of a merit-based immigration system,
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  given that most of the world is not white,
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  wouldn't that, by his design,
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  create a system where mostly non-white people are immigrating
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  simply because of the math of it?
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  The brain drain. Let's talk about that.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Really smart with Scott Adams of Dilbert.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  We'll be back. Let's talk about the brain drain straight ahead.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  the organic wormwood.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal

[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars,
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  are absolutely fantastic,
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  It might seem like a simple thing,
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Well, thank you.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me,
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  but it says Won't Tread on Me,
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  and it's a big Daeglo snake, Gadsden snake,
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-Shirt.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  Trigger Warning T-Shirt,
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  in the infowars.com on the back.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  That is the new shirt of the month
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  available exclusively at infowars.com.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  Well, I've always liked Dilbert,
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  and I've also read his new book, Win Bigly.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  And Scott Adams, of course,
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  endorsed Hillary for his own safety,
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  but he's been more of a, what do you call him,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  a Libertarian or a conservative or a liberal over the years,
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  and he always gets me to think about different angles,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  and it doesn't mean I totally agree with him.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  I think Trump's being more like Putin.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I don't mean on policies or being pro-Russia,
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  but Putin would say this is a crap whole country.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  I mean, you have Trump even really said it.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  I've just seen media lie so much.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  I don't know how we can even agree that Trump really said it.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  But then when the Oxford English Dictionary says
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  a third-world country without running water
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  or without sewage is a SH-T hole,
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  I just say own it then.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  That's why people like Trump.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  But I can see what you're saying in these countries
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  then hurting our relations.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Well, I think the Clintons robbing them hurts the relations.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  But I want to hear you flesh this out
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  and the point you were getting to as we went to break Scott Adams.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  Please continue.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  Well, the point was about context.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  And if we haven't compared the president's future plan
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  of a merit-based system,
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  I don't know if we can determine whether his merit-based system
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  would be biased toward white people or not.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  But if you just do the math,
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  I think 25% of the world is white,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  and they may be disproportionately in countries
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  where they're less inclined to want to immigrate,
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  because they may have good economies in their country.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  So I think you're comparing two proposed systems
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  in which both of them get you far more brown people,
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  but one is merit-based,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  where the people who come in are more immediately adding
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  to the quality of life in this country, and some are not.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  It's a completely fair argument as to whether or not
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  you should have a merit-based system.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  But I think it's false to say that one system
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  brings in lots of brown and black people
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  to use the phrases that are being used in the news,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  and one doesn't, because as far as I can see,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  both of them would do pretty much the same.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  Well, pragmatically,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  Trump two, three years ago said over and over again,
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  I'm not against all Mexicans, they're not all criminals,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  that's a lie.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Well, a lot of criminals are coming in unvetted,
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  and he gave examples, they take me out of context,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  and then the conservatives were all mad at him going,
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  he's saying he's going to go for a docket if they vet the people.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  Well, that's a betrayal. No, he never said that.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  It's like conservatives go, super right wing ones,
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  no, he hates gays, because the media said he did.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  He's got rainbow flags at the convention,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  he's got people coming out of the closet up there,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  eloquently like Peter Thiel,
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  and then when he doesn't come out as anti-gay,
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  they go, oh my gosh, you betrayed us, you're not anti-gay,
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  but it's the leftist media misrepresenting,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  and then it's just crazy.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Well, yes, and also keep in mind that we observe this president
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  using hyperbole and exaggerating on every topic
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  about everything.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  So everything he does, he says, is the best in the world,
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  which I think is good technique, by the way,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  and he says that everything that he doesn't like
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  is the worst thing in the world and some kind of a hole.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  So this is the way he talks about everything all the time.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  If you were in that meeting, you probably knew
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  he was just talking about the economic circumstances
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  of those countries, but as soon as it leaves that meeting,
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  whoever leaked it turned it into something different
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  by changing its context.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  The leak is the issue.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  I mean, why do these people keep doing incendiary things,
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  whether they're true, half-true, lies?
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Aren't they really the ones endangering the country?
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  Because you can say, well, let's talk big.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  If we had the biggest industrial base, we had the future.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  If Trump says we're great, we believe it again,
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  we look at the economy, look at everything.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  It's manifesting.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  It's not like Oprah's secret where you just shazam
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  can make a palace out of the sky because you believe it.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  We have the infrastructure, we go back to it.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  It looks like Trump's exuberance is working.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Yeah, and I would also go back to something
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  that a famous blogger named Scott Alexander
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  once wrote about.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  It's the phenomenon that if you hear something in the news
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  that just sounds unbelievable,
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  it is almost certain that it didn't happen.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  So, for example, when it's been widely reported
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  that the president called the white supremacist
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  in Charlottesville find people,
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  well, that seems so amazing that you say, oh, my God,
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  is that possible?
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  And the answer is he almost certainly was thinking
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  about there must have been other people there.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Maybe there was just some Trump supporters
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  who like free speech or whatever.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  So, it is unbelievable because it probably,
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  almost certainly, didn't happen.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  Likewise, what he said that coming,
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  the immigrants coming from Mexico included, you know,
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  rapists and murderers, whatever his exact quote was.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  If you interpret that to think that he believes
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  that everyone coming over the border is a criminal,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  that's hard to believe.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  And the reason it's hard to believe is because
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  there's no chance he was thinking that.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  Let me ask you this.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  Where do you see this going?
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  Because mainstream media keeps ratcheting up the rhetoric,
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  ratcheting up the rhetoric with Phil Mudd,
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  you know, saying we're going to kill the president
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  a few months ago.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  And now he says, you know, he's called us all,
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  all of us assholes when we didn't,
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  personalizing it, where if I go out now,
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  they'll attack me, throw coughing on me,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  they scream Nazi, they scream Russian agent.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  I mean, this is like a witch hunt
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  at the levels of the Salem trials.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  And I am not a witch.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  And I basically have people chasing me down the street
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  with pitchforks and torches screaming,
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  witch, witch, witch.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  And it's insane.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  It's not even scary to me.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  It's insane.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  Well, you know, the witches are always the ones who say,
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  I'm not a witch, Alex.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  Exactly so.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  And I think you have to
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  allocate the blame rationally.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  The president did something
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  that made this new excitement possible.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Totally his fault.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Could have been avoided.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  It was a self-inflicted wound.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  But whoever leaked it turned it into a big
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  effin' problem.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  And that person needs to answer
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  for that morally, ethically,
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  practically, and politically.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  I think that
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  not knowing who that was,
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  whose judgment
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  was so bad
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  to think that this should be a story
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  that the public should be digesting,
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  it's almost mind boggling that somebody
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  could have made an ethical decision in that direction.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  Plus, Trump showed
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  if Democrats come to the table and are real with him,
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  he'll make deals. He's not a dictator.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  He's got to make deals.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  He lets them in and then every time they leak
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  or they embellish,
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  they've been caught lying, too, about stuff.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  So I don't agree with you that we know this was true.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  It was not that.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  I think he knows somebody might have recorded it.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  It was something else. It may have been close.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  I think you're partially right,
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  but I just think he's, I don't know.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  I agree.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  But when he gets nailed down, he starts getting accurate.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  But Alex, I would agree with you that it's unlikely
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  that we're hearing the quote exactly
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  as it was said.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  And chances are, if we heard it again in context
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  and the exact words following
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  whatever else had been saying
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  at the moment, it probably
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  would sound different.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  So I don't think he's necessarily wrong when he says
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  that he didn't say that
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  exactly, but I
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  think it's fair to say he was making
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  disparaging remarks about the quality
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  of some countries.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  I don't think that's true.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  But if somebody says to me,
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  like I've got India in friends and I've said,
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  you know, I've never been to India, where should I go?
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  And I mean, they're like, oh man, I'll tell you, you know,
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  I would not go to Calcutta or this or that.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:11.320]  If they're
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.320]  not just crap holes and because people are
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.320]  crapping all of the street, there's dead bodies.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:16.920]  I have family that's gone over there.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.400]  Some are totally beautiful and great.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.400]  It's not just crap holes.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:25.360]  Well, the context is you're the parent. You love your child. You're just being doing something dope
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:31.620]  Right, but but if somebody else calls your your kid a dope. Well, these are fighting words, right?
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:36.260]  So the problem is not whether it's interesting question and maybe one that's useful to know
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:44.560]  But it but it really matters who's saying it and in what context and
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:47.000]  And what are good countries called glory holes
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.720]  No comment
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.360]  Sorry go ahead. I apologize
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.920]  Well, I think I was done with that point that what what was said in the meeting was bad
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.160]  But whoever leaked it made it terrible. So context matters
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:10.560]  Do you think Trump's gonna end up being one of the greatest presidents ever or do you think just on this track?
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:16.640]  I mean, this is insane how because of the prosperity is coming in. I don't see how they were moving as long as the economy keeps surging
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.640]  well the
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:28.160]  The history of this sort of thing, you know, it happens every month or so is that it plays big for 48 hours
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.160]  And then it goes away. Do you remember? I think it was three or four years ago
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:39.000]  We were talking about this book called the fire and fury like our sense of time has completely changed because of this president
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.680]  Exactly. It's almost like he does so much of this as an idiot savant that it jumps from the one thing to the next. So, yeah
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.080]  So the one thing you don't have to wonder is if there will be another
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.840]  Outrage that will push this one off the page again
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:56.400]  But it will always live in people's minds as part of the confirmation

[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:52.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:01.360]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:11.360]  Watch me, watch me, I got it, watch me, I got it, hey
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:15.360]  I got something that makes me want a shelter
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:19.360]  I got something that tells me what it's all about
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:23.360]  I got stone and I'm super bad
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.360]  The **** has hit the fan
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:33.360]  President Trump's supposed comments according to two sources have riled the virtue signalers who live in their self-righteous bubbles of delusion
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:41.360]  In the presence of Senators Durbin and Graham and others, President Trump allegedly said, why do we want all these people from Africa here?
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.360]  They're **** whole countries
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.360]  We should have more people from Norway
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:54.360]  Ironically, back in 2015, former President Obama praised Ted Kennedy's 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.360]  A big notch on the belt for the United Nations replacement migration agenda
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:07.360]  Eddie McHugh writing for Breitbart in 2015 said, how have Kennedy's promises stood up to the passage of time?
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:16.360]  50 years later, the Census Bureau predicts that the foreign born population is set to increase 85% by 2060
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.360]  where Hispanics will see their numbers grow by the tens of millions
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:27.360]  and native born whites are the only group expected to decline in both absolute numbers and fertility rates
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:35.360]  50 years later, the U.S. places no numerical limit on the immediate family members of aliens admitted into the country
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.360]  despite holding only 5% of the world's population
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:47.360]  The U.S. is the most popular destination in the world for immigrants, attracting 20% of all the world's migrants
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:59.360]  50 years later, the U.S. allows some 11-20 million illegal aliens to squat on its territory while allowing over 1 million more each year to legally enter the country
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:11.360]  50 years later, the native born population of whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Jews and all the rest suffer economic loss while the foreign born see net job growth
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  Is there more to the president's alleged shocking remarks? Seeing as DACA has been a frustrating odyssey standing in the way of national security
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:28.360]  namely the campaign promise of the wall and while Nancy Pelosi makes outright racist remarks about white people
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:42.360]  The five white guys I called them, you know, I said you're going to open a hamburger stand next or what, the very idea that this week they're saying
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.360]  oh why don't we get four white guys and General Kelly to come and do this
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.360]  You have to understand in our caucus we are blessed with great diversity
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  The mockingbird media that Pew Research recently discovered is the most bias in the world is flipping the script
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:04.360]  Anderson Cooper has predictably declared the statement racist even though race wasn't an issue
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:11.360]  Perhaps the White House feels the president's remarks will be well received in some parts of this country, among some parts of the president's face
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:17.360]  and perhaps that is true, but it doesn't make what he said any less ignorant or any less racist
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.360]  Not racial, not racially charged, racist, let's not kid ourselves, let's not pretend or dance around it
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.360]  The sentiment the president expressed today is a racist sentiment
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:35.360]  This is how the psych warfare people do it, they go, we'll declare he's now caved in to us so that it'll look like he's double crossed if he doesn't
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:42.360]  and then we'll also say to the base he's betrayed them and that'll give us more leverage and we'll chip away at that pushing him more into our arms
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  and then we can still set him up and bring him down later once we've gotten rid of his base
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  That's the Machiavellian strategy
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  Virginia Governor McAuliffe has threatened the president with violence
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:58.360]  and former Mexican President Vicente Fox has declared Trump's mouth the foulest sh**hole in the world
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:04.360]  While the media and all the naysayers on Capitol Hill devolve into spineless mud-slinging children
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  Americans carry on through a fog of indifference knowing that deep down we can identify with the frustration generated by our political system
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.360]  as it races towards yet another government shutdown
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  Senators have agreed to a bipartisan fix for DACA, a fix that ignores the president's proposals
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:27.360]  downgraded by publications like The Daily Beast
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  writing, a top Senate Democratic aide said that the party would be open to agreeing to items such as additional drone operations, fencing and sensors
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  but not a presidential vanity project
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:47.360]  Of course, everyone knows best. The full report is up on infowars.com
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:55.360]  We'll be right back with James O'Keefe on the other side getting into how they're using Crapgate to cover up key issues

[02:05:54.360 --> 02:06:04.360]  Waging war on corruption
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:12.360]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:17.360]  Well he's not just one of the greatest investigative journalists of our time, he's one of the greatest investigative journalists of all time
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:21.040]  He's one of the greatest investigative journalists of all time and this isn't about Tootness Horngers
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:24.840]  He's on into that James O'Keefe and the great folks at Veritas project project Veritas
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:31.240]  It's about recognizing the reason we're even still here halfway as a country and as those that love freedom world-wide
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:38.280]  Bombshell number one story not in mainstream media, but was becoming that but on Twitter Facebook and YouTube top of all the trends
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:44.840]  It was shadow band gate the admissions eight different executives of Twitter admitting massive censorship well
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:47.480]  Right on time a whole new distraction
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:53.120]  More fake news president says he didn't say it. It's like two weeks ago. They said he said Haitians all have AIDS
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:58.960]  Didn't true Clinton's Rob Haiti. That's okay. He gives them extra age. He's a bad guy
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:02.480]  So James O'Keefe of Veritas gonna give us his take on this
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:09.840]  From the next shoe to drop and to see what happened since this other fake story obscured his vetted true story
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.880]  Where we have video and audio of them saying it not just more Democrats led into the White House
[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:19.640]  Making stuff up and I could say sources say Trump raped a little girl last night
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:23.960]  And you know and then roasted her in oven with an apple in her mouth total horse manure
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:31.400]  What about it said that a thousand times like like these these these people like Jim Acosta with all his fake news saying Trump didn't meet
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.720]  Was Khalees or you know that the Flynn has flipped the admissions a Russian agent. None of it true
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:41.120]  That's all ABC news CNN. So joining us is the consummate journalist just for the next eight minutes
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:47.480]  And of course that is the man that heads up project Veritas. That is James O'Keefe. So give us a report sir
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:55.040]  Well Alex the video yesterday was a sensation it blew up the internet blew up Silicon Valley and right on time
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:56.400]  the
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:03.640]  Media changed the subject to a single source quote from the president that there's I guess there there may be audio
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:10.040]  But there's no audio video and I saw a report in the Washington Post and it said something like there's no evidence to suggest
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.720]  He did not say this. I mean follow the logic
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:18.880]  There's no evidence to suggest he did not say we have audio video evidence of people in big tech
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:26.480]  Actually saying these things about targeting people who are quote rednecks and targeting people not not radical ideas
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:30.000]  But the American flag they have an algorithm that targets these key words
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:37.640]  So you may be saying well, they've won the battle this week and I of course always have more videos in my pocket
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:43.400]  I'm gonna wait till Monday morning, and then I'm gonna drop the really inflammatory one and we'll get back the news cycle
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:49.400]  And and this is what they're doing this thing where every time he brings Democrats in and to work with them
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:53.520]  They make crap up and they've been caught over and over and over and over again
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:09:00.560]  Well, yeah, I mean that there's gotta be some repercussions the Washington Post is not journalist Jeff Bezos owns it the richest man in the world
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:07.320]  The you know the Mexican kingpin. It was even Mexican. He I guess the the guy from the Middle East Carlos Slim
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.800]  Owns the New York Times. This is a joke
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.680]  Well, they're doubling down Alex there
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.420]  They're losing their relevance and legit and legitimacy when they see stories like the one that was broken this week
[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:25.620]  When they see James D'Amore suing Google when they see Charles Johnson and Roger Stone and Milo Yiannopoulos suing Twitter
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:30.700]  And when they see video tapes of nine Twitter nine Twitter executives
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:33.780]  Saying that they shadow banned their words not mine
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:36.900]  Shadow ban and downrank people that by the way
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:41.980]  Shtty people they use the same word about some of us
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:48.700]  They use that word about not right-wing extremists, but moderate voices. They call them sh itty people
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:54.580]  When that happens they go. Oh my god. It's almost it. It's almost like someone in the deep state was like here
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:59.540]  Hold my beer CNN. Why don't you throw something up on the Chiron? I mean, this is how these people work
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:02.140]  You it all just clicked
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:05.420]  That's why you're the genius you are literally that's it
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:08.620]  They always semantically reverse if the Clintons are in bed with the Russians
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:12.220]  They say we're in bed with the Russians if if they want to raise taxes
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:16.820]  They say Trump wants to and there it is they're calling knowing. Oh my god
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:23.340]  They're calling their users sh it people. They're calling whites rednecks and sh it people
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:26.580]  They're calling Julian Assange a hero this and that they're admitting it
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:31.540]  This is the thing worse than deplorables calling his supporters deplorables, and they go it's okay
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:34.940]  He just met with them on the Haitian thing. We'll just say he's home you
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:39.900]  Semantically because that's what they do they reverse you. Oh my god. That's it right there
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:46.460]  Yep, they semantically reversed it Alex because in the beginning of the tape that rock Silicon Valley do mass-headed drudge
[02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:51.660]  Everyone's seen it all the sources I have in Silicon Valley the woman's trust and safety counsel
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:54.060]  Which is the policy part of Twitter?
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:59.620]  How are William sounding is that trust and safety, but she goes we take the sh it t there it is
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:05.580]  We're trying to get the sh it t y people to not show up. It's a product thing. We're working on it's called
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:10.220]  Downranking or shadow banning and then a few hours later
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:18.460]  Suddenly the Chiron on CNN it go it says that Trump called these countries sh it
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:20.900]  I mean I mean you can't make this stuff up
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:23.660]  It's like a truth is stranger than fiction Alex
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:28.500]  We have to be we have to be guerrilla not only in how we gather the information
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:32.580]  But how we release it because we are taking on the palace guard you got a circumvent them somehow
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:39.780]  Unbelievable, you know there was something I was missing going this is the same word. It's the exact and and so
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:45.180]  They're not creative. I've noticed. I always wonder why when I say something they'll steal it and reverse it upside down
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:48.140]  Because they're not creative that and that's it
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:54.300]  That's it. They didn't know what to do. This was the number one story trending. They're calling us all if we're white
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:12:00.540]  Sh it they've been hired by the globalist bringing this whole system. They're in trouble. They know they're in trouble
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:04.100]  So they just reverse it. I think you're I think you're on target brother
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:06.460]  Yeah, it's it's bad
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:10.420]  But of course we we actually are as you noticed Alex the first video was there
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:15.700]  They may be sharing Trump's private direct messages with the Justice Department and people were like, oh, you can't prove it
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:23.340]  The second video is them calling people. They don't like sh itty and saying their shadow banning people who are rednecks and quote
[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:28.100]  Have the American flag and their tweets and you may think that oh, that's the best he's got no
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:32.540]  I've got more and we're gonna keep pushing we're gonna keep putting pressure on them and Alex
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:35.740]  This was actually trending on Twitter this video yesterday
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:43.460]  And it had some fifty sixty thousand tweets with the hashtag shadow ban and they actually shadow banned the trend shadow ban
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:48.660]  It was the trending but it was lower. They also banned you for a day or so as well to stop
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:53.220]  Yeah, they've banned me and they've reinstated me because Twitter knows that if they banned me
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:55.220]  It's only gonna it's it's a stricent effect
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:59.540]  They can't ban me effort. They only ban you for a while when you're about to go to number one
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:03.020]  Yeah, and then they reinstate you but we've got more tapes
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:08.020]  We actually have a tape and I have a message for Jack Dorsey who's maybe watching that Twitter Jack Dorsey
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:11.780]  Jack Dorsey is CEO of Twitter Jack every Monday morning
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:15.100]  You come out of Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco on Market Street
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:19.540]  You may recall interacting with some people who you thought were hobos or businessmen
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:25.060]  Well, just I want you to spend the weekend thinking about what you might have said to these individuals because Monday is gonna
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:29.700]  Rock your world, you know, it's funny. I got a call for one of my high-level Pentagon sources and he said
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:33.340]  We are about to destroy Jack Dorsey yesterday
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:38.580]  I didn't know it had anything to do with you. Is that what this has to do with is they say they've got something big on Jack Dorsey
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:45.140]  Well, they may have something I don't know what your sources have they may have something different than what I have but a lot of my
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:51.420]  Undercovered journalists have been interacting with a lot of Jack Dorsey's top engineers and some of the things they're doing Alex with your private
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.940]  Information, I don't send private information on direct messages
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:14:00.100]  But a lot of people send direct messages on Twitter and what they're doing with your information
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:03.780]  What they're how they're exploiting we know they're revenge pouring and aren't they?
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:09.460]  Well, they're that's that's mmm. You're gonna have to wait and see I'm not gonna scoop myself here Monday morning
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:14.100]  Well, the word is the Twitter folks are using their private network as a dark web
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:20.460]  Not just with our info, but they're trading in people's private messages was what I got from our sources. Is that where you're going?
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:28.060]  That's where I'm going and you you'll hear it and see it Monday morning and we'll take back the news cycle again
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:31.820]  Wow incredible because that's what they do with Facebook Google Twitter Amazon
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:35.700]  They take our data they use it off these systems that spy on us and they sell that
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:42.500]  Data and now they've created a whole new dark web with your videos and your private photos of you your wife your boyfriend
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:50.140]  Your whatever it is and it's a whole industry underground. Wow. How devastating do you think this will be by Monday when this comes out?
[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:56.700]  What time does this drop that project veritas on on Monday? I think it's gonna be 9 a.m.. Eastern time
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:15:02.860]  It'll be pretty devastating. You know all these things Alex confirmed suspicions. I thought the DOJ video was gonna be
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:05.860]  Devastating but they're weasel the way out
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:09.060]  So we have to shame them Alex and the only way to shame them is to figure out
[02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:14.420]  Where is their moral boundary lie? How bad does it have to get before they say? Okay? This is wrong right now
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:16.980]  I think they think what they're doing is actually quite good
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:22.620]  And they're getting patted on the back by their friends in mainstream media their cartels of mainstream media protecting big tech
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:27.420]  So we're going to shame them by exposing just how awful they can be and
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:34.660]  Perverted they can be an exploitative they can be so stay tuned Monday morning project veritas releasing part three of this investigation

[02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:28.980]  Well, there's a new time magazine cover out
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:37.020]  And they put an image of Trump his hair is fire, but I'm told Jack the sobic out of the term
[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:42.700]  On to it that year one and I'm growing and say what you want about Trump
[02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:49.060]  But he's getting rid of the globalist and he's actually trying to restore basic free market capitalism and it's been explosive
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:52.580]  That said I
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.380]  Don't just say James O'Keefe super smart. I
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.860]  Have tracked
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:21:02.180]  everything he's done as a lot of you have obviously and it's all been devastating and
[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:07.260]  And there's not many people out there that I can say have done as much as we've done
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:10.060]  Drudge has done more overall
[02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:15.060]  Trump has done more because the scale and
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:24.260]  You know right up there is James O'Keefe and I just celebrate his team his group
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:28.660]  His people and and we want them trying to move into that mode as well
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:33.540]  And and we do some of that. It's just that type of detective work is
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:38.140]  very expensive and it's very very focused and
[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:43.580]  It's something we want to do, you know, I'm gonna have
[02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:48.060]  Millie Weaver in here with a bunch of breaking news the next segment a bunch of other things
[02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:52.660]  I've gotten to get talking about things. We're not looking at all this big distraction or a story is there, but
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:55.700]  When O'Keefe was getting into
[02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:59.980]  Then the stuff is gonna release Monday and
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:07.460]  As he said a lot of this is so bad. You don't want to release it, but they don't ever stop and that's the info
[02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:09.460]  I've got is that
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:11.540]  Twitter
[02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:17.860]  Obviously like Google or other platforms can turn on your phones they can turn on the audio they can turn on the video and
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:22.620]  They have encouraged a culture
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:30.980]  Where they just lawlessly I mean you hear about people about to go to jail in the government for spying without warrants with fies and stuff
[02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:33.860]  And then they should get in trouble, but you've got these tech giants
[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:38.940]  I keep trying to explain to everybody that are bigger and more out of control than the government bureaucracies and
[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:42.140]  They're trying to become the government. I
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:49.180]  Mean Bezos controls trillions. He's worth a hundred and seven billion a couple days ago was a hundred four billion and
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:56.380]  The money is all out of a scam and out of government contracts and out of monopoly and out of government
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:23:02.300]  Kickbacks and government funding and Trump says we should get rid of that and the Washington post
[02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:07.860]  Comes out two weeks ago and says he thinks all the black people and 80 have AIDS didn't ever say it
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:11.580]  And now it's up that they're a crap hole and all this stuff and that's pretty obvious
[02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:18.980]  It's Trump's about to say taxpayers aren't paying $1.48 for every package you've got we're not gonna let you run sweatshops
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.480]  We're not gonna let you get CIA funding
[02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:28.860]  Yeah, now two Republican senators claim to have not heard Trump's sh-t whole
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.300]  country remark
[02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:33.860]  Let me tell you something if Trump did it. He don't up to it
[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.220]  But he's
[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:41.660]  Had a long conversations with Trump obviously on air, but off air and I
[02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:45.900]  Not gonna give any inside baseball about Trump
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:50.020]  Let's just say the grass is always green on the other side and
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:53.780]  Trump does not dislike black people and
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:59.420]  They just better watch out for when the time comes for the ace in the hole
[02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:06.140]  Because the aces there's some black aces down in the hole folks and I'm gonna leave it at that
[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:10.060]  That's why people like you know, he's out of control and had a bad issue before you know
[02:24:10.060 --> 02:24:14.180]  He's an interesting businessman. That's why Don King loves him and everything else Donald Trump
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:16.180]  the big secret is really likes black people and
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:24.340]  What he likes is interesting alive aggressive people he doesn't like black thugs or white thugs or anything like that
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:26.940]  but you know Donald Trump likes black people and
[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:29.780]  There's a big ace in the hole
[02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:31.860]  waiting
[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:33.860]  from the times
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:37.500]  But the president has not been married and a lot of other things
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:41.580]  But the point is is that I'm sick of them playing the race card
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:49.820]  Over and over and over and over again when he got all the awards from NAACP for hiring record numbers of blacks and putting them in
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.820]  management positions if they performed
[02:24:52.740 --> 02:24:58.220]  That's why Dennis Rodman loves him everybody else has been around him is black well in back 30 40 years loves Donald Trump
[02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:04.940]  Because Donald Trump doesn't care what color you are or if you're gay or whatever it is
[02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:09.460]  If you get the job done, you're gonna be promoted. You don't you're fired and
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:12.580]  I
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:18.300]  Look just just just pull up the graph the last the graph on zero hedge and the graph on the CNBC is like only 20 years
[02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:23.220]  There's another one I saw for 40 years, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics was set up. I was at 70 something years ago
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:30.500]  Pull it up black unemployment is the lowest. It's been since World War two
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:34.700]  Now see this is the difference between media
[02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:40.820]  They look at it under Obama and all the Democrats super high down super low
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:43.500]  Obama is over here
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:47.860]  Telling you how much he loves you all day when you had record unemployment 15%
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:52.700]  Now it's down at what five and a half percent
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:59.100]  See that's the difference and
[02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:06.540]  These aren't gonna be McDonald's jobs. These are 25 30 $40 an hour and by the way white unemployment is the lowest
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:08.740]  It's been in 30 plus years
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:11.540]  And
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:13.540]  That's what makes me so angry
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:18.180]  Is that I'm pragmatic too. I want everybody to do good
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:24.860]  I don't want the left out there brainwashing people turning them into crazy racist and and then the whites all get racist
[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:26.860]  And we're all in our little weird groups and
[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:36.140]  And along comes Trump it totally delivers uphill and these criminals
[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:42.980]  At the KKK Democratic Party they come along and they piss all over it and
[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:47.340]  It's sick
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:50.780]  Extremely sick
[02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:57.420]  But all the black people love Donald Trump. He was in more rap songs more stuff. They all loved him
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:02.220]  Until he ran for president and then they were told he's the worst guy since Hitler
[02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:09.580]  All the black people like Trump because all the contracts and all the money they made with him and how he brought them in
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:15.460]  But Kanye West they sees the best things in fly spread
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:21.100]  But Hillary Clinton says black people are super predators and are bad and you know what?
[02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:26.260]  You got a lot of black folks that are acting like predators out attacking white people. It's all over the news
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:30.260]  Liberals go. Yeah, I walked out of the plane and six black guys beat me up saying I was a Trump supporter
[02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:35.620]  I voted for Hillary and it's some gay white guy, but see that's the excuse
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:38.260]  to sit there and
[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:44.500]  Attack whoever you want, but if you're a racist black person and shoot your mouth off at Donald Trump
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:46.500]  He's gonna slap your ass right back
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.060]  But it's all a load of crap
[02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:54.700]  So by every metric black people
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:28:01.020]  By the way, he just signed up for prison reform so that blacks don't get more jail time for cocaine and whites
[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:03.340]  Oh, that's in the news today, but you won't hear about it
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:07.260]  That the you know who got that pass was the Clintons, right?
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.340]  Now if I was a real racist
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:17.740]  I'd play the race card me a Democrat and manage everybody via race and sit back and act like I'm this big loving person
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:24.980]  Well, I'm turning the white people into racist again because I've turned you the minorities into frothing foaming at the mouth
[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:28.140]  crazed racist, do you know what?

[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:12.160]  I was just kind of pointing at the bike. Hey kill that because it was echoing in my ear
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:17.920]  But I know you're a big fan of the products briefly Millie. This is unscripted. What are your favorite products for info wars life.com?
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:27.920]  Well, definitely the x2 is a staple, but I've also been really enjoying the new enzymes and probiotics that we also have as well
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.280]  I was originally taking the the probiotics that we had but this new probiotic
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.360]  I seem to be getting even better results with I also really like the secret 12
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:45.520]  That one really gives me energy and I cannot do without the vitamin mineral fusion because you have to be getting those minerals from somewhere
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:51.760]  Our food supply is depleted. We typically aren't getting the right amount of minerals as we should be
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.560]  So it's important to have a mineral supplement and it's crazy. I'm the guy that was never really into this
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:01.280]  But our big sponsors were supplements and then I had Dr. Group and they're saying why don't you actually try them?
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:06.720]  And I lost like 60 something pounds and I've been working really hard lately and haven't even been working out and stuff
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:10.160]  But because of the supplements, I'm lighter than I was 15 years ago
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:14.560]  And I've just got to remember take the vitamin mineral fusion give it to the kids
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:17.680]  You know take the immune boost
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:19.920]  Take the x2
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:23.200]  Take the secret 12. I don't need another cup of coffee at two o'clock three o'clock when I get off
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:27.920]  If I just take the secret 12 about an hour before it gives me the natural energy
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.760]  It's just amazing and then you're funding the info war and listen audience. You've done a great job
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:36.960]  But we're under attack. They've taken our sponsors. They've taken our google ads. They've tried to shut us down
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:42.480]  Despite that we brought in as much revenue last year as we did before but I'm expanding as everybody can see
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:44.640]  So I haven't paid myself from last year
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:50.720]  I I intended to with some things I could pay my bills but my bank accounts are actually shrinking because I'm not complaining

[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:16.800]  We're gonna have you and roger for the next three segments. Let's go to roger stone
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:21.520]  We haven't talked to him since last night to get his take on a crap gate
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:29.520]  Just and just how incredible it looks using the same thing. We have twitter executives calling their users any christians
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:36.720]  Any conservatives trump julian assange american flag sh it people they always invert then they say
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:42.400]  Oh, he said this quote the same thing to change the number one story from the truth to a lie
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:48.720]  We have video they don't trump has all these witnesses saying he didn't say it. Uh, what do you make of this roger stone?
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:53.040]  Well, I gotta tell you alex. I've been watching cnn
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.520]  I've seen change or just whip himself into a
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:02.160]  This is the best day this guy's had in years
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:04.880]  As they try to trounce on the president
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:08.720]  They had to find some way to distract from the fact
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:16.160]  That african-american unemployment is at the all-time lowest it has ever been in the entire nation's history
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:22.560]  They've got to find some way to distract from that and what better way is this entire charade?
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:25.840]  Speaking of which have you been to Haiti recently?
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:30.160]  If it weren't for the clinton is stealing all of that birth quake relief money
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:37.040]  Virtually all of it literally billions the country's destitute the situation is dismal there
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.440]  There is no housing. There are no
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:46.240]  Disease is ramp unemployment is out of control the country is a basket case
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:50.160]  Why because after they were hit by natural disasters
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:51.600]  Bill
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:57.200]  Is the head of the un task force and hillary clinton's heading the u.s. State department
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:06.160]  Stole literally every single penny for themselves in their cronies leaving Haiti in the dismal statements in today
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:14.320]  Imagine if the president announced a press conference or a 30 minute speech the american people saying
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:19.920]  You know the clinton stole two billion dollars even the media admits 99 percent of the money that was given
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.960]  They're involved in all this. I've had aid for Haiti
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.600]  I didn't say these things and I call for criminal investigations of what they did in Haiti
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:32.000]  The Haiti president everybody's saying they robbed the robbery is still ongoing
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:36.560]  It's been going on and imagine if you had a press conference to get back in their face and say
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.960]  This is a counter to black unemployment
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:45.200]  Being the lowest has ever been in modern history and my speeches and my commitment to try to direct new jobs
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:47.760]  businesses industry to black
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.400]  Impoverished areas true
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:56.080]  Uh, you know systems to actually help bring people up true affirmative action
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:01.520]  Shouldn't he have a press conference say tomorrow night or a speech to counter them right between the eyes
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.520]  Uh, I think it's good advice. I've always believed in the immediate counter attack
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:12.720]  Now is there video existing of the president saying this? No, I haven't seen any
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.080]  So so and the president denies it and his witness is to say he didn't say it
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:22.000]  Yeah, so it looks to me like a mainstream media manufacturer
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.160]  And it's been as a distraction a distraction from the fact that
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:29.680]  Senator Feinstein got caught ready into breaking the law
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:33.200]  Uh in trying to further the fusion gps
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:34.960]  charade
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:42.320]  Uh, the fact that the economy is cooking like never before that the north and south koreans are now at the table
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.120]  Thanks to Donald Trump. Oh my god. We've got to distract from all this good news
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:51.040]  Trump is not only making america great, but he's moving us towards peace
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:57.040]  So let's manufacture a new crisis in which we're able to call it racist. Exactly
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:41:59.200]  I see you know, roger
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:05.040]  It does make sense that this could just be more fake news because we even saw that the fake news media
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:12.400]  Edited a edited up a clip from that DACA meeting saying the trump was going back on his DACA campaign promises
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:17.760]  Which we all know if you watch the entire meeting, it's far from the truth and they remove crucial points there
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:22.560]  So it's very likely that you know, this is not true and trump denying it makes it even more so
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:26.800]  Well, you've got some great points. You're gonna make right when we come back, but exactly they lie at every angle
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:30.240]  They tell supporters he's going he's gonna totally say 50 million come here
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:32.720]  You can be 80 years old from another country you can come here
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:35.680]  And then and then he didn't do that and they hit the other side go
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:40.000]  He's gonna kill all the mexicans and then they go and he hates black people and they just and they go
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:45.360]  Oh, see he's gonna sell us out on DACA. Oh, he didn't do DACA. They lie at every level. It's just like
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:47.680]  Total lies total fraud
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:51.760]  We're gonna talk about that with roger stone millie weaver and more straight ahead info wars.com

[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:15.460]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100 efficiency
[02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:18.580]  Then they start producing reactive oxygen species
[02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:23.460]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage
[02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:26.340]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:32.020]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:39.380]  The stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals

[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:22.820]  So a spinal tap you know makes a joke about their hellhole countries like north korea or venezuela
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:26.100]  I mean countries that don't have running water and have sewage running down the streets
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:30.260]  That's how people do it. You just crap in the street. That's where the term sh it
[02:47:30.260 --> 02:47:35.140]  You know hole comes from but the president says he hasn't said it. You've got these witnesses saying hasn't said it
[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:39.540]  I want to know why the oxford dictionary says that they should be shut down in rustic his language is evil
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:42.180]  roger stone riding shotgun with us rob do coming up
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:45.700]  Millie weaver you've got a bunch of points to make and i want to get roger's take on
[02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:50.500]  What crump needs to do about this because you can't sit there while the washington post and jeff bezos
[02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:54.180]  The richest man in the world from slave labor and government kickbacks does this
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:58.020]  It's time to break his ass right now in his monopoly and take away his uh
[02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:00.740]  Is the dollar 48 he gets on every package
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:05.700]  Well, what's pretty clear to me after watching the entire meeting that was aired by the press
[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:10.980]  Where trump sat down with democrat republican lawmakers to put together this daca bill
[02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:18.260]  What was apparent was that the republicans were more than willing to compromise and actually there were a good amount of democrats
[02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:20.020]  That were willing to compromise
[02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:26.020]  But there seemed to be a handful like senator feinstein and others that wanted to come out and say well
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:29.220]  No, we just want daca, but we don't want to have to give an inch
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:30.420]  We just want daca
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:34.740]  We don't want to give on the border security which we know trump is trying to push through with that
[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:42.580]  And so what I feel is that trump made statements on twitter that they put forward a really bad offer
[02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:47.940]  Which most likely we can assume he rejected and this is the democrats way of throwing a hissy fit
[02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:52.500]  Throwing a fit saying look the daca thing isn't going to go through because trumps are racist
[02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:57.700]  Not because we aren't willing to compromise and that is exactly what they're trying to do here
[02:48:57.780 --> 02:48:59.780]  Yeah, so they just cooked it up and made it up
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:03.620]  Exactly and he's got to just counter that roger stone. I mean what does trump need to do right now?
[02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:05.620]  I mean this isn't really hurting him in fact
[02:49:05.620 --> 02:49:10.100]  It's backfiring even though he didn't say it people are going. Yeah. Hey, he is a crap hole or whatever
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:13.220]  You know didn't put down the people it's a crap hole because the clinton's robbed it
[02:49:14.980 --> 02:49:19.540]  Well, look alex downtown is the greatest counterpuncher in american politics
[02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:25.140]  Maybe the greatest counterpuncher in our american political history and he needs to get on off that
[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:27.460]  This is obviously a calculated
[02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:29.540]  distraction
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:32.020]  From the fact that he's succeeding across the board
[02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:34.180]  record stock market
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:39.460]  Unemployment at all time lows african-american employment at the all time low
[02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:47.620]  Uh, the south and north korean in peace talks isis on the run a solid conservative on the u.s
[02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:50.980]  Supreme court trump is delivering in spades
[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:57.620]  The democrats must distract somehow from it if i were the president i would use a bully pulpit
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:04.820]  I would call uh for uh, you know a televised address to the nation and i would get out there and counterpunch
[02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:10.900]  The greatest single amount of hootspa. I've seen is a tweet i just read from hillary clinton
[02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:13.460]  Which accuses the president of being racist?
[02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:22.660]  Racist hillary. No denying your your husband's son danie williams banishing him. That's racist calling black people
[02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:28.980]  Super predators and passing laws to give them more time for the same drugs. We can play the clips of her saying it
[02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:34.900]  Exactly trump should actually point out what the clinton foundation did in haiti and talk about, you know
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:39.060]  Democrats want to bring these people here as the solution. Why not talk about, you know
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:46.660]  The people staying there fixing the nation and clinton foundation companies not robbing those nations from from funds that would have helped
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:51.060]  Exactly, but again, uh, I can't believe they're even trying to get away with us. I mean
[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:57.620]  This is just so transparent roger. This shows. They're not giving up. I mean listen. I'm against monopolies anyways
[02:50:57.700 --> 02:51:04.020]  But you've got google facebook twitter all admittedly involved in censorship. You got bezos own the wash and post as fake news
[02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:08.900]  I think trump needs to move against them and break them up right now. They're not ever going to come to the table
[02:51:08.980 --> 02:51:13.380]  They are out to destroy this country. They're globalists. We got to deal with them right now. What do you think roger?
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:18.180]  Well, but then you saw the president saw it instincts on the massive
[02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:23.780]  Uh citizen surveillance bill before the united states senate tweets correctly
[02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:31.140]  That that this is being used to spy on the american people had been abused in the spying on his campaign
[02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:36.900]  And then the very people as he hired the people he appointed and the quizlings in congress
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:44.900]  Get to him and they turn him around again the president's instincts correct the people around him undermining those instincts
[02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:51.700]  So he's got to get back on offense and realize this is all all a giant mainstream media
[02:51:52.580 --> 02:51:54.020]  Democratic bait the switch
[02:51:54.020 --> 02:52:00.420]  We've got to get people distracted from the fact that trump is delivering that america is on its way back
[02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:06.980]  I am for the fireside chat. I am for the televised national address to the country
[02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:11.860]  The country would be riveted and the president would regain the initiative
[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:16.740]  And they'd have to not just a press conference not just him, you know, uh,
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:21.700]  You know occasionally out talking to some firefighters. He needs to just look right in that camera
[02:52:22.260 --> 02:52:26.740]  And go over his points and I go on the attack about the foundation the clinton's
[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:31.460]  Look how fast Ted Cruz quit when he brought up his dad the cia and all that in the bay of pigs
[02:52:31.780 --> 02:52:34.580]  I mean he needs to go on total offense. But like you said
[02:52:35.460 --> 02:52:37.460]  We now know why this happened
[02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:42.500]  Despite his despite everything his instincts despite the insiders the attacks everything
[02:52:43.140 --> 02:52:47.060]  We have the economy turned around two million new jobs record black
[02:52:47.540 --> 02:52:49.540]  unemployment
[02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:51.780]  All these good things happening
[02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:56.980]  Double the amount of appointments for people in the va and services, you know turn in the corner in less than one year
[02:52:57.620 --> 02:52:59.620]  Because of his instincts and his will but
[02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:03.620]  I was part of it. We were all conned by it or at least most of us
[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:09.540]  Bannon goes in we want to believe he's the good guy. The media told us he's the bad guys. It must be the good guy
[02:53:10.100 --> 02:53:16.900]  He goes in he betrays. He brings in the globalist. He sabotages. He prepares the 25th amendment. He gets caught thrown overboard
[02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:19.140]  We still cruise forward
[02:53:19.140 --> 02:53:22.100]  Uh weakened and wounded but stronger than the globalist by far
[02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:27.860]  And and and it's just so clear that now because of bannon who brought in the coterie of globalist
[02:53:28.260 --> 02:53:31.380]  The president isn't able to implement everything and if they weren't in the way
[02:53:31.860 --> 02:53:38.020]  Where will be be roger right now that wasn't for steven bannon and his benedict arnold judas iscariot type activity
[02:53:39.220 --> 02:53:44.500]  Now I think you put your finger on it. What's amazing is how much the president has been able to achieve
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:48.980]  Giving the intractable opposition of the two-party duopoly
[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:56.340]  And the elite of both of the national parties which still resent his election still can't get over it
[02:53:57.060 --> 02:54:04.180]  He not only has their deep enmity, but their resolve to remove him has not flagged a single inch
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:10.900]  Uh, I go back to new year's eve when we were high fiving each other and I said, you know
[02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:16.180]  We're at a high point right now, but they will still seek to take him down. They will never
[02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:21.220]  Admit his success. They despite his love. They hate his love for this country
[02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:25.940]  They hate the fact that he's committed to a reform agenda and that he's destroying the
[02:54:26.260 --> 02:54:28.260]  They call it mentally ill
[02:54:28.260 --> 02:54:31.620]  They call it mentally ill. You're supposed to be a psychopath and screw all the people of the world
[02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:34.500]  The things he's doing for us will raise wages globally
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:39.060]  They've been erased the bottom like ross burrow said the elites went totally poor people
[02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:45.540]  In coffin apartments. They control Bezos admits that and and then Trump's countering that with a prosperity message
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:50.740]  And all these people Africa's being told you can't have cars. You can't have air conditioning by obama
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:55.300]  Trump says yeah, you can have it all and they're it's just it's so obvious
[02:54:55.540 --> 02:54:58.820]  It is obvious and you know, roger. I have a question for you
[02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:04.500]  Do you think that it's possible that we could actually see the president come out and address the
[02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:10.580]  Uh project veritas videos on twitter and the censorship that has been going on and discrimination
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:15.620]  Against people who have certain political imagine a weekly address on each of these topics
[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:22.420]  It would devastate them like a fireside chats of issues and he goes on the offense instead of always being on the defense for the
[02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:26.660]  What we're saying is it must happen. They need to stop tying his hands his instincts
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:32.100]  Gosh, but the thing is that he's got oh, he's got advisors will give him disinfo. It's just roger. What do we do?
[02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:34.100]  This is so riveting. I can't turn away
[02:55:35.220 --> 02:55:39.460]  Well, you're exactly right. They are moving very very very quickly
[02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:42.580]  To shut down our access to social media
[02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:48.660]  The reforms announced by facebook yesterday if you read it says if it's not friendly and nice
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:53.140]  We're banning it, but the democrats can say they're going to murder us if we say don't murder me. That's bad
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:59.140]  Well, and there's a direct quote. We're going to be showing you less news and more of what we want you to say
[02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:02.660]  They're closing down channels on facebook
[02:56:03.220 --> 02:56:06.740]  Millions have already been disenfranchised. I know
[02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:13.620]  Republicans and conservatives and liberty-minded folks who own major facebook channels who have lost
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:20.900]  Millions of millions of followers and access in the last 72 hours. This is coming very rapidly
[02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:23.860]  The president crows about his prowess
[02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:30.180]  On social media, but he has to come to grips with the fact that they are moving aggressively
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:35.780]  To shut him by the way the commonest Chinese two years ago announced this where if you don't support their system
[02:56:35.780 --> 02:56:40.980]  They're going to downgrade you on their own social media and now they're showing you going be positive go along
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:44.500]  Shut up and we'll make you big if you don't you're gone
[02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:47.780]  But then by the time they've got everybody they shut that down too
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:53.460]  Now is the time our country has never been more divided now that we have social media if you really think about it
[02:56:53.460 --> 02:56:56.580]  It's because we have it was designed for a globalist takeover
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:56:59.940]  We use it to defeat them. They're trying to create a civil war
[02:57:00.020 --> 02:57:03.700]  They're trying to create division and then when you have democrats out democrats out there in the media
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:09.300]  Saying oh, we're going to punch the president. Oh, you know president is racist without anything sitting governor of virginia
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:13.620]  Exactly, but then he can say that that can be on twitter google and facebook
[02:57:13.940 --> 02:57:18.660]  We just can't say that's wrong. That's not coming together in the little cult with the trendy
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:23.220]  So that can't be heard. No, we're just going to call for scolese's death and trump's death
[02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:24.820]  And you're going to sit there and take it
[02:57:24.820 --> 02:57:30.260]  I want to come back with both of you after 70 second break and and and recap this milley because this is it
[02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:34.340]  This is the fight you want to defend the republic trump was only the beachhead

[02:59:48.100 --> 02:59:50.740]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:50.740 --> 03:00:03.380]  The globalists are scared of non-cyber activities. They're scared of people on the ground
[03:00:03.860 --> 03:00:07.700]  Tricorice puts in billions of dollars of fun anti-fascam
[03:00:15.940 --> 03:00:17.940]  If you are receiving this transmission
[03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:21.940]  You are the resistance it's alex jones
[03:00:25.940 --> 03:00:31.540]  That's right, and you know what we're talking about here what would happen with the march on google
[03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:38.100]  We ended up we we ended up taking a step back from that because of the threats of violence and the democrats coming out
[03:00:38.100 --> 03:00:39.620]  And it being used to set us up
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:45.140]  But the problem is like you were saying alex if we don't do anything if we don't stand up and actually take to the streets
[03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:49.780]  Rather than just twitter and in social media platforms where we're in our own echo chambers
[03:00:50.100 --> 03:00:54.660]  No one's going to hear us and nothing's going to change and that's why I feel like what's so important here
[03:00:54.900 --> 03:01:01.140]  Is what roger stone milo enopolis and these other people are doing by actually taking these people to court
[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:04.980]  That's very important, but also street action is very important
[03:01:05.380 --> 03:01:11.380]  We need to actually come up with another march on twitter march. Well, what you just said is I talked to google insiders
[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:16.260]  And they said they're so scared of you and cernovich announcing these marches coming up in a month
[03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:22.180]  So then they triggered their operations in virginia and did all that and then said about you and others just going to cover marches
[03:01:22.340 --> 03:01:26.820]  You were coming to kill people and then we were coming to kill people and now we learn internally
[03:01:27.220 --> 03:01:30.340]  I'm banned on google campuses. We're the number one enemy. They're scared of this
[03:01:30.580 --> 03:01:36.100]  Well, everyone's you just randomly go protest at google facilities and expose them, you know online and in person
[03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:41.860]  They're so scared of that. So yes in the next few weeks. I'm going to be announcing during the show
[03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:44.580]  for a flash events
[03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:48.900]  In in off of 360. They've got a google facility an apple facility
[03:01:48.900 --> 03:01:54.500]  They've got another one downtown and everybody has to do this because they're so scared of being cyber
[03:01:54.820 --> 03:01:58.580]  Called out but also in person. So as they restrict us online
[03:01:58.980 --> 03:02:02.740]  We start hitting the streets roger stone. Go ahead. Give us your take on that
[03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:08.100]  Well, you know, uh, my colleague tyler nixon yesterday invented a great new
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:13.860]  Hashtag stop the twat sees because that's what they are the twitter not sees the twat sees
[03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:21.300]  Uh, think of a think of a chain of humans and to hand like a circle all around the twitter headquarters
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:23.700]  You've got to cross the picket line to get in
[03:02:24.740 --> 03:02:31.140]  You have to fight them. Yes in the courts and I guarantee you my low and high and a host of others will be doing that shortly
[03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:33.140]  the mother of all lawsuits
[03:02:33.220 --> 03:02:36.980]  Multiple jurisdictions and multiple causes of action to avoid
[03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:43.460]  Them consolidating. You know, we will confront them in the courts, but they have to be confronted at their front door
[03:02:43.700 --> 03:02:45.700]  That's the beauty of the first amendment
[03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:47.780]  protest nonviolent protest
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:52.340]  And as libertarians and conservatives, we don't ever do that. We've got to do it now
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:56.580]  They're shutting on our free speech. They're involved in our phone calls. That's what digital stuff is
[03:02:56.580 --> 03:03:02.580]  They're like breaking in twitter facebook. I bet they break into our private messages and look at them and share them and laugh
[03:03:02.660 --> 03:03:07.460]  This is a group of truly criminal authoritarian dirt ball control freaks
[03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:10.420]  And and and we're coming after me. You know, I told everybody I'm gonna sue me
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:15.940]  I'm listening these lawsuits now by de bohr and others and more is coming and a lot more is coming
[03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:18.980]  Oh, we've got them on video saying they discriminate against me
[03:03:19.140 --> 03:03:21.300]  Thomas waiting for more comes out and I'm suing them as well
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:26.180]  And if you think for a second that you wouldn't have we're going to sue the google employees
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:33.860]  Well, I want to see some of the people who were in that terrific project veritas video
[03:03:33.860 --> 03:03:37.700]  I want to see them under oath in this on the stand. Let's see what they say then
[03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:40.820]  And jack dorsi, we know where you live jack
[03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:46.740]  We're going to form a human chain around your home every day day in day night. Have a nice time pal
[03:03:46.740 --> 03:03:52.740]  It's people. It's the first amendment. Get ready buddy. It's coming. It's the first amendment. It's best. Thank you
[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:54.340]  rogers town. We'll talk to you soon. Go ahead melanie
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:56.740]  and you know if you think for a second that
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:05.060]  Liberals if they were being discriminated against on twitter or youtube that they would just sit back and not do anything about it
[03:04:05.060 --> 03:04:07.060]  Or just say oh, let's just use a different platform
[03:04:07.140 --> 03:04:10.740]  No, they choose you don't make gay guys a cake. They see you fine
[03:04:10.980 --> 03:04:14.580]  But we're not even I mean, I'm not even we're not letting any access to anything
[03:04:14.580 --> 03:04:20.580]  We have to see because we're shi people. They have us on video calling us, you know that
[03:04:21.220 --> 03:04:24.500]  Calling the shite, but oh, but see they've got a made-up quote
[03:04:25.060 --> 03:04:29.860]  So they can discriminate, but the cake maker can't sorry, but this is grounds for lawsuits
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:35.540]  This is grounds for massive protests and you know that liberals would be doing it if it were them
[03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:39.460]  So we need to do well. They've hired a bunch of racist minorities and told them
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:42.420]  It's your time to suppress white people for what happened a hundred years ago
[03:04:42.420 --> 03:04:46.980]  And that's what they've done. We'll be back with the key to this whole operation stay with us. Thank you, roger
[03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:49.140]  Milly stay there. We'll learn this rob dude
[03:04:52.420 --> 03:05:00.100]  I'm so excited the new product at info wars life.com in a glass bottle two month servings filled to the brim

[03:05:06.980 --> 03:05:10.820]  A new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate
[03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:17.380]  Because it's beyond that quite frankly, uh, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:23.220]  Prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars
[03:05:24.100 --> 03:05:25.780]  for the formulae
[03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:30.180]  And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non-gmo
[03:05:30.740 --> 03:05:33.700]  Made right here in america 120 capsules
[03:05:34.260 --> 03:05:37.060]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglenone to it
[03:05:37.060 --> 03:05:43.220]  Which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands
[03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:45.620]  It is amazing
[03:05:46.420 --> 03:05:51.460]  Red pill now available at info wars store.com and your purchase fugs the operation
[03:06:00.180 --> 03:06:03.540]  Big brother mainstream media
[03:06:03.540 --> 03:06:05.540]  Government cover-ups
[03:06:06.180 --> 03:06:08.180]  You want answers?
[03:06:08.180 --> 03:06:10.180]  Well, so does he
[03:06:10.180 --> 03:06:12.180]  live from austin texas
[03:06:12.180 --> 03:06:14.180]  Broadcasting worldwide
[03:06:14.740 --> 03:06:16.740]  It's alex jones
[03:06:21.780 --> 03:06:24.260]  All right, rob dude taking over in this shower
[03:06:24.260 --> 03:06:27.780]  We've got millie weaver now in the control room with some final comments. I'm alex jones your host
[03:06:27.780 --> 03:06:29.780]  But let me just explain this right now
[03:06:29.780 --> 03:06:32.020]  There's some truth to people that say
[03:06:32.020 --> 03:06:35.140]  Facebook, google, twitter, you know, they're they're properties
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:37.700]  like youtube
[03:06:37.700 --> 03:06:39.220]  they
[03:06:39.220 --> 03:06:40.660]  They
[03:06:40.660 --> 03:06:41.860]  They
[03:06:41.860 --> 03:06:46.980]  Have their own platform. So why are you bitching? Well, they're very same groups are running around saying censor us take control of us
[03:06:46.980 --> 03:06:51.380]  Hillary was she got elected knock them all off the web. I mean they're everywhere just saying shut us down
[03:06:51.380 --> 03:06:56.660]  And I like it it to they built a gingerbread house to say everybody come in and play come in and eat have some free candy
[03:06:56.660 --> 03:06:59.780]  It's great. It's fun and now they're going push in the oven in the oven
[03:06:59.780 --> 03:07:01.780]  Yeah, now we're going to put you in the oven. We don't like what you're saying
[03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:05.380]  Hansel and gretel exactly and then they're censoring the liberals and other people that are independent
[03:07:05.380 --> 03:07:10.500]  They're coming into muscling going. Oh, you got 20 million views pretty pie. Do what we say or your band
[03:07:10.500 --> 03:07:16.580]  He's like, I'm not even a conservative. It's all about muscling right knowing the power of the people knowing that was coming on the internet
[03:07:16.580 --> 03:07:22.900]  They created these things to so people would make it big and then now they come in and censor it while they want to censor any other
[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:24.900]  site these are internet ghettos, but
[03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:27.780]  It's a fraud. It's racketeering
[03:07:27.780 --> 03:07:33.860]  It's fake advertising it's discrimination. We hit them there, but like Matt drudge said and as I've said
[03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:39.860]  We got to create our own websites like info wars.com or news wars.com. We've got to create our own platforms
[03:07:40.340 --> 03:07:48.500]  And listeners have to go to those platforms realizing and share that info realizing that it's all up to us if you
[03:07:49.300 --> 03:07:55.700]  Go to news wars.com or prison planet.com and if you go there and if you share those links on
[03:07:55.700 --> 03:07:57.700]  The enemy's platforms with your own
[03:07:57.700 --> 03:08:03.700]  Email your own by hand. They can't stop us. So at the end of the day, it's up to you
[03:08:03.700 --> 03:08:05.700]  But they are already ratcheted us down
[03:08:05.700 --> 03:08:10.980]  But because we fought so hard. We've stayed the same size the last year which is completely confounded them
[03:08:10.980 --> 03:08:16.980]  So they're in panic mode. That's why they have congressional hearings everything else because it's not working
[03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:18.980]  Well, the answer is
[03:08:18.980 --> 03:08:24.260]  Sue congressman quickly saying shut us down as fake news for civil rights violations
[03:08:24.260 --> 03:08:29.460]  And we're behind the scenes suing people. There'll be public lawsuits. Don't worry. But, you know, we're doing it
[03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:33.460]  But it's not we're happy about it. That's why we need to be flooded with money
[03:08:33.700 --> 03:08:39.700]  Because I don't have money to even expand right now much less do all these people say oh sue do this do that
[03:08:40.180 --> 03:08:45.940]  Buy a t-shirt buy some books buy some videos buy some supplements. You need water filtration air filtration
[03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:50.820]  Whatever the best systems are out there right if we some see discounted in foreshore.com because without that
[03:08:50.820 --> 03:08:56.100]  We're nothing without you. We're nothing. We're this is a real war. This isn't just media and conservative liberal
[03:08:56.100 --> 03:09:00.100]  This is the full takeover and we're in the fight, but it's happening now
[03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:03.620]  The future is being decided now Rob do well
[03:09:03.620 --> 03:09:08.980]  I'd like to just point out that you were ahead of your time by creating you created a social media platform
[03:09:08.980 --> 03:09:15.140]  Years ago it ended up, you know kind of dying. Well, I got infiltrated and it wasn't all fancy with CIA money
[03:09:15.140 --> 03:09:17.300]  But right right you didn't have CIA backing
[03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:22.180]  You didn't have the the push to the front but still it's people that need to make things like that like their own
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:29.140]  Social media sites to take away and then gab did and google bans it on there and then calls for it to be shut down
[03:09:29.140 --> 03:09:31.140]  Right, they don't want competition
[03:09:31.140 --> 03:09:36.020]  And it's like hey if you don't like what the people are saying on gab don't respond to them or don't put don't follow
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:40.900]  But it's way beyond all that. We're under total criminal censorship attack. Oh, yeah
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:48.500]  Bezos is making a billion dollars every two days off the scams. He runs and government funding
[03:09:49.060 --> 03:09:53.060]  The washington post is literally the enemy of this country because we keep being reasonable
[03:09:53.220 --> 03:09:58.900]  Right, you know keep us kind of looking at the facts and the evidence and oh debating this and polishing that the globalists are
[03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:04.500]  Absolutely in total war against the recovery against the president against all of us. Yeah, no more
[03:10:05.060 --> 03:10:08.500]  Just shitting there like pundits analyzing this and and uh
[03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:13.060]  James O'Keefe hit it on the head. They use the word sh i t t y
[03:10:13.540 --> 03:10:19.620]  Against because they're on video calling all whites conservatives trump supporters play that because we can't do that
[03:10:19.620 --> 03:10:23.780]  We're not upper class elite liberals. They're allowed to say because it's documentary and they're okay
[03:10:24.020 --> 03:10:27.380]  We can't and then three hours later. They come out with the same thing. Oh trump said this
[03:10:27.620 --> 03:10:32.100]  Who do we have we have people according to people familiar with their reactions?
[03:10:33.220 --> 03:10:35.220]  Those people weren't even in the meeting
[03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:40.340]  According to people familiar with their people the meeting say they didn't say it. Of course. They're lying of course garbage
[03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:42.820]  You're gonna be taken over soon. Really. We were final comments
[03:10:43.460 --> 03:10:44.500]  well
[03:10:44.500 --> 03:10:48.740]  It's obvious that we are seeing social media networking companies right now
[03:10:49.460 --> 03:10:54.580]  Fighting for the right to control their chattel their brainwashed
[03:10:55.060 --> 03:11:02.260]  Masses beyond that. They're saying we're gonna social engineer with algorithms what you're allowed to even talk about to engineer you
[03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:07.620]  Where you don't interact in the real world you interact through cyberspace and then in this virtual reality
[03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:11.460]  We condition you to behave the way we want or you don't get human activity
[03:11:11.540 --> 03:11:13.540]  We put you in solitary confinement
[03:11:13.700 --> 03:11:17.860]  They are creating their own echo chambers through their bots through their algorithms
[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:22.660]  So if we were to just say hey, let's just leave in only beyond our platforms
[03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:31.140]  We miss the opportunity to awaken the masses the masses that are still watching cnn and watching don lemon and believing
[03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:33.940]  The lies and disinformation so we have to fight
[03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:38.500]  We have to stand our ground and you know that if the liberals were being discriminated off these platforms
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:41.700]  They would do the same so we have to do it. That's my
[03:11:42.100 --> 03:11:43.460]  I agree. They're authoritarians
[03:11:43.460 --> 03:11:46.660]  I just thought people could go online and act like fake liberals
[03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:50.340]  For a few months and build it up and and actually and then say it was all fake
[03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:54.660]  Just to show people but listen they found people that only want social media power
[03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:59.380]  They get the dopamine of getting promoted so they don't care what the truth is
[03:11:59.380 --> 03:12:02.660]  There could be a cure for for death. These people don't want it
[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:06.980]  They have chosen people in these things that are literally pure scum
[03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:13.060]  And so some say the answer is leave facebook twitter and google and I agree the president needs to break it up
[03:12:13.540 --> 03:12:18.660]  Google facebook and twitter are a greater threat than hitler who wanted to conquer the world because they're scientific
[03:12:18.980 --> 03:12:22.500]  They're committed. They're evil. They're using psychology. So I agree
[03:12:22.980 --> 03:12:27.780]  It's now time to shut down google. They want to shut our speech down. It's just hit me fine
[03:12:27.780 --> 03:12:34.020]  It is time to have congressional hearings and all of it and not just break it up
[03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:41.700]  It's time for google facebook twitter and all these groups as criminal international crime syndicates with everybody's personal data
[03:12:41.700 --> 03:12:43.220]  We're going to break next monday
[03:12:43.220 --> 03:12:47.700]  Sharing our photos our videos turning our cameras on recording in as intelligence agencies
[03:12:47.860 --> 03:12:53.060]  It's time for facebook google twitter to be shut down as criminal operations
[03:12:53.380 --> 03:12:55.540]  Just like the soviet union or nazi germany
[03:12:55.540 --> 03:12:58.660]  It is time to shut them down
[03:12:58.900 --> 03:13:05.060]  It was all started with dirty money cia funding is what started left us cia money exactly and it was to create this
[03:13:05.380 --> 03:13:10.420]  Panoptagon that we're in right now this social media panoptagon where they try to control everything you want to say
[03:13:10.740 --> 03:13:14.500]  And that is the the danger that we're in right now. We do have to break free
[03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:18.500]  I mean you just read zuckerberg's statement of what he's saying. They're going to start doing him
[03:13:18.500 --> 03:13:21.460]  He put this out yesterday. He's basically saying we're shutting people down
[03:13:21.460 --> 03:13:26.420]  We're shutting people down, but he does it with a smile. Remember the velvet glove over the iron fist
[03:13:26.660 --> 03:13:31.620]  That is what is going on again with facebook. He announced like if it's not loving and liberal. We're shutting it down
[03:13:32.020 --> 03:13:37.380]  He says if it's not friendly and then meanwhile, they're all they're saying we're going to kill you. We're going to murder trump
[03:13:38.100 --> 03:13:41.940]  Sitting governor saying i'm going to punch the president out hashtag hunt republicans
[03:13:42.180 --> 03:13:47.620]  He's government saying i'm going to kill everybody cussing screaming if you say it's wrong to say kill people you're shut down
[03:13:47.780 --> 03:13:50.500]  Exactly. I mean he even says these are total cowards
[03:13:50.500 --> 03:13:54.740]  I he said we're basically going to make these changes and you're going to see your traffic go down
[03:13:55.220 --> 03:13:58.180]  And basically what he's saying he's going after people who are content creators
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:03.460]  That is he says it right. He says we're only going to feed you what we want, which is the big corporate sponsors
[03:14:03.460 --> 03:14:07.780]  So facebook is killing itself twitter is google and they're doing it early
[03:14:07.780 --> 03:14:10.260]  They were always pumping dumps to get everybody involved and do this
[03:14:10.340 --> 03:14:12.900]  But now we're forcing their hand and they're done
[03:14:13.140 --> 03:14:15.140]  Well, I tell you what if we don't do something now
[03:14:15.140 --> 03:14:22.340]  This next election 2020 the big election it's going to be you're not going to hear anything from the other the conservative opinion
[03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:27.380]  You know, all you're going to hear is liberal talking points for an antifa is going to come out like we can't even go to the
[03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:32.500]  Oh, right. We can't go to the capital. There's guys with guns and the cops go. They're anti for they're allowed
[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:36.900]  They go you don't come in here right and it's like whoa, and they're like black kids can't go to school
[03:14:36.980 --> 03:14:41.060]  You know until eyes and how we're sitting in the troops the democrats, you know, we're not letting them do it
[03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:45.540]  The democrats said no black kids can't go to school merely closing comment before rob do takes over
[03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:53.060]  Well, you know in the 1930s the telephone companies were broken up because they had a monopoly on the system and they and
[03:14:53.220 --> 03:14:58.980]  Congress did this because you wouldn't want someone discriminating saying hey, you know, you can't
[03:14:59.860 --> 03:15:04.660]  Call these amount of people or have the same access. They turned it into somewhat of a public utility
[03:15:04.820 --> 03:15:09.140]  Now i'm not necessarily saying let's turn these companies into public utilities
[03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:11.780]  But something needs to be done about the discrimination
[03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:14.340]  For people and their political affiliation
[03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:21.780]  Congress does have legislation that protects people against racial discrimination religious discrimination
[03:15:22.420 --> 03:15:29.540]  And sex discrimination, but there's nothing protecting people federally against political affiliation discrimination
[03:15:29.620 --> 03:15:34.340]  So that's something that we hear but it's all right legislators about it's beyond that. They say white people are evil
[03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:39.380]  We're blocking them in these new videos that veritas has great point. You're taking over trade ahead on the other side

[03:20:24.660 --> 03:20:28.660]  Listening to the fourth hour of overdrive and I just want to go over a few things before I bring up my
[03:20:28.660 --> 03:20:32.900]  Guest who's a been a victim of this facebook censorship that is now going to be hitting everybody
[03:20:33.380 --> 03:20:36.900]  In the country who doesn't agree with cyborg zuckerberg
[03:20:37.700 --> 03:20:40.740]  And I even want to read some of his statement, which we'll read throughout the hour
[03:20:41.460 --> 03:20:46.580]  And but first yesterday bombshell undercover video twitter engineers admit censoring conservatives
[03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:52.660]  And it comes out on the video that they're calling people sh i t t y people right there
[03:20:52.660 --> 03:21:00.180]  We're trying to get the sh i t y people not to show up. It's a product thing. We're working on so that comes out into the news
[03:21:01.220 --> 03:21:03.220]  And then what happens a few hours later
[03:21:04.100 --> 03:21:08.900]  trump derides protections from immigrants from sh i t whole countries right there
[03:21:09.460 --> 03:21:12.900]  And what who is it from do we have do we have people in the meeting?
[03:21:12.980 --> 03:21:17.540]  No, it is according to people familiar with the reactions of the people who were in the meeting
[03:21:17.540 --> 03:21:23.300]  Total bs, but it creates enough cover to stop people from looking at this story
[03:21:23.540 --> 03:21:27.060]  They effectively killed this story the mainstream media killed this twitter story
[03:21:27.780 --> 03:21:31.540]  By doing this and turned this into trump is a racist trump is bad
[03:21:32.500 --> 03:21:33.940]  Now trump comes out and denies it
[03:21:33.940 --> 03:21:37.860]  He said the language used by me at the docket meeting was tough, but it was not the language used
[03:21:38.260 --> 03:21:40.260]  But not that was not the language used
[03:21:40.820 --> 03:21:43.860]  It was really tough and it's a big setback. So basically
[03:21:43.860 --> 03:21:50.500]  He said he's denying it now, but here's an interesting article from kid Daniels state department warrants avoid travel
[03:21:50.980 --> 03:21:55.300]  To sh i t whole countries and it's talking about Haiti. It's so bad
[03:21:55.940 --> 03:22:00.660]  It's talking about countries in Africa do not travel to the central african republic
[03:22:02.980 --> 03:22:06.740]  Uh probably el Salvador, I don't know if el salvador's on here, but norway's not on this list
[03:22:07.540 --> 03:22:12.180]  And you know trump probably had he had the prime minister of norway in they were talking about all kinds of things the last few days
[03:22:12.180 --> 03:22:15.380]  And that's probably why he mentioned norway. I don't think it anything to do with
[03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:19.620]  Being racist, but and here's the other things they want to keep you from looking at check this out
[03:22:19.940 --> 03:22:24.260]  Oh 90 percent of workers are likely to see more money in paycheck next month
[03:22:24.660 --> 03:22:26.980]  The u.s. Treasury and the irs put out a new guidance
[03:22:27.380 --> 03:22:32.900]  Withholding tables for employers the that incorporate changes of the new tax law under those new tables
[03:22:32.980 --> 03:22:40.100]  That's why trump signed it before christmas the treasury estimates the 90s percent of the people who get a paycheck are likely to see more take home pay
[03:22:40.100 --> 03:22:47.460]  So employers have till february 15th to incorporate the new changes. So 90 percent of workers people out there busting their butts
[03:22:48.100 --> 03:22:54.340]  In this economy are going to see more take home pay. I know nancy polosi says it's not that much because she's a multimillionaire
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:56.740]  She takes your money
[03:22:56.820 --> 03:23:02.820]  And spins it on whatever she wants she she sucks you dry and goes. Oh, it's a pittance to the people
[03:23:03.460 --> 03:23:05.460]  Watching her make those comments disgusting
[03:23:05.460 --> 03:23:11.380]  And here's what else they want to hide strongest holiday sales since great recession up 5.5 percent topping industry's forecast
[03:23:11.700 --> 03:23:17.300]  They thought it'd be about between 678 billion and 682 billion. It was 691
[03:23:17.780 --> 03:23:20.820]  0.9 billion nearly 700 billion spent
[03:23:22.020 --> 03:23:24.020]  And that was a retailers for the holiday season
[03:23:26.740 --> 03:23:28.740]  And all this
[03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:33.380]  The twitter story done by project veritas great job. I can't wait to see what they drop on monday
[03:23:33.380 --> 03:23:37.460]  Of course, it'll be ignored or they'll come up with some other fake trump story. This is going to be great
[03:23:37.460 --> 03:23:39.460]  This is going to come out as fake news again
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:46.820]  But yesterday we had facebook put out on their news feed news feed flai bringing people closer together, right?
[03:23:46.820 --> 03:23:49.300]  They think it's about sharing opinions with people
[03:23:50.260 --> 03:23:55.140]  No, it has nothing to do with that. It's about killing content providers
[03:23:56.100 --> 03:23:57.620]  That's what it's about
[03:23:57.620 --> 03:24:01.620]  It's and they put it on this lovely smile face for the rest of the day
[03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:04.580]  On this lovely smile face where zuckerberg walks around
[03:24:05.060 --> 03:24:10.500]  And smiles at you and has everybody in virtual reality glasses and he's smiling because he's not in them
[03:24:10.580 --> 03:24:16.740]  And he just walks around. Yeah, you people are scum. I'm gonna dominate you. I'm gonna dominate you
[03:24:17.300 --> 03:24:18.900]  our big focus
[03:24:18.900 --> 03:24:23.780]  Areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on facebook is time well spent
[03:24:24.500 --> 03:24:30.100]  We built facebook to help people stay connected and to bring us closer together with the people that matter to us
[03:24:30.100 --> 03:24:34.020]  That's why we've always put friends and family at the core of the experience
[03:24:34.260 --> 03:24:39.060]  Research shows that strengthening our relationships improves our well-being and happiness
[03:24:39.620 --> 03:24:45.060]  Happiness is a is a uh emotion. I don't think mark zuckerberg has it's all fake
[03:24:45.540 --> 03:24:50.100]  He really wants to dominate you. I'm I'm gonna go to my next guest. All right, so he's gonna be with us for the rest of the hour
[03:24:50.100 --> 03:24:51.860]  Jason thick
[03:24:51.860 --> 03:24:55.300]  He's a guy who's worked facebook to make money for himself
[03:24:55.300 --> 03:25:01.060]  And then because he didn't want to play ball because he started promoting uh republican candidates in the last election
[03:25:01.460 --> 03:25:03.460]  He started having his pages taken away
[03:25:04.340 --> 03:25:10.580]  And it's ramping up. He sent me this last night this news feed and I read this I said, this is the death of facebook
[03:25:10.580 --> 03:25:14.580]  They're basically going to kill themselves with this move. They're going to start
[03:25:15.060 --> 03:25:18.740]  Sensoring hardcore. It's going to be over. It's going to be everywhere
[03:25:19.300 --> 03:25:21.300]  And it's going to hit everybody
[03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:26.740]  And by doing that people are going to leave facebook. So jason, what do you what do you make of that analysis?
[03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:29.300]  After reading what we heard from comrade zuckerberg
[03:25:31.300 --> 03:25:33.300]  Well, first off, thanks for having me on rob
[03:25:35.300 --> 03:25:38.340]  Obviously we've been talking about this for months you and I um
[03:25:39.300 --> 03:25:45.300]  I guess it was what three or four months like three months ago give or take and I predicted all of this
[03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:47.300]  Every single thing that was coming out
[03:25:47.300 --> 03:25:49.300]  I've been in this for
[03:25:49.700 --> 03:25:51.700]  Close to I guess seven years now
[03:25:51.700 --> 03:25:57.220]  Um, I watched the rise and fall of it and obviously facebook has changed so dynamically over the years
[03:25:57.700 --> 03:25:59.700]  We've gotten to a point where
[03:26:00.820 --> 03:26:06.500]  Um, you know at at first it was a free for all anybody could say anything and it was
[03:26:07.300 --> 03:26:09.300]  Honestly a lot of fun back in those days
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:12.660]  Then what happened is is that and I think that this was what?
[03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:19.780]  Caused the change is that they realized that the individual voice is very loud
[03:26:20.660 --> 03:26:24.020]  That people talk amongst themselves, especially like conservatives these days
[03:26:24.660 --> 03:26:28.660]  We're talking amongst each other and we use this as a town square to be able to
[03:26:29.620 --> 03:26:37.620]  Present ideas to our own, you know peers and so forth. Well, I think along the way they realize the strength of that is very scary
[03:26:37.620 --> 03:26:41.620]  They don't want people to be able to talk amongst themselves because we can organize and as soon as you start to
[03:26:41.620 --> 03:26:45.620]  To get into a situation where they organize they realize they had to gain control of that
[03:26:45.620 --> 03:26:47.620]  I know that that's
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:49.620]  I'm just sort of giving you the back
[03:26:49.620 --> 03:26:51.620]  Like the inside way that this works
[03:26:51.620 --> 03:26:53.620]  when they gain control of
[03:26:54.820 --> 03:26:56.820]  Essentially what people were talking about
[03:26:57.620 --> 03:26:59.620]  They gain control of how
[03:26:59.620 --> 03:27:01.620]  The minds work
[03:27:01.620 --> 03:27:03.620]  The minds work
[03:27:03.620 --> 03:27:07.620]  They gain control of how the minds work of the individuals
[03:27:07.620 --> 03:27:12.620]  This is essentially what mainstream media is trying to do is they're they're they're showing you this over here
[03:27:12.620 --> 03:27:15.620]  But they really want you to pay no attention to this over here
[03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:18.620]  It's the bait and switch thing you guys were just talking about that
[03:27:19.620 --> 03:27:21.620]  But your analysis is is right they are
[03:27:22.620 --> 03:27:27.620]  And I had said this for a number of years is that they they took out all of the good content
[03:27:27.620 --> 03:27:29.620]  They tried to turn themselves into a news network
[03:27:29.620 --> 03:27:31.620]  which
[03:27:31.620 --> 03:27:33.620]  In my opinion bit them in the ass
[03:27:33.620 --> 03:27:35.620]  Yeah, that's literally
[03:27:35.620 --> 03:27:39.620]  Had they let it just be memes and funny stuff
[03:27:39.620 --> 03:27:42.620]  Nobody would have paid attention it would have buried all of this stuff
[03:27:42.620 --> 03:27:49.620]  Now what they've done is they have mobilized so many people and this is this is the danger and I'm I'm gonna tell you
[03:27:49.620 --> 03:27:51.620]  I can forecast Facebook
[03:27:51.620 --> 03:27:53.620]  It won't ever go away
[03:27:53.620 --> 03:28:00.620]  It won't collapse by what you said it's not like it's just gonna go bankrupt and just fear that I don't see happening
[03:28:00.620 --> 03:28:08.620]  It's just too big but what I do see happening is people are now getting tired of it. They're going now this this is
[03:28:08.620 --> 03:28:13.620]  I'm not going to be forced ideas that I don't believe in
[03:28:13.620 --> 03:28:18.620]  And the people at Facebook don't understand that that's what they're doing to do their customers
[03:28:18.620 --> 03:28:21.620]  They're telling people what to think we're about to go to break
[03:28:21.620 --> 03:28:22.620]  We're trying
[03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:25.620]  Yeah, we're about to break this is what's happening right now
[03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:30.620]  They are trying to guide it and they tried it in this election with Hillary Clinton and it didn't work
[03:28:30.620 --> 03:28:36.620]  And now they're going well we're gonna ban everybody from talking we're not gonna let anybody talk unless it's about their stupid cat
[03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:45.620]  We'll be right back Jason Fick a social media entrepreneur insider who is basically trying to warn people about what's been happening with Facebook
