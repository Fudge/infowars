[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, because this is going to be a power pack transmission.
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  The first Friday transmission of 2013. It is the fourth day of January 2013, and we're
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  gonna be live here for the next three hours, Lord willing. Gerald Cilente hadn't been on
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  in about, I don't know, three weeks, always informative.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  We're gonna get his take on Sandy Hook, the economy, the fiscal cliff, the government
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  funding Al Qaeda publicly in Libya and Syria, all of the craziness. Gerald Cilente is on
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  in the third hour. Larry Pratt popping in on short notice via cell phone will be joining
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  us to give us the latest on Dianne Feinstein's new bill that has gun confiscation in it and
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  is getting almost no attention.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  The Illinois bill that only has today to pass, and they claim they're not gonna try to pass
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  that they lost the votes they needed. But look out, that could be a playing possum event.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  I've seen this more than once. They claim they're like ten votes short. They had the
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  votes they needed just two days ago. You shot it down. I've gotta give infowars.com radio
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  listeners credit.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  I gotta give drudgereport.com credit. I gotta give the NRA credit and governors of America
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.600]  and just all of you. We did a great job. They had the votes and they now are freaking out
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.000]  that they couldn't ban them. I mean, it banned everything but bolt action rifles, pump shotguns,
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  pump rifles, semi autos, revolvers. They have the foid cards in Illinois, so you're registered
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  would have made you turn them in.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.700]  That's why we don't want registration in the other states cuz they always use them to try
[02:02.700 --> 02:07.520]  to confiscate and everywhere else in the world are successful. That's why the new bill that
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.000]  Feinstein's introduced has shut down the gun shows, shut down being able to give your grandson
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.320]  a firearm, shut down being able to buy your dad a firearm.
[02:15.320 --> 02:18.680]  We all buy each other firearms, don't we? At least I know my dad's probably bought me
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.720]  four or five firearms in my life or more, I've bought him four or five firearms. The
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.760]  point is, is that give each other knives, bows, hunting jackets, I mean, it's what men
[02:28.760 --> 02:29.760]  do.
[02:29.760 --> 02:36.140]  Well, not anymore according to these people. And it just absolutely registers all other
[02:36.140 --> 02:40.040]  gun owners. You have to take guns you've already legally bought and go in like you're a criminal
[02:40.040 --> 02:47.480]  and be fingerprinted. That has been introduced. And it hadn't shown up in thomas.loc.gov as
[02:47.480 --> 02:49.440]  of this morning, but they say they've introduced it.
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.040]  So we're gonna be tracking that kind of like on Wednesday, they said they introduced the
[02:55.040 --> 03:01.400]  bill in the State House in Illinois, but we couldn't find it. And then it got defeated
[03:01.400 --> 03:06.080]  yesterday and now it's popped up in the registry today. And it's exactly what the NRA said
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.040]  was in it from their sources in the legislature that were able to get an advance copy.
[03:11.040 --> 03:15.600]  So they're gonna try to sneak bills in and pass them same day. They're gonna try to keep
[03:15.600 --> 03:22.480]  you from seeing the bills. And they can try to attach this gun grab bill to debt ceiling
[03:22.480 --> 03:29.880]  increases. They can try to put it into defense spending, you name it, you name it. So we're
[03:29.880 --> 03:35.840]  facing a lot of big issues here. Obviously, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it.
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.760]  But we are gonna do a general article about Al Jazeera, Russia Today, BBC, Piers Morgan
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.820]  on CNN. All these foreign media outlets and foreign governments calling to take our guns
[03:45.820 --> 03:54.360]  and our free speech. And so, I mean, RT really, I saw a video that they did yesterday, really
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.240]  trying to defame me.
[03:56.240 --> 03:59.920]  And it was just so pathetic, I don't know if I'll respond to it. I mean, they know we
[03:59.920 --> 04:03.200]  have a bigger audience domestically than they do, so it's an attempt at that. But RT the
[04:03.200 --> 04:09.840]  last eight months has really taken a turn towards authoritarianism and is shameful.
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.760]  But I mean, I go on any media outlet, it's like Dave Stills, Piers Morgan's producers
[04:13.760 --> 04:18.780]  trying to get me to fly to New York. I told them no. No, I was flown to New York once
[04:18.780 --> 04:24.900]  to be on a television show and it was canceled. That's why I don't do that. I said, I'll do
[04:24.900 --> 04:28.040]  satellite and they said, okay, we'll do satellite.
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.100]  I'd like to be in studio with him, I just don't have the time or the energy and I'm
[04:31.100 --> 04:35.180]  not going there to be chumped. I've been in the car more than ten times driving to a satellite
[04:35.180 --> 04:41.740]  uplink when CNN has canceled it when I'm in the car, almost like it's a joke to mess with
[04:41.740 --> 04:43.780]  me and waste my time.
[04:43.780 --> 04:46.960]  And they send a car to make sure you're gonna be there. So you're driving in the car, got
[04:46.960 --> 04:51.760]  some guy chauffeuring you, it's just all ridiculous. But the point is, I'm gonna go on CNN, doesn't
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.960]  mean I agree with CNN. People say, why do you go on RT? Well, I mean, I go anywhere
[04:55.960 --> 04:56.960]  to get the truth out.
[04:56.960 --> 05:02.040]  It's my message that counts. We'll be right back. Alex Jones here with a very important
[05:02.040 --> 05:06.320]  announcement for truth seekers. We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the

[08:35.760 --> 08:44.080]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:44.080 --> 08:54.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the fourth day of January 2013. I am your host Alex Jones,
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.920]  the head of governors of America with the latest attacks as we track the defense of
[08:58.920 --> 09:03.080]  the republic against the globalist Larry Pratt will be popping in at the bottom of the hour,
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.280]  Gerald Salonte in the third hour today. We will have open phones as well.
[09:08.280 --> 09:14.920]  Okay, where to begin? There is massive harassment going on. You've seen it in the media saying
[09:14.920 --> 09:21.180]  all gun owners helped kill children. So you are child killers. You're also Klan members
[09:21.180 --> 09:27.120]  and you're also racist and you're also hateful. And Michael Moore, MSNBC, literally you've
[09:27.120 --> 09:34.040]  seen it dozens of places say white people are bad and guns are bad.
[09:34.040 --> 09:41.520]  So the only thing worse than white people is guns. And we had people calling in yesterday,
[09:41.520 --> 09:47.840]  one lady who said she was Hispanic and she said the problem is white people. So the media
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.480]  with their dumbed down Obama heads is really having an effect. You're like, that doesn't
[09:52.480 --> 09:56.680]  make any sense saying white people are bad and they own guns and let's get the white
[09:56.680 --> 09:58.480]  people and get their guns.
[09:58.480 --> 10:06.400]  With folks that have been indoctrinated into race based lib tyranny, lib tarred tyranny
[10:06.400 --> 10:15.120]  as they call it. For them, you really are guns are racist. Because you can't take responsibility
[10:15.120 --> 10:19.360]  for the gang banger culture, people killing each other. It's got to be a white person's
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.960]  fault. And again, folks, we try to bring people together under liberty and under the Constitution,
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.340]  under family, under God, under private property, all the things that make you healthy, wealthy
[10:29.340 --> 10:31.400]  and wise.
[10:31.400 --> 10:36.840]  But the system really is pulling out all the stops to demonize gun owners. Here's a headline
[10:36.840 --> 10:42.220]  out of NBC and they report this like it's a good thing. Lawmakers propose publicizing
[10:42.220 --> 10:50.780]  gun owners names. And you already saw the newspaper in New York, the Journal News publish
[10:50.780 --> 10:55.160]  where they live and the guns they have by getting the records from the state where they
[10:55.160 --> 10:56.880]  make you registered.
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.180]  Now they know that causes people to be robbed. In fact, newspapers have done this for decades.
[11:02.180 --> 11:08.780]  They always get sued over it and stuff, but they hate gun owners so much that they terrorize
[11:08.780 --> 11:16.600]  you and say John Smith or Tom Hernandez or Carol Scott. I mean, these are random names
[11:16.600 --> 11:23.480]  I'm throwing out. They live at this address and they've got nine permits for guns and
[11:23.480 --> 11:26.700]  thieves go and rob them.
[11:26.700 --> 11:32.580]  Now there haven't even been threats, but because of complaints by thousands of gun owners and
[11:32.580 --> 11:37.800]  threats of lawsuits, the newspaper has hired armed guards after publishing gun owners address.
[11:37.800 --> 11:44.540]  And of course, that came out days ago. What's amazing now is in Connecticut and other states,
[11:44.540 --> 11:50.620]  the lawmakers are saying, let's give newspapers cover since they can't terrorize, I mean,
[11:50.620 --> 11:51.620]  Hitler did this.
[11:51.620 --> 11:58.260]  He would publish by law under regulations by 35, he started doing this, he got in at
[11:58.260 --> 12:07.420]  33, where Jews lived and the businesses they had. So all armed thugs, brown shirts, quasi
[12:07.420 --> 12:12.180]  government like TSA could come and knock out your windows and burn down your business.
[12:12.180 --> 12:15.600]  And there's famous Nazi film reels of that for folks that tonight went on, they were
[12:15.600 --> 12:20.700]  very proud of it. And they'd come and paint the star on your business or throw furniture
[12:20.700 --> 12:21.700]  through the windows.
[12:21.700 --> 12:25.220]  And then a year later they said, for your safety, cuz everybody's beating you up and
[12:25.220 --> 12:29.540]  you can't pay your property tax. We want you to, yeah, Germany had property tax for we
[12:29.540 --> 12:36.680]  did as a feudal state, going back to feudalism. German slaves, white slaves were not released
[12:36.680 --> 12:41.240]  until the 1860s. But the media never tells you about that cuz then it can't be a black
[12:41.240 --> 12:43.420]  white thing over slavery.
[12:43.420 --> 12:48.260]  Germans were actual slaves in many areas, but it wasn't even called Germany. It was
[12:48.260 --> 12:56.580]  Germania in general, Austrian Hungarian Empire, and had 77 sub counties with 14 major districts,
[12:56.580 --> 13:01.260]  but you can go look up all that up for yourself. That people won't believe it, you type year,
[13:01.260 --> 13:04.180]  the German serfs were free, the German slaves were freed.
[13:04.180 --> 13:09.620]  And it was from the 1840s through the 70s, I just said the 1860 cuz that was the main.
[13:09.620 --> 13:13.700]  And that was another reason over here people were saying, we gotta free slaves here too.
[13:13.700 --> 13:18.580]  In Poland, they're freeing the slaves, in Germany, they're freeing the slaves. But I'm
[13:18.580 --> 13:23.900]  digressing ladies and gentlemen, they can't terrorize gun owners properly.
[13:23.900 --> 13:28.580]  And so now they wanna make it the law that you've got guns so people can rob you and
[13:28.580 --> 13:32.300]  so you can be hated like you're a sex offender. It's like publishing, in fact, they said that,
[13:32.300 --> 13:39.140]  they said, we wanna publish your names like you're sex offenders. And there's a special
[13:39.140 --> 13:45.500]  report that Melissa Melton and Jakari Jackson are going to be putting out on the Nightly
[13:45.500 --> 13:51.540]  News tonight, for Infowars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, about a 15 minute report
[13:51.540 --> 13:53.940]  into all the mainstream news.
[13:53.940 --> 13:58.560]  Last week it was The Economist, yesterday it was Vanity Fair, Huffington Post, literally
[13:58.560 --> 14:05.780]  scores of major publications, the same talking point, repeal the Second Amendment. So we're
[14:05.780 --> 14:09.220]  gonna be going over that. Now before they said the Second Amendment doesn't mean you
[14:09.220 --> 14:13.380]  have a right to own guns. Now they just say, you know what, you're right, we lied about
[14:13.380 --> 14:17.540]  that, you do have a right, we're gonna repeal it.
[14:17.540 --> 14:21.920]  And they're not playing games. Now here's the good news, two days ago the local, we've
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.940]  had them on many times, great patriots, we should get them back on. The Illinois Rifle
[14:25.940 --> 14:31.740]  Association, a subgroup of the NRA, but they're hard chargers. The main NRA could learn from
[14:31.740 --> 14:38.060]  them. They got the subsections of the bill from a legislator before it was introduced
[14:38.060 --> 14:42.260]  and were able to head it off at the pass, because they had the votes.
[14:42.260 --> 14:45.040]  They had more of the votes than they needed, and it's now being reported on. I have the
[14:45.040 --> 14:52.140]  articles here, they're up at infowars.com. They had the votes, the local papers are reporting.
[14:52.140 --> 14:56.380]  And because of tens of thousands of phone calls and people going to the State House
[14:56.380 --> 15:02.340]  and visiting their legislatures, the Democrats caved in for now. Now they do, they could
[15:02.340 --> 15:03.700]  be playing possum.
[15:03.700 --> 15:07.060]  They've still got today in the legislative session to get that done, but here's Kurt
[15:07.060 --> 15:12.300]  Nemo's article that links to the mainstream articles. Illinois Democrats lose bid to pass
[15:12.300 --> 15:22.860]  firearms confiscation bill. So some good news, because even Chicagoland run by the Don Rahm
[15:22.860 --> 15:32.120]  Emanuel and run by the Obama gangster gang, they need that.
[15:32.120 --> 15:36.300]  Because what they were proposing is what Feinstein is, ban almost all guns, make it turn them
[15:36.300 --> 15:40.900]  in. That's in her bill. Talks about making you re-register, but also, or we may just
[15:40.900 --> 15:46.540]  do a forced buyback. It's right there, and the funding for it. But it's a footnote written
[15:46.540 --> 15:48.100]  by these lawyers.
[15:48.100 --> 15:52.460]  So first they'll do it with people that say they have criminal records or whatever to
[15:52.460 --> 15:56.340]  make it look reasonable, and then go after everybody. They're gonna pick you off at checkpoints.
[15:56.340 --> 16:00.860]  I was talking to one of my law enforcement forces yesterday here in Texas, pretty high
[16:00.860 --> 16:04.100]  level. They were saying, no, exactly what you're saying is what we're being told. If
[16:04.100 --> 16:09.220]  it passes, we're just gonna set up these statewide checkpoints they're now announcing and search
[16:09.220 --> 16:10.220]  everybody's cars.
[16:10.220 --> 16:16.860]  They call them gang task force checkpoints. They just search you. Well, this is a semi-auto.
[16:16.860 --> 16:21.980]  That's federal law, and then they call the feds and they come and arrest you. I mean,
[16:21.980 --> 16:25.700]  we're talking paddy wagons of gun owners here. And you're like, well, I'll just bury my guns.
[16:25.700 --> 16:29.140]  Well, that kills the gun culture. They don't want you shooting. They don't want money going
[16:29.140 --> 16:31.660]  to the reloaders, going to the ammo producers.
[16:31.660 --> 16:37.420]  They wanna freeze it out and then demonize it and hunt us down. That's why you don't
[16:37.420 --> 16:41.900]  just bury guns and get ready to shoot gun confiscators. If you do that, you're falling
[16:41.900 --> 16:48.740]  in the globalist's hands. We don't want a civil war. The globalists want a civil war.
[16:48.740 --> 16:53.300]  They want police and military to be killed trying to confiscate our firearms. And remember,
[16:53.300 --> 16:56.860]  Alex, you're a fair monger. They'll never try to get our guns. And I said, you watch,
[16:56.860 --> 16:58.260]  there's gonna be mass shootings.
[16:58.260 --> 17:04.980]  There's gonna be false flags. A month before Sandy Hook, I said, this is the season, get
[17:04.980 --> 17:13.460]  ready. I'm seeing them roll out the propaganda now beforehand. Just like before Gulf of Tonkin
[17:13.460 --> 17:17.960]  in 63 and 64, they're like, we need to go ahead and put troops in. They already had
[17:17.960 --> 17:23.100]  tens of thousands of advisors. 6,000 already died from 60 to 64. We need to go in, we need
[17:23.100 --> 17:24.100]  to go in.
[17:24.100 --> 17:27.420]  They were already building up the pretext to then stage the Gulf of Tonkin that never
[17:27.420 --> 17:32.900]  happened. Our ships were never attacked, that's now been declassified. It's the same thing.
[17:32.900 --> 17:36.740]  Before 9-11, they're like, we're gonna be hit by terrorists and when we are, give your
[17:36.740 --> 17:40.580]  rights up. And I was reading Rand Corporation public stuff where they said, soon we'll be
[17:40.580 --> 17:42.620]  hit by large terrorist attack.
[17:42.620 --> 17:46.780]  The PENAC documents with Dick Cheney were saying, there's gonna be a huge Pearl Harbor
[17:46.780 --> 17:50.780]  event. Pearl Harbor killed 3,000, 9-11 did. And they said this catalyzing event, whether
[17:50.780 --> 17:56.580]  real or manufactured, go read it, it's public, their own website. And they said down the
[17:56.580 --> 18:02.080]  road we'll then use race specific bio weapons. But we've got to get the media to legitimize
[18:02.080 --> 18:03.080]  their use.
[18:03.080 --> 18:08.380]  I mean, it's like, whoa, and I've got to give our own globalist local paper, the Austin
[18:08.380 --> 18:14.220]  American Statesman credit. They were the only national paper that I saw, big paper in the
[18:14.220 --> 18:19.980]  country that actually did an editorial a week after. This was back in 2000 when the PENAC
[18:19.980 --> 18:23.740]  document came out saying this is crazy.
[18:23.740 --> 18:29.940]  Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, he wasn't even vice president yet, this was in 2000.
[18:29.940 --> 18:34.680]  He says use race weapons. I mean, folks, the stuff they write about, they think you're
[18:34.680 --> 18:39.340]  totally stupid. They're like, Alex, don't fear monger about Dick Cheney and race weapons.
[18:39.340 --> 18:47.500]  I mean, he wrote it in the September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses. I mean,
[18:47.500 --> 18:53.420]  I just gave you the name of the paper, National Archives, you can pull it up in ten seconds.
[18:53.420 --> 19:00.580]  Rebuilding America's Defenses, PENAC. And there's 25 authors total, but he is credited
[19:00.580 --> 19:01.580]  with that paper.
[19:01.580 --> 19:06.460]  I mean, it is a blueprint for 9-11. And you can say, Alex, come on, the government didn't
[19:06.460 --> 19:10.080]  do 9-11. I didn't say the whole government, I said criminal elements, bare minimum, knew
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.900]  and let it happen. I mean, that's been confirmed. Just like the government ran Al Qaeda against
[19:14.900 --> 19:17.820]  the Russians, and then against the Serbs.
[19:17.820 --> 19:23.620]  And then they ran Al Qaeda, of course, against, this is the pretext, to take our liberties.
[19:23.620 --> 19:27.320]  And now they're running them against Libya and Syria on record and giving them missiles
[19:27.320 --> 19:31.700]  and letting them kill people. And the media is saying it's a great, good, wonderful, wholesome
[19:31.700 --> 19:32.700]  thing.
[19:32.700 --> 19:37.180]  I mean, this is going on. Those things are real, whether you want to believe it or not.
[19:37.180 --> 19:41.740]  Yeah, there it is. Rebuilding America's Defenses, Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century.
[19:41.740 --> 19:45.060]  A report to the project, a New American Century, September 2000.
[19:45.060 --> 19:50.300]  Yeah, the actual publishing day is September 20th. I mean, look, it's all there. They think
[19:50.300 --> 19:55.420]  you're stupid. We're gonna have a big Pearl Harbor event and take everybody's rights.
[19:55.420 --> 19:59.260]  And then now who they admit the target of all the 9-11 stuff is? Gun owners, conservatives,
[19:59.260 --> 20:01.980]  returning veterans.
[20:01.980 --> 20:06.420]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[20:06.420 --> 20:11.340]  storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression. America's worst
[20:11.340 --> 20:16.420]  drought in agricultural history. And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[20:16.420 --> 20:21.340]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
[20:21.340 --> 20:25.660]  more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own

[21:25.460 --> 21:31.500]  or decline like I've been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula

[24:00.820 --> 24:11.180]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now. No matter how hard you try, you can't
[24:11.180 --> 24:20.700]  stop us now. We're the renegades, it is the time of age. Folks, here's an example of how
[24:20.700 --> 24:25.980]  we can have victory. The globalists order police all the time. The police have all been
[24:25.980 --> 24:30.100]  basically federalized for all intents and purposes in all the big departments at least
[24:30.100 --> 24:34.460]  to go out and do things like set up a checkpoint, randomly search everybody's vehicles.
[24:34.460 --> 24:38.940]  Doesn't matter if the courts have ruled over and over again, it's totally unconstitutional.
[24:38.940 --> 24:46.300]  Serious felony crimes, they just exercise the power. Kind of like I was talking to one
[24:46.300 --> 24:51.980]  of the crew members that after she had a baby and she already said no to vaccines, she woke
[24:51.980 --> 24:56.340]  up with them jabbing a needle in her arm giving her a vaccine. And then they say, it's the
[24:56.340 --> 25:00.700]  law, there is no law, they just do what they want.
[25:00.700 --> 25:06.940]  They set the precedent and hide their actions in plain view. So more and more of the state
[25:06.940 --> 25:12.060]  police in Texas pull you over, put gloves on, pull you over speeding, you name it and
[25:12.060 --> 25:15.700]  shove their hands inside your body. And then we'll go to the next person, cuz why not?
[25:15.700 --> 25:20.620]  They're already breaking the law. And the state police came out and defended it. Well,
[25:20.620 --> 25:23.740]  because no one bought it, they went, okay, we'll suspend her with pay while there's a
[25:23.740 --> 25:29.740]  lawsuit. But the head of the DPS defended it, first her local commander defended it.
[25:29.740 --> 25:34.180]  I mean, these are crazy people, crazy people. I'm not saying the average person in the state
[25:34.180 --> 25:38.540]  police is a crazy person, but I've lived in Texas my whole life, born here. State police
[25:38.540 --> 25:45.460]  were all really nice when I was a kid, a teenager, even the last 15 years ago, protesting things.
[25:45.460 --> 25:48.860]  They're different now, bugging their eyes out at you, coming over and saying, you can't
[25:48.860 --> 25:54.540]  film on the grounds of the Capitol. Just making it up and going, okay, go ahead and arrest
[25:54.540 --> 25:55.540]  me.
[25:55.540 --> 25:58.140]  And then they go, I'm getting my commander and then, well, and then a nice one walks
[25:58.140 --> 26:00.700]  over and goes, well, yeah, they're allowed to film, what's going on? We have that on
[26:00.700 --> 26:07.220]  tape with Aaron Dykes. They're hiring goons. And they're gonna phase out the good guys
[26:07.220 --> 26:11.660]  and the good women and they're gonna come and stick their hands in our bodies. I mean,
[26:11.660 --> 26:15.380]  and if you don't like it, they'll taser you or shoot you. They're crazy people.
[26:15.380 --> 26:21.980]  Because the globalist wants to dominate, but here's the good news. People got so upset
[26:21.980 --> 26:27.140]  that now the state police are like, well, we'll have to review this then. It's a power
[26:27.140 --> 26:33.620]  grab. And I'm telling you, if you let government just tell you what to do, in every case, they'll
[26:33.620 --> 26:36.700]  start saying, all right, show up on Saturdays to dig ditches.
[26:36.700 --> 26:41.060]  It's part of your compulsory national service. By the way, Rahm Emanuel as White House chief
[26:41.060 --> 26:48.340]  of staff, it's in my film Martial Law. It's in my film Fall of the Republic, excuse me.
[26:48.340 --> 26:51.180]  He says on C-SPAN and on another show, he says, we're gonna have compulsory national
[26:51.180 --> 26:52.180]  service.
[26:52.180 --> 26:59.160]  You're gonna come out a few months out of the year and you're gonna serve the government.
[26:59.160 --> 27:02.240]  And they've got all the proposals. You're gonna dig ditches. But they're gonna first
[27:02.240 --> 27:08.940]  collapse society and say, here's your government card with money. Here's your government housing.
[27:08.940 --> 27:14.580]  But you've gotta go out and do work now. You've gotta go out and pick up trash on the highway.
[27:14.580 --> 27:19.380]  And people are like, well, good, make welfare people work. You don't get it. They wear these
[27:19.380 --> 27:26.220]  red uniforms now, these red jackets through AmeriCorps, FEMA Corps, all these different
[27:26.220 --> 27:27.220]  groups that we cover.
[27:27.220 --> 27:31.220]  You've seen the video where they're marching and they're doing the dance going, salute
[27:31.220 --> 27:36.540]  Obama. Obama's gonna give us free healthcare. Obama's gonna take over. Obama is our commander.
[27:36.540 --> 27:41.780]  And you're like, well, those people are a bunch of dumbed down goons, so what? Doesn't
[27:41.780 --> 27:47.700]  matter, folks, a wall of those people, just like the Soviet Union, will overrun you.
[27:47.700 --> 27:50.540]  And they've got the Boy Scouts training for gun confiscation, all of this. I mean, this
[27:50.540 --> 27:56.180]  is freakazoid level. But see, I'm here pointing out this is all freakazoid. They're like,
[27:56.180 --> 27:57.680]  come on, don't fear monger.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.580]  Show Texas is announcing statewide checkpoints to see if you're a gang member. They set up
[28:02.580 --> 28:07.300]  a checkpoint on the highway, pull you out of your car, photograph you, search your vehicle
[28:07.300 --> 28:11.860]  at a warrant. I mean, come on, that's not a big deal. First, it was Alex, you're a fear
[28:11.860 --> 28:14.340]  monger that checkpoints are coming to search everybody.
[28:14.340 --> 28:18.520]  Then they come with TSA checkpoints as well. They're like, okay, well, you're a fear monger
[28:18.520 --> 28:25.980]  not liking it. You're a fear monger, Alex, nobody's ever gonna come for our guys. Nobody's
[28:25.980 --> 28:30.020]  gonna try to physically make you turn them in. Now they've got the bills introduced all
[28:30.020 --> 28:32.780]  over the place. All right, well, you're a fear monger, now I wanna turn them in, you
[28:32.780 --> 28:34.660]  don't need those guns.
[28:34.660 --> 28:38.940]  Hey, here's the New York Times calling for world government and global carbon tax. Well,
[28:38.940 --> 28:42.580]  you're a fear monger not liking that. I thought I was a fear monger, it didn't exist. No,
[28:42.580 --> 28:49.580]  you're a fear monger, it's a good thing. Hey, I don't like foreign media, British, Russian,
[28:49.580 --> 28:55.400]  Chinese now on US cable systems, just saying turn our guns in and get rid of free speech
[28:55.400 --> 28:56.400]  and stuff.
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.580]  They're like, shut up, what's wrong with having foreign media tell you to turn your guns in?
[28:59.580 --> 29:06.420]  That's normal. Even USA Today and Paul Watson to an article on this came out yesterday and
[29:06.420 --> 29:12.780]  said, what's with Al Jazeera saying turn our guns in? What's with Russian TV saying turn
[29:12.780 --> 29:13.780]  our guns in?
[29:13.780 --> 29:18.500]  I mean, every show now, and then see, I don't like it. And so the Russian TV comes out and
[29:18.500 --> 29:23.700]  says, Alex Jones just in it for money, and he's a fear monger, those are quotes. What,
[29:23.700 --> 29:29.620]  I mean, I don't get my money from Putin, so I'm bad. I get my money from you that buy
[29:29.620 --> 29:30.620]  our good products.
[29:30.620 --> 29:36.180]  See, we're bad for being Americans. And we're like sex offenders here. Our names get published
[29:36.180 --> 29:39.740]  in the newspaper. And I'm like, hey, this is really dangerous. People are getting robbed
[29:39.740 --> 29:43.620]  and stuff. Shut up, fear monger. So we're saying you're a Klan member cuz you own guns.
[29:43.620 --> 29:46.740]  We're going to publish your name in the newspaper. We're going to make you turn your guns in.
[29:46.740 --> 29:49.940]  And we're setting up checkpoints to take them.
[29:49.940 --> 30:02.460]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.460 --> 30:08.780]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal

[31:03.340 --> 31:08.740]  east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm. The most devastating economic conditions
[31:08.740 --> 31:13.380]  since the Great Depression, America's worst drought in agricultural history, and now the
[31:13.380 --> 31:18.340]  economic results of the presidential election. This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's
[31:18.340 --> 31:23.540]  food supply. I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct and I recommend
[31:23.540 --> 31:27.900]  you do the same. It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct. I know I won't
[31:27.900 --> 31:33.100]  be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food. I'm taking control of my future
[31:33.100 --> 31:38.860]  and you're nuts if you don't do the same. Go to efoodsdirect.com to find the specials.

[32:00.900 --> 32:05.580]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[32:05.580 --> 32:11.220]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[32:11.220 --> 32:16.660]  a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

[32:30.060 --> 32:34.880]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[32:34.880 --> 32:40.420]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing
[32:40.420 --> 32:45.480]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the
[32:45.480 --> 32:53.900]  silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

[33:05.040 --> 33:19.420]  Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Ladies
[33:19.420 --> 33:23.980]  and gentlemen, we are back live coming up the third hour, always informative. He had
[33:23.980 --> 33:28.180]  been on this in about three weeks, a lot to cover on the economy. Sandy Hook, the police
[33:28.180 --> 33:31.540]  state, Gerald Cilente of Trans Research will be joining us.
[33:31.540 --> 33:36.020]  We're gonna have open phones in the second hour and a ton of geopolitical and economic
[33:36.020 --> 33:40.140]  news. Joining us for the next 20 minutes or so is Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun
[33:40.140 --> 33:46.140]  Owners of America, gunowners.org. And if it wasn't for Larry Pratt and Gun Owners of America
[33:46.140 --> 33:49.940]  and the members, we would have already lost the Second Amendment. And if it wasn't for
[33:49.940 --> 33:52.220]  them, the NRA wouldn't have been kept honest.
[33:52.220 --> 33:57.080]  The NRA is better than they were ten years ago. But Larry has been forced before to point
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.700]  out they were founded by the federal government after the Civil War and actually supported
[34:00.700 --> 34:06.140]  the 68 Gun Control Act. But keeping our gun lobbies honest, never had to do that with
[34:06.140 --> 34:11.940]  Gun Owners of America, perfect record. Keeping the other groups honest is key, key to not
[34:11.940 --> 34:14.100]  let Benedict Arnold sneak in.
[34:14.100 --> 34:17.620]  We've had some big victories in Illinois, they can still sneak it back in today. But
[34:17.620 --> 34:23.020]  it is a big victory, they had the votes two days ago. But gun owners physically went there
[34:23.020 --> 34:28.780]  to their offices and called by the tens of thousands as local Chicago and other newspapers
[34:28.780 --> 34:32.780]  report. Those stories are all up at infowars.com.
[34:32.780 --> 34:38.940]  But here's some of the news, Connecticut town to burn violent video games. That's a little
[34:38.940 --> 34:42.900]  too much like book burning, but how about you just don't let your kids play them? Lawmaker
[34:42.900 --> 34:47.620]  proposes publicizing gun owners names, that's trying to terrorize us. That's kind of stuff
[34:47.620 --> 34:53.240]  Hitler did. Illinois Dems pull measure to ban weapons, not enough votes.
[34:53.240 --> 34:58.100]  Marine warns Feinstein, I will not be disarmed. I've said publicly, I'm just not turning them
[34:58.100 --> 35:04.220]  in. Not registering, it's my line in the sand, done. Homeland Security buys another 200,000
[35:04.220 --> 35:09.260]  hollow point bullets on top of the 1.6 billion they bought in the last 14 months. And that's
[35:09.260 --> 35:13.160]  now over 12 times any previous one year purchase.
[35:13.160 --> 35:17.560]  And it just goes on and on. That's all up at drudgereport.com. We've got reports up
[35:17.560 --> 35:25.700]  at infowars.com as well that I'll go over once Larry leaves us here at the end of the
[35:25.700 --> 35:32.000]  hour. But DHS buys 200,000 more rounds of ammunition, more people killed with hammers
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.820]  and clubs than rifles. This is all info weapons, it's all truth.
[35:35.820 --> 35:41.060]  Ram it down the enemy's throat. Put it out on Facebook, Twitter, email, local talk radio,
[35:41.060 --> 35:47.820]  don't stop. We can use their attack to actually have a counter offensive and may actually
[35:47.820 --> 35:53.460]  route the gun grabbers to a great extent and shut the door on them. Won't be the first
[35:53.460 --> 35:57.220]  time in history a major offensive turns into a route against an enemy.
[35:57.220 --> 36:01.020]  Democide, how many people will government kill this year? Has an incredible video we
[36:01.020 --> 36:06.020]  produced giving the history of government killing 290 plus million, I kept saying 260
[36:06.020 --> 36:11.600]  million in the 20th century. Crass Obama photo op exploits Sandy Hook massacre, proven that
[36:11.600 --> 36:14.860]  it's staged photos dealing with the dead kids.
[36:14.860 --> 36:19.420]  Just incredibly evil along with his fake crime. Government democide and disarmament, the greatest
[36:19.420 --> 36:26.900]  threats to just a bunch of key videos, articles up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. But
[36:26.900 --> 36:33.260]  Larry Pratt joins us here today to talk about a host of issues. First off, I wanna get into
[36:33.260 --> 36:41.220]  Dianne Feinstein and her bill, where she actually says forced buyback and or forced registration,
[36:41.220 --> 36:42.620]  what's happening there?
[36:42.620 --> 36:47.860]  How much trouble we're in? But then Chicago and Illinois being their model, going for
[36:47.860 --> 36:53.140]  almost a total ban there. How big a deal is it that we've shot that down for now? Larry
[36:53.140 --> 36:57.700]  Pratt, executive director, gun owners of America. It's good to be with you.
[36:57.700 --> 37:06.100]  Good to be with you, sir. Well, they're gonna try and what I have to say is I wish there
[37:06.100 --> 37:15.380]  were guys on our side that would be as tenacious and in the face of tough fights and willing
[37:15.380 --> 37:21.060]  to just keep the battle going even if there isn't that much chance of success at the moment.
[37:21.060 --> 37:26.860]  And that's the way I see Feinstein. She probably can't get something out of the Senate, let
[37:26.860 --> 37:32.020]  alone the House, but that doesn't keep her from stopping because she understands that
[37:32.020 --> 37:37.180]  if you don't keep the debate going, you're not gonna be able to eventually change the
[37:37.180 --> 37:48.220]  terms of the debate. And that's one reason why our answer to the massacre in Newtown
[37:48.220 --> 37:54.020]  was not just an armed guard, which frankly we think would be, well I guess it's better
[37:54.020 --> 37:59.580]  than nothing, but it's very expensive and it means that there would be an identifiable
[37:59.580 --> 38:08.900]  person that would presumably be the one person with a gun at a school. And if somebody wants
[38:08.900 --> 38:15.500]  to commit mass murder, begin with the armed guard that's identified as the armed guard
[38:15.500 --> 38:21.500]  carrying the gun presumably right out there on the hip like armed guards almost always
[38:21.500 --> 38:28.340]  do. And once he's down, or she's down, then it's Katie Barr the door on the rest of them
[38:28.340 --> 38:32.700]  and once again you're forced to wait for some 20 minutes until the police are able to get
[38:32.700 --> 38:41.460]  there. Now the better solution would be to encourage everybody on staff at these schools,
[38:41.460 --> 38:46.780]  no matter whether they're teachers or administrators or support like janitors, whatever it might
[38:46.780 --> 38:54.060]  be, and any parent that might be visiting, if you're qualified for concealed carry, you
[38:54.060 --> 38:57.740]  all come and you're welcome to come with your gun.
[38:57.740 --> 39:02.600]  Right now that's illegal. That is so stuck on stupid.
[39:02.600 --> 39:06.260]  Because the mass shooters, you're gonna break the law, they're ready to kill kids. All you
[39:06.260 --> 39:12.140]  do is keep the law abiding citizens out. Well, what about Harold ISD that in 2007 used the
[39:12.140 --> 39:18.700]  state law to arm more than 10 teachers. That way somebody's always there, multiple people,
[39:18.700 --> 39:23.100]  and on the one in a billion chance a teacher went crazy, there'd be other teachers.
[39:23.100 --> 39:27.180]  A crazy teacher could already sneak a gun in. It's kind of like not arming the pilots.
[39:27.180 --> 39:33.120]  You trust them with a 100 ton weapon that's thousands of times more deadly than a gun,
[39:33.120 --> 39:38.420]  but you don't trust them with a gun when these are about the most proficient people with
[39:38.420 --> 39:41.540]  machinery and equipment and tools out there.
[39:41.540 --> 39:49.500]  And in a situation where you've got a mass murder underway to complain that the teacher
[39:49.500 --> 39:57.220]  may not be professionally trained, excuse me, even when the shooter was, all these mass
[39:57.220 --> 40:03.740]  shootings are done at very close range. And so self-defense is not something that requires
[40:03.740 --> 40:04.740]  Annie Oakley.
[40:04.740 --> 40:08.100]  It simply requires that a good guy has a gun.
[40:08.100 --> 40:13.220]  Well, I mean, the so-called left always implies that women can't shoot, which is incredibly
[40:13.220 --> 40:17.860]  sexist. You know in shooting competition, women are as good or now statistically in
[40:17.860 --> 40:19.420]  the Olympics better than men.
[40:19.420 --> 40:25.260]  Hey, listen, I hate to admit it, but they pay attention better than most of us men and
[40:25.260 --> 40:33.980]  they learn better. It's not something that we can disregard. And the fact is, look at
[40:33.980 --> 40:38.820]  what that one brave woman did. I guess she was a teacher, Victoria Soto.
[40:38.820 --> 40:45.580]  She had the presence of mind to hide away the kids and then she was out running where
[40:45.580 --> 40:49.820]  she became a target. Why not have her have a gun, for goodness sake?
[40:49.820 --> 40:50.820]  Oh, imagine what she would have done.
[40:50.820 --> 40:57.100]  She's got the presence of mind to use it. Well, here's the issue. They know that the
[40:57.100 --> 41:03.100]  gun culture was the bedrock of the Republic along with the First Amendment, free speech,
[41:03.100 --> 41:07.200]  and that it was growing and becoming very popular, so they're striking back now.
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.300]  But expanding on that, they know when there's another mass shooting and the way they're
[41:12.300 --> 41:18.420]  advertising it, there will undoubtedly, unfortunately, be some copycats. So we're in a race to get
[41:18.420 --> 41:23.920]  the teachers armed now, but they know when there's the next shooting that if they can
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.780]  just get them registered now, like she wants, then she'll be able to physically get them
[41:28.780 --> 41:33.100]  like her and Cuomo are trying and like they've tried in Illinois.
[41:33.100 --> 41:35.340]  What's your breakdown on that, Larry?
[41:35.340 --> 41:42.660]  Well, that's why I think it's really important that our side not be simply playing defense.
[41:42.660 --> 41:49.460]  I mean, there are times when you can't do anything, but even now, we can be talking
[41:49.460 --> 41:55.780]  about the 20 years of insanity that have led to the same result, and we keep expecting
[41:55.780 --> 42:03.340]  a different result every time. We create a gun-free zone, and oh, how could that person
[42:03.340 --> 42:13.140]  go and shoot all those people? Well, hello? We put up a sign that said, free firing zone
[42:13.140 --> 42:20.340]  here, come on over. I mean, they're like magnets for the scum. These people are evil.
[42:20.340 --> 42:28.060]  They're not stupid. And yet, by contrast, look what happened, and maybe some of, although
[42:28.060 --> 42:34.000]  your listeners are better informed than almost anybody, but still, there wasn't very much
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.540]  attention given to what happened at the Clackamas Mall outside of Portland three days before
[42:40.540 --> 42:48.060]  Newtown. There, a guy had brought a gun into the mall, which was posted no guns, which
[42:48.060 --> 42:53.020]  they can do under state law, even if you had a concealed carry, and he killed two people,
[42:53.020 --> 42:58.780]  wounded another. Hearing that, a good guy with a gun, I'll presume that he didn't see
[42:58.780 --> 43:06.580]  the posting of no guns, ran to the sound of the shots, which in itself is quite remarkable.
[43:06.580 --> 43:11.180]  It was seen by the shooter as the shooter was unjamming his gun, so instead of getting
[43:11.180 --> 43:16.300]  to kill any more people, nobody having rushed him during the time he was fiddling with his
[43:16.300 --> 43:23.980]  gun, he then committed suicide because he saw the good guy with a gun. And my guess
[43:23.980 --> 43:31.300]  is that we're not going to have any prosecutions of the good guy, because that wouldn't look
[43:31.300 --> 43:33.820]  too good on the prosecutor's resume.
[43:33.820 --> 43:39.340]  Larry, we have the UN treaty coming up in March that they wanna ram through the Senate,
[43:39.340 --> 43:44.300]  and in it, and in the original State Department memorandum 7277, it states that once they've
[43:44.300 --> 43:48.740]  disarmed the people, then they're going to disarm our military and only allow there to
[43:48.740 --> 43:52.060]  be brigades and units assigned to the UN and NATO.
[43:52.060 --> 43:57.140]  We already now have the spectacle last year in 2012 of three different congressional hearings
[43:57.140 --> 44:04.460]  where the committees were told that NATO and the UN was commanding Obama to launch these
[44:04.460 --> 44:09.860]  wars and that Congress was not involved in war making or military operations now. I mean,
[44:09.860 --> 44:17.340]  just over the top unconstitutional treason. And this is about guns. Feinstein in a speech
[44:17.340 --> 44:22.240]  last week said, well, in a letter she put out, she said, well, this is embarrassing
[44:22.240 --> 44:24.420]  worldwide that we own guns.
[44:24.420 --> 44:30.500]  And even the New York Times has said, foreign governments don't like us owning guns, we
[44:30.500 --> 44:36.660]  need to get rid of them, it's embarrassing. But here's USA Today, their columnist in the
[44:36.660 --> 44:42.340]  article reports for all the complaints about the leftward tilt in American journalism,
[44:42.340 --> 44:44.980]  it's nothing compared to news operations around the globe.
[44:44.980 --> 44:49.060]  Piers Morgan points to a bigger issue, and it says, why is Russian TV broadcast here
[44:49.060 --> 44:57.300]  in the US transmitted? Arab News, Al Jazeera, you name it, BBC, Piers Morgan, why are the
[44:57.300 --> 45:01.660]  Chinese government, why are they calling for our guns? And why does our media give this
[45:01.660 --> 45:06.820]  attention and act like it's legitimate? I'm now being criticized by Russian TV because
[45:06.820 --> 45:07.820]  I'm pro-gun.
[45:07.820 --> 45:13.420]  I mean, no one would ever put up with this, but this really is this globalization. And
[45:13.420 --> 45:18.740]  I think that if we get the word out to gun owners through GOA and others, and I'm putting
[45:18.740 --> 45:22.500]  an article out with Watson today, pointing out that foreign governments and media are
[45:22.500 --> 45:28.020]  telling Americans what to do. I think this could really backfire on them if we push this
[45:28.020 --> 45:32.260]  information because it's just outrageous. Your take on that?
[45:32.260 --> 45:39.380]  It's very outrageous. Almost immediately after Newtown, the Chinese perhaps were the first
[45:39.380 --> 45:47.700]  ones in the chorus to start singing this anti-American, anti-Second Amendment song, calling for too
[45:47.700 --> 45:51.140]  many guns in the United States, blah, blah. Well, of course, there would be too many guns
[45:51.140 --> 45:56.980]  from their point of view because we would use our guns to shoot the very people like
[45:56.980 --> 46:03.940]  them, who would ever attempt any kind of government like the communist dictatorship in China being
[46:03.940 --> 46:06.500]  imposed here in the United States.
[46:06.500 --> 46:10.920]  It makes them nervous to think that there's any place in the world where the people are
[46:10.920 --> 46:11.920]  trusted with guns.
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.260]  Yeah, they're tyrants, they're tyrants. I mean, the communist Chinese official People's
[46:16.260 --> 46:22.820]  Daily and their TV came out and said, Obama, we support you, quote, wage a war on the Second
[46:22.820 --> 46:27.820]  Amendment. Foreign governments saying wage war on us and Obama's doing it.
[46:27.820 --> 46:34.660]  Yeah, not that he really needed any encouragement, but I guess they can't resist it. They are
[46:34.660 --> 46:40.460]  so offended. I mean, there are lots of things that I'm offended about. Communist China,
[46:40.460 --> 46:42.940]  thugocracy, Russia, on down the list.
[46:42.940 --> 46:45.500]  Suicide nets, forced abortions, yeah.
[46:45.500 --> 46:54.260]  Yeah, yeah. But I don't expect my government to be making a big deal about it unless, well,
[46:54.260 --> 46:58.460]  and maybe if we stop trading with them and started treating them the way they should
[46:58.460 --> 47:03.060]  be, we could be the kind of thing to talk about. So we'd have in mind what kind of people
[47:03.060 --> 47:06.620]  they are. But, you know, I don't tell the Chinese what kind of food to eat and I don't
[47:06.620 --> 47:11.580]  expect them to tell me anything about freedom because they obviously don't understand or
[47:11.580 --> 47:15.740]  care to know anything about freedom. It's certainly not their government that was issuing
[47:15.740 --> 47:16.740]  this offense.
[47:16.740 --> 47:22.380]  Well, that's a good point. Just 20 years ago, our government would criticize China for its
[47:22.380 --> 47:26.900]  criminal activity. Now they won't do it because our government is adopting their policies.
[47:26.900 --> 47:27.900]  Exactly.
[47:27.900 --> 47:33.500]  Well, Larry, I mean, even USA Today, Piers Morgan points to bigger issues. They point
[47:33.500 --> 47:39.100]  out that it is our own media piling up with foreign governments and foreigners who are
[47:39.100 --> 47:47.180]  flooding the social media lobbying to take our guns. This is really, it'd be sedition
[47:47.180 --> 47:51.460]  if they were citizens, this is subversion, but we're so accustomed to it, we don't even
[47:51.460 --> 47:52.460]  call it that.
[47:52.460 --> 47:58.700]  I call it subversion to have Russian and Chinese media published in this country saying take
[47:58.700 --> 48:00.580]  my rights. That is outrageous.
[48:00.580 --> 48:09.020]  And I guess the silence that is kind of deafening is the silence of our government not telling
[48:09.020 --> 48:14.700]  the Chinese that we really don't need their comments about a free society since they obviously
[48:14.700 --> 48:18.060]  don't understand freedom. That's about as polite as I'm putting it.
[48:18.060 --> 48:20.740]  No, no, our media says we've got to do it because they say so. It's incredible. Dianne
[48:20.740 --> 48:25.900]  Feinstein says that. What do you expect them to try to do, not just with her bill, but
[48:25.900 --> 48:31.180]  others? What's the timeframe? Obama said yesterday his priority is open borders and gutting the
[48:31.180 --> 48:34.900]  Second Amendment. What's your battle plan?
[48:34.900 --> 48:43.380]  There's a bunch of anti-Second Amendment bills in. I don't expect them to be successfully
[48:43.380 --> 48:49.460]  pursued either in the Senate or the House. What we have seen is that yesterday and now
[48:49.460 --> 48:55.540]  today, two bills pretty much the same have been filed to do away with gun-free school
[48:55.540 --> 49:02.980]  zones. And I think that's terrific. Congressman Stocklin was the first one in, and he has
[49:02.980 --> 49:08.260]  taken the offensive. He's not talking about, oh, you shouldn't be taking our semiautomatic.
[49:08.260 --> 49:14.140]  Well, of course they shouldn't. We know that. But what we should be doing is working to
[49:14.140 --> 49:21.100]  get rid of the invitation that's posted around every school for mass murder. No guns beyond
[49:21.100 --> 49:28.060]  this point. This is a gun-free zone. Sure it is. That's just insanity. And that's defined
[49:28.060 --> 49:33.420]  as repeating the same thing and expecting a different result each time.
[49:33.420 --> 49:37.700]  And if they want to believe something like that, that's fine. But as for the rest of
[49:37.700 --> 49:41.620]  us, we've got to say, no, we're not playing by those rules.
[49:41.620 --> 49:46.100]  I agree. We've got to get on the offense and point out that it's the government and the
[49:46.100 --> 49:50.340]  liberals, the tyrants, because they're not really liberals, creating the gun-free zones
[49:50.340 --> 49:54.820]  and advertising it. That is absolutely responsible for this.
[49:54.820 --> 50:00.580]  And then they want to blame us gun owners after they created the zone that was the shooting
[50:00.580 --> 50:04.700]  fish in the barrel zone. For those that don't know, more than 10 bills
[50:04.700 --> 50:08.500]  have now been introduced in Congress. How many do you expect to be introduced before
[50:08.500 --> 50:14.460]  this session is up? It'll be a lot. But I think there's going to be some even more coming
[50:14.460 --> 50:15.820]  from the good guys.
[50:15.820 --> 50:22.620]  And those have a chance because even as Senator Coburn put a measure on a spending bill, it
[50:22.620 --> 50:27.060]  was a credit card bill, actually a horrible bill, but he knew it was going to pass because
[50:27.060 --> 50:32.760]  the president really wanted it. And he was able to get the long time ban on guns in national
[50:32.760 --> 50:39.060]  parks done away with. He took a house measure, put it on an amendment to a spending measure,
[50:39.060 --> 50:42.340]  finance measure, and off it went. The president signed it.
[50:42.340 --> 50:47.460]  No, no, you're right. Instead of defending against him, we do that 50%, the other 50
[50:47.460 --> 50:51.100]  offense to get them off balance. I'm going to talk about more ways to get on the offense
[50:51.100 --> 50:56.580]  in our final segment with Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America. Get over
[50:56.580 --> 50:59.660]  there and join it today and get the free alerts.
[50:59.660 --> 51:05.820]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[51:05.820 --> 51:10.540]  severe hot flashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard to work
[51:10.540 --> 51:15.940]  because it continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted and depleted
[51:15.940 --> 51:18.100]  after only three weeks on one world way.
[51:18.100 --> 51:24.060]  I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again. I feel energized and strong. This is
[51:24.060 --> 51:25.060]  an amazing product.
[51:25.060 --> 51:28.900]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10%
[51:28.900 --> 51:34.620]  of its protein content as glutathione, but due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could
[51:34.620 --> 51:38.940]  glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you
[51:38.940 --> 51:43.220]  restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
[51:43.220 --> 51:47.780]  then as a result, your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement
[51:47.780 --> 51:56.060]  you might have. To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. Or visit

[53:04.780 --> 53:10.580]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[53:10.580 --> 53:14.860]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could

[53:20.340 --> 53:24.780]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[54:07.380 --> 54:12.580]  not funded by the Russian government like RT is calling for the end of the Second Amendment.
[54:12.580 --> 54:17.380]  We're not funded by the blood of the Chinese people like their Politburo has with their
[54:17.380 --> 54:22.100]  media outlets calling for the end of our Second Amendment. We're funded by you. So support

[54:37.300 --> 54:41.420]  All of it at mfallwars.com and spread the word. We're growing but we're getting more
[54:41.420 --> 54:45.880]  and more opposition because we're having an effect. Now, Gunners of America Chairman Larry
[54:45.880 --> 54:46.880]  Pratt is with us.
[54:46.880 --> 54:50.420]  It's also important to join gun owners, or at least sign up for the free email alerts
[54:50.420 --> 54:54.280]  up to the minute on the gun grabs. You can defend the Republic. We're having victories
[54:54.280 --> 54:59.360]  like in Illinois yesterday. Moving fast, why not get on the offense too, sir, with bringing
[54:59.360 --> 55:03.820]  up Fast and Furious? Hey, Obama, why don't you cry for all the dead Mexican kids you
[55:03.820 --> 55:08.140]  killed shipping guns into Mexico?
[55:08.140 --> 55:14.200]  The idea that guns need to be banned in the United States, such as Diane Feinstein and
[55:14.200 --> 55:21.260]  other members of Congress are proposing, and not a word about having armed the Mexican
[55:21.260 --> 55:27.220]  cartel thanks to a United States government program, Fast and Furious. These people, they
[55:27.220 --> 55:32.780]  understand staying on offense. You catch them red-handed and all they tell you is, so do
[55:32.780 --> 55:35.940]  you believe me? Are you lying eyes?
[55:35.940 --> 55:40.460]  Oh, I mean the incredible amount of lying. What has it done though where they denied
[55:40.460 --> 55:43.660]  they wanted our guns all these years when we had their own publication saying they want
[55:43.660 --> 55:48.520]  total abolition, that now they're out in the open. I see this if we seize the moment, totally
[55:48.520 --> 55:51.580]  blowing up in their face and reversing everything they've done.
[55:51.580 --> 55:58.980]  I think so too. I've had that sense that maybe my good friend Piers Morgan, I maybe haven't
[55:58.980 --> 56:04.940]  told you, but I'm thinking of setting up a fan club and I'll be the head of it. He brought
[56:04.940 --> 56:14.340]  us more new members than we've had in a long time at one time. I think that so has outraged
[56:14.340 --> 56:20.220]  people and frankly, I think it showed some, when I've talked to other conservative groups
[56:20.220 --> 56:26.220]  in Washington, it really encouraged them to realize that we don't have to just sit there
[56:26.220 --> 56:33.100]  and be sort of a captive, tied to a chair and take our beating.
[56:33.100 --> 56:38.620]  Exactly. These fake liberals aren't liberals, they're authoritarians, call them authoritarians
[56:38.620 --> 56:43.620]  and don't let them sit in the position of authority, in fake moral authority and always
[56:43.620 --> 56:49.140]  put us on the defense and tell us we're child killers when they're the child killers. I
[56:49.140 --> 56:52.340]  mean, if we're child killers, they're 10 times the child killer.
[56:52.340 --> 56:58.340]  Yeah, well, first of all, we don't support abortion, most of us. There's a big exemption
[56:58.340 --> 57:03.820]  right there. And a lot of children get killed in the genocides of dictatorial governments
[57:03.820 --> 57:10.700]  all around the world. And the pattern was very clear. The guns and other weapons were
[57:10.700 --> 57:14.020]  collected first before the real killing got started.
[57:14.020 --> 57:19.100]  We've got an article up at Infowars.com that has a special video we did, Larry, exposing
[57:19.100 --> 57:24.540]  democide governments killing 290 plus million people in the last century after gun control.
[57:24.540 --> 57:28.340]  And it's got all the proof and all the facts. Very important to get that out to people.
[57:28.340 --> 57:32.580]  In closing, in the one minute we have left, anything else you want to warn people about?
[57:32.580 --> 57:37.060]  Oh, during the break, you said executive orders. He may still do that, though.
[57:37.060 --> 57:42.820]  That is a real problem. He could simply say, you can't buy a handgun over a certain caliber
[57:42.820 --> 57:50.660]  and on up and you can't buy a long gun if it takes a detachable magazine. That would
[57:50.660 --> 57:54.140]  be illegal, it would be unconstitutional, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for
[57:54.140 --> 58:00.580]  this president. And we'd eventually beat him in court, but the dealers would have no choice
[58:00.580 --> 58:06.820]  but to comply because if he pulls their license, they're out of business that second.
[58:06.820 --> 58:08.820]  That's right.
[58:08.820 --> 58:10.620]  That's quite a barrel to have us over.
[58:10.620 --> 58:17.180]  You know, I just thought of something. We need a gun owners, a gun shop union so that
[58:17.180 --> 58:21.060]  they can stand up to the ATF because you know how brutal they are to nice mom and pops,
[58:21.060 --> 58:25.900]  you name it. I mean, they really are gangsters because I've experienced them repeatedly.
[58:25.900 --> 58:29.380]  And people I've never been around feds that act like people out of Goodfellas. I mean,
[58:29.380 --> 58:34.820]  tell you, the ATF is a joke. Larry Pratt, thank you so much. Gun owners of America.
[58:34.820 --> 58:38.140]  Thank you, sir. We'll talk to you again soon. Have a great weekend.

[59:53.780 --> 01:00:05.460]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:14.220]  Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:40.740]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:53.020]  Aaron Dykes here on January 1st, 2013. Now, Alex Jones talked on the show today about
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.020]  how the system views us as human resources. And this is happening more and more under
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:03.020]  the eugenics model, more and more here in the United States as we adopt Obamacare, as
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:07.820]  we move towards a planned economy where there's limited economic options and less and less
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.940]  freedom all the time. Now, I just want to point out they really do consider us human
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:18.980]  resources. I'm going to play you a clip from a 1974 family planning clip called Communicate,
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:24.040]  Speak, They Are Listening. Family planning is, of course, code for eugenics. It's the
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:29.020]  softer side of Sears, the softer side of eugenics. Let's go to that clip right now.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:34.820]  In Kenya, the Minister of Finance and Development offers valuable support. Well, my views, which
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:41.460]  really are government views, is that family planning is an integral part of development
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:47.820]  planning. It is an essential part for the reason that you cannot hope to plan other
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:55.420]  forms of production if you cannot plan the production of the main resource, human beings.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:00.580]  We view it as an aspect of human freedom. Incredibly, you see this Finance and Development
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.960]  claim that it's the state's role to decide how many people reproduce, who and when, because
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.580]  they are human resources, part of the overall planned economy system, which time and again
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.880]  leads to limited freedom and basically totally slavery. But on top of that, you see this
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:22.940]  incredible 1984 Orwellian backwards doublespeak where freedom is slavery. Somehow when the
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:28.960]  state tells you if you can breed or not, that's freedom from the natural restrictions on breeding
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.420]  that otherwise occur. So that is not slave to just natural forces. And this is what I
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:41.840]  said in Swahili to these people, that we view family planning education as an extension
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.900]  of personal liberty. And you can find that film in the National Archives, signing off
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:53.540]  for Infowars.com. And there is just one of the little nightly news vignettes that are
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.420]  turned out every night. Infowars Nightly News some days is like three hours long. Usually
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:02.120]  it's about an hour and a half. Soon it will go to an hour with a few commercial breaks
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.460]  so that it can be put out on cable and television systems.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:10.580]  It already is. We're already very thankful to cable systems overseas and domestically
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.100]  that pick it up, edit down the high def file the next day and air it on cable systems.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.940]  It's great for folks with access television shows around the country too to pick out special
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.420]  reports, things you like from prisonplanet.tv and then put it out in your area. Because
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:34.220]  the truth is so much more powerful than lies, a thimble of truth trumps a bucket of lies.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:39.860]  And the globalists are discredited now, they're in trouble. They've got a bunch of brain numbed,
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:45.180]  tranced out, drugged out zombies that follow them, that giggle at you. I mean, they're
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:51.300]  victims. I mean, if you pull up and there's a homeless person who's obviously schizophrenic,
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.380]  been on drugs their whole life, bombed out of their brain.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:58.140]  And they're going, you're the devil, you're the devil or talking to themselves. You don't
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:03.180]  get mad. Now, if your neighbor who you've been friends with for 20 years came over and
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.820]  said you're scum, you're the devil, you might get offended because that's someone who is
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:11.960]  you thought cognitively together, or you'd be worried about them.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:23.700]  But it doesn't hurt my ego at all when a victim laughs at me. Or when these even establishment
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:30.820]  media people following the same old laundry list scripts try to attack us with buzzwords
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:37.040]  and stuff. Because we have the thinkers, they have the stinkers. We have the people that
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.260]  understand history and are rugged and love liberty and they've got a bunch of losers.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:47.300]  So I for one know that liberty is on the march. You see, things are so dark, I saw some emails
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:52.500]  going, Alex says we're on the march, the empire's on the run. The empire's on the march. Yeah,
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:05:00.700]  but if we take the fight to them, we can use their offensive as a way to defeat them.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:05.940]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:11.640]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.820]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:25.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:43.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and liberty lovers are back on the offense. We
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:52.420]  have smashed the most draconian gun control legislation ever seen in the Midwest or even
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:09:03.280]  in the West itself. Only New York City has trumped the almost total gun ban that the
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.220]  entire state of Illinois was trying to ram through.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:13.740]  They were trying to take the Chicago-style gun ban and take it right through the entire
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:17.980]  state of Illinois. And Illinois, I've been up there many times, have family that lives
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:25.180]  up there, works in Chicago. There is no way that the farmers and ranchers and hardworking
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.940]  people that live in the rural areas are turning their guns in.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:35.460]  And decades ago, they warned people in Illinois, and the people in Illinois warned the legislators.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.220]  They said if you ever register our guns, which they've done through the Floyd card, you are
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:46.580]  simply going to allow the government to come confiscate legally owned guns. Cuz it's been
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:52.580]  done all over the world and in the US and Canada.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:58.340]  And we've got Vanity Fair, we've got London Guardian, we've got Huffington Post, we've
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.300]  got them all calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. Here's the Vanity Fair headline.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:09.040]  Let's repeal the Second Amendment. Same thing out of London Guardian. Here's Huffington
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.220]  Post, repealing the Second Amendment would make us better than this.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:20.740]  And again, that's George Soros connected Huffington Post. I sit here and talk about Chinese media
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:25.940]  that's on some cable systems here in the US, government controlled. And I talk about it
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:31.020]  being foreign agents, clearly illegal, when they're engaged in our domestic operations.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:36.020]  They wouldn't put up with it. No government does that, no people put up with that. I talk
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:42.100]  about Russia today. You can have foreign Russian government funded news, but when it starts
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:47.240]  saying repeal the Second Amendment or open your borders up like they're doing or bring
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:54.060]  in socialism, they're trying to cause a Russian revolution in this country.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:57.700]  And I'm too busy to monitor it, but because I was hearing from listeners it was happening,
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:03.420]  so I started spot checking it. And man, they're tearing me down, they're tearing America down,
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:10.660]  they're tearing constitutionalists down, they're tearing Ron Paul down now. I mean, it is bad
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.020]  what's on Russia today, bad.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:19.060]  And it's worse than CNN or MSNBC now. And I guess for a while they operated and posed
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:24.180]  as patriots to get an audience and are now doing this. But I mean, it's hard to deal
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:28.900]  with. And people are like, well, let them have their First Amendment. Listen, if I went
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.540]  to Russia and set up a media operation with $100 million a year, let's say I had that,
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:38.740]  that's what RT gets roughly, one of the federal filings that are out there.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:45.140]  They would arrest me so fast it would make my head spin. And that's because Russia is
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:53.420]  very authoritarian and getting more authoritarian, unfortunately. But the license would be revoked
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:59.480]  even back a decade ago when Russia wasn't as authoritarian. They're taking the Iranians
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:06.900]  license to be on cable away in England and in Europe. And by the way, Press TV is milquetoast
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:13.260]  compared to even my show covering political issues.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:18.300]  And I get invited on Iranian TV, it's worldwide. So it's worthwhile to do cuz it's in English
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.740]  and it's in cable systems all over the world. And I can go and talk about the New World
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:29.460]  Order, the Second Amendment, liberty, freedom, whatever I want. And so it's my message. And
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:35.120]  so even if those things are state run to a certain extent, it's my message getting out.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:42.260]  So I turned down going on Japanese TV or Brazilian TV or Iranian TV just cuz I'm too busy. And
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:46.640]  Japanese TV and Iranian TV always want me to go down to a satellite uplink facility
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.180]  downtown, which takes 30 minutes to go down there and then find parking.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.660]  And then, I mean, Austin's very metropolitan now, it's hard to find parking. Or it's outrageously
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.900]  $10 to park for two hours. And then I gotta get in the building and go through security
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:06.140]  and go through all the trouble and sit there for 30 minutes before and go on. I would do
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:11.260]  RT because they do Skype, boom, turn it on, do 10 minutes, I'm done.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.580]  And it was almost a nuisance, so they wanted me on there every week. But I can talk about
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:19.260]  the New World Order, the Patriot Act, the NDAA, Al Qaeda being government run. I could
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:25.100]  really get some good done, so I'd do it. But I'd bad mouth Stalin and communism as well,
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.220]  and they didn't like that.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.660]  And I haven't been on there in eight months, which is, again, no skin off my back. I've
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.540]  just ignored it. I mean, I've been in New York before, supposed to go on Fox News and
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:40.700]  they go, sorry, higher ups don't want you on now. Well, let's give blame where it's
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:44.780]  due. It was Glenn Beck that time was throwing fits over it. The point is, is it's no sweat
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.380]  off my back. I mean, it's not like, I get to go on television.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.580]  Like they say, I'm on Piers Morgan, the seventh when it gets back. If they cancel it, I'm
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.740]  not even worried about it. In fact, I'm kind of lazy at night, that's fine. Not really
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.540]  lazy, I get so tired, I don't care when stuff gets canceled. They're trying to get me to
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:04.700]  fly up there right now. And I'm like, no, no, no, well, we'll give you three segments
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.700]  if you do.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:10.480]  Right now you've got 12 minutes, we'll give you 16 minutes. And I'm like, no, just do
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.820]  it via satellite, that way if you cancel it, I just drive home 30 minutes, I don't have
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:19.740]  to miss my family. Cuz I only see him a few hours at night when I do, didn't even see
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.780]  my children yesterday, except in the morning.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:28.060]  And I'm not complaining, it's just that I'm not criticizing RT now, because I haven't
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:34.700]  been on there in eight months. Cuz some people are like, Alex, you go on RT, you must work
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:39.800]  for Putin. And I'm like, no, it is state run, state funded, but they don't control what
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.700]  I say. I'll go on there and talk about foreign banks taking the US over, but something changed
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.700]  eight months ago.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.080]  And it's now come out in the EU, it was in the news last week. Hermann von Rompi, one
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.380]  of the heads of the EU, the head of the commission, has been in meetings with Putin and others.
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:15:00.660]  And they're gonna merge the European Union as a new Soviet, and even the president of
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:06.280]  the Czech Republic has said this, but it's now official, with the old USSR. And they're
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.180]  putting the hammers and sickles back on the tanks.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:17.420]  The old timers were right, Russia played possum. And so there were different policies just
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:26.620]  a year ago. Now it is full bore, merged with Obama, the authoritarians uniting against
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:32.700]  our Second Amendment. And I find it outrageous that you've got Al Jazeera, state run media
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:40.380]  out of Qatar, on record, who even funds CNN, that's come out with the Amber Lyon news.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:46.780]  You've got other state run media funded directly by the Kremlin, on record, 100 million a year
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:55.420]  on average, dollars, RT America. You've got BBC, you've got Piers Morgan over on CNN.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:03.340]  In fact, USA Today lists a whole bunch of others here, and points out why are foreign
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:08.380]  governments and state run media calling for us to turn our guns in? Now granted, USA Today
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:12.500]  will have like 15 anti-gun editorials for every editorial like this.
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:20.680]  This is a good editorial by Dan Gaynor of the Boone Pickens Media Fellow, and vice president
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.520]  of business and culture. I mean, he's saying, man, this is over the top, and it really is
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.220]  over the top. I mean, the Japanese would not put up with an American, much less government
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.220]  run.
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:38.620]  Imagine if I showed up with 100 million US dollars a year, and set up a TV station in
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:47.980]  Russia, or in Japan, or in Saudi Arabia, or in Brazil, or Mexico, anywhere. And started
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:55.460]  telling them what to do and bad mouthing George Washington. Ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.100]  have to have the government throw them out.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:02.600]  The people would go and physically throw you out, guaranteed. Bilderberg met two years
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.780]  ago in Switzerland, a year and a half ago, and people showed up with torches to throw
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.340]  them out. And a member of the EU Parliament went in and got beat up by police, and then
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.500]  the police got orders to stand down.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:19.700]  So the Bilderberg group panicked and flew out on helicopters when presidents of three
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:24.420]  cantons showed up. And the cantons are the states, but they actually run the federal
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:28.780]  government there. So the equivalent of super senators showed up and said, you are to stand
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780]  down.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.740]  And helicopters, dozens of them landed, and the top Bilderbergs fled. And that actually
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:39.040]  came out again in the news yesterday that indeed, they are freaked out and may not even
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.420]  meet in Europe again next year, certainly never against Switzerland. Because the government
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.780]  of Switzerland started turning against them and going, yeah, what are a bunch of foreigners
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.060]  here trying to get rid of our sovereignty?
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.940]  They were meeting, part of the agenda was how to get rid of Swiss sovereignty. The Swiss
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.300]  aren't gonna put up with that, because they understand that's why they're wealthy and
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:01.700]  powerful cuz they don't have foreign banks sucking off of them. And because the vampires
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.740]  have sucked everybody else dry, they run to the one place they don't completely run to
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:11.020]  live because they haven't polluted it with their policies.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:17.460]  Everybody's fleeing France to Switzerland right now, and Belgium for lower taxes. The
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:25.420]  football stars, the soccer stars, as they're properly called, all of it. And so my issue
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.180]  is, here's the talking points, cuz it's the facts, I go with the truth. We've got the
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:37.420]  truth, we can destroy these people or at least make them back off, okay?
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.220]  It's time to let RT and all of them know, and I knew this a few weeks ago, so they're
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:47.300]  really attacking me now, which is great. I mean, you're such fools, America is totally
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:51.380]  lining up behind me right now. I saw some of the votes on one of the videos, like 90%
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:56.100]  in favor of us, when the Russian government starts attacking Alex Jones and the Second
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.100]  Amendment.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:04.220]  Good, good, call me bad, call me evil, attack me, Russia, good. I'm not immoral like your
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.220]  government. When the globalists tried to start a war with you in 2008, I was against it because
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.940]  it was wrong morally. And I know America is run by foreign banks. I want my government
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940]  back.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:17.940]  I want my country back, and I don't want foreign banks taking my government over. I don't want
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:21.580]  the Russian government manipulating my life. I don't want the Chinese government manipulating
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.620]  my life. I don't like the Mexican government trying to dictate my life. I don't like the
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:31.620]  federal government trying to run my life, okay? I'm a sovereign, I'm free. You got that?
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.500]  I stand with the truth. I stand with what I really believe is morally right. I don't
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.900]  sit there and try to manipulate my audience and use buzzwords on them over and over again
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.460]  like Alex Jones the Fairmonger, Alex Jones the Fairmonger, Alex Jones the Fairmonger
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.380]  like 10 times in one report.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:51.060]  You think that works? Everybody sees right through you, okay? You're not going to get
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:56.500]  our guns, Russians. You understand that, Vladimir Putin? You're not going to destroy America.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:02.340]  You understand that?
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:07.180]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:11.700]  storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:16.820]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:21.700]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:25.780]  more supplies from Eastwood Direct, and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get

[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:34.780]  my freedom for food. I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do

[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.100]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:43.660]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:50.240]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:56.080]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.100]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:04.540]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:11.300]  get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:15.540]  that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are,
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:20.180]  incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:25.700]  bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:32.620]  and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes. My video at 123coverup.com
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:37.020]  exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:42.140]  too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:48.220]  in the last three months. Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:54.260]  power bill and protect your home. Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:24:15.620]  force me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:20.900]  You're going to find out who's who right now. You're going to see people who claim they
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:26.220]  were patriots, anti-New World Order, come out of the woodwork against info wars, against
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:31.780]  yours truly, Alex Jones. You're going to see a foreign media come out against us as they're
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:37.060]  doing all over foreign newspapers across Europe, across England, China, you name it.
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:43.740]  They are attacking yours truly because they know that we are able to take basic facts
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:49.900]  and hypocrisies and get them out to the public. And they see the articles we put out going
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.860]  viral worldwide and hurting them.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.780]  The enemy has identified us as a key point. You're going to find out who's who now as
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:03.680]  Europe lines up with Russia and Obama to set up a world government. The globalists are
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:11.460]  bringing their system in right now. And the different alignments are being made in the
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:16.420]  power structure. I ought to get Joel Skousen on, he is really smart when it comes to breaking
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:21.260]  all this down. I concur with a lot of his analysis, but I'm really seeing, I want to
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.260]  get what he thinks.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:26.460]  Give him a call. I know Cilentes coming up. See if he can come on for like five minutes
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:32.580]  a day, but like an hour next week, just to give me his take on this Russia really snuggling
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:38.300]  up to Obama right now. But that's a side issue. The point is that all of this is beginning
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.100]  to unfold. All of this is beginning to accelerate.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.980]  And if we can beat Dianne Feinstein and her gun ban bill, if we can beat things like what
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:52.420]  the Illinois legislature thought they had the votes to do, but we defeated, you defeated.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:57.900]  We're on like three affiliates in Illinois, including Chicago. If we're able to do this
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:03.540]  together, and if we turn this around against them and then use this as a way to get more
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:08.740]  guns into schools and more guns in the gun free zones, and then you're gonna have more
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.060]  cases that were shooters going to kill people and get taken out.
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:17.860]  There should be nowhere criminals and shooters are safe. I mean, you look at the higher gun
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:23.020]  ownership in areas like Texas and Arizona, they don't have home invasions at anywhere
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:28.420]  near the numbers of places like England where they've taken all the guns. England has triple
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.060]  the violent crime rate that we have, look it up.
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:36.580]  But our media lies and actually creates fake graphs, just like they tell you Israelis don't
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:40.620]  have guns in school. You know they have guns in school, you can go to Haaretz or Jerusalem
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:45.220]  Post, type in guns in Israeli schools, see articles going back over decades, see new
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:46.220]  articles.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:51.660]  They lie to you, ladies and gentlemen. They think you're stupid because it's all they've
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:59.240]  got. We've got the truth, they've got the lies. And you're going to find out who's who.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.600]  But also, people that have been on the fence for decades are suddenly coming out against
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.380]  the New World Order, are coming out in support of the Second Amendment.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:11.740]  You're going to see who the good guys are right now as well. People you thought were
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:16.860]  just milk toasters suddenly getting hardcore because they realize that now there's no hope
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.260]  unless we get serious. That's it. We either get hardcore and stop playing games or it's
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:23.260]  over.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:27.640]  And you know what, when we get hardcore, we win. When we get angry, we win. When we get
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:35.420]  aggressive, we win. When we stand up and fight, we win. Fight against that? No, we will run
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:42.820]  and we will live. Sure, fight and you may die, run and you'll live at least a while.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:49.060]  But someday, lying in your beds, you'll wish that you had done the right thing now and
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:54.760]  could come back here and tell our enemies that you can take our lives, but you'll never
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:01.100]  take our freedom. The globalists have done everything they can to gut our economy, sell
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.140]  us out, globalize us.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:07.440]  The UN tells our military what to do, NATO tells us, foreign governments tell us what
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.180]  to do, foreign media tells us what to do, illegal aliens come here. I don't hate them.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:19.860]  I hate how they're being used and get a free kidney, over $200,000, paid for by taxpayers
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:24.400]  and Loyola together. And then the guy complained and said, it's not enough. I want all my other
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.640]  immigrant friends to have free stuff.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.640]  You're only being given free stuff as an advertisement. Come to America, can have your baby for free.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.880]  Come to America, you can get a free kidney when citizens don't get that. And why is that?
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.760]  To drive down the wages and implode us, just like the globalists use China to implode our
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.760]  wages.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.840]  Doesn't help the Chinese people, they're worse off than they were. Suicide nets around the
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.000]  factories forced abortions. Mexico's worse off than it was 20 years ago under NAFTA and
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.960]  the UN down there forcing everybody off their land up to Mexico City to live like slaves.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:01.320]  I fight against that. I want the Mexican people to be wealthy and strong and to have freedom.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.160]  Because I want them to be free, but also doing the right thing, also intellectually is always
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.220]  good for you.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:11.660]  Because then it would be a wonderfully wealthy, good, happy, productive place that would not
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:18.640]  be a time bomb helping the globalists bring down America. You understand that, folks?
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.900]  You can't have our neighbors to the south living in squalor and not have it implode
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:28.000]  us. And let me tell you, bringing all those poor people up here is gonna implode us. It's
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.920]  gonna flood our lifeboat, it's not gonna help them.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.740]  And the globalists know that, that's why they want our guns, they want open borders, they
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.200]  want socialist healthcare for the state to run our healthcare. They're control freaks
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:47.040]  that wanna run our lives. 800-259-9231, wide open phones, 800-259-9231, I'm Alex Jones

[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.580]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:17.120]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:22.680]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:28.140]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:32.760]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:38.200]  depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:44.160]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.380]  every street corner.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:50.920]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:29.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. And I think the one reason we've been successful
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.320]  here, well, there's a lot of God's good grace, research, doggedness, but also the fact that
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.360]  I'm naturally excitable when I'm dealing with tyranny. And we've been able to translate
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:48.680]  that energy into others to get America moving out of our inertia, to get America understanding
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:54.280]  we're under attack and to get people into the mindset of not just taking it but standing
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.800]  up.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.160]  And big things have small beginnings. Once we start the ball rolling, it's very hard
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.960]  to get it rolling, but now it's starting to roll. And I was thinking about it. They've
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.100]  had Mexico, the Mexican president come out the last few years and say ban the Second
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:15.480]  Amendment and blame crime in Mexico on it when they have a total gun ban down there.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.920]  And most of the violence is full auto stuff shipped in by big banks who've been caught
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.680]  flying guns in, drugs out.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.080]  Major banks, it's all over the news, hand grenades, rocket launchers. The drug cartels
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:34.760]  have tanks. They're not buying tanks from gun shops. Fast and Furious was staged to
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.840]  blame the Second Amendment and it came out in the memo that they were gonna blame the
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.280]  Second Amendment and blame the violence in Mexico for it and try to go after it.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.120]  Well even though they got caught, the White House still went forward with that. They were
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.040]  going to have press conferences with the poor women talking about their dead children just
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.760]  like they're doing Sandy Hook. But because it turned out they were the ones behind it,
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.960]  they had to kind of back off halfway and it fizzled.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.280]  But right on time Sandy Hook happened. And I saw some more of the foreign media going
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:13.160]  conspiracy theorists say that there were multiple shooters. Well, the media always
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.240]  reports multiple shooters cuz little kids were seeing people and making the reports.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:25.720]  No, we've aired the newscast. It was helicopters and footage and surveillance cameras of multiple
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:32.920]  guys in camo arrested out in the woods. It wasn't little kids filing these reports, there's
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.080]  video of it.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:43.360]  And they said he had an AR-15 M4 inside and it was in the car. I mean, they staged Gulf
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:50.100]  of Tonkin, our government staged mass shootings in Iran in 53 to blame it on Mohammad Mosaddegh
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:57.760]  in mass shootings that they blamed on the government. Declassified, 1999, declassified.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.280]  Decades and decades later, led by Kermit Roosevelt, grandson of Teddy Roosevelt and MI6 and OSS.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:10.480]  Well, it turned into CIA by then. And Operation Gladio, where the Pentagon and NATO launched
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.680]  hundreds of mass shootings and bombings in Europe to demonize their political opposition,
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.880]  whether it be left wing or right wing, that's been declassified by the Italian Parliament.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:27.400]  Their operations with NATO. I mean, mass shootings are in Operation Northwoods, type in Operation
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:28.400]  Northwoods.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.660]  Guys, will you do that PDFs at the National Archives and go in there and it says the Pentagon
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:39.280]  would conduct mass shootings at shopping malls, at markets and on the streets and would shoot
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:48.120]  Americans and blame it on the Cubans as a pretext to invade. But Kennedy said no. Bobby
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.120]  liked the plan.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:56.600]  As much as people lionized Bobby Kennedy, he actually supported bombing the US Embassy
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.760]  in Honduras as a pretext to invade and his brother overruled that as well. Kennedy's
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.720]  weren't perfect by any stretch of the amount. By the way, that's all declassified, just
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.560]  type in, I think it's like BBC, AP, you name it.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.700]  It's been declassified, it's not debatable. So when I see something like this right on
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.640]  time and it has the earmarks, I'm like, yeah, they could have staged that. I mean, with
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:22.080]  the Batman thing, people keep saying, why are we connecting this to Batman, mainstream
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.760]  corporate foreign press and others?
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.440]  It's not like we said Batman would be connected to shootings after it. We said before it had
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.520]  clear triggers. And they mailed out these bane letters to media showing bane attack
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:41.720]  points that name things like Sandy Hook and Hinkley, one of the shooters. And the Batman
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:49.040]  shooter was in a government mind control program, that's in the Colorado newspapers, that he
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:55.960]  was in a special DARPA defense program of brain interface with machines to take over
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.160]  the cognitive abilities.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:04.640]  Thought helmets, like in the movies where they put the helmet on and it picks up your
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:12.900]  brain waves. He was in a super advanced top secret Pentagon funded program with a top
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:16.680]  Air Force psychiatrist as his handler. You wanna keep going about an hour and a half
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.680]  here?
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.600]  Cuz I mean, it just goes boom, boom, boom, boom. I don't know, maybe that is a coincidence.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.520]  Maybe it's a coincidence I said, I believe the Batman movie coming out will be a trigger
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:36.000]  for bombings and shootings. I mean, I'm on record months before it came out, who put
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  out Batman?
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.920]  Warner Brothers even tried to get our video taken off YouTube, breaking it down, tried
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.200]  to claim copyright on it. We went and refiled and it's fair use, we were just exposing scenes
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.320]  in the trailer. I said it's trying to invoke a subconscious blueprint for revolution. And
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.480]  Bane symbolizes the Illuminati, fire goes up, and how they leak that beforehand.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.200]  See, these little brains of the New World Order think we're all stupid and don't see
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.640]  what they're doing. All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls. The point is the globalist
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:10.120]  are coming after the Second Amendment right now. And they're gonna come after the pension
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:13.440]  funds and they're trying to set up all over the country you're hearing.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:19.840]  In California, in Oklahoma, in Virginia, in Tennessee, in Texas, the police are setting
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.400]  up federally funded gang checkpoints where, let me see, you got any tattoos? Get out,
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.400]  I don't wanna look at your tattoos. No judge, no jury, no probable cause, no reasonable
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.240]  suspicion. Let me search your car.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.920]  By the way, we're gonna look for guns now. That's in the news. By the way, we're gonna
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:42.160]  do a cavity search now. This is martial law. I'm not saying martial law is coming, martial
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:47.840]  law is here. The police state isn't coming, the police state is here. That's the tagline
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.160]  from Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA came out two years ago.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:58.720]  And I've got state reps and governors and army colonels on admitting gun confiscation
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.640]  drills. Remember they had gun confiscation drills in Arcadia, Iowa, where they practiced
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.800]  writing the local gun shop going door to door with the citizens taking their guns in a drill.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:13.320]  The town of 650, and I had the colonel on, he goes, well, yeah, we are doing this drill,
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.680]  but what's wrong with that? And the media called me a conspiracy theorist. It said,
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:20.680]  yeah, they're doing a gun confiscation drill, but Alex Jones is still a conspiracy theorist.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:24.960]  So it's like, well, yeah, we're doing the gun confiscation drill, but it's not like
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.560]  he gets laurels thrown at him. You were right. Thank you for warning us. Let's stop this
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.560]  nightmare. It's, no, he's bad.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.560]  Alex Jones said they were gonna start having the TSA on the streets. Now it's happening.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.240]  My gosh, man, you were right. Tell us more. It's like, you fair monger. Because that's
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:46.280]  all they've got. But people aren't listening to them anymore. But they don't care. They're
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:52.840]  arrogant. They're there in their big fancy CNN and RT and MSNBC facilities and they really
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:53.840]  believe it.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.240]  When The View called me a few years ago and said, we want you to come here. And I said,
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.240]  I wanna do it on satellite. They said, we don't do satellite. And I said, I know, I
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.000]  just don't wanna do it. They said, you're kidding. You don't wanna do The View. I mean,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.720]  the president's wanna come on here. And I said, nope. And they said, listen, we'll pay
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.760]  for your ticket, direct flight, everything.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:17.000]  And then a bunch of other media called to get me to New York. So I said, okay, I'll
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.680]  come to New York. Cuz that way I figured they wouldn't cancel me cuz that was my concern.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:29.040]  I'm not gonna be chumped or schmucked into that. And then I go, well, I want first class
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.640]  tickets, sir, I'm not going. It's ABC's money. They go, sorry, we never bought anyone first
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]  class.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.480]  And I said, I'm not doing it. They go, we're calling your bluff. We're not doing it. You're
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.120]  not on the show. I said, good, click. They call back, okay, we'll buy you first class
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:47.840]  tickets. My point is, they hate it that I don't care about them. They absolutely cannot
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.400]  stand it that I don't worship them.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.060]  And they hate the fact that you don't worship them anymore either. They hate the fact that
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.680]  you're awake to their fraud. It's like the Emperor's New Clothes, I'm gonna go to your
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:07.640]  calls. Do you know that old parable of these scammers end up coming to the king and they
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:12.920]  say, we're gonna weave you the most fine linen, but only the most royal can see this gold
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.000]  linen.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.120]  So they sit there for hours, imaginarily weaving. And he's royal, surely he could, so he thinks,
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.040]  maybe I'm not royal. Maybe I'm an imposter, I better not say I don't see it. So they put
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.680]  it on him and he goes out and he's in his underwear. He's not really wearing clothes.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.200]  But no one wants to say that the Emperor is naked. Well, finally, he gets totally naked
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:39.320]  by the third garment and is in a parade naked and no one wants to say he's naked.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.280]  And finally, a three year old steps forward and laughs and says the Emperor has no clothes
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.720]  and everyone dies laughing. And that's how this works with these people, okay? The Emperor
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:54.280]  has no clothes. Laugh at them like you laugh at a rattlesnake that's rattling its rattle
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:58.240]  at you when you've got space age technology and you know this rattler isn't gonna make
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.240]  it.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.840]  You think I'm gonna reach down and let you bite me? No, no, no, I have a shotgun and
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:10.920]  I'm talking about politically. I have a shotgun rattlesnake. I'm gonna step back about 20
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:16.580]  feet. I'm gonna put a bead right dead center. And you're not gonna be as uppity after I
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:21.600]  pull this trigger.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.880]  They can feel Liberty's fingers wrapping around their throats. To use another analogy, we're
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.680]  like a giant boa constrictor that's wrapped around them. And they're busy telling us how
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:36.000]  powerful they are and all they're gonna do to us, call their bluff. Call their bluff
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  and mean it.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.640]  It's like, I'm not saying playing chicken's good, but that's just what it's all about.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:48.460]  You're not turning off and you're ready to die. You're gonna win the $20,000 prize. And
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:52.040]  people bet and play chicken, they're that crazy. Why don't people that are that crazy
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.400]  get crazy for Liberty and we can beat these people very, very quickly.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:59.800]  Why not just say I'm all in, I'm done, that's it, I'm committed. See, that scares them.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:07.480]  That scares them. The will scares the globalist. And it's now time to have the will and realize
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.280]  they're gonna take everything we got anyways. We might as well start getting aggressive
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.280]  with these people.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:20.160]  All right, let's go to your phone calls. Angela in Nebraska, you're on the air about media
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.160]  propaganda. Go ahead.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:29.600]  Hi, Alex. There's an artist that I love. I'm keeping it really quick. Her name is Santigold
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:35.080]  and I don't know if you've seen this video, but it's called The Keepers. And all of the
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:42.520]  food at the dinner table is poisoned and they all have cancer wigs on or wigs. And the mother's
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:48.400]  pumping the wig and the chicken has breast on it because it's over hormone. And Santi
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:55.400]  White, the director and artist Santigold is trying to basically expose the fact that we're
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:01.760]  all being poisoned with their hormones and the oil spills and the radioactive food. And
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:07.440]  he can't use the word cancer, but I can see through it because my mom died of cancer and
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:08.760]  wore the cancer wigs.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.160]  Well, what happens is the system intimidates you and says, you can't do this, you can't
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.880]  do that. They tried to sue milk producers that put no GMO in it, but they counter sued
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:26.240]  and won the right to say, our milk doesn't have growth hormone in it. So absolutely,
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.400]  our girls are going into puberty now at an average age of 10, that used to be 14.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:37.880]  Our boys are going into puberty late. I mean, they're killing us, the cancer rates are off
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.800]  the chart. It's funny to them and they just wanna go, come on conspiracy theorist, no
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.200]  one's poisoning you. That's the new thing. Russia Today was saying there's no chemtrails.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.720]  I mean, the government admits they're spraying barium salts, aluminum dioxide and other stuff
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:58.200]  on record in massive tests everywhere. One got stopped a few months ago out in New Mexico
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.200]  because the whistle got blown on Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.880]  We're gonna spray a bunch of stuff on a town. And they're just like, there's no secret testing
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:09.240]  on you when everybody knows about the thousands of tests, including lethal ones, we're done.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.440]  You don't just sit here and tell us this isn't going on and cuz you're the authority, we
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.120]  sit here and bend over to it. God bless you, ma'am, I appreciate your call. Let's talk
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:24.320]  to Sean in Arizona. Let's talk about the Russians listening on WWCR. Go ahead.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.640]  Thank you, Alex. I haven't talked to you in a while. I have a great story from back in
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:34.680]  1989 in Jackson Hole. There was a summit there in the third week of September with Russian
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:40.040]  Foreign Minister, Sherba Natsi and James Baker, our Secretary of State. The Russian Secret
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:46.360]  Service or equivalent came into Jackson Hole Valley three weeks beforehand. At the end
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:52.320]  of August, they were there for a month. In that area of Wyoming, hunting season starts
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:59.280]  in some areas on the 28th of August. The Russian Secret Service equivalent told the people
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:05.880]  up in Teton County and the state people that were working with our federal and their federal
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:12.520]  people, the Russians let it be known that they were very unsettled, that they had always
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:16.680]  been told that the Americans had a lot of guns.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:24.560]  But what they were seeing, one and two loaded rifles in the rifle racks, in the cabs of
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:31.280]  pickups continuously, all day, wherever they were in the valley, some of them were even
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:38.000]  afraid. So- Well, yeah, because that very crew of Russians had just killed 67 million
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.720]  people, raped their wives, beat their brains out, worked people to death in work camps.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.200]  They were used to being in total power and everybody's scared of them. And seeing real
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:51.800]  human beings armed who weren't scared of them totally freaks them out because they're cowards.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.120]  Authoritarians are cowards and the Israeli government's been bad mouthing our guns when
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:01.240]  we pay for theirs. The Russians, the Chinese, the British government, all of them can go
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.000]  straight back to North Korea.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.160]  I'm sorry, finish your story. I have one other point here because I've been studying this
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:16.400]  thing since the late 70s. You are absolutely right that the kibosh is on for our freedom
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.760]  in everything. I'd like to make a quick point on what happened with the markets yesterday.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:26.960]  There was a release of a statement by the feds that panicked the whole markets. And
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:33.960]  I believe the reason they let it out at this time was because they want, of course, more
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960]  money.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.920]  Look, I predicted Monday on air, we gotta find the clip, when the market went up 200
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.040]  points, or was it Tuesday, cuz of the fiscal cliff deal. I said that's a fake sugar high.
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.560]  The plunge protection team controls it. They're gonna jack it up and then run it right back
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.760]  down because they're the insiders on record. Congress, they say, is allowed to insider
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.760]  trade.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.640]  Of course, they're not, but they say they are, cuz they're criminals, the ones that
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.580]  are involved. And they all know, so of course they run it up and run it down and then run
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:05.600]  it back up. Go ahead.
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:11.160]  And the last thing, I sat and watched C-SPAN last night, watched Joe Biden swear in the
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:18.080]  new senators. And it's a shame, a lot of those folks have young families. And they'll just
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:23.520]  be turned every which way but loose and never really know what's going on in the country.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:29.280]  It takes effort, I've studied it for 40 years and you've studied it for 30. It takes effort
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.000]  to research these things, to really understand what is going on.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.160]  Why do you think the globalist claim they were fighting with the Russians just a year
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:41.960]  ago, two years ago, and now they're all chummy. And the Russians are over here saying, let's
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:46.520]  get rid of freedom, let's take the guns. Anybody that criticizes the government's evil, I mean,
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.080]  why do you think they're doing that?
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:55.600]  Well, because now is the time. I mean, we're at this point where we're the most vulnerable.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:03.280]  We've got an administration that is more sympathetic to globalist causes than we ever had. And
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.200]  the kibosh is on, just like you say every day. You're absolutely right.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:16.120]  Well, I wanna say 17 years on air and two decades of research, I've never been one tenth
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.800]  as concerned. And I just hope listeners get that. I mean, this is the time where just
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.080]  cuz we think we're winning the Second Amendment battle right now, that's cuz we got on the
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.120]  offensive. I guarantee you they're getting ready for false flags, all the signs are there.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:32.640]  And they're going to blame it on us. And we've got to instantly come out and not take the
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.680]  guilt they put on us. Minute one, when they blame us, we gotta go, well, hey, you did
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.680]  it then.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.200]  And they go, how dare you? Well, you're saying we did it. No, we don't believe a thing you
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:46.120]  say, you did it. And they'll go, well, that's outrageous. Well, you just said we did it.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:51.200]  You did it, you did it, you did it. You have the history of staging stuff, you did it.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.400]  You're the suspect. You're the suspect. You're the suspect government. You're the foreign
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:03.240]  bank run collaborators. Get out of our country. Get out, get out, get out.

[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:17.220]  presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind. And I've been ranting
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:22.080]  about foreign governments and media teaming up against the American people. This is a
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.400]  big deal.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:27.520]  And the globalists just think that because we're Americans, we have such hospitality.
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:33.220]  That's what it is. You go ahead Russians and Chinese communists and corrupt Mexican government,
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:38.000]  you know, we'll turn our guns and we're sorry we killed those kids. Yeah, publish our names
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.240]  in the newspaper like we're criminals. Yeah, you know what, we'll prove we're good. That's
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:45.360]  the mind game.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.420]  But we take the fact that foreign governments are in our face. If we take that fact and
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:57.340]  point it out, we can use their outrageous attempt to take over, to totally turn this
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:55:03.000]  debate around. And it's starting to happen. If you go to Infowars.com, Obama teams up
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:08.320]  with foreign media and governments to destroy Second Amendment, Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:13.600]  Russian, British, Australian talking heads. Yeah, and the Israelis didn't back us up on
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.160]  the Second Amendment, their foreign ministry at least. We need to demand a full statement
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:23.380]  on that to correct that. And of course, it's in there, Al Jazeera is coming out against
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:24.380]  the Second Amendment.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:28.360]  I mean, it's ridiculous. And of course, they don't speak for the Australians. They don't
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.440]  speak for the Israelis. They don't speak for the Russians. We're not against the Chinese
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:39.240]  or Russian people. It's their corrupt governments. Get your stinking hands off my guns. Okay,
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:44.120]  you understand that? You understand that? Just like I told our corrupt government when
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:49.200]  they tried to start a war with Russia, don't do it.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.920]  That is what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen. Gerald Cilente is coming up. I'm
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:58.040]  gonna go to some more of your calls as well. We've got a listener with solutions on KKGM

[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.160]  Again, a 1630 AM listener who has some quick solutions. Go ahead.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:55.000]  Actually, I don't have solutions. I wanted to talk to you about them. I've been the listener
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.040]  for a while. You have a ton of knowledge. And I know that your main message is really
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.440]  to spread the word. So taking that knowledge, I started my own teacher company, so obviously
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:14.480]  just to spread the word. Like you said a few minutes ago, to quote you, I'm in, I'm committed.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.280]  I wanted to talk about real solutions because I listen to you all the time and I hear and
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:23.160]  I gain knowledge all the time, but- Okay, well so much of this is a moral issue.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.920]  They're moral, we're murderers of children. After saying to you, well, we have to go,
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:30.520]  wait a minute, you're the ones that took the guns out of the school. See, so much of it
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:37.840]  is about selling tyranny. So we said, call the State House in Illinois, stop the gun
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:38.840]  ban.
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:43.160]  We put articles out, others did. We flooded them and they knew the villagers were coming
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:49.420]  with pitchforks, so they backed off. Same thing, we introduced bills to arm the teachers
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:55.040]  in the school. So this stops, then it actually fixes things. So you're saying, what are the
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040]  solutions?
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.560]  Call us the private Federal Reserve, bring the power of the Treasury, of the purse back
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:05.920]  into the Treasury. Get constitutionalists elected. I mean, there's so many, run for
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:12.200]  office yourself locally, educate people. So much of it is just getting the word out, sir.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.920]  See, they wanna keep this gun grab under the radar. We're not gonna let that happen. You
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:17.920]  see what I'm saying?
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.680]  Yes, sir, I just feel helpless. I feel like we never win and we're always on the defense.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.600]  So what you're saying about going on the offense, you know, writing letters, suing them and
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.600]  all that, these all sound great. I just don't know how to do them. I've written letters
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.600]  to my Congress.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.760]  All right, well listen, you can sue any city you're in that's putting so-called sodium
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:51.320]  fluoride in the water. Stay there, I'll come back to you, then I'll go to others.

[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:23.200]  We have a caller asking for solutions and saying he doesn't know how to take action.
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:36.960]  All over the world and in the U.S. there have been successful lawsuits pointing out that
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:40.800]  not only sodium fluoride is out of the water but a bunch of other chemicals. So you do
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:45.680]  a four year request, you get where they're getting the fluoride, you document, you get
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:51.880]  in, you take photos of it at the water plant with a skull and crossbones for the exhibit.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:55.300]  You have to go file this to do this. You put them on notice you're gonna sue them because
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.840]  they're hitting you with a dangerous chemical weapon and making you pay for it. And then
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.880]  you just copy the lawsuits that have been successful in other states and counties and
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:06.700]  you file a suit on the city.
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:10.640]  And you go in city council and you talk about it during the citizens communication to draw
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:17.080]  attention to it and then local media will report on it. And usually there's already
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:20.640]  an activist group locally that's sick of it. You get aggressive. They're assaulting you
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:26.300]  with a chemical weapon. You assault them with a court. Courts are meant to take a caveman
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:29.920]  system of violence when somebody's violent to you, you can only be violent back and to
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.360]  go and do it through a court.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.320]  But we've abandoned the courts. So there's a solution. Take our video we put up yesterday,
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.400]  demand a real plan. It's had 64,000 views. It'll probably get about 300, 400,000 views
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:49.640]  at the rate it's going. In the next few days, it needs to get 10 million views. But the
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.920]  point is we just churn videos out, pointing out that government's the number one threat.
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.040]  Government's the danger. Don't turn your guns in. Then politically people have the will
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.040]  to not turn their guns in.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:05.240]  And then we say, look, I came on air and I said, I'm not turning them in, come and get
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:09.400]  them. And it's one thing to say that to your buddy at the bar. I said it on the radio to
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:14.600]  3 million people, okay? That's where the real power is saying, you know what? You gotta
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:15.600]  go through my body.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:20.040]  I'm done playing games, okay? You're criminals. You're unconstitutional. You've committed
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:25.320]  all these crimes. Cease and desist now. And it gives moral support to the good police
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:28.880]  and military. Most of them are good men and women who know this is wrong and they need
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:34.760]  our moral support. We need theirs. And everybody else, you've got to stand.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.920]  So I hope that answers your question, Ryan. God bless you. Let's talk to Ken in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:40.920]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:43.120]  I'm here, Alex.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:44.120]  Hey, buddy.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.000]  I ran out of my longevity products a couple weeks ago running around from the holidays
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.640]  and all that. Didn't reorder in time. And because of my job, I'm up and down the ladders
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:58.240]  all day. I was getting soreness in my legs and my ankles. Anyway, my new packages came
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:06.040]  in like a few days ago and it's gone. I'm back to fighting weight, fighting the-
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:10.000]  The products at Infowarshealth.com, this isn't a planned call. The guy's just calling in
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.840]  about this. The products we've assembled and put together at Infowarshealth.com are the
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:19.240]  best out there from our research. And the dramatic effects for Aaron Dykes, myself and
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.560]  others are just amazing.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:27.200]  Just the energy level with the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the Polymers Plus, their special
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.360]  proprietary blend of essential fatty acids, the hundreds of products there at Infowarshealth.com
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:37.320]  are amazing. And I need to do more to promote it because it also funds our operation. And
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:42.920]  that's what I do. I fund us, not with Putin money, like RT, I fund ourselves with stuff
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.880]  I believe in and I use.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:48.520]  So anything else you'd like to add about the longevity products?
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:54.680]  Well, I got introduced through them for listening to their show. And I thought I'd try them
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:59.240]  and see how they did. And I was amazed. Within a week, it's just what a difference.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.000]  Well, I tell you, you ought to sell them. If you become a distributor, you can pay 10
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.600]  bucks and get discounts. And also sign up and get free shipping when you get auto-ship

[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  it's good.

[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:23.600]  go there and sign up to become a distributor and then pay it forward. You discover something
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.480]  that really works? Tell people your testimony and promote it.
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:28.480]  Absolutely.
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:34.280]  Well, God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call. Gerald Cilente, our first visit with
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:38.080]  him in the new year. Folks are chomping at the bit to get him on, myself included. We'll
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:45.360]  talk about Sandy Hook, the economy, the police state, the wars, where he sees it going. I
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:51.320]  mean, it is just crazy, the zone we're entering right now.

[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:11.920]  storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the great depression, America's worst
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:17.140]  drought in agricultural history. And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:22.120]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even

[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:06.640]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:21.240]  For the balance of the hour today we are joined by Gerald Cilente. We'll also continue with
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:25.240]  some of the phone callers that are already on hold because Gerald can speak about any
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:30.640]  issue. He's a very well researched best selling author. Worked as a consultant. Worked in
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:36.740]  a political circles as well. I really need no introduction here. Trendsresearch.com.
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:40.360]  Gerald is an American Trends forecaster, publisher of Trends Journal, business consultant
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:45.000]  and author who makes predictions about global financial markets and other events of historical
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  importance. Cilente has described himself as a political atheist and a citizen of the
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  world. He's appeared basically on everything under the sun and he is a regular guest with
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.680]  us. Something we really appreciate and his quarterly Trends Journal and his daily and
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:06.400]  weekly trends updates are invaluable. Everyone should also support real media and real analysis
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:12.040]  and go and become subscribers and then hand off the great color magazine to folks that
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:13.040]  you know.
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:18.140]  It's got the great art of Anthony Frida in it. He's also got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts riding
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:24.400]  with him. Roberts has pointed out recently that so is USA Today of all people, of all
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.240]  outfits that the Israeli government didn't defend our second amendment and said, we don't
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:33.980]  have armed teachers. No, you shouldn't have guns. When we pay to arm the teachers in Israel,
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:35.560]  that's on record they do.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:40.320]  The Russian media has come out and said we should not have our guns and they attack me.
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:43.540]  We've had the Chinese government come out through their media and say we shouldn't have
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:48.600]  guns and quote, there should be a war against gun owners, Piers Morgan. All this media,
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:55.760]  BBC, Australian news, it's despicable that all these authoritarian systems want our guns.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.140]  And I wanted to talk to Gerald about this first because I wanna get his take and his
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.140]  view on it.
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:05.960]  Then we'll get into his latest forecasting and fine tuning cuz so much of what he said
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:13.920]  is coming true like clockwork. What he sees unfolding now in 2013 to 2014 as the economy
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:18.440]  continues to deteriorate. They've announced in states all over the country federally funded
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.680]  local police checkpoints looking for criminals and gangs.
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:27.020]  And they search for guns while they're at it, legal guns. They drag you out of your
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:32.700]  car and take photos of your tattoos. That's mainstream news in Texas. We're going into
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:38.400]  a deeper level of incremental martial law. And is that happening because the hammer is
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:41.040]  about to drop financially?
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:47.400]  It's all accelerating basically and Gerald Salente joins us to be able to speak about
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:51.640]  this. Gerald, a lot's happened since you were on three or four weeks ago, my friend. Good
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:52.640]  to have you on.
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:55.600]  Thanks for having me and happy new year to you and everyone.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.640]  You too. What is your take on the shooting there in Connecticut very close to you and
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:07.060]  how they're publishing names of gun owners so we can be robbed and so we can be demonized.
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:12.200]  How they're saying all gun owners are racist Klan members. These are quotes. It looks like
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.320]  they really are coming after us.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:22.360]  Yeah, they are. And it's what you said before. Matter of fact, we're finishing up the winter
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:28.120]  edition of the Trends Journal and we go into all the laws and restrictions that they're
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:33.920]  putting out there to control us. And it is because to use your phrase, the hammer is
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:42.600]  falling. And on the gun control issue, let's play this back. When did we first start seeing
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:50.640]  these kind of uncontrollable lunatics losing their minds in mass killings of people?
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:57.300]  I mentioned that when I was a young man, I remember this this movie, a young kid, actually,
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:03.200]  in cold blood by Truman Capote. And this guy killed like, you know, four people or something
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:11.660]  in a farm village in Iowa or someplace. And he was whacked out on aspirin. When you look
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:20.040]  and see when this mass murder trend began, it began with the issuance. It's all there.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:27.520]  You could look at the data. It began with the issuance of these psychotropic drugs.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:35.040]  And as you follow what went on in Newtown, there's very little talk, if anything, about
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:41.320]  what this kid was whacked out on. And they're saying that he was suffering from Asperger's
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:50.720]  disease or syndrome. And consequently, it is assumed that he was on psychotropic drugs.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.940]  And they're keeping that sealed because in every case it keeps coming out. The shooters
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:58.760]  were on all sorts of these drugs that in the insert says causes you to kill people and
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:03.360]  kill yourself. Just like our militaries at record suicides, they give them suicide pills.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:06.000]  I mean, what do you expect is gonna happen?
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.160]  Not only that, when you look at the latest data coming out on how much money the military
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:21.320]  is spending on these drugs and prescription drugs, it's absurd. It's obscene. And again,
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:31.560]  you don't even have to read the label of Zoloft or Ritalin or Prozac. Just tune in to any
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:39.080]  TV station and listen to the ads from the prescription drugs that they're selling.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.160]  And after they show the person romping through the fields and bluebirds flying everywhere
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:52.200]  and how great life is, and they go through what the side effects of these drugs are,
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:14:01.240]  you'll hear suicide come up more frequently than not. So it's not an issue of gun control.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:10.560]  It's an issue of drug control. And it's not an issue of marijuana. It's an issue of the
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:17.080]  pharmaceutical industry that are killing the brains of the nation. And then when we look
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:27.320]  at the other issue, and I hear all these politicians come out, the Dianne Feinstein's, the not-so-Feinstein's,
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:35.000]  the Obama's, all of them, one after another, saying what we have to do to stop this cycle
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  of violence.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:43.460]  I got an idea. Why don't we start at the top? You want to talk about murder? Hey, you blow
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:51.200]  some people off in a school. How about wiping out entire villages? I got one for you. You
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:58.080]  want to talk about a cycle of violence? How about that wonderful war that you senators
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:09.100]  and you congressmen voted to send our people to to go kill other people by the millions?
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:15.500]  You want to talk about a cycle of violence? Hey, let's wait for Tuesday. Yeah, terror
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:21.900]  Tuesday. You know that day when Obama signs off on what drones to send over to foreign
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:29.040]  countries and kill people? Oh, and the wives and the kids around them, just call them collateral
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:36.240]  damage. It's a culture of cruelty. Why shouldn't people do this? They'll see it coming from
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:42.080]  the top and the fish rots from the head down.
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:47.520]  And I want to mention about what happened over here with this newspaper in Rockland
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:54.840]  County, not far from us. This is beautiful. This is great. You want to talk about imbeciles
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:16:03.640]  and cowards, the editor of this, the publisher of that newspaper, a coward, a little slimy
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:13.000]  piece of crap, publishing people's names that have guns. And why am I calling her a slimy
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:21.080]  little piece of crap? Because right here in the Turlet Paper of Record, newspaper that
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:27.520]  put gun permit map online hires armed guards.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:36.000]  Check that out for hypocrisy. No, you can't arm yourself, you little weenie, disgusting
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:43.320]  individual. You need somebody to protect you. You need an armed guard. I got an armed guard
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:53.160]  for you. Check this line out. The safety of my staff is my top priority, Ms. Hansen said
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:17:00.360]  in a telephone interview. Guess what? The safety of my staff is their own priority.
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:06.960]  If you can't stand up for your life, you don't deserve to have it if you're gonna call somebody
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:14.360]  out and start a fight. And that's what these people do. They start a fight and then they
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:21.720]  call armed guards in because they don't have the courage, the dignity, the respect to defend
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:23.480]  themselves.
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:29.240]  Gerald, I've studied a lot of history, so have you, because to know what's gonna happen
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:34.400]  currently in the future, you have to know history. The hypocrisy of the so-called liberals,
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:37.680]  these are not liberals. It's not that the conservatives are good either, the mainline
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:38.680]  ones.
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.920]  They're authoritarians too, but this group of Obamanoids, they've all got bodyguards.
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:47.000]  They've all got concealed carries, Dianne Feinstein admits it. But then she says, Mr.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.080]  and Mrs. America, this is a quote, I'm gonna make you turn all your guns in. I'm sure you've
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:56.960]  seen that video. It's crazy. It's like they're gonna have guns, but then say we're trash
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:00.840]  and publish where we live, cuz they're doing this all over the country with government
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:04.160]  list of concealed carry people.
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:08.800]  And this has been done before and people get robbed. And I hope they get sued for doing
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:14.260]  this because this is harassment. This is a terroristic action. I mean, they are the scum
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:18.920]  of the earth. They've got armed guards, Gerald, but they'll publish that you've got guns.
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:24.000]  Yeah, I know, I mean, who's making this crap up, an armed guard? Why can't you arm yourself?
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:30.160]  You gotta hire somebody? Yeah, what kind of, who made this crap up? And then they brag
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.600]  about it. We hired armed guards? Doesn't anybody see the disconnect here?
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:39.440]  They are pathetic, disgusting jellyfish. And again, up top, they want our guns to enslave
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:44.240]  us. But the general liberal is really a chicken neck who's never been in a, I walk on the
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.240]  hike and bike trail and I could tell who real liberals are, who love liberty, they're outgoing.
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:55.060]  But the fake liberals are literally scared chicken necks of everything. They are scared
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:19:00.360]  of their own shadows. And so they want us to live like disarmed slaves like they do.
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:08.100]  All right, now let's put this all into perspective to make it real at another level. Let's suppose
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:16.080]  they pass gun control. How effective is it going to be with some 300 million guns out
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:22.520]  there? Who's going to have the guns? I'll tell you how effective it's going to be. It's
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:28.560]  going to be as effective as prohibition was. I'll tell you how effective it's going to
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:35.680]  be. It's going to be as effective as the war on drugs. Who can, what are they going to
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:39.200]  do? They're not going to be able to control this.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:45.760]  I'll tell you how effective it is in countries like Brazil and other places where it's almost
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:52.760]  impossible to get guns. You know who has the guns? The criminals. And they're running loose.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:54.560]  That's who's going to have the guns. Stay there, sir. You're right. Let's talk
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:59.340]  about that. That hasn't been looked at. The crime rate will explode, which is what the
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:04.800]  big city mafia wants. It's absolutely heartbreaking. All over America,
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:09.720]  people are constantly suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure,
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:15.260]  congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeat, clogged arteries, and high cholesterol. Can
[02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:20.680]  you live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, and experience your body healing
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:24.600]  itself? Look to Heart and Body Extract, an all-natural

[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:10.960]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:15.080]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:20.640]  President could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:25.160]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:30.840]  ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:36.040]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:40.280]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders

[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:03.400]  It's the only one you've got. On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:07.720]  to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:13.160]  taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:17.480]  to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw of free enterprise or is our monetary
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:21.920]  unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:26.280]  and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:30.920]  book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:35.840]  needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.960]  international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:47.020]  from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:51.940]  copy today. It's critical that the public be made aware of the system. Call and order

[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:05.760]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:11.840]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:17.120]  device poses the greatest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:21.200]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:26.020]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:30.740]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:36.840]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:42.520]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:47.720]  exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:52.920]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com
[02:23:52.920 --> 02:24:16.920]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:20.960]  Gerald Salente is our guest. Gerald, I want to get back to the point you were making about
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.200]  crime rates exploding in Chicago, New York, everywhere they take the people's arms. I
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:29.420]  mean, it's common sense. This idea of let's don't arm the pilots, they can be trusted
[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:35.900]  to fly the plane, but let's literally get a $20 an hour security guard who's had a couple
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:40.960]  of firearms classes that anybody could take, and let's have them come guard us.
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:46.480]  Or let's put federal air marshals on all the planes to spy on everybody instead of, I mean,
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:50.520]  it's this idea that only government specialists can do it. It's all about a government monopoly,
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:54.160]  but doesn't the power structure, I want to get back into the point you were making, but
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:58.040]  then I want to ask you this central question. We can see where this is going, you've talked
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:00.520]  about it, you've wrote about it, history, we've seen it.
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:04.040]  Yeah, they may get half the public to want to turn the guns in, and half the public to
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:07.520]  suck their thumbs, and think government really cares about them, and maybe the government
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:14.760]  can come and wipe their hind ends. But a lot of us, 10, 15, 20, 30% know what's going on,
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.000]  we're not gonna go along, we're done.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:22.360]  So they can't put us all in prison, I mean, the system obviously knows it's gonna cause
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:27.840]  a civil war if Obama signs an executive order to try to confiscate guns, Gerald Cilente.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:33.000]  Well, yeah, they're going to try something, I don't believe they're gonna go that far
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.760]  with it, because I think they know that they're not gonna get away with it. And we even saw
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.060]  in Chicago, what was it, in Illinois, they tried passing some legislation I saw on your
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:44.840]  website on the Prison Planet website.
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:45.840]  Yes, we shot it down.
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:47.160]  You're following that?
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:48.160]  Yes.
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:53.240]  And they didn't pass it. I think what they're going to do is they'll come up with some other
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:59.580]  kind of restriction, and it'll only go so far. They'll keep playing out this political
[02:25:59.580 --> 02:26:04.100]  capital for as much as they can get from it. But in the end, I don't think they're going
[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:09.200]  to succeed. There will be more restrictions guaranteed.
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:15.220]  And again, the stupidity, for example, there was just a guy in Switzerland that killed
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:20.740]  three people or four people the other day. Everybody in Switzerland is allowed to have
[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:25.720]  a gun, they all have guns. They're not killing each other. This has nothing to do with having
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:32.580]  the gun. It has to do with a society that's out of control, a society that's over medicated.
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:37.360]  And again, let's stay on that issue for just a moment. Now, you've been following this
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:43.120]  closer than anybody that I know. And you're looking at every piece of information coming
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:51.760]  out. What drugs was this kid on? Why do we have to hear from some police superintendent
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:58.520]  or inspector whoever say, we have the information, but we're keeping it private because we don't
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:26:59.800]  want you to know anything.
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:05.700]  I mean, who can make this? What's wrong? Why don't we know? Why aren't the books open?
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:14.280]  Why can't we say what drug tipped this kid out of his mind? Hey, all of those wankers
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:20.980]  out there that have been screaming about marijuana over all the years and how it could become
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:25.520]  a gateway drug and lead to worse things.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:32.260]  Why aren't you screaming out against all of these psychotropic drugs that they're pumping
[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:39.840]  into all of these kids? And now it's getting even worse. Here's what's going on. A kid
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:47.000]  grows up in a family of which there are tens of millions in this country. His mother's
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:56.120]  whacked out on meth. He doesn't know who his father is. He's living in this drama, this
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:03.160]  situation that's hell every day. He goes to school, oh, he becomes unruly.
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:07.880]  So what do they do? Well, there are no social programs anymore. When I was a kid, there
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:16.460]  was CYOs, there were PALS, police athletic leagues, there were YMCAs. The kids had a
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:21.960]  place to go. If things are uneasy, you had a little support, the churches, whatever.
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:26.440]  Now you're on your own. You know what they're doing to these kids? They're feeding them
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:35.160]  drugs to calm them down. That's right. Millions and millions of kids getting drugged up by
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:39.580]  big pharma, their minds are being blown.
[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:46.040]  So for this, they say we need gun control. And as I said, if we're going to have gun
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:56.760]  control, start with Obama, start with Bush, start with Clinton. Bombs away over everybody,
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:29:02.480]  kill millions. But take the guns away from people because they could become dangerous.
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:08.480]  But wait a minute, Gerald. Obama fake cried and couldn't squeeze tears out and now has
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:14.520]  released another fake photo of him sad over the dead children. Just like the fake Situation
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:21.640]  Room photo, they had to admit, I mean, the milking of this, he isn't crying over the
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:25.240]  hundreds of dead Mexican kids from Fast and Furious, is he?
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:33.120]  Now how about the million people the United States killed in Iraq? How about the ongoing
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:40.520]  slaughter in Afghanistan? Just yesterday, another predator drone killed the military.
[02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:43.000]  There's eight other people that happened to be around them.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.120]  I bet Obama cried over that. He signed the death order. We'll be right back with Gerald
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:50.400]  Cilenti.
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:30:01.240]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:06.400]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:12.000]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.480]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:12.860]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:24.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Here's some of the top stories at Infowars.com. Police
[02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:32.820]  kicked out of Bellaville Denny's. Am I pronouncing that right? For being armed. CBS News. I saw
[02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:38.300]  that this morning. It just blew me away. And the newscast acts like it's kind of reasonable.
[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:45.000]  So the anti-gunners, the rank and file are so scared of guns that now they're even scared
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:52.320]  with police with guns. Actually, we have that clip of the DEA guy shooting himself. Maybe
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:56.300]  we should play that brief clip for Gerald here if we can find it.
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:34:00.060]  But the issue here is if you're gonna trust police with guns, you gotta trust firefighters
[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:03.460]  with guns. I think they should have them as backup when they get shot at sometimes during
[02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:07.240]  riots. You should trust the citizens with guns. You should have the pilots with guns.
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:14.060]  The answer is armed good people, okay? And that's been known throughout history. And
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:18.780]  the areas that have the highest crime are the areas where they've taken the guns. But
[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:24.420]  here it is, police kicked out of Denny's for being armed. The police chief, Bill Clay,
[02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:30.520]  and by the way, we have a police chief coming on the Sunday show who's calling for a Second
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:31.520]  Amendment zone.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:34.620]  He says he's gonna nullify all the federal laws. People say, well, you can't do that.
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:41.580]  Really? You've got 800 plus cities that nullify the illegal alien laws that are actually constitutional.
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:47.660]  How about we nullify laws that are unconstitutional? The new orders come after a New Year's Day
[02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:51.580]  clash between five detectives and one Denny's manager.
[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:55.440]  The department says the detectives were out of uniform but were wearing their badges when
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:00.460]  manager David Rice asked them to either leave or put their guns in the vehicle. And of course,
[02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:04.600]  they argued with them but left. Rice told detectives that one of their weapons, specifically
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:09.180]  a female detective's gun, was making another diner feel uncomfortable.
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:13.380]  As the officers were leaving without their food, General Manager Michael Van walked up
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:16.860]  and corrected the manager and said it was fine for them to stay. But officers said it
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:20.820]  would be too awkward. And I found a file, this must be another article. I had another
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:23.680]  one here in my stack where the police chief called it crazy politics.
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:30.460]  And I wanted his full quote. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, I had a carpet cleaner
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:34.460]  guy. I've told this story 100 times. I'm not gonna keep Gerald on holding longer, but I
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:41.140]  don't want his take on this. I had the carpet cleaner there and my girlfriend lived with
[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:42.140]  me.
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:45.180]  We got married. It's my wife, very, very evil, but we were about to get married. She just
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:51.540]  moved in. And we're getting a house, a little house, carpet cleaned, and my studio, and
[02:35:51.540 --> 02:35:58.740]  I didn't have any kids yet. There was a shotgun up in a 243 and some stuff. And the guy said,
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:35:59.740]  I can't clean in there.
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:04.060]  Well, and the assistant was from Texas. He goes, no, man, guns are legal here. The guy
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:07.420]  goes, no, no, and he leaves. And I had to call him and go, well, we've stopped him calling
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:11.340]  the police, but yes, he's not comfortable. We'll send another crew. And I'm like, you
[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:13.340]  know what, just forget it.
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:19.020]  But this is the attitude where these people think guns come out at night and kill people.
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:23.620]  And here's another headline, Boston mayor, vice president, guaranteed gun control before
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:28.300]  Sandy Hook shooting. Leading gun control advocate, we'll get it done by the end of January. I
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:31.700]  told you, they plan with even an executive order.
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:35.840]  The head of Gunners of America says they may actually try it. Gerald Cilente, what is your
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:41.300]  take on the citizens so scared now that they call the police when they see a gun in your
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:47.320]  gun rack or they see a gun in your gun case? Or police now are having people freak out
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:49.340]  when they've got guns.
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:54.020]  Well it's fear and hysteria. Look what happened down in Maryland the other day. The little
[02:36:54.020 --> 02:37:00.780]  kid six years old went pow, pow, pow, and they threw him out of school. I said, good
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:05.660]  thing the kid didn't go bang, bang, bang. They would have the SWAT teams in there shooting
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:06.660]  him.
[02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:12.260]  Now the country's lost its mind. I mean, look at every level it's breaking down. This whole
[02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:17.300]  thing of it's fear and hysteria. Look what they did with the fiscal cliff. Pick the cat
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:22.420]  category. How they had the people freaked out since election day. I mean, it's still
[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:30.580]  going on. So you have a society that's lost its dignity, its respect, its courage, its
[02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:36.500]  passion, and they're living unfulfilled lives.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:41.820]  So when you live these unfulfilled lives and have nothing going for you, you start making
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:50.460]  life miserable for other people around you. And again, this gun issue to me is more of
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:58.660]  a prescription drug issue and people refuse to hold onto it and they keep avoiding the
[02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:07.080]  fact. And the fact is that all of these drugs make a lot of people that are already over
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:13.460]  the edge, pushing them even further. And it's well documented and well known.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:17.740]  Gerald, I wanna get into the economy and some issues and then take some wildcard phone calls
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:24.980]  questions for you here. But look, in the 1980 study of Prozac, they admitted a 14 or was
[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:32.020]  it 15 time increase in suicide, that's mainstream news. A decade ago, we finally forced all
[02:38:32.020 --> 02:38:38.980]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs or SRIs to put in there that it causes mania,
[02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:44.900]  schizophrenia, mass murder, violence, suicide, I mean, it's all in these drugs insert.
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:47.860]  And in almost every shooting, they try to suppress it, but it always comes out later
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:51.220]  they were on it. Like this time that it was under psychiatric care, give me a break, he's
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:54.900]  on it. It says when you have Asperger's, they try to put you on. Prozac is actually the
[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:57.380]  one they recommend, one of the oldest.
[02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:03.020]  So we know these pills do it. And then we always wonder, it's always a goth, devil worshipper
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:08.660]  obsessed with shoot them up video games, who is literally taking hallucinogenic drugs who
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:16.100]  does this. It's open and shut, it's the drugs. Why do I have to lose my guns because mommy
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:20.660]  likes to jack her kid up on a bunch of drugs instead of giving them a spanking or making
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:21.660]  them carry out the trash?
[02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:24.700]  I mean, why can't we have discipline for these kids?
[02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:31.380]  Again, you nailed it. That's what I'm saying. So the discussion starts to lose its focus
[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:36.180]  because it keeps going into all these different areas. Again, for me, the two areas are very
[02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:45.780]  simple. One is drugs and the other is a culture of cruelty. We have presidents that get out
[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:56.820]  there and brag how they kill people. Hey, Obama got Osama. Hey, wasn't that great?
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:40:04.380]  Hillary bragged about Gaddafi. She goes, I came, I saw, he died.
[02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:14.020]  Yeah, so it's a culture of violence and it's a culture of prescription drug addicted society.
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:17.580]  Where do you predict it's going to go? And then let's shift into your latest trends and
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:21.100]  what's really front and center in the new Trends Journal. Everybody's got to go to the
[02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:27.340]  site with all the videos and the material, trendsresearch.com. I stop there daily, trendsresearch.com.
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:32.760]  People can go there and subscribe and support what Gerald's doing, but really get the magazine,
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:34.980]  the journals, you can then give it to others.
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:37.780]  This is the type of thing you want to leave at the dental office. This is the type of
[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:42.340]  thing you want to pay forward. Again, Trends Journal, ladies and gentlemen, available at
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:47.700]  trendsresearch.com or trendsjournal.com. What else do you see on the radar? What else is
[02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:48.940]  front and center?
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:55.740]  Our front and center war, and they're leading us to it. Remember, you've heard me say this
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:41:03.980]  before, we're watching a parallel universe happen. The crash of 1929, the Great Depression,
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:11.100]  currency wars, trade wars, world war, the panic of 08, the Great Depression. There's
[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:16.300]  a depression going on in a lot of countries worldwide, including here. If you're out of
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:20.540]  work and you're starving and things are terrible, it's a depression and there are a lot of people
[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:29.980]  in it. Currency wars. Last year we heard Guido Montega and this year from Brazil saying there's
[02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:35.920]  a currency war. We just heard Mervyn King, the outgoing head of the Bank of England in
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:42.740]  New York. There's a currency war going on. Now we have a new prime minister of Japan,
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:48.380]  Abe. There's a currency war. What's the first thing he did when he got elected? He told
[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:53.140]  the Bank of Japan, do what they're doing in the United States. Do what they're doing in
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:57.940]  Europe. Do what they're doing in China. Do what they're doing all over the world. Print
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:42:07.460]  more money. Devalue the currency because there's a war on and the war is for exports. If your
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:14.120]  currency is too strong, your manufacturers can't push product out of the country. So
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:23.640]  Japan do like they've done in the USA. Devalue the currency so that their exporters could
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:34.300]  export more. Stage next trade wars. They're heating up and world war and anybody out there
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:41.840]  that doesn't believe that the United States currency has been devalued. Well, take a look
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:48.660]  at gold prices from where they are now and where they were 10 years ago. So what is going
[02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:57.900]  on for the our forecast is economics more of the same, but worse. They're going to continue
[02:42:57.900 --> 02:43:04.180]  to print money. That's the only way that they're keeping this going. And by doing so, keeping
[02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:10.240]  interest rates at or near zero, which they are coming out of the Fed. So the banks are
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:16.040]  getting all the dough that they can. And then you put the other piece on top, low interest
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:21.640]  rates. Okay. The housing market's in its worst decline since the Great Depression. What's
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:27.460]  holding it up? Oh, you can get, you know, you can get a loan now for what on residential
[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:36.540]  2.77%. So now we can see how they key. Oh, and by the way, on that new fiscal cliff deal,
[02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:44.380]  they extended the mortgage tax deductions. So that is a $600 billion cost that helps
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:48.860]  the mortgage investment. That's right. They didn't do that to help mom and pop. They did
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:53.800]  that to help the banksters again who loan this out of nothing. And what's amazing is
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:44:00.640]  Obama saying no new payroll taxes. He swore it, but 77% of American workers got that tax
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:06.280]  increase and he raised a bunch of other taxes. That's exactly right. So this keeping this
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:12.520]  mortgage deduction in there, that helps the mortgage business. That's all that was for.
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:17.440]  So and it's guaranteed. I mean, who makes this thing up? I'll be a bank. I'll loan you
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:25.000]  money to buy a house. You default on the loan. Okay, don't worry about the FHA, Freddie Mac
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.520]  and Fannie Mae. We'll cover the bet that the bank made that made a bad bet and they get
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:37.640]  to take your house and then resell it. Anyway, moving back to the war because it's all connected.
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:44.920]  When all else fails, they take you to war and they're going to take us to war, I believe,
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:52.920]  with Syria and that is the gateway to go into Iran. So when I talk about the first great
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:45:01.640]  war, do the math. There's a war in Libya. There's a war in Syria. There's a war that's
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:08.320]  heating up again, a revolution in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood took over, which by the
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:15.640]  way, had nothing, nothing to do with the so-called Arab Spring. They were not on the streets.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:21.040]  Same thing in Tunisia. After they overthrew that government, whoop, here's the Muslim
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:27.400]  Brotherhood. Oh, and by the way, take over, take a trip over to Yemen. Not far away. A
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:33.200]  civil war going on there. Corrupt government that we, the American taxpayer, are supporting
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:41.280]  and President Obama sending in predator drones. Check out Bahrain, not too far. A civil war
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:47.480]  going on, but don't say anything bad about Bahrain because the United States has the
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:48.480]  fifth fleet there.
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:55.920]  Hey, it came out that Bahrain actually pays money and others to CNN for fake reports.
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:03.560]  The whistle got blew by Amber Lyon, who's won three Emmys for her news reporting, and
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:08.360]  it never even became a news issue. That CNN isn't just connected to the Pentagon, and
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:14.560]  PsyOps just came out 12 years ago. They're actually foreign funded.
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:22.360]  Of course they are. Look what's going on what just happened with Al Gore, just selling his
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:30.440]  current TV. Who did he sell it to? Al Jazeera. Who owns Al Jazeera? Hey, it couldn't be to
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.800]  cut a government, could it?
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:39.040]  Well, and again, what do you make of all these foreign TV stations domestically saying America
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:42.240]  needs to turn its guns in? Why are they all ganging up on us?
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:46.160]  Well, because they're controlling the people and they don't want it. They don't want the
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:47.960]  people to have any freedom.
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:50.840]  So all these slimy governments are in it together, basically.
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:56.520]  Well, again, going back to Qatar, these are the people that started, and by the way, there's
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:07.600]  a link that subscribers get. I was on China Today with the Al Jazeera Washington bureau
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:14.680]  chief prior to the Libyan war. You got to check this out. We'll put the link up there
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:20.680]  for everybody. We'll put it on YouTube on the Gerald Cilenti or Trends Journal channels.
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:26.880]  And this is prior to the war. You want to see this easy talking guy lose it at the end.
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:34.760]  It's a comic book. What happened was that the Arab Little League, all of these kings,
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:42.360]  emirs, dictators by any other name, are the ones that are destabilizing the area and sending
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:52.000]  all of the arms in that are supporting these Islamist Al Qaeda wackos that the United States,
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:57.480]  of course, began supporting under Jimmy Carter called the Mujahideen that's overthrowing
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:47:59.160]  these governments.
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:08.080]  So now going back to Al Gore, he just scored a hundred million bucks because his worthless
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:16.960]  current TV didn't have anybody watching it when they had as low as 40,000 people tuning
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:17.960]  in.
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:22.160]  By the way, that's a political payoff, having foreign governments later pay you for something
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.520]  that's not really worth it. That's the oldest trick in the book. I mean, this is just, look
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:31.760]  at Congress saying they're allowed to insider trade and then passing a law that actually
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:36.680]  lets them insider trade, claiming the law outlaws them insider trading.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:39.860]  I mean, it is just unbelievable how much trouble we're in.
[02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:46.280]  But it's perfect for a piece of crap like Al Gore. He just sold us out and brought Al
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:55.760]  Jazeera in to do propaganda for us. This is the same slimeball that sold out America and
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.520]  sent out all our jobs overseas with NAFTA.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:07.040]  And he's got the young turds on there that show young Turks calling to take our guns.
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:11.760]  It's all just a bunch of foreign traders. I mean, how much will we put up with?
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:19.600]  He traded the country out on that debate with Ross Perot back in the early 90s. And people
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:28.560]  don't understand that Ronald Reagan couldn't push NAFTA through because the Democrats were
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:37.160]  against it. They knew that labor would lose all its jobs. George Bush Sr. couldn't push
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:43.560]  NAFTA through because the Democrats knew that it would suck out all our jobs.
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:48.440]  But as long as Al Gore and Clinton did it, it's cute. Democrats love getting destroyed
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:52.880]  as long as they feel like they're winning and their party's in. They love it.
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:50:00.040]  As long as one of them destroys them, Clinton pulled off what the other ones couldn't. So
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:06.200]  Al Gore is the perfect metaphor for selling out the country, whether it's selling out
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:14.680]  our freedom to hear great programming and not be propagandized by the Qatar government
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:17.320]  that's starting wars throughout the Middle East.
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:20.720]  And that's their perfect cut out. And of course, they're connected to British intelligence.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:25.640]  I mean, I think it's time to really look at these foreign-run TV stations domestically
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:28.960]  because they're running around trying to overthrow our republic. I mean, what do you call that
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:33.760]  when foreign governments come in? Cuz Al Jazeera says turn our guns in. I say Al Jazeera needs
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:35.880]  to get out of our country.
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:42.520]  And that's what I'm saying, that Al Gore is the same guy that sold out the country, that
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:50.080]  took our jobs overseas, and now he's grabbing some more dough. So going back to the wars-
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.400]  I'll tell you what, we gotta go to break. We'll come right back and I promise go to
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:57.360]  some calls here. General Salente is our guest. It's just unbelievable. I hadn't even gotten
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:02.680]  to the Al Gore Man Bear Pignage. What a piece of trash.
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:07.120]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:12.040]  storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:17.160]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:22.060]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
[02:51:22.060 --> 02:51:26.400]  more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:30.760]  supply from E Foods Direct. I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:36.080]  for food. I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:39.720]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:44.400]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:50.880]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:05.640]  Hi, my name is Annette, and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:09.880]  loss of beer hot flashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:14.800]  to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:19.800]  and depleted. After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes, and I'm
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:24.880]  sleeping normally again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product.
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:28.760]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10%
[02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:34.460]  of its protein content as glutathione. But due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:38.800]  your glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:43.040]  restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:47.640]  then as a result, your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:55.920]  you might have. To order One World Whey, call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. Or visit

[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:06.920]  All right, we're going to jam in a few phone calls in this next segment and the next, and
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:10.000]  I'm going into overdrive in the next hour to play some special reports and take more
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:16.300]  calls. Gerald Cilente is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, if you just tuned in. I said I would
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:21.600]  announce two big contests today, but I'm going to shoot a video that'll air on the nightly
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:26.200]  news tonight where I break down the new contest we're going to have.
[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:31.640]  We're going to have a $5,000 contest. We got two $1,000 contests I'm about to pay out on
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:37.040]  next week. We've had like over 20 contests now over the years. We're going to have one
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:42.180]  that's $5,000 that I'll be announcing and another that's $100,000. And the reason I'm
[02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:47.280]  doing this is to get the word out and it will reach tens upon tens of millions of people
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:48.440]  with the message of liberty.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:55.500]  Wait till you hear about these contests. It's going to be big. But I've got to codify my
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:55:00.080]  thoughts. I haven't written up the rules yet, so I'll announce it tonight in a special video
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:09.480]  the next week officially. Kick it off because we've got to turn loose the power of the people.
[02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:14.960]  Continuing here, this is everything we're talking about. Globalism is foreign financial
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:20.520]  interests that are authoritarian coming in and buying off your government and then having
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:26.880]  the government give the tax money and no bid contracts to them. And then they want to secure
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:27.880]  that.
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:32.480]  So now they want our guns too and our freedom. It's just mafia. It's organized crime. That's
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:39.640]  what the new world order is. And that's what we've become. And now we are such a joke that
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:44.840]  all these foreign governments are here propagandizing us and paying for CNN and paying for what's
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:51.260]  on current TV and lecturing us on all these channels that we need to give our guns up.
[02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:56.520]  And it's enough, okay? It's enough. Gerald, have they miscalculated here? Or will America
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:55:58.880]  just put up with anything?
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:05.720]  Well, what I'd like to do is come back at another time shortly and go over our top trends
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:14.540]  for 2013. And one of them is the Great Awakening. There was before this revolution in this country,
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:21.420]  there was an awakening. And part of the Great Awakening was that people woke up to the idea
[02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:29.440]  that they should not bow to nobility, that they weren't better than the rest of the commoners.
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:36.320]  It became also something where people realized that their salvation was dependent upon their
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:43.920]  actions on how they behaved, what they did, and how they would bring themselves up to
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:49.000]  the highest level to be the best human beings they could be. A lot of, by the way, Thomas
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:54.940]  Paine's work is written in the context of the Great Awakening. And there was a religious
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:57:00.720]  element to it as well. But forgetting the religious element, I believe we're going to
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:05.000]  answer your question. We're going to have another Great Awakening. The nobility had
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:10.100]  become this red carpet crowd. They never show up without a red carpet. Do you know how sick
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:17.280]  and tired I am of watching Hillary Clinton or somebody, the president, waving from their
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:18.280]  jumbo jets?
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:26.680]  Who are they waving to? A bunch of prostitutes down below? A bunch of flaky, flunky aides?
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:28.120]  But yet you see these pictures.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:32.840]  No, they're behaving like royalty. They're saying, I'm God, you're nothing. And by the
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:36.240]  way, I'm gonna take your guns. And by the way, I'm gonna take 85 million a month and
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:40.040]  put it in my pocket. And if you don't like it, a SWAT team's gonna drop by.
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:48.720]  Exactly, so now the people are going to start rebelling against the royalty. All of the
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:58.200]  charade is down. How could any self-respecting human being listen to a McConnell or a Reid
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:06.880]  or a Pelosi or a Bonner or an Obama or a Laurel and Hardy? That's all it is and everyone knows
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:12.960]  it. The charade is coming very clear to many.
[02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:20.240]  And then when you go overseas, it's no different. The Great Awakening is beginning to happen.
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:28.800]  You have a guy like this Roy over there in Spain or Merkel or three card Monty who just
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:35.280]  stepped down in Italy. And one after another, when do these people, Hollande or Cameron-
[02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:43.040]  Hold on Gerald, stay there, we're gonna take a couple of calls.
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:50.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:52.600]  Yeah.
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:53.600]  That's kind of a weekend.
[02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:58.360]  Two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm. The
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:02.520]  most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[02:59:02.520 --> 02:59:07.400]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election. This
[02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:12.360]  perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
[02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:16.800]  more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own
[02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:21.240]  supply from E Foods Direct. I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom
[02:59:21.240 --> 02:59:26.640]  for food. I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[02:59:26.640 --> 02:59:30.680]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with
[02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:35.920]  a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50. Remember, I can warn you, but I
[02:59:35.920 --> 02:59:43.200]  can't feed you. Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex. Would you rather prepare
[02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:49.680]  six months too early or one day too late? 409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash
[02:59:49.680 --> 02:59:52.400]  Alex.
[02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:59.680]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:10.720]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:17.000]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:26.240]  All right, let's jam in a few quick calls for Gerald Cilente. I want to invite him back
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:31.680]  because I want to get his trends for the new year next week if he wants. So the week after
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:36.240]  that, whenever Gerald wants, he's on. I always love listening to him, so do our listeners.
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:40.500]  Great information, really points out the hypocrisy and accurately predicts what's going to come
[03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:46.040]  in the future. And I agree with him. People finding their dignity. Everything the globalists
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:52.680]  do is about dominating us, breaking our will like a pimp does to a woman he's drug off
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:59.000]  into slavery. And we have got to stop letting government dominate us. It's doing it everywhere
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.720]  because it knows what it's doing.
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:08.680]  Let's go to George in Connecticut. No, no, no. George is at first. John in Wyoming on
[03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:12.320]  Feinstein listening on WWCR. Go ahead, John.
[03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:16.160]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you for having your great guest Gerald Cilente on today.
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:17.160]  You bet.
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:22.240]  I had something happen yesterday that both of you will enjoy. I called Dianne Feinstein's
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:27.280]  office in Washington, D.C., and one of her young male staffers answered the phone. I
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:33.760]  said, as per the gun control measure Ms. Feinstein is introducing today, I said, please give
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:41.040]  her my congratulations. I had no idea she was a supporter of the Fuhrer. I said, Adolf
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:47.000]  Hitler did the same thing to his people in 1934, and then we saw what he did to his people
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:52.400]  after he disarmed them. So I just wanted to give her a very hearty congratulations for
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:02:02.000]  following her guide, the Fuhrer. And I said, by the way, if you think that anyone is going
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:09.200]  to be obeying your gun control edicts, ask her how many murderers, rapists, armed robbers,
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:14.380]  drug dealers or gang bangers are going to turn in their firearms. I said the answer
[03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:21.160]  is like her credibility. Zero. I said, we saw how well the alcohol prohibition worked.
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:26.880]  We saw how well the drug prohibition has worked. And now you expect different results with
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:30.440]  the gun prohibition. I said criminals don't obey the law.
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:33.880]  And what did the creature on the other end of the line say?
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:38.120]  He started hollering, what zip code are you calling in from? I said, never mind that.
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:43.360]  I said, I'm not a constituent. But since she introduced this legislation, I thought I would
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.800]  call up- Yeah, they'll also imply that if you're not
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:50.640]  in their state, she's trying to take our rights nationwide. Shut up, Feinstein, you represent
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.920]  everybody. That's the stuff they pull as well. You need to call her and let her know. Thanks
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:59.040]  for waking everybody up, you pig witch. I'm sorry, go ahead, Gerald.
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:05.280]  Bravo, that was perfect. What he said was perfect. Not a word minced and not a word
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:11.040]  wasted. And by the way, on the Feinstein issue, I was just talking about Al Gore before and
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:17.180]  the deal that they made to get their station on all their worthless current TV on all these
[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:21.480]  cable companies that would never normally carry it, but because of his connections.
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:26.880]  Do you know what are the investors in there? Dianne Feinstein's husband.
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:31.440]  Isn't that a coincidence? Who gets banker bailout money and all the insider trading
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:36.840]  stuff that mommy's involved in. But she got the Senate Ethics Committee to tell her it
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:42.400]  was okay. Said the news said, she's allowed the insider trade, but you go to jail if you
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:46.120]  do, but she's better than us. She walks on red carpets.
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:51.040]  Exactly, and again, that goes back to the Great Awakening. But that caller, that was
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:55.720]  perfect what he said because it covered all the points perfectly. Yeah, like you said,
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:01.200]  the gangbangers, all these, the rapists, the robbers, they're gonna give up their guns.
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.600]  Hey, Gerald, I wanna tell people right now, cuz you've gotta leave us, I know. You just
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:09.280]  offered to come on and break down your trends that we don't have time to get to. Is your
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:10.280]  book there?
[03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:13.640]  Can I tell folks now when you're gonna be on for an hour next week?
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:19.400]  I don't know the exact date, but we'll get it to you later on today.
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:22.280]  Okay, but just sometime next week you will grace us with your problems.
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:25.080]  I promise sometime next week we will make the time to be on.
[03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:29.080]  If I have a red carpet for you. Then it could be tomorrow.
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:33.720]  No, listen, I was joking. I'm just having bling and like red carpets, maybe all the-
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:39.280]  Yeah, no, I want a red carpet when I show up. No, and it's true because every time you
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:44.320]  see these dictators, we'll call them presidents or prime ministers, they always have some
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:48.120]  flunky over there dressed up in a costume.
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:53.440]  And they're all lined up and they're saluting. Who made this crap up? Who's paying for this?
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:54.920]  Get these guys to work.
[03:04:54.920 --> 03:04:58.920]  They're very embarrassing. Gerald, thank you so much. More calls and news, special reports
[03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:00.920]  coming up. There goes Gerald Cilente.
[03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:07.960]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:13.040]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:20.000]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  your help.
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:26.240]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:32.800]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:38.400]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:41.960]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:49.400]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:49.400 --> 03:05:58.280]  and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus
[03:05:58.280 --> 03:06:01.520]  the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.520 --> 03:06:06.240]  Who wants to be disease free, full of energy and vibrant health? Two reasons you may feel
[03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:10.880]  constantly tired and run down could be that your body's acid level is high and your pH
[03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:16.640]  level is low. How does acid enter your body? A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress,
[03:06:16.640 --> 03:06:21.480]  and cell phones. Plus, your own body produces acid on a regular basis. Alkavision plasma

[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:27.960]  ingredient in crushed garlic. Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial,
[03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:34.080]  fungal, and viral infections. One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.

[03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:07.720]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:08:07.720 --> 03:08:20.280]  If you go to infoawars.com or prisonplanet.com, we have different articles up there with the
[03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:25.520]  video in it titled, Demand a Real Plan, documenting that government has been the biggest murderer
[03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:30.440]  in history in the last century, killed over 290 million. I kept saying 260 million. My
[03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:36.440]  memory failed. It was 290 plus million from the university studies that we show in the
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:41.360]  Demand a Real Plan five-minute breakdown.
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:45.820]  And then under the YouTube video, we have links to the university studies and also comparable
[03:08:45.820 --> 03:08:51.040]  information compiled by Jews, the preservation of firearms ownership. And again, I wanna
[03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:58.800]  thank you for joining us. We are live. It is the fourth day of January 2013. 2013, man,
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:00.760]  wow, here we are.
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:04.880]  Time is a flying. How fast will this year go by? Now, I went into overdrive so we can
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:09.720]  take some more of your phone calls and get some of these special reports. Because these
[03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:14.560]  are the type of reports that are being filed daily on the nightly news, 7 o'clock central.
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:18.960]  By the way, you get 11 memberships for 5.95 a month. So you can go create one membership
[03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:24.400]  username passcode, share it with 10 more people who can simultaneously use it.
[03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:30.480]  Social films, the nightly news, so much more, prisonplanet.tv and the tiny bit of money
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:35.840]  we make helps fund this operation. So if you're not a member, join us with Operation Awaken
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:41.440]  the Sleeping Giant. And again, I'm gonna launch Operation Paul Revere. I'm gonna shoot a video
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:45.400]  about it today that'll be on the nightly news and we'll have official rules next week.
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:50.940]  This is so much money, $100,000 in the prize that I'm just gonna have a lawyer double check
[03:09:50.940 --> 03:09:54.360]  it cuz I wanna be sure people can be litigious out there. We always pay out on our products.
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:58.240]  But I wanna make sure people understand that you're gonna have to officially enter with
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:02.600]  us and officially have a contest form you sign up with.
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:08.400]  This isn't gonna be just all over the map. $100,000 prize and then the chance to have
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:15.540]  us put out your next film with a, I gotta look at the budget, but we're looking at like
[03:10:15.540 --> 03:10:20.040]  a half million dollars for production and promotion. And I know how to put films in
[03:10:20.040 --> 03:10:23.660]  theaters. I've never done it. I'm just too busy to make films. I am planning to make
[03:10:23.660 --> 03:10:24.660]  one this year.
[03:10:24.660 --> 03:10:27.800]  We're gonna try to put it in some theaters, but that takes a lot of work for anybody.
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:32.360]  You gotta go on tour, you gotta show it, you gotta do it. So we're here to, the contest
[03:10:32.360 --> 03:10:39.680]  is 100,000 for a film you make, then you just get $100,000. And then we'll also, it fits
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:44.080]  all the criteria, put it out and sell it. But I've gotta develop all those final parts
[03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:45.120]  of the plan.
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:50.080]  But then you get in the running from the top people in the contest to, we're probably gonna
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:53.760]  have three or four different people at the top and come in and make a bunch of films
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:57.560]  and try to finance them. That's why it's important to buy the books, the videos, the propure
[03:10:57.560 --> 03:11:02.200]  water filters, the support our sponsors, to become prisonplanet.tv members.
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:07.040]  Cuz we take that money and put it back into getting the word out. I mean, I'm up here
[03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:11.440]  saying I'm not turning my guns in no matter what. I mean, I'm willing to have the globalists
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:16.600]  come after me and kill me, put me in prison for this, folks. So I mean, I'm doing whatever
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:20.160]  I think will devastate the enemy. I mean, we are here to dominate the globalists.
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:25.400]  We're not here for status. We're not here for power trips. We're not here for all the
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:31.360]  normal worldly stuff. We are here to savagely defend liberty with the First Amendment, savagely
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:36.600]  and viciously with no apologies, and with any means legally necessary ahead of civil
[03:11:36.600 --> 03:11:42.160]  war. We're trying to stop that. And so we wanna turn your creative power loose. Look
[03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:47.520]  at how we did a contest for reporters, 5,000 for a female, 5,000 for a male.
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:50.840]  Hired three or four other reporters that were in the running. Got them here, the great job
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:56.880]  they're doing. Well, the next contest is 100,000, okay? All right, I'm already starting to get
[03:11:56.880 --> 03:12:01.440]  into this. And again, I'm just so busy up here late every night doing news reports and
[03:12:01.440 --> 03:12:04.800]  stuff. I haven't codified the whole rules yet, but I've thought it out.
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:09.560]  And so I'll make a video about the generalities and then I'll absolutely get the rules out
[03:12:09.560 --> 03:12:13.720]  by like next Wednesday. We worked over the holidays too. We were here New Year's, day
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:19.200]  before New Year's, all that, day after Christmas, whatever. We're not playing games, okay? And
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:22.360]  because we understand this is real and the prize we want's liberty.
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:26.880]  Our blood, our name, our treasure, it's all on the line, everything. Now I wanna go to
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:32.200]  David Knight's report. You just heard Gerald Cilente talking about how this great turning
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:38.380]  is coming, this great awakening historically in a cycle. And it's not just one theory that
[03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:39.960]  proves this, there's actually dozens.
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:46.640]  But one book that came out in the 80s breaks down the fourth turning. And he's got a clip
[03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:51.460]  from the 90s where they predict the implosion of the market, how it would happen, what would
[03:12:51.460 --> 03:12:55.920]  come out of it, the tyranny, the awakening, the cycles. And there's different ways to
[03:12:55.920 --> 03:12:58.760]  interpret the cycles, but they're definitely there.
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:13:02.120]  And the globalists know their cycles. Brzezinski writes about it. So we're gonna play this
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:04.680]  then go to your calls. We're going to the bottom of the hour here at least that long
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:08.560]  in overdrive and then back into retransmission at the bottom of the hour when Larry Pratt
[03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:11.080]  joined us, very important intel.
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:15.760]  Let's go to David Knight, our reporter and researcher's report, the fourth turning. Full
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:20.320]  video for radio listeners posted at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:24.680]  I'm David Knight with the Nightly News. Now this quote was written nine years before the
[03:13:24.680 --> 03:13:31.160]  financial crisis of 2008. But it came from a book that was written in 1990, had the same
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:36.580]  ideas from the same authors, 18 years before the financial crisis. The fourth turning is
[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:41.520]  due to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the 00 decade. About the year
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:46.720]  2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a crisis mood. Remnants of the old social order will
[03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:51.000]  disintegrate. Political and economic trust will implode. Real hardship will beset the
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:57.380]  land with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation and empire.
[03:13:57.380 --> 03:14:03.520]  The very survival of the nation will feel at stake. Sometime before the year 2025, America
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:07.560]  will pass through a great gate in history commensurate with the American Revolution,
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:12.960]  Civil War and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II. The basis of
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:16.760]  this prediction is a cyclical view of history that Strauss and Howe discovered by going
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:21.860]  back through American and English history back to the mid 1400s. And they discovered
[03:14:21.860 --> 03:14:26.960]  that just as we have seasons of weather, we have seasons of society. And just as we don't
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:30.420]  know the exact date that winter is going to come, or whether it's going to be a harsh
[03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:35.160]  or mild winter, we do know that it's going to follow fall. And we do know the approximate
[03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:39.840]  time that it's going to come. We take a close look at the rhythms of American history. And
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:45.280]  in our book, we make the following big prediction that beginning about 10 years from now, America
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:52.280]  is due to enter a era of crisis, an era of political and social upheaval that will last
[03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:59.520]  around 20 years or so until the late 2020s. We call this era of fourth turning, and we
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:03.160]  think it's going to be a big threshold for the history of our nation. It's going to be
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:07.800]  something on par with World War II and the Great Depression are going back the length
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:11.920]  of a human lifespan before then the Civil War, the going back the length of another
[03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:19.280]  human lifespan, the American Revolution, it could be a time of tragedy or a time of great
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:25.160]  opportunity. What they found was that society will go through four phases of high, awakening,
[03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:31.360]  unraveling and crisis. Humans go through four phases of life, childhood, young adult, midlife
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:35.960]  and elderhood. And they noticed generations where people have shared experiences and attitudes
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:41.060]  are spaced about 20 years apart. And generations are shaped by where their childhood falls
[03:15:41.060 --> 03:15:45.000]  within the phases of society. Now this got my attention because I noticed that there
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:49.700]  was a repeating pattern of about 72 years between significant dates in American history
[03:15:49.700 --> 03:15:54.400]  as well as some other histories. For example, if you go from the time the US Constitution
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:16:00.000]  was written in 1789 to the beginning of the Civil War, 1861, that's 72 years. Another
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:05.160]  72 years takes us to 1933, the beginning of the New Deal, another major transformation
[03:16:05.160 --> 03:16:11.000]  of American society. If you go another 72 years, that took us to about 2005, exactly
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:15.320]  where Strauss and Howe had predicted a major crisis and change would occur. And in addition,
[03:16:15.320 --> 03:16:22.120]  if you look at the Russian Revolution, from 1917 to 1989 was about 72 years. So it seemed
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:28.460]  to fit with a life cycle of humans. In a cycle, four generations, 20 years apart, are shaped
[03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:32.500]  by when their childhood falls within that cycle. And the names they use in their book,
[03:16:32.500 --> 03:16:36.700]  The Fourth Turning, come from the biblical account of Exodus. For example, we have one
[03:16:36.700 --> 03:16:41.920]  generation as a prophet generation. Now think of Moses calling a generation to change, the
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:47.520]  next generation, the nomad generation, wandering in the wilderness, a period of crisis and
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:52.080]  restlessness. The following generation would be a hero generation. Think of the Joshua
[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:57.560]  generation taking a promised land. That often involves a major war. And then finally, an
[03:16:57.560 --> 03:17:02.600]  artist generation, the generation that builds a new society. Well, where does Strauss and
[03:17:02.600 --> 03:17:07.120]  Howe think that we are in this cycle? The researchers see the millennial generation,
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:13.360]  those born between 1982 to 2004, as the hero generation. And they see our society entering
[03:17:13.360 --> 03:17:18.420]  a fourth turning, a crisis period where society will be fundamentally transformed as it was
[03:17:18.420 --> 03:17:23.680]  with the American Revolution, the Civil War, or the New Deal. And the last time we faced
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:29.000]  a fourth turning was the Great Depression and World War Two. Strauss and Howe's predictions
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:35.160]  of 22 years ago now look prescient. We can see the storm surge coming in our society
[03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:40.780]  at our time, just as if a hurricane was approaching the shore. Now our government has been undermining
[03:17:40.780 --> 03:17:46.560]  the foundations of liberty for a long time. And the question is, will you be a sandbag
[03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:51.200]  to help hold up and protect liberty? Or will you stand by as it gets swept away and we
[03:17:51.200 --> 03:17:56.760]  enter a new dark age of authoritarianism? I'm David Knight for the Infowars Nightly
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:17:59.160]  News.
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:02.880]  Excellent job, David Knight. We're gonna skip this network break and take phone calls
[03:18:02.880 --> 03:18:09.000]  here. Again, lot of other special reports right now being filed every couple hours at
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:14.020]  prisonplanet.tv as we fight the construction of the prison planet. So we have to recognize
[03:18:14.020 --> 03:18:16.840]  what's bad to then enter the new.
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:20.640]  We've studied history. People say, what's the solution? Recognize evil and then stand
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:26.160]  against it. What allows evil to take over? Laying down. You want solution? Stop kissing
[03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:30.640]  government rumpus. The government is now run by evil. Does it mean every representative
[03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:31.880]  of it is an evil person?
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:37.280]  No, but they are forces of Mordor. We've been taken. America's run by foreign banks. Wake
[03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:43.960]  up to that, restore the republic. Don't wake up, no hope. Very simple. You give aid and
[03:18:43.960 --> 03:18:48.420]  comfort to the foreign occupation forces when you sit there and make excuses for it. Or
[03:18:48.420 --> 03:18:50.800]  think anything it's doing is reasonable or nice.
[03:18:50.800 --> 03:18:57.440]  It's all about controlling you, Georgia and Connecticut. Contest for gun control, he has
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:19:00.080]  some comments on that. Go ahead and thanks for holding, sir.
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:04.840]  Good speaking to you. I think this whole thing is basically engineered because they're trying
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:10.080]  to, because of the financial collapse. I mean, so they can basically get the little gangs
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:16.160]  that can basically come into our communities once we're gun-free and able to be victimized
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:20.760]  so that we have to run to these big gangsters, Mr. Big, for the collapse.
[03:19:20.760 --> 03:19:25.240]  No, no, that's it. I don't know. Absolutely. They admit that's the plan, yeah?
[03:19:25.240 --> 03:19:30.440]  So I mean, most people got to be, we've got to raise the awareness of everybody. And I'm
[03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:36.240]  glad you're having a contest, but I think we should also have something like, why not
[03:19:36.240 --> 03:19:42.160]  get, say the Sandy Hook, or Sandy, is it Sandy Hook? Not again, Sandy-
[03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:43.160]  Sandy Hook.
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:48.960]  Whatever, where the shooting was done in Connecticut. Have them brought together with people from
[03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:55.160]  Waco and Ruby Ridge and people like that, and the people who have survived shootings
[03:19:55.160 --> 03:19:58.520]  where they had guns, and say, look, this is where it should go.
[03:19:58.520 --> 03:20:02.160]  Sure, well that's why they let the media harass them, then the police take over, and won't
[03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:05.680]  let anybody get near the families so they can control the narrative. That's problem
[03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:11.280]  reaction solution, but here's the deal. We're gonna have a $5,000 one month contest to do
[03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:17.240]  this quickly. $5,000, one winner, that'll be announced tonight as well, and people can
[03:20:17.240 --> 03:20:20.200]  start going right now, but it doesn't matter, everybody wins.
[03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:26.280]  Putting out a video, demand a plan video, that basically defends the Second Amendment
[03:20:26.280 --> 03:20:31.440]  along the lines of the video we put out. It can be anything you want, any style, anything,
[03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:37.280]  a $5,000 contest for the Second Amendment. Then we're going to have a $100,000 contest
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:44.040]  where you can make any film on any liberty issue you want, one minute, two hours, whatever,
[03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:50.480]  fiction, non-fiction. And then I will judge, as the sole judge, who the winner is.
[03:20:50.480 --> 03:20:54.680]  And then out of that, you'll get hundreds of great films made. Everybody wins by getting
[03:20:54.680 --> 03:21:02.900]  the word out, fighting tyranny and creativity. Somebody else gets $100,000, and then I take
[03:21:02.900 --> 03:21:08.120]  the top five or six people. And the top person, because the winner won't necessarily get the
[03:21:08.120 --> 03:21:10.200]  film deal, we have to work that out.
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:14.720]  But we're gonna try to put out a bunch of different films of different budgets, depending
[03:21:14.720 --> 03:21:19.800]  on how much money we have. But we're planning to just launch everything at the enemy. We've
[03:21:19.800 --> 03:21:24.040]  got our platform ready now, and we're just gonna have a major offensive. And it doesn't
[03:21:24.040 --> 03:21:28.760]  mean that our offensive will win, but we will inspire others to have offensives.
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:32.120]  I mean, just like this guy this last week who put out a video showing all these Hollywood
[03:21:32.120 --> 03:21:36.800]  stars shooting people in movies, cut between saying turn our guns in. That's been all over
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:41.120]  TV everywhere, it's totally destroying the enemy. And it's just another punch. We're
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:47.600]  gonna fire, and fire, and fire, and fire, and fire, and fire. Anything else, sir?
[03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:52.000]  Yeah, I thought we should also put poison pills in every one of their bills. How about
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:55.960]  adding on to each one of these gun bills that they're trying to put in there that they have
[03:21:55.960 --> 03:22:00.000]  to repeal, what is it, the NDAA?
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:05.720]  NDAA, yeah, or abolish the Federal Reserve. Or that all federal buildings have to be gun
[03:22:05.720 --> 03:22:09.400]  free and they can't have bodyguards, disarm the Secret Service. And they'll go, well,
[03:22:09.400 --> 03:22:13.480]  that's ridiculous. Exactly, leave our guns alone, filth. You've already sucked the country
[03:22:13.480 --> 03:22:14.480]  dry.
[03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:18.560]  Well, we know you hate us. You're not getting our guns, we know you're criminals. Shut up,
[03:22:18.560 --> 03:22:25.000]  shut up, the game's over. Shut up, Chelsea. Shut up, Stalin. Shut up, New World Order.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:30.760]  Shut up, Queen of England. Shut up, Al Jazeera. Shut up, RT. Shut up, Chinese government.
[03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:36.440]  Shut up, shut up. We're not putting up with it anymore. I appreciate your call. Shut
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:40.880]  up, scum. Let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Illinois. Thanks for holding her on the
[03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:41.880]  air.
[03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:48.200]  Happy New Year, Alex, and everyone listening. I was planning on heading out to your neck
[03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:53.960]  of the woods this weekend out in Austin. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to do so.
[03:22:53.960 --> 03:23:00.200]  But there's a major conference, the American Meteorological Society is having a conference
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:02.040]  beginning Sunday through Thursday-
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:05.400]  I'm glad you raised this. I told them months ago I want to send reporters and the problem
[03:23:05.400 --> 03:23:09.920]  is we forget. Yes, our reporters work like seven days a week by choosing because they
[03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:14.120]  love liberty so much. Somebody needs to go to the weather modification conference because
[03:23:14.120 --> 03:23:17.240]  RT came out yesterday and said, we're making it up.
[03:23:17.240 --> 03:23:21.200]  There's no weather mod. They're not spraying anything. Did you know that, Julio? The Russians
[03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:25.080]  said, shut up. So shut up. Sorry.
[03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:31.680]  No worries, Alex. I saw that video this morning and I've been planning research for the last
[03:23:31.680 --> 03:23:37.080]  couple of months in preparation for this conference and there's going to be people from various
[03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:39.240]  universities throughout the country as well as-
[03:23:39.240 --> 03:23:44.320]  Conference doesn't exist. There's no NAFTA highway. They're not coming for our guns.
[03:23:44.320 --> 03:23:48.920]  We're bad people. We shouldn't be upset, Julio. We should just trust our government and turn
[03:23:48.920 --> 03:23:53.040]  everything over to them. And of course, we need to go to government facilities and work
[03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:57.120]  in labor together. Together, aren't you for the people? Don't you want to prove you're
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:00.320]  for America and go work in a forced labor camp, Julio?
[03:24:00.320 --> 03:24:05.320]  I mean, the army manual says they're setting them up. I mean, what's wrong with a FEMA
[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:10.320]  camp? What's wrong with quote, reeducation centers? We shouldn't be upset about that,
[03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:13.040]  Julio. Are you ready to apologize?
[03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:17.760]  I am apologizing, Alex. Actually, remember I called your show back in November of 2011.
[03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:22.800]  I think during the Cancun conference, the UN climate change conference in Cancun, they
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:28.280]  said that they want to move us into mass camps in large urban areas.
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:31.920]  No, no, that's in the official document. But no, the UN doesn't exist either. You're a
[03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:36.160]  conspiracy theorist. No, none of it exists. They're good people. I appreciate your call.
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:42.120]  How dare you say government doesn't do anything but good. When the government goes and gets
[03:24:42.120 --> 03:24:48.400]  on the toilet, flowers come out, okay? And if you say anything else, you're a terrorist.
[03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:52.320]  I think it's normal to put gun owners' names in the paper and tell people where to go rob
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:56.240]  them and say they're scum and say that all gun owners are Klan members. Obviously, that's
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:25:02.080]  true. I mean, the government is good.
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:05.400]  Patty in Wyoming, how are you doing, ma'am?
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:10.720]  Hi, Alex, how are you? God bless you. And God is calling out his army and we all need
[03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:19.320]  to pray for each other. And I really enjoyed the commentary with you and Gerald. It was
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:24.280]  very informative and a real privilege to listen to such brilliant men.
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:30.360]  Ma'am, you know where roses come from, right? I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:25:30.360 --> 03:25:31.360]  I'm sorry.
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:37.920]  That's okay. Listen, I just wanted to reiterate and agree with what Gerald said earlier about
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:46.000]  psychotropic drugs. I'm a registered nurse and I actually experience that weekly in my
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:52.840]  profession that the inappropriate prescribing of these medications, the over-prescribing
[03:25:52.840 --> 03:25:58.120]  of these medications, and especially, most criminally, prescribing these medications
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:25:59.120]  to children.
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:03.560]  Yeah, I've been reading where they're giving anti-psychotics to three-year-olds now. What's
[03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:09.040]  wrong with that? I mean, next you're gonna say it wasn't good to shoot 15,000 black people
[03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:10.760]  up with live syphilis?
[03:26:10.760 --> 03:26:13.560]  Yeah, it's criminal. It's absolutely-
[03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:17.760]  No, you're a criminal for not liking it. The government did it. And the government injects
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:19.760]  black people to kill them. It's good.
[03:26:19.760 --> 03:26:20.760]  Yeah.
[03:26:20.760 --> 03:26:24.440]  I mean, what are you, a fear monger? You don't trust the government?
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:32.720]  No, I guess I am. I'm just a bee vendetta, mask-wearing, radical nut who needs to go
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:34.240]  to a re-education camp.
[03:26:34.240 --> 03:26:38.160]  Ma'am, I agree with you. Ecoscience says they've been poisoning our water and I think it's
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:42.360]  good. Of course, we need to be poisoned by the government. The government's poisoning.
[03:26:42.360 --> 03:26:43.680]  It's good.
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:49.360]  It's very biblical. The truth has become the lie and the lie has become the truth in the
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:51.040]  end times and I really believe that.
[03:26:51.040 --> 03:26:55.960]  That's right. And Diane Feinstein wants our guns cuz she cares about us. Thank you, extremist.
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:03.240]  That lady was so extreme. ABC Angel, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:06.080]  Yeah, Alex, this is Archangel in Pittsburgh.
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:07.080]  Go ahead.
[03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:13.360]  Hey, I was just had a long talk with Mark Kessler, who's the Gilbertan chief of police.
[03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:18.560]  We had a long talk and by the way, you neglected his direct no phone number, his 570-
[03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:21.440]  Hold on, let's not give the police chief's number out.
[03:27:21.440 --> 03:27:23.040]  Said it would be fine.
[03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:26.600]  No, no, let's not. We got millions of listeners, bro. You're talking about the police chief
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:30.480]  that's saying he's gonna have a pro-second amendment zone in his town.
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:31.480]  Yeah.
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:35.360]  He's on the show Sunday. I didn't wanna announce it, cuz I like surprises, but he's on the
[03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:37.160]  show Sunday, right? He's already set up?
[03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:42.360]  Yeah, he was really happy. We had a long discussion about it. I told him about my ideas. He said
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:46.840]  he had sent it out to other mayors. I had said about the legislature and the Senate,
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:55.880]  the Governor Tom Corbett also mentioned that in the 70s or 80s years, they made the legal
[03:27:55.880 --> 03:27:56.880]  militia illegal.
[03:27:56.880 --> 03:28:03.320]  Sir, that police chief does not exist and this phone call does not exist. And Piers
[03:28:03.320 --> 03:28:05.480]  Morgan cares about you and your family.
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:10.480]  The Pennsylvania House and Senate reinstate the legal militia. That would give it to Bill
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:15.880]  Teeth, cuz there's over 2 million hunters and sportsmen registered just to hunt in Pennsylvania.
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:22.240]  I agree. We need more police chiefs to come out and say, we are gonna defend the Constitution
[03:28:22.240 --> 03:28:24.040]  and Bill of Rights.
[03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:28.760]  And we need the states to defend our borders. It's time to understand we have an occupied
[03:28:28.760 --> 03:28:32.000]  government. And this has happened dozens of times in modern history, like Romania and
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:37.320]  places where everybody just stops complying, okay? And police, you name it, they can't
[03:28:37.320 --> 03:28:38.320]  get you all.
[03:28:38.320 --> 03:28:42.800]  I know they persecute police that aren't oppressive in most areas. You've got to just get together
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:47.840]  and start saying no, cuz there's no future. The globalists will steal everything if we
[03:28:47.840 --> 03:28:52.200]  don't stand up against them right now. Let's go to Ron in New York real fast. Ron, you're
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:53.200]  on the air.
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:58.780]  Yeah, hi, Alex. Alex, a few things. How come there's been no real consequential journalistic
[03:28:58.780 --> 03:29:03.560]  vetting of Adam Lanza's mother? I mean, after all, according to the press, she played a
[03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:04.560]  central part-
[03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:10.000]  Listen, the whole thing, if you ask me, my gut tells me it's all staged, and the Batman
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:15.080]  shooting too, and we've got the proof. But I don't know if the public can handle it.
[03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:17.680]  The entire thing is scripted, yes.
[03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:21.720]  Second question is, why is the mayor of New York City, the mayor of a city, having a quote
[03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:27.040]  secret meeting with the former representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark, as
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:30.600]  though he's sending her out on some secret mission they won't discuss? And an interesting
[03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:34.640]  thing about her husband Mark, back in the 90s, the man was nothing more than a naval
[03:29:34.640 --> 03:29:39.760]  aviator. Nothing more than a naval aviator, and I can't see the connection. He was part
[03:29:39.760 --> 03:29:45.240]  of a trade, some kind of a trade group that went to the People's Republic of China, government
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:46.240]  sanctions-
[03:29:46.240 --> 03:30:02.400]  Absolutely. God bless you, brother. We're out of time.
