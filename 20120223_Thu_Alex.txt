[01:15.000 --> 01:18.360]  happen in other cities even with smaller stations than a big blow torch like
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.240]  810 where Goliath Goliath cannot stand against the truth again the fact is
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.800]  freedom is popular the truth is popular Jeffrey R. Smith a real expert
[01:31.800 --> 01:37.040]  investigative journalist and filmmaker will be joining us the last hour and a
[01:37.040 --> 01:43.260]  half today to talk about GMO and toxic fluoride the history of Monsanto
[01:43.260 --> 01:47.280]  as pertain all of it there's been a lot of big new developments they're coming
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.360]  out with hundreds of new crops not just the 30 or so that were force-fed and
[01:52.360 --> 01:55.720]  that governments are moving to pass laws we're not allowed to even label it
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.400]  not that you have to label or not that you don't have to label but that you're
[02:00.400 --> 02:05.880]  not allowed to tell someone so we're going to be talking to him about that
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.640]  eugenics operation coming up in the second half of the transmission today
[02:11.640 --> 02:18.840]  obviously there is a large flotilla of incredibly important news at infowars.com
[02:18.840 --> 02:26.440]  and prisonplanet.com that we're going to be covering today and I'm gonna give
[02:26.440 --> 02:33.000]  the number out during the third segment at 24 after but I'm not gonna open the
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.360]  phones yet and I'm gonna specifically tell callers that I do want you to call
[02:37.360 --> 02:41.560]  in on one subject we do this about once a week no one follows the rule and
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.040]  I sit there and politely let folks talk about whatever they want it's not gonna
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.040]  happen today just because things are getting a little too serious here and
[02:49.040 --> 02:51.760]  we need to sometimes actually need to focus on some issues and actually hear
[02:51.760 --> 02:57.160]  from people that want to discuss the points that I'm raising and we do have
[02:57.160 --> 03:03.000]  free-for-alls most days but we're gonna be talking about something that I saw in
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.720]  the news a month ago in mainstream papers something that Justin Romondo of
[03:07.720 --> 03:12.560]  anti-war wrote a very good article about three weeks ago that I had highlighted
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.280]  and meant to cover on air but never got to I mean I mentioned some of it but
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.480]  didn't really read in the meat of it titled Ron Paul won't sell out but
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.960]  others will and I read the article and I tended to read it but I think I kind of
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.560]  subconsciously held back on reading it because even though I think Romondo is
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.560]  right in what he says in his article and by the way I want to get him on the
[03:36.560 --> 03:41.440]  show guys concerning that I thought about doing it at the time and I was on
[03:41.440 --> 03:48.280]  razor's edge because it borders on infighting but it's not and I was at
[03:48.280 --> 03:54.800]  least gonna mention the article and say what do you think of this and then I
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.680]  never got around to it basically and I think that was subconsciously my
[03:58.680 --> 04:05.000]  instinct is to not engage in a bunch of infighting or second-guessing of people
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.280]  that have bonafide clear decisive records of being no compromise and being
[04:12.280 --> 04:16.160]  absolutely committed to liberty and who I trust and who I've measured and looked
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.320]  into this soul of as Putin said about George W. Bush in a joking way I looked
[04:21.320 --> 04:25.520]  to him into his eyes and saw his soul and it was a good man that was a sick
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.280]  Russian joke of course you look at Putin too until he's a killer and a thug I
[04:31.280 --> 04:36.080]  wouldn't say as a type of pervert that George W. Bush is but the point is that
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.000]  you know gets off on torture and makes jokes about it and stuff and sends
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.160]  military to prison who follow the orders to torture and scapegoats but then
[04:47.160 --> 04:50.400]  later writes a book admitting he ordered torture and says he'd do it again
[04:50.400 --> 04:53.840]  side issue I'll tell you what I'm talking about when we come back it deals
[04:53.840 --> 05:01.200]  with Ron Paul admit Romney and a VP run that's right on the ticket I've been

[07:57.920 --> 08:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.360 --> 08:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.880 --> 08:41.000]  Alex Jones hard to believe it's already Thursday the third day of February 2012
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.400]  and we're gonna have absolutely vital and jam-packed transmission lined up for
[08:46.400 --> 08:52.880]  you here today of course the websites leading the pack of the exploding
[08:52.880 --> 08:57.840]  alternative media that is overthrowing the corporatist new world order
[08:57.840 --> 09:04.600]  prostitute media are info wars.com and prison planet.com info wars.com alone is
[09:04.600 --> 09:11.240]  the number one alternative news website in the world and prison planet.com is a
[09:11.240 --> 09:16.880]  distant second of course I don't call the drudge report drudge report.com an
[09:16.880 --> 09:24.720]  alternative site it's kind of its own one-off Himalayan mountain range of media
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.840]  power it's it's bigger than the New York Times and Twitter and Facebook and you
[09:28.840 --> 09:32.360]  know things like that combined with news drivers so that's a totally different
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.640]  animal when it comes to all other media we are number one when it comes to
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.480]  somebody who's doing a radio show doing a TV show who has a news system info
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.640]  wars.com is it and I I raised that at least once a week at the start of the
[09:46.640 --> 09:51.360]  show more and more because we've had that position for a couple years you can
[09:51.360 --> 09:55.920]  go to Google analytics you can go to stat brain you can go to dozens of big
[09:55.920 --> 10:01.720]  systems you can go to Alexa.com on an average day we have about 30 times the
[10:01.720 --> 10:09.120]  visitors of somebody like MSNBC.com and they're literally the mouse that roared
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.200]  or a mouse is too big the the mouse that the tiny baby mouse that that's
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.800]  squeaked but because they've got teleprompters and fancy sets the small
[10:18.800 --> 10:22.600]  group of people that actually watch it and most their shows have 100,000
[10:22.600 --> 10:28.360]  viewers their biggest 500 600 800,000 some days I mean it is a giant
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.160]  illusion and I point that out because it just runs from that point on the
[10:32.160 --> 10:38.880]  mainstream media is an empty rotten husk everywhere where the media is
[10:38.880 --> 10:44.840]  uncontrolled or long-form and open and unscripted that's where you have the
[10:44.840 --> 10:51.520]  large audiences and of course look at talk radio it is the only old media that
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.760]  is still extremely popular radio shows here in the United States there are more
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.880]  than a hundred radio programs that are rated to have over a million listeners a
[11:01.880 --> 11:07.840]  day in this country think about that there's only two cable network news
[11:07.840 --> 11:14.640]  systems that have you know I'm a million people on average watching any hour in
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.360]  fact CNN doesn't even have us so I guess it's only Fox they are legends in your
[11:19.360 --> 11:25.560]  mind and in my mind one of the last dominoes to fall is that we the
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.600]  alternative press are in awe even when we get on the dinosaur media and
[11:31.600 --> 11:37.760]  wow I happen to see you on Fox or CNN who congratulations that's one of the
[11:37.760 --> 11:44.320]  last dominoes to fall is that we don't realize how powerful we are I would have
[11:44.320 --> 11:47.720]  said legends in their own mind and some of the anchors are legends in their own
[11:47.720 --> 11:57.920]  minds but the system knows that they have a dwindling tiny audience 25 years
[11:57.920 --> 12:05.560]  ago network broadcast news on average had 30 million viewers during a program
[12:05.560 --> 12:10.400]  during the dinner time hour five or six o'clock a nightline would have your 15
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.200]  million viewers at 10 30 or 11 at night came on different times I certainly know
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.280]  when I was up late when I was a kid my parents would watch it if they were up
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.440]  that hasn't been the case obviously with cable news more choice and then that's
[12:23.440 --> 12:34.840]  now all in an exodus to the to the internet and so the the system the
[12:34.840 --> 12:42.640]  system knows what they're doing the the system is desperate to continue to add
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.840]  more teleprompters more flash more regalia more flashing flash bulbs to
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.480]  create the perception that there is a separation between them and anybody
[12:53.480 --> 12:58.440]  else more and more the internet has created a fairer playing field they
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.040]  still have the big money they have the big names the big guest but more and
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.240]  more it's a more and more of a level playing field it's still somewhat slanted
[13:07.240 --> 13:12.200]  and they're losing because people won't trust them they've been caught lying so
[13:12.200 --> 13:17.000]  many times and it's because of that that you have the perfect storm of old
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.440]  dinosaur trader media sewer stream media decepticon media coming out and
[13:23.440 --> 13:26.520]  working with government and trying to massage the public and sell the public
[13:26.520 --> 13:30.680]  on the end of demonstrations the end of rallies the end of protest the end of
[13:30.680 --> 13:33.760]  free speech the end of the Fourth Amendment the end of states rights the
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.360]  end of internet freedom supporting internet taxes supporting regulations
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.680]  supporting copyright and trademark laws where you have no due process and a
[13:41.680 --> 13:44.520]  company just says something is theirs and they take it and they're filing
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.560]  cases every day saying you can't have the word sky in your name you can't have
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.680]  sky in an article you write you can't have sky in the word Skype news course
[13:53.680 --> 13:57.560]  suing them of course for a year over that you can't have the last name McDonald
[13:57.560 --> 14:03.280]  you can't use the word dummy you can't I mean they're trying to attack the
[14:03.280 --> 14:09.520]  language itself just to muddy everything and kill what was the free and open
[14:09.520 --> 14:14.140]  internet in their desperate bid and we're seeing the last gas for the
[14:14.140 --> 14:18.440]  corporate or media four years ago they were able to suppress Ron Paul and
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.720]  keep him from becoming a front runner this time he's become the front runner
[14:21.720 --> 14:27.080]  all the major polls numbers election fraud show that I've gone over that in
[14:27.080 --> 14:38.520]  detail but now now that illusion is is is threadbare now that's worn out like
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.160]  so many Gator backs as they call them the old 18 wheeler tires blown out on
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.200]  the side of the road the system is running on bald tires the system is
[14:48.200 --> 14:51.760]  blowing out more and more of its tires it's not gonna make it so something's
[14:51.760 --> 14:54.760]  gonna change they're gonna launch false flag attacks they're gonna start a whole
[14:54.760 --> 14:58.560]  bunch of big wars not just proxy wars and covert wars and they're gonna go
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.120]  after domestic groups and they're gonna start shutting the web down as we know
[15:01.120 --> 15:04.120]  it they're gonna launch cyber attacks against the web system blaming on
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.840]  foreign enemies domestic ribs they're gonna operate through so-called anonymous
[15:08.840 --> 15:11.640]  which has some good people some bad people involved in it because it is
[15:11.640 --> 15:18.440]  anonymous anybody can use that cloak and then blame all hacktivism all hackers
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.240]  that are engaged in free speech activities for their actions this is a
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.800]  classic elite in major crisis and they're gonna do everything they can to
[15:27.800 --> 15:37.440]  shut down the opposition but on this fully on this freer and freer playing
[15:37.440 --> 15:44.480]  field now that we stand on collectively here it is coming down to your brains
[15:44.480 --> 15:48.600]  it's coming down to your eloquence it's coming down to your analysis it's coming
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.760]  down to reality the internet has allowed a giant spectrum of everything from
[15:53.760 --> 16:02.000]  corporates propaganda to schizoid paranoia to hilarity and comedy
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.840]  straight through to the mundane to incredible educational developments and
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.280]  a love of learning and a new renaissance being discovered right through to
[16:12.280 --> 16:19.520]  exploding true journalism analysis cutting satire it is a cornucopia a full
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.000]  spectrum for people to sample and research and develop their own palate
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.360]  their own tastes their own repertoire of understanding and the system knows
[16:30.360 --> 16:35.240]  that and so they are moving to shut it down and Ron Paul the fact that they
[16:35.240 --> 16:38.480]  haven't been able to suppress him and the fact that he really is in almost
[16:38.480 --> 16:41.680]  every state the front runner remember they said he couldn't win and then when
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.160]  he would get in second place they wouldn't mention in different primaries
[16:45.160 --> 16:47.600]  that even got second place just like they wouldn't mention when he got first
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.080]  place in a straw bowl they've mentioned second third and fourth place or they
[16:51.080 --> 16:54.640]  give him the least amount of time you saw that that fix was in and despite that
[16:54.640 --> 17:00.440]  he won Maine he won Iowa he won Nevada and it's come out it's in those local
[17:00.440 --> 17:04.520]  papers now it's not a new story to those of us that listen to this show or those
[17:04.520 --> 17:07.360]  of you that were delegates or those of you that were there witnessing it who
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.160]  reported it all state by state to us as it happened and were our listeners
[17:12.160 --> 17:17.080]  proven accurate after each of those primaries yeah weeks later the case of
[17:17.080 --> 17:20.280]  Iowa months later they cancel the election and say we're just throwing the
[17:20.280 --> 17:23.800]  whole thing out it was all a fraud we say Santorum's the winner we're not
[17:23.800 --> 17:26.280]  going to say of that means he gets the delegates just don't worry about it
[17:26.280 --> 17:29.640]  same thing in Maine yeah we didn't count all the big counties where Ron Paul
[17:29.640 --> 17:33.800]  had double-digit leads yeah the other party even says it's a fraud but we're
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.720]  not going to tell you when you ever get to cast those ballots Mitt Romney keeps
[17:36.720 --> 17:42.440]  it okay it's just the way it is same thing in South Carolina same thing in
[17:42.440 --> 17:47.680]  Nevada and this is just revealing they're using the old game that they had
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.800]  before of just cheating everybody out in the open back when they had media
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.080]  dominance or air superiority basically over us and now they're doing their old
[17:57.080 --> 18:01.960]  tricks in front of everyone just burning down their own house okay you just stole
[18:01.960 --> 18:05.920]  it again but this time people are watching you know before maybe five
[18:05.920 --> 18:09.240]  percent were aware and call conspiracy theorists for not trusting known liars
[18:09.240 --> 18:14.280]  four years ago maybe thirty five percent now the basic fraud and election
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.160]  fraud I saw Gallup poll year ago like eighty five percent I've seen some
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.640]  polls as high as ninety one percent don't trust the election process now
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.360]  they've even got mainstream TV saying it looks suspicious even the New York
[18:26.360 --> 18:32.720]  Times to stay credible is saying it looks like Ron Paul won main so see it
[18:32.720 --> 18:36.880]  isn't working anymore they in the past they could steal things because oh that
[18:36.880 --> 18:39.800]  doesn't happen in America we have free and fair elections and that's what
[18:39.800 --> 18:43.080]  allowed the corruption to grow now people are going okay I'm looking for the
[18:43.080 --> 18:46.920]  fraud oh I guess it's there looks like fraud and Iowa oh it's confirmed now
[18:46.920 --> 18:54.160]  oh main fraud confirmed oh South Carolina fraud confirmed this is what's
[18:54.160 --> 19:00.920]  going on and it's a sad prospect but it's better than just sitting here and
[19:00.920 --> 19:04.560]  buying the lies and not having somebody run for office because then you don't
[19:04.560 --> 19:10.000]  put somebody in there to prove that it's a fraud it'd be kind of like if they
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.080]  had not ten horses in a horse race and only one of them wasn't bought and
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.920]  paid for and on the off chance that you know that jockey's not paid off and the
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.360]  horse is a good horse and starts you know running and winning I mean when he
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.920]  when he wins by you know five horse links do they say well you know the
[19:28.920 --> 19:34.720]  jockey did something wrong or or or lied on his weight so now you don't win well
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.640]  the first time you're like yeah maybe that is true but if it happens 10 times
[19:38.640 --> 19:44.280]  20 times 50 times 100 times you you know what's going on now when I come back
[19:44.280 --> 19:49.720]  I'm getting our big top story has Ron Paul formed a political alliance with

[24:25.360 --> 24:30.120]  on the front page of info wars.com in fact I'm gonna get that red link it's so
[24:30.120 --> 24:37.680]  important has Ron Paul formed a political alliance with Mitt Romney and of
[24:37.680 --> 24:43.800]  course it follows the Washington Post MSNBC hundreds of publications and
[24:43.800 --> 24:48.640]  outfits today are running with the headlines will Ron Paul be the VP
[24:48.640 --> 24:56.040]  running mate of Mitt Romney and the Romney people wouldn't answer the question
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.720]  but said that Ron Paul is an iconic last and a guy that stands for what he
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.200]  believes in so I have been following this and hearing about this for over a
[25:06.200 --> 25:11.080]  month because people in the Paul campaign have been talking to people
[25:11.080 --> 25:18.120]  about it not Ron Paul himself but Jesse Benton who we've interviewed many times
[25:18.120 --> 25:26.280]  as you know and others now I've gotten a chance to meet and interview Ron Paul
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.480]  I've interviewed him I don't know five or six times or more I guess on radio I
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.240]  guess more than that probably 15 times and I think about his interview years
[25:34.240 --> 25:37.720]  ago probably one of the first interviews ever because I actually went out and
[25:37.720 --> 25:40.920]  look for his family and people that were politically active locally like I've
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.480]  interviewed Wayne Paul his brother and I've interviewed Rand now that I think
[25:44.480 --> 25:48.920]  about it probably a decade ago wow but I've interviewed him five or six times
[25:48.920 --> 25:54.080]  well a few times to get him to run he's like gee I don't know and you know I was
[25:54.080 --> 25:57.360]  calling him up at his house to get him on and yeah you need to do it form the
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.120]  exploratory committee oh gee Alex they I'd never get elected senator you know I
[26:02.120 --> 26:09.360]  just this and then of course they tried to block him from even being able to get
[26:09.360 --> 26:12.520]  on the ballot and then the Republican establishment tried to keep him from
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.360]  being able to be at fundraisers even speak to Republican groups but all that
[26:16.360 --> 26:19.840]  failed and we backed him our audience backed him and just like Ron Paul said
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.920]  four years ago on this show half the initial money he got to run in 2008 was
[26:24.920 --> 26:29.640]  from this audience in 2007 and it's still a large core of it you see Ron Paul
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.440]  all over the country and people are there and info wars.com shirts and have
[26:33.440 --> 26:36.960]  them you know signing their info wars.com bumper stickers or you see AP
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.040]  photos of Ron Paul shirt and then he's got a info wars wristband I mean you know
[26:42.040 --> 26:45.720]  that you're you're his supporters and I support Ron Paul I've been interviewing
[26:45.720 --> 26:53.720]  him for now almost 17 years I've been on air it'll be 17 years next month 17
[26:53.720 --> 26:56.920]  years next month on air so I've been interviewing Ron Paul about 16 and a half
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.040]  years I've been on radio just a few months when I first interviewed him
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.240]  because his district used to come right up to South Austin they've rewritten it
[27:03.240 --> 27:06.520]  a few times but the reason I'm giving you some background before I even get into
[27:06.520 --> 27:11.000]  what I'm gonna say here is because I'm really just thinking a lot I know Ron
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.800]  Paul is a person of impeccable integrity his voting record is perfect
[27:15.800 --> 27:19.920]  constitutional voting record he never compromises on what he believes in and
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.680]  he never waffles or waivers and even if you don't believe you know all of his
[27:23.680 --> 27:27.720]  ideas I believe about 99% of them because they're sound and make sense and
[27:27.720 --> 27:30.600]  they're just common sense and constitutional that's how we have the
[27:30.600 --> 27:32.880]  same views on pretty much any issue without even seeing what each other
[27:32.880 --> 27:36.800]  think same thing with Lou Rockwell something with Rand because it's just
[27:36.800 --> 27:40.680]  the Constitution Bill writes if you know that you know what America is you
[27:40.680 --> 27:44.080]  know what made us great and it's you're following the same roadmap you know how
[27:44.080 --> 27:48.720]  does somebody drive from Austin Texas to Pensacola Florida where I am right now
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.960]  or outside Pensacola how do you do that well you got a roadmap well how does
[27:53.960 --> 27:58.600]  somebody else get there well the roadmap same thing so I know they're a
[27:58.600 --> 28:02.960]  family of integrity and they're good people and they're very shrewd in kind
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.240]  of a down home way and they're servant types and they're hard-working dedicated
[28:08.240 --> 28:15.120]  types they're salt of the earth Americana that said I've seen Ron Paul when
[28:15.120 --> 28:19.640]  he's on Jay Leno or on these shows and around a movie star or something and he's
[28:19.640 --> 28:24.080]  not starstruck for his ego but he does get starstruck by things I've watched
[28:24.080 --> 28:32.640]  Ron Paul carefully and on issues he's a hundred percent but I think on
[28:32.640 --> 28:39.520]  relationships and over time you know being kind of friendly to the Republican
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.160]  establishment just because he's in that party and it's more of almost like Ron
[28:43.160 --> 28:47.440]  Paul people that work for him and are around him it's almost like it's a form
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.400]  of hospitality that well you just tolerate what people around you were
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.000]  doing even though you don't agree with it I know I do that with my employees and
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.320]  my crew I don't sit there and hammer into them what I believe and what I think
[29:00.320 --> 29:04.760]  it's some corporate handbook of our ideas and I never try to dominate people
[29:04.760 --> 29:10.520]  and so sometimes it starts turning around the other way where because I'm not
[29:10.520 --> 29:14.400]  always trying to put my will on people then sometimes it's the opposite that's
[29:14.400 --> 29:17.480]  kind of why in a corporate environment their reason to dominate you and do all
[29:17.480 --> 29:22.360]  that is so you understand that and again I'm getting into the complexities
[29:22.360 --> 29:25.800]  the complexities of these we have a long 18 minute break coming up and then
[29:25.800 --> 29:29.120]  after I cover this I'll give the number out and you can get your take and your
[29:29.120 --> 29:31.960]  view on it in fact I'll give the number out now and come back and really tell
[29:31.960 --> 29:36.400]  you what I think and I'm just gonna say it I'm gonna tell you what I really think
[29:36.400 --> 29:44.920]  the different angles of it concerning all this hype with Ron Paul the talk of
[29:44.920 --> 29:48.800]  him running as a VP with Mitt Romney and some of the folks on his campaign are
[29:48.800 --> 29:54.800]  excited about that we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:54.800 --> 30:03.440]  the GCN radio network I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of
[30:03.440 --> 30:07.760]  food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my
[30:07.760 --> 30:11.680]  body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key
[30:11.680 --> 30:16.680]  vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was
[30:16.680 --> 30:21.200]  eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at

[34:52.800 --> 34:57.080]  Apple have exposed it and Google's been caught of course Microsoft and does it
[34:57.080 --> 35:02.480]  themselves they're just in competition with the NSA Google is the NSA side
[35:02.480 --> 35:09.040]  issue I'm digressing let me get into Ron Paul and just give you the shortening
[35:09.040 --> 35:22.360]  of it okay a month ago I saw a quote by Jesse Benton in the news and in that
[35:22.360 --> 35:36.960]  quote in that article he was talking about the fact that everyone should be
[35:36.960 --> 35:43.480]  considering Ron Paul as a VP because he's the smartest guy in the room and
[35:43.480 --> 35:49.880]  that's an article again at info wars.com of course they had a movie called
[35:49.880 --> 35:55.840]  smartest guy in the room or smartest guys in the room it was about in Ron but
[35:55.840 --> 36:02.240]  I mean Ron Paul is one of the smartest guys in the room and I saw his quote in
[36:02.240 --> 36:08.800]  several newspapers and I didn't really say anything about it because I wanted
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.160]  to let this ride out a little bit and see what was happening this is his
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.360]  campaign chairman this is the head of his campaign Ron Paul campaign chairman
[36:17.360 --> 36:23.560]  Jesse Benton has also promoted Rand Paul as a suitable VP any Republican this
[36:23.560 --> 36:29.080]  is a quote should be looking at Rand Paul as a potential running mate you're
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.320]  talking about Rand Paul the senator because he's the smartest guy in the
[36:32.320 --> 36:37.760]  room and he has tremendous credibility with conservatives any Republican should
[36:37.760 --> 36:40.160]  have Rand Paul on a shortlist and of course they go back and forth between
[36:40.160 --> 36:43.800]  Rand Paul and Ron Paul because the Washington Post our article all of them
[36:43.800 --> 36:47.640]  have the different quotes about Rand Paul Ron Paul it's all up there being
[36:47.640 --> 36:53.000]  discussed and the Washington Post today is saying you know the word is that it is
[36:53.000 --> 37:02.720]  being discussed to have yeah I'm good I'm good thanks guys appreciate it I'm
[37:02.720 --> 37:04.960]  good
[37:12.720 --> 37:19.120]  let me just let me just try to start over here for just a minute takes I'm
[37:19.120 --> 37:22.480]  getting used to doing this on the road with your whole family in the river at
[37:22.480 --> 37:31.520]  with you let me just start over okay and then I'm gonna give the phone number
[37:31.520 --> 37:44.240]  I'll give you the phone number right now it's 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and we
[37:44.240 --> 37:51.480]  will get you up and on the air on this subject of Ron Paul should he if he
[37:51.480 --> 37:58.400]  doesn't win the nominations for all the GOP fraud should he run if he was
[37:58.400 --> 38:03.320]  offered it in a VP slot to Mitt Romney and I'm gonna give you my view my research
[38:03.320 --> 38:07.880]  to view my well-thought-out view on that in a moment from different angles but the
[38:07.880 --> 38:12.480]  point is is that Rand Paul has come out and I've got his quotes in Watson's
[38:12.480 --> 38:19.840]  article and said he would be honored to be considered in a VP slot he said that
[38:19.840 --> 38:24.160]  when asked and we have where he said it in links to it in our article I think
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.280]  Rand Paul is a credible guy of integrity who I respect and I can who's done a
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.640]  good job as a senator and done what he said he would do his father is above
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.320]  reproach and I totally trust him but as Justin Romondo wrote at any war a month
[38:37.320 --> 38:44.800]  ago or three weeks ago Ron Paul will not sell out but others can others around
[38:44.800 --> 38:47.880]  him can I forget that exact headline were you guys ever able to pull that up
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.920]  for me about 45 minutes ago when I was I mean I guess I could look it up here
[38:51.920 --> 38:58.120]  here I'll just do that right now I'll just do that right now because I want
[38:58.120 --> 39:01.240]  to be able to give folks the headline
[39:07.880 --> 39:11.640]  go to music or whatever you need to because I need to be able to have this
[39:11.640 --> 39:25.320]  article for I continue
[39:41.640 --> 40:09.720]  okay continuing here to break this down the toll-free number to join us on this
[40:09.720 --> 40:19.920]  subject and this question is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 on this one subject I
[40:19.920 --> 40:23.400]  don't screen your calls and then about once a week I say I want to talk about
[40:23.400 --> 40:28.120]  this topic and no one will ever maybe one out of ten callers will even address
[40:28.120 --> 40:31.560]  anything I'm talking about so if I do go to you and it's on the subject I'm gonna
[40:31.560 --> 40:34.840]  hang up on you because we need to be able to occasionally have a focused
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.840]  discussion on something now continuing here it was behind the headlines can
[40:39.840 --> 40:45.240]  Ron Paul be tamed and my brain morphed to that that that headline of Ron Paul
[40:45.240 --> 40:51.920]  won't sell out but his campaign could and that's what Ramondo says he says no
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.240]  but his campaign camp that's the article can Ron Paul be tamed no but his
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.160]  campaign can and that was less than three weeks ago that was about three weeks
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.640]  ago that was that was February 3rd that was a February 3rd he asked that and
[41:06.640 --> 41:14.320]  he's got all the quotes and the rest of it there in the article where they've
[41:14.320 --> 41:23.240]  got all these Republican insiders and people saying that they think Ron Paul
[41:23.240 --> 41:30.200]  maybe has to be VP or Rand Paul and then we have a top analyst who's rarely been
[41:30.200 --> 41:36.920]  wrong on Fox News betting and saying he believes and well in saying he thinks
[41:36.920 --> 41:43.040]  Ron Paul will be on the ticket there'll be a broker convention and that the the
[41:43.040 --> 41:50.160]  the the the Paulians will force him on to it and that's what used to happen
[41:50.160 --> 41:55.640]  until the political insiders took over the system generally whoever was the
[41:55.640 --> 42:05.080]  second most powerful candidate was forced on as VP because yeah whoever gets
[42:05.080 --> 42:08.320]  picked to be second to the president might as well be who had the second most
[42:08.320 --> 42:15.560]  votes and the last 30 years ago or in the last 30 years or so that's basically
[42:15.560 --> 42:20.400]  being phased out but thanks for pausing that for me guys here on air we're live
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.400]  but to play 30 seconds of news what we found that is a pause so I can pause and
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.880]  find that specific article for you so that we can guarantee you give me the
[42:31.880 --> 42:37.000]  right info and again my problem getting into this subject is I'm always so
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.280]  you know decisive on info because I've thought it out so well but on something
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.680]  this complex I can basically put myself inside the campaign and I'm not
[42:45.680 --> 42:51.040]  judging them I'm not saying they're bad because a we don't even know what's the
[42:51.040 --> 42:57.880]  truth is completely we don't know where all of this is going we don't know what
[42:57.880 --> 43:02.400]  Ron Paul is thinking I will assure you next time I get him on the show and
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.040]  King because I know he's told me he wants to come on every month but then I
[43:06.040 --> 43:08.760]  say well sometimes it's hard to get you on he goes well tell him I want to come
[43:08.760 --> 43:13.320]  on and sometimes I've got you know call him up at home or something to say hey
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.120]  tell him to get you on because they're not returning my calls or emails and I
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.000]  don't get I don't get butt hurt as they say over that it doesn't seem that big
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.880]  of a deal I've interviewed Ron Paul probably a hundred times it's just you
[43:26.880 --> 43:30.600]  know you also run into that and I understand people on the campaign and
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.760]  the congressional staffs of you you know he can go any show he wants and they
[43:34.760 --> 43:37.920]  know they have this audience of course it's growing all the time and they know
[43:37.920 --> 43:40.640]  Ron Paul can say things that are dangerous on this show because I'll ask
[43:40.640 --> 43:46.520]  real questions he's a real person and so they want to try to control things but
[43:46.520 --> 43:52.240]  that's a side issue as well it's just that I mean here's an example to describe
[43:52.240 --> 43:57.280]  to you of what's inside the Ron Paul campaign I've had family go to the
[43:57.280 --> 44:02.800]  Capitol and one group of family goes in and says hi you know we're cousins of
[44:02.800 --> 44:06.960]  Alex Jones and we're big fans of Ron Paul and I've had him say oh wonderful
[44:06.960 --> 44:10.560]  yeah we love him too and boy I like his show depends on who they end up talking
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.080]  to it at the congressional office or different campaign headquarters to
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.000]  people saying we don't like Alex Jones he's really bad he makes Ron Paul look
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.520]  bad and of course I've heard that for years and that's happened to friends
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.760]  family others you just basically it's like Russian roulette what response you
[44:26.760 --> 44:31.560]  get because he's got staffers he's got he's got internist he's got whatever
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.760]  you're just getting a pool of kind of Republican libertarian types and some of
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.520]  them you know that work in there verge off into just kind of mainstream patty
[44:41.520 --> 44:46.160]  cake world who were just kind of into the whole rock star thing of Ron Paul and
[44:46.160 --> 44:50.280]  they think hey if he just said new guy ran he'd get elected the neocons would
[44:50.280 --> 44:54.960]  be for him in a minute but that's not what this is all about Ron Paul is
[44:54.960 --> 45:02.840]  successful Ron Paul is admired Ron Paul is loved because he's real because he
[45:02.840 --> 45:10.600]  doesn't compromise because he's a good person and because he stands for what
[45:10.600 --> 45:14.320]  he believes in and even if you're more of a big government type you know those
[45:14.320 --> 45:17.480]  people a lot of them still respecting because they know he is a man of
[45:17.480 --> 45:21.680]  integrity and so is Rand and so is most of his crew and it's high level people
[45:21.680 --> 45:27.120]  the head of his congressional office is an amazing guy who we've interviewed over
[45:27.120 --> 45:29.560]  the years by the way we should probably try to get him on I probably try to call
[45:29.560 --> 45:33.480]  him up again that's a side issue the point is is that there's all these low
[45:33.480 --> 45:40.280]  level people and middlemen and gatekeepers that are there in the strata
[45:40.280 --> 45:45.200]  who who behind the scenes are even like yeah we wish sometimes Ron would
[45:45.200 --> 45:50.680]  compromise but that's what makes him great almost in a condescending way so
[45:50.680 --> 45:55.120]  Ron Paul is surrounded around by a bunch of people the good the bad and the ugly
[45:55.120 --> 45:59.680]  mainly the good who are all giving him his two cents worth and you've got Rand
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.120]  quoted in our article with links to where he said it saying that he would be
[46:04.120 --> 46:09.000]  incredibly honored to be asked to be on any Republican VP ticket when asked by
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.320]  reporters Rand Paul said a Tea Party favorite that his response would be of
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.800]  Romney approached him about the offer of VP he hardly poured cold water on the
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.440]  idea I don't know if I can answer that question but I can say it would be an
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.680]  honor to be considered said Senator Paul just a classy gentlemanly thing to say
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.680]  but showing yeah I'm interested in that and then you've got similar comments by
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.560]  Jesse Benton about Rand Paul in here the new debate is is there a secret
[46:36.560 --> 46:42.680]  alliance between the Ron Paul and Mitt Romney campaign and Romondo's article
[46:42.680 --> 46:46.400]  goes through a lot of evidence to that and by alliance this happens a lot where
[46:46.400 --> 46:50.120]  they'll team up and attack one person and attack each other late later so that
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.600]  this is why it's so complex is that just good strategy from Ron Paul to be
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.000]  shooting down Santorum and then Romney later and that's what he's always done
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.440]  is he's targeted that doesn't mean he's for Mitt Romney so people could be
[47:04.440 --> 47:08.480]  misinterpreting that Romondo could be misinterpreting that his final
[47:08.480 --> 47:12.560]  summation is he doesn't think he is maybe he's right he's a smart guy it's up to
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.280]  you to make that decision then we get into the whole other debate that's why
[47:16.280 --> 47:23.680]  this is so complex of is it good instead of just losing and being cheated or
[47:23.680 --> 47:30.960]  whatever to take a VP run from Mitt Romney and bring all those voters in
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.560]  defeat Barack Obama and now have Ron Paul with a bully pulpit to be able to
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.280]  at least inject some sanity well three things come into play I don't think
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.320]  Mitt Romney's gonna do that even though this is the evidence shows being
[47:43.320 --> 47:46.920]  discussed behind the scenes and being offered to Ron Paul if he plays ball and
[47:46.920 --> 47:51.120]  doesn't run third-party I think they'll betray Ron Paul let me just say I think
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.760]  this is all a bad idea my gut tells me that but I know why the Paul campaign is
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.040]  looking at all options and they clearly are does that mean Ron Paul is gonna go
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.640]  with the bad idea no but it means some of the people below him who are younger
[48:03.640 --> 48:08.200]  and don't have his wisdom are certainly chomping at the bit at this because they
[48:08.200 --> 48:13.040]  get to go on they get to be in the vice president's office if you're Jesse Benton
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.040]  if you're Rachel Mills if you're these people you get to be in the White House
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.280]  so what are you gonna advise Ron Paul on and I know he's wise enough to still
[48:23.280 --> 48:27.480]  take counsel to bounce ideas around but but but they think it's enough of a
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.280]  discussion not Mills as she's heard as an example Benton does to have said
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.720]  things like this repeatedly about Rand Paul and maybe that is a step up maybe
[48:36.720 --> 48:41.600]  Benton's right I'm just stating all angles here because I can tell you that's
[48:41.600 --> 48:45.440]  what's going on in their brains this isn't oh my gosh Ron Paul's bad some
[48:45.440 --> 48:48.920]  people are discussing him running his VP when he hasn't done that it's some of
[48:48.920 --> 48:54.760]  his people have when asked over and over again was it out of turn is it wrong we
[48:54.760 --> 48:58.600]  don't know we'll ask Ron Paul next time he's on whether she better believe it
[48:58.600 --> 49:05.000]  now and by the way this keeps developing and I don't get an answer I'll just go
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.120]  to a rally or go to a campaign event I'll just go there and you know with the
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.360]  microphone it's pretty easy or I'll just send my fleets out of you know info
[49:12.360 --> 49:17.800]  warriors so I've been watching this for a month sitting back reserving judgment
[49:17.800 --> 49:22.320]  just because it was a quagmire that hadn't been officially entered yet but
[49:22.320 --> 49:27.160]  now it's one of the big national stories it's in hundreds of papers today and so
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.520]  we're here debating we're discussing it so I don't think that Romney would
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.520]  actually having then the question is if he would would that be a co-opting because
[49:34.520 --> 49:38.440]  as the economy implodes we want to be as far away from this power structure so we
[49:38.440 --> 49:42.240]  don't get blamed for it I mean he wouldn't be able to really change much in
[49:42.240 --> 49:45.560]  there with Romney because Romney's a globalist bought and paid for by
[49:45.560 --> 49:50.440]  Goldman Sachs money so I think this is a double-cross and I think it's Romney
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.840]  people trying to play the Paul campaign I don't think they're playing Benton I
[49:54.840 --> 49:58.840]  think he's a good guy overall I don't think they're playing Paul I don't think
[49:58.840 --> 50:04.400]  they're playing Rand I think Rand and all them are playing nice because they
[50:04.400 --> 50:07.800]  know in Washington if you make it personal then they'll come after you ten
[50:07.800 --> 50:12.080]  times harder it's kind of like Obi-Wan Kenobi so I have trust in Paul I just
[50:12.080 --> 50:15.640]  know this is going to be used as a wedge now to try to take the sheen off Paul
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.160]  that he's this maverick who never compromises that's like when a Bilderberg
[50:19.160 --> 50:24.260]  guy created a super pack for Ron Paul obviously you know as a way to make him
[50:24.260 --> 50:29.480]  look bad as a big sick Joe at one level and at another level they want to laws a
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.560]  fair libertarian thing after they've collapsed up so they can then say hey

[54:09.520 --> 54:14.240]  okay so I've tried to give you full spectrum information I know you're
[54:14.240 --> 54:17.200]  thinking a lot of similar things probably have your own points you're gonna
[54:17.200 --> 54:21.240]  make and we'll take 30 minutes of calls when we start the next hour on this
[54:21.240 --> 54:31.200]  subject at 800 at 25 at 9 92 31 but I know that Ron Paul has come on this show
[54:31.200 --> 54:37.040]  over the years even though the media has demonized him for it even though I know
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.160]  some of his crew have said you know don't do it play it safe because he isn't
[54:41.160 --> 54:45.000]  a compromiser and he appreciates people that love liberty and people that have
[54:45.000 --> 54:55.200]  supported him for 16 plus years the issue is though if they start going more
[54:55.200 --> 55:01.280]  mainstream if his if his minions start trying to get him to go more mainstream
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.600]  you have to understand I don't think Ron Paul will do that and again I don't
[55:05.600 --> 55:16.720]  think at the end of the day it is bad for Ron Paul to entertain at least on the
[55:16.720 --> 55:24.640]  surface parlays for him to be VP I think that should be a debate and I think it
[55:24.640 --> 55:27.760]  shows how prominent the Liberty movement's become and it shows that he
[55:27.760 --> 55:30.640]  really is the guy that's winning all these states they're having to steal it
[55:30.640 --> 55:35.480]  from and they know that if he runs third-party that's the only way they
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.800]  would give him a VP is they understand that if he runs third-party they will
[55:39.800 --> 55:43.600]  create a wild card and that even with election fraud he's going to be there
[55:43.600 --> 55:47.840]  for another six months after these primaries and all this is over in the
[55:47.840 --> 55:53.640]  middle of the campaign covering real issues and in national debates they
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.960]  won't be able to shut him out they are horrified of that and you can kind of
[55:58.960 --> 56:02.840]  lock him up like Uncle Fester like they've done Joe Biden if they did make
[56:02.840 --> 56:07.720]  him a VP but my gut says it's the Romney and big Republican machine which they
[56:07.720 --> 56:12.400]  admit has tried to co-opt Rand and others and failed in their trying to
[56:12.400 --> 56:16.680]  co-op Ron Paul and I'm guarantee that they've been told sell out on some issues
[56:16.680 --> 56:19.960]  will make you VP and I'll guarantee you Ron Paul said no I don't even need to
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.080]  ask him I'll ask him we get him back on air I'm just chomping at the bit to do
[56:23.080 --> 56:27.200]  it I'm not that chomping I haven't called anybody yet I've just sent an email
[56:27.200 --> 56:31.160]  every other day but I'm gonna make some phone calls today because I want to I
[56:31.160 --> 56:37.080]  want to get a response on all this gosh I got Rand Paul's home number Ron Paul's
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.920]  home number I never even call these I've got most his family's phone numbers I've
[56:41.920 --> 56:47.600]  got the congressional his congressional heads phone number who I know sends me
[56:47.600 --> 56:53.240]  emails and listen to the show so I've got to call Jeff up that's the answer no
[56:53.240 --> 56:56.200]  rest for those seeking liberty and freedom I tell you it just gives me a
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.240]  headache and again I'm not even enamored with the whole presidential system I'm
[57:00.240 --> 57:05.080]  not I'm one of those people that's had success gained some notoriety met a lot
[57:05.080 --> 57:08.720]  of Hollywood people and I've learned it's just I guess I was a little starstruck
[57:08.720 --> 57:11.960]  a decade ago when I was first put in a few movies and stuff people approached
[57:11.960 --> 57:15.600]  me and put me in some films Rick Linklater and others you know being in a
[57:15.600 --> 57:18.920]  film you know shooting scenes with Keanu Reeves with no writer and Woody
[57:18.920 --> 57:22.880]  Harrelson you know but I mean knowing Charlie Sheen knowing people even
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.960]  bigger than Charlie Sheen but I mean now it's just all I want freedom I just
[57:27.960 --> 57:31.840]  want to be able to fly and not have somebody grab my genitals I mean really
[57:31.840 --> 57:35.480]  it for all of you that have Madison Avenue controlling you and thinking oh
[57:35.480 --> 57:39.600]  you never reached and success because you don't know anybody famous or people
[57:39.600 --> 57:42.280]  even get invited to low-level dinners with the Congress people that are
[57:42.280 --> 57:46.800]  traders but they're so starstruck they'll sell out just to be in an event with
[57:46.800 --> 57:50.840]  what's powerful what's what's what's powerful is having healthy happy
[57:50.840 --> 57:55.600]  children what's powerful is loving God quite frankly if I never meet another
[57:55.600 --> 57:58.840]  Hollywood person if I never meet another famous person quite frankly I've
[57:58.840 --> 58:02.400]  never talked to another congressman again I could care less I would love to
[58:02.400 --> 58:07.440]  just live on a ranch and oil paint all day and and and raise crops and cattle
[58:07.440 --> 58:12.640]  and have a couple donkeys and horses and you know quite frankly drive down the
[58:12.640 --> 58:18.920]  road and shoot road signs with shotguns just joking not really but well I mean
[58:18.920 --> 58:24.960]  I again but I can see how a lot of folks in his campaign as I'm putting myself in
[58:24.960 --> 58:28.840]  their mindset I can see how a lot of them it's just the idea of we'll join the
[58:28.840 --> 58:32.960]  power and we'll change things women then and Ron Paul come on you can do it you
[58:32.960 --> 58:36.160]  can do what's needed I mean that's the debates that are happening because they
[58:36.160 --> 58:44.960]  they haven't gotten real power yet they haven't experienced it this is GCN the
[58:44.960 --> 58:55.560]  Genesis communications radio network when you're out on the road the last place you

[1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:13.600]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:23.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:29.080]  all right for the next 30 minutes we're taking your phone calls one after the
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:32.600]  other with what you think about the establishment media saying hey there's
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:37.160]  discussion of Ron Paul running his VP under Romney yeah they're gonna steal the
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:40.800]  election and defrauding but they're gonna let him run VP I think it's all a
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:45.640]  co-opting by Romney that's what my gut is the question is is it bad for people
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:50.640]  in his campaign to even be discussing it and I don't think so but I tried to go
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:54.080]  over all the facets and what could be going to their minds and what's
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:56.880]  happening but it just shows how the Liberty Movement's grown how powerful
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:01.160]  it is you saw what happened with Rand Paul let's go to Sarah then Justin then
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:06.080]  Nicholas then Andrew and then Hunter Sarah you're on the air welcome hi thank
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:11.200]  you for taking my call and it's a pleasure to speak with you a new subscriber
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:17.000]  in January for my birthday and your site has a wealth of information everybody
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:22.720]  should take advantage of that I think a bigger question is who is Ron Paul's
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:28.600]  running mate going to be I suggest Judge Napolitano but definitely he can
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:32.960]  consider the idea of being vice president it is an honor but it would be a
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:39.000]  disgrace to what Ron Paul stands for and has stood for for many years I think
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  he should stay on the outside with us if anybody but him makes it into the
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:51.680]  presidency that's what I'm thinking you know my gut is don't do it because I
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:55.240]  mean it'd be one thing of Mitt Romney wasn't a complete globalist I mean it
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:59.080]  was something like Ronald Reagan who had some good traits it'd be alright but I
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:03.960]  mean Mitt Romney has been for abortion open borders now he's changed but carbon
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:10.840]  taxes gun control I mean he's Obama from the Republican Party and again these
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:15.440]  are people stealing the election from him right now I think it's all smoke and
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.320]  mirrors and they're trying to manipulate folks in his campaign and I'm not
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.400]  saying that manipulation has happened but I mean I've seen things about yeah
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:26.920]  people ought to consider all the candidates ought to consider Rand well
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:30.720]  you can't have Ron Paul with his son as his VP and you can't have two people
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:34.840]  from the same state I mean I know he lives in Kentucky but it's a serious
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:38.560]  issue and I appreciate your call good point Sarah I'll say this by the way
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:41.400]  people get confused when I hear folks calling and say I'm a subscriber that's
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.080]  prisonplanet.tv for the nightly news the video the daily radio show all my
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:49.840]  films and more of course info wars.com is free and the audio streams are free as
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:53.560]  well but thank you sir we couldn't do it without you Justin in Missouri you're on
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:59.120]  the air welcome. Hey thanks for taking the call I just want to say that I don't
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:04.800]  think Ron Paul would do this he's a rock salad guy but if he does I will call it
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:08.720]  filling out and I will withdraw my support and take down every video I've
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:15.480]  published in every piece of support I've given. Yeah I don't think it's gonna
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:20.160]  happen and again I'll talk to Paul as soon as we get him back on the air is
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:23.520]  that in a few times before when you know he's not on a month and I got a
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.200]  back to make phone calls I know they're really busy too it's just that I'm
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.480]  chomping at the bit because this is the kind of question like I was waiting I
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:33.880]  think to talk about it because this has been going on for months now until I
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:37.840]  could get him on and asking because I don't just want to sit here and have a
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:43.480]  big drama it's just that now there's more and more people in his campaign kind
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:47.120]  of acting like this this could be discussed I'm like it like this might
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:51.440]  be something good I agree with you this is this is not something that's good I
[1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:57.040]  mean what B co-opted I mean you're not gonna I mean you cannot join with evil
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:02.120]  to make evil good you see what I'm saying never works never works and I'll
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:06.280]  tell you what I like I said I put out hundreds of videos have thousands of
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:10.840]  subscribers and and I'll do my best to have them all follow me should this
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:17.080]  happen but I don't think it will yeah let's be clear that I mean exactly and
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:20.760]  I appreciate your call and that's one reason the media is hyping this is they
[1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:23.600]  keep saying when are you gonna drop out Ron Paul when you're gonna drop out
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:26.760]  you're not really a Republican you're gonna run third party they're trying to
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:31.520]  make everybody just forget him and and you know what you get asked thousands
[1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:35.160]  of questions you're gonna have something like Benton occasionally said oh you
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:39.560]  know it'd be an honor if Rand Paul or somebody else got you know asked me VP
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:44.160]  because you know again in the beltway even if you're a libertarian and that
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:47.440]  success oh you're being brought into a coalition government that's kind of a
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:51.480]  parliamentary type thought system but but I agree it'll go over like a lead
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:55.960]  balloon and Ron Paul's mystique will go down the drain if he ever works with
[1:04:55.960 --> 1:05:04.720]  Mitt Romney a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:08.680]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:13.200]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:16.520]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:21.640]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:26.240]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:31.040]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:23.320]  okay if you just joined us it is Thursday the 23rd day 23rd day of
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:33.280]  February 2012 I'm on my way to Orlando Florida TSA free no out of their
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:39.560]  jurisdiction unsworn quasi peace officers trying to grope my family but I
[1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:43.440]  have seen police randomly pulling over vehicles and searching them all the way
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:47.560]  here this country is really turning into a sad joke we have the largest prison
[1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:51.160]  population and the government ships the drugs in and then idiots that are done
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:55.160]  enough to use them give the government a pretext to treat us all like it's a
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:09:00.240]  giant prison I don't blame folks that are leaving this country it's really
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:04.280]  really sad what this nation's turned into but I'm taking the long trek here
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:08.440]  from the road to be able to visit a few stations one in Dallas and now one in
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:12.360]  Florida and also speak to two crowds kind of a beta test of what become or
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:16.840]  what may become larger trips in the future I don't know what it is about
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:22.360]  when I'm on the road but I tend to like kind of mumble sometimes and I'm just
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:29.240]  now getting accustomed to being here on the air doing broadcast from the road
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:36.520]  but I tend to be a little a bit more not so much lethargic but relaxed which I
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:41.440]  guess in a way is a good thing compared to my a manic type mindset that I get
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:45.920]  into when I'm there in the studio here is some of the top stories that we haven't
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:50.480]  even gotten to yet Pentagon says US citizens accused of supporting terrorism
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.400]  can be assassinated and they're saying that if you even give money to a charity
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:59.480]  I guess like doctors without borders or others that they could connect to
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:04.320]  supporting a group that the banks running our country call enemies that you
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.200]  can be killed including here in the United States secretly arrested secretly
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:11.480]  tortured secretly disappeared so now they're getting around to announcing
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:15.040]  they want to use the NDA against you and they're saying they'll use mercenaries
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:19.520]  Israelis or others to do the killing of course a few years ago I saw quotes in
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:23.120]  the Israeli news where they said we'll assassinate people anywhere we want in
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:27.320]  the world anytime including Americans in America so more and more we're kind of
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:33.000]  getting the Israeli policy here in the United States continuing here and it's
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.040]  not that I'm an enemy of Israel or hate Israel itself but I don't like Israeli
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.160]  agents coming in and buying off elements of our government and then setting up a
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:47.080]  policy saying I have no sovereignty and they'll kill me in my country if they
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:50.740]  feel like it because they're God you know I kind of like my Bill of Rights and
[1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:55.120]  Constitution imagine if the Ruskies were influencing our government like this
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:00.760]  but instead the British the EU people the UN Israel all these big mega
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:04.240]  corporations the defense contractors they just use this country like a
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:10.200]  latrine or something and then my property rights my Constitution it's all
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:15.480]  destroyed my taxes are raised to pay for their empire and I'm tired of it and
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:20.080]  the Israelis in mass are protesting and demonstration and having huge
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:24.280]  demonstrations in some cases over 70% of the Republic don't want these wars it's
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:27.680]  just these these elements running all of our countries want this and I've had
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:32.040]  enough of it so Pentagon says US citizens accused of supporting terrorism
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:37.680]  can be assassinated unvaccinated kids banned from Indiana school due to measles
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.880]  outbreak now I thought if you've had the measles shots you're so you're
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:48.440]  protected but see now they have panics if one person gets measles and shut down
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:51.800]  school but when you take the shot and actually get measles from it as you do
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:54.920]  about a third of the time that's a non-issue so it's all about a bunch of
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.520]  panic attack making a big drama queen issue out of stuff that articles at
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:04.680]  info wars.com document proves DHS is monitoring social media for government

[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:24.800]  alliance with Mitt Romney info wars.com story we're gonna get red link for
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:32.840]  folks Ron Paul highlights from the last debate last night feds new rules written
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:37.320]  behind closed doors info wars nightly news Kurt Haskell new video out witness
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:42.560]  to government falls flag part two we sent Rob do to Michigan to Detroit to
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:45.760]  actually interview him so it's high quality it's very powerful now I'm gonna
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:49.840]  go back to your calls for those that missed the first hour the Washington
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:53.560]  Post hundreds of publications it's big news today are saying that behind the
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:58.040]  scenes Mitt Romney is basically reaching out to Paul about a VP run a I don't
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:03.400]  believe that if he is doing it it's to betray Paul because he knows that he's
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:11.120]  the real winner of this whole situation that's what's really going on so the
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:14.720]  very system that's stealing these primaries from Ron Paul on record is
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:19.600]  not gonna make him VP a I think that's going on B I think the Washington Post
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:23.480]  and others are making a big deal out of this to make it look like Ron Paul is
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:29.120]  going to compromise and sell out to kill his image of a stalwart independent who
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:33.160]  doesn't ever compromise Ron Paul is not gonna compromise and run VP with Mitt
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:36.400]  Romney I can tell you that right now just like I told you a year before he
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:41.000]  announced this presidential run he would do it just like I told you ran Paul
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:47.400]  would win I can look at the situation and tell you what's gonna happen one
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.960]  more point I need to make I don't have the power cord for this central
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:54.680]  computer that we're on Skype with and it's gonna go out of power here by the
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:59.120]  next segment if we don't do that I can see Rick I can see Richard are on the
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:02.800]  road engineer right out there listening to us and I'm waving at him hey buddy
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:08.600]  how you doing side issue as I like to say segue there back to your calls that
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:12.040]  said though this is becoming a big issue you know will Ron Paul do this or
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:16.480]  will Rand Paul do this Jesse Benton has said you know Rand Paul is the smartest
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:20.400]  guy in the room and you know anybody would want to have him as their VP and
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:26.200]  Rand has said he'd be honored so I think that's just being gentlemanly when
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:30.240]  they say that but I think it's a bad idea and I don't think Ron Paul would do
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  it in the final equation I don't think Rand would either because they're not
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:36.600]  gonna have their will to liberty subverted and they're not gonna sell out
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:41.720]  these are men of integrity but it is a big issue that we're discussing here
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:46.440]  today and let's go back to your phone calls until about 40 after them we'll
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:50.160]  get Jeffrey Smith on because I need to get to these calls Nicholas in Illinois
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:56.320]  you're on the air welcome Alex I love how your show is so human it just shows
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:02.240]  your actual person my personal opinion on the Ron Paul situation is as you well
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:06.840]  know this is not his first Rodale so I trust his campaign or what he's doing
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:12.080]  and I'm going to have to disagree with the first two callers he's you know he's
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:15.960]  a chess player he's thinking many moves ahead and that's what you need to do to
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:20.000]  stay in the game he's thinking worst-case scenario so worst-case scenario
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:25.800]  he does get off of the VP me personally I say take it because it's under the
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:29.760]  philosophy of a ninja you might be outpowered or outnumbered but you
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:34.120]  run away and swallow pride and live the fight it on the day and we need him in
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:38.640]  politics to be injecting serious issues as you said before even he doesn't get
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:43.720]  the nomination well listen if look but I guarantee you that this is what I'm
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:50.000]  saying it's meant to become a political distraction so that people think he might
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:56.520]  sell out because that's how it's seen by some okay and it's also you know meant
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:01.080]  to imply that these two are working together against Santorum and I don't
[1:16:01.080 --> 1:16:04.800]  see a system that's gonna steal primaries from him ever doing that and
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:09.720]  giving him that bully pulpit so you know that's my reason that I say that I
[1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:15.240]  think it's a bad idea now if I saw Ron Paul go for it and he gave me his
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:20.880]  reasons for it and they made sense then I might entertain the idea but my gut
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:26.440]  tells me run from this Ron Paul run from this I can understand why some of the
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:30.520]  people in his campaign might say who that sounds interesting because they're
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.920]  young and they want to go work at the White House they want to work for the
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:37.640]  vice president but Ron Paul has not fought for almost 40 years never
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.480]  compromising to do this now and so I think it's a non-issue at the end of the
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:44.640]  day but I mean we flesh it out we've covered a lot of angles of it and we're
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:49.440]  we're getting your perspectives good points anything else and Nicholas this
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:52.840]  little thing the market eyes has a new show on vocal calm and I think a lot of
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:56.800]  truthers need to do their own shows get the word out there it's good alternative
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:02.200]  media to use against them in their own system it is mark is just a wonderful
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:08.800]  person it does a great job let's go ahead and talk to Hunter Ian Florida
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:13.960]  you're on the air go ahead hey Alex I'll see you Sunday I look forward to it I
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:17.920]  just want a couple points on Ron Paul that people may not have heard that the
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:21.920]  media did not publicize only one-third of Republican people actually voted in
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:26.800]  Florida that's number one and I literally just heard an hour and just over an
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:31.120]  hour ago that our local ABC affiliate was talking about the debates last night
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:34.840]  that not one candidate talked about the birth control issue and that was
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:39.000]  actually incorrect because Ron Paul did address it and he addressed it directly
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:44.840]  and and the third the third point with Ron Paul is is I hope he's planning on
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:48.680]  focusing on you know because the establishment the way they work of
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:54.080]  getting his independent in line and working as an independent because I
[1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:58.640]  think that we need to make sure that the left-right paradigm does not continue
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:02.520]  and these debates of the Democrat Republicans don't continue and having
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.680]  him on the front line debating of the left-right paradigm in the end of the
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:14.000]  game will show a lot of people and awaken a lot more people I totally agree
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:17.200]  with you and I appreciate what you've said here I'm gonna get Lou Rockwell on
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:23.240]  tomorrow if we can I'm gonna fire the bat search line up into the sky and see
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:26.840]  we can get him on maybe even the day and just go into the fourth hour
[1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:32.560]  that even try that because this is so important we need to get his perspective
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:36.680]  because he was the former head of the congressional office and of the first
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:40.000]  congressional run another issues good friends with Ron Paul he can give us the
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:43.960]  deep inside skinny and I'll tell you right now he's gonna say I don't think
[1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:48.600]  Ron Paul is gonna do that but if he did it's because he's been guaranteed he
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:53.240]  can act autonomously and if Ron Paul comes out and says I've been told I can
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:59.040]  be VP and do and say whatever I want well then that's a different subject and
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:01.880]  then Ron Paul would say and do what he wanted but I'll guarantee Ron Paul's a
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:04.840]  man of his word so they'd come to him and say well promise you'll do what the
[1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:09.000]  president says we'll make a VP I'll say no so it's not gonna happen but but
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.360]  because this is a big issue now and because it will be used against Ron
[1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:17.880]  Paul like the whole Bilderberg thing on a Bilderberg attendee big libertarian guy
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:22.800]  a mainline libertarian the guy that created a bunch of different websites
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:29.760]  and systems like PayPal new money he created a super PAC and it's supporting
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:33.840]  Ron Paul and everybody's like it's Bilderberg they're supporting him well he
[1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:37.880]  doesn't control what people create super PACs and do I mean is that done
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:41.600]  deliberately to make him look bad probably not it's probably done because

[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:18.440]  I just talked to Richard Raves who's worked as a delegate and more stall
[1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:22.120]  relief for many years fighting for Ron Paul and he said look they're just
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:24.640]  trying to damage him that's why the media is covering this that's why they're
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:31.280]  getting into it and Ron Paul is not gonna do that and I agree with him it's
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.360]  just they can take statements by his campaign people you know about oh yes
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:40.520]  you know Ron Paul would be great in there or you know little you know cutesy
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:46.920]  stuff with Romney and they can use that against him but again Ron Paul says
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:52.240]  it's himself he is only a focal point of liberty just like I am just like so many
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.720]  others are just like you are he's just the biggest focal point all over the
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:01.640]  world they're trying to black him out because people are looking at what he
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:11.840]  stands for and using it as an example of freedom across the planet and it's a
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:17.360]  bellwether it's a barometer it's a gauge and the fact that the system would be
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:22.080]  dangling that in front of Ron Paul only shows the success he said so I have
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:28.120]  total confidence in Ron Paul I have total confidence in Rand Paul but we're
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:31.280]  taking your calls on this subject because it is the type of complex issue I
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:35.520]  like to cover so we can really think and get a different angles of this
[1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:41.200]  Jeffrey Smith is going to be joining us expert on GMO we're continuing with your
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:49.880]  calls right now who's up next here? Greg in New York? Greg in New York I'm good
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:55.280]  welcome thank you I was just named delegate for Ron Paul 23rd congressional
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:00.760]  district here in New York State I've worked so hard for this man that I can't
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:04.720]  believe for a second that Jesse or anyone would really try to talk when
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:08.320]  taking the VP it just it just would go against everything that that this man
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:13.320]  has stood up for and in person Alex I just don't see it I see Ron taking this
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:17.920]  all the way in upstate New York we're we're right up here and we've got so
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:23.320]  many followers and they just can't keep they can't keep us down and with Ron
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:28.760]  going with Mitt it's oil and water it would you would just never work and
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:32.560]  even with Rand Rand has too many principalities too much of his own man
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:38.920]  and I can't see him bowing down to the to the elite as well what are your
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:45.040]  thoughts? No I think that's what's happening and then I think Rand says oh
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.800]  I'd be honored to be considered you know first he said well I don't know if I
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:52.360]  can really speak to this but you know I'd be honored to be considered you know
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:56.280]  it's an honor to be considered yeah to be the vice president of America you know
[1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:59.960]  he sees that as he's very polite he's very nice like they're gonna be into
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:05.280]  DA's like now do my colleagues know this subsection says it can secretly arrest
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:10.480]  citizens I know you don't want to get rid of habeas corpus and basic liberties
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:14.400]  that I know you don't want to overthrow the American system and then
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:17.680]  meanwhile Lindsey Graham and all of them are like yes we do we're gonna do it I
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:21.520]  mean literally acting like that so I think it's a lot of high road behavior
[1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:27.760]  and Ron Paul and Rand have both been criticized for their gentle ways I mean
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:30.240]  I was watching the other night we played a clip of it on the nightly news last
[1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:33.880]  week because we watched like 30 minutes of it to find the clip of him hitting
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.280]  our home run I'm trying to find the clip where he knocked it out of the park but
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:42.000]  the clip on YouTube didn't have that that congressional baseball game and I
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.720]  was just watching his mannerisms and everything and it's just kind of like a
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.920]  non-assuming you know almost a nerdliness but just real polite real
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:56.640]  friendly real game you know the business you know get the job done and that's just
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:01.240]  how they are so they just don't start really being mean to people until if you
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:03.920]  say something nasty to them then they'll come back at you they're just
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:08.000]  gentlemanly but I think that attracts more people than it turns folks off and
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.680]  you know we'd like to see a little more fire we'd like to see a little more
[1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:14.360]  attack maybe there should be more of that but we're not in the arena at that
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.680]  level but I mean what do you think the one I've said here honey than you can
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:23.600]  with a vinegar and I think that's the good doctor he's just pure trades
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:27.720]  himself and carries himself to be such a gentleman and such a founding father and
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:31.680]  and he's a figure you know he's a figurehead and he and he realizes how
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:35.360]  important he is to people's lives and he doesn't let it goes to his head and you
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:38.520]  know I've met him a couple of times not like you obviously but working his
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:43.920]  campaigns and in town halls and he's just I've met Bill Russell and sports
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:47.720]  stars I used to chef in Arizona and I've never been starstruck until I met
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:53.680]  dr. Paul and I'll leave it that Alex I'm a prison-planning TV subscriber you are

[1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:05.960]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:09.920]  meal that was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:14.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:18.280]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all

[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:04.000]  now he'll be joining us as I come to you here from the road this is great today
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.520]  no hiccups on the road as it normally does we had a few hiccups the last few
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:12.160]  days and I'm told listeners and stations say that it was just a little bit of
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:15.760]  hiccups and kind of made it more exciting it's kind of when you're
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:19.520]  watching the news and you see like a problem or a light go out or that time
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:22.680]  Hillary was on 60 minutes they released the tape and the light falls on her it
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.720]  kind of it's kind of fun to watch the train wreck when you're not part of it
[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:29.400]  huh wasn't a train wreck though it's kind of a bump in the road mainly a
[1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:32.960]  couple bumps in the road kind of like some of these highways I drive around the
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:38.920]  country more now on the roads are falling apart the more money they spend the
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:42.400]  more they fall apart as of all the scams and dollar devaluation now we got
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.760]  Jeffrey Smith coming up here in just a moment but let's jam in these callers
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:51.720]  on their take on the establishment trying to dangle the idea of Ron Paul
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:55.200]  taking a VP slot after they steal the election from him if they're able to do
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:35:01.480]  that Daniel in Texas give us your take yeah Alex before I get to my Ron Paul
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:05.160]  question just wanted to suggest the name mockingbird media for the mainstream
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:09.280]  media both as an homage to operation mockingbird and also the way that they
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:16.720]  parrot each other's talking points that's a good idea I think mockingbird
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:20.520]  media it's got a good ring to it but I know time is limited let me get to my
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:24.640]  questions but Ron Paul my concern is that they're going to dangle up the VP slot
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:28.840]  but rather a convention speaking slot and maybe altering the party platform to
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:32.720]  include an audit of the Fed and as we head into the possibility of a brokered
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:36.360]  convention where Rick Santorum and Duke English combined delegates that Romney
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:40.480]  may need Ron Paul delegates my fear is that Ron Paul won't get a VP slot in
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:43.960]  exchange for putting it Romney over the top but rather they'll get a party
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:47.320]  platform which I'll then turn their back on and a speaker slot which while
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:51.480]  valuable really isn't that much and I guess there's an addendum to those
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:55.880]  questions I could just put in these put in these two questions on the on the
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:59.440]  topic of Iran and anti-imperialism Ron Paul has been an absolute leader on
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:03.560]  opposing this what concerns me is that he hasn't directly attacked it Romney
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:07.720]  both for his warmongering his neocon cabinet that he's establishing you know
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:11.400]  Romney has been the leading warmonger in many of these debates it disappoints
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:16.840]  no that's the one thing I don't think Ron Paul has been attacking Mitt Romney
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:21.440]  enough and I just want to say something right now Daniel in Texas should be
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:26.880]  hosting this show in in 30 seconds he said what I tried to say in an hour and
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:30.240]  that was all the points I even wrote notes this morning that I wanted to
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:33.560]  cover I didn't get to half of them because instead I got into like background
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:37.800]  and you know how I know you know these people and know they're real and what
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:41.840]  can be affecting them and let's get inside their minds yes it's going towards
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:46.960]  a brokered convention that's admitted Romney may need Paul and so that's why
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.280]  if they do need him they're trying to be friendly and I think some of the
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:53.920]  people lower down not Paul but some of people that get the work done have
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:57.560]  become enamored and they've made some enamored statements of Romney and I
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.480]  think the fact that they know Ron Paul's retiring their jobs are going away in a
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:07.280]  year or less you know when he steps down from Congress that you know they kind of
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:12.200]  want some lifeboats and so Ron Paul doesn't end up selling out but some of
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.000]  the people that work for him I don't want to call it selling out but
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.080]  compromise to an extent and I don't think Ron Paul should let that happen he's a
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:25.080]  very nice person to people that are close to him and I understand that people
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:29.040]  that are married to the family and other things it's just that I think you can't
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:32.480]  let that get in the way you can't be too nice to meant Romney he's attacking
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:37.320]  some he's run some ads against him but we need to see major attacks on Romney
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:41.400]  now from Ron Paul and I think that's a great point you make the point about the
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:44.120]  broken convention that's what they're dangling now okay we'll give you an
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:47.760]  audit the Fed it's some whitewashed you know nothing where the Fed sets up a
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:50.640]  blue ribbon committee and says okay give us more power that's what they did a few
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:55.880]  years ago not a what in the financial you know overhaul not what Paul proposed
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:37:59.520]  but what they ended up having and so you're right on that you're right on
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:05.840]  every facet of what you just said and so I can see the perspective of some of the
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:09.640]  people in his campaign you know saying well look if we're talking about them
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:13.440]  stealing it from us which is clearly going on you know let's not be sore
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:16.240]  losers or then we may not even get anything on the platform well the
[1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:20.680]  Republican platform of Texas reads like Alex Jones wrote it but they don't
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:25.600]  follow one stinking piece of it that's the same thing nationally the platform's
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:29.520]  got some good stuff in it nothing like Texas they don't follow any of it so
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:33.960]  you're right Ron Paul needs to both barrels attack and savage them and use
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:37.040]  the platform he's got to point out there's no difference and he's been
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:42.040]  doing that to a certain extent but great point sir you know I think you should
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:45.160]  you should shoot a YouTube video and send it to us and we'd air it here
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:50.360]  because your point is very well taken anything else Daniel yeah like to make
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:54.240]  it I think is Ron Paul supporters the job of people now to say for all the
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:57.400]  money and time and effort and organization that people have put in
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:01.560]  don't do this don't end up supporting Mitt Romney because Mitt Romney means
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:05.560]  more wars it means an attack of Iran it means more CIA color revolutions and
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.600]  frankly it means more austerity I think there are many people who are well on
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:14.000]  economics who are pushing the very same tax cuts for Wall Street tax cuts for
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.040]  enforcing 500 and exchange for cuts to social programs in this country and they
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:22.840]  may see Mitt Romney as some pop to go on austerity and I think Ron Paul needs to
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:26.160]  be aware of this and his supporters need to say look don't do this don't don't
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:29.840]  sell out these delegates sure and I mean let's be clear when this becomes a
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:33.600]  national debate and the Republican insiders openly say they're trying to
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:39.080]  co-opt Rand and Ron it's and we're the supporters we're America we're we're the
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:42.480]  people that you know took the great man Ron Paul and put him where he is and he
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:48.720]  said that so it's it's our job to tell his camp followers hey listen we're the
[1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:55.600]  boss not you Ron Paul's the boss not you so don't tell him to moderate he got
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:00.320]  where he is by not moderating what a Barry Goldwater who he admires and who I
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:07.240]  admire as well say you know moderation and defense of liberty is you know is
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:11.400]  not golden especially yellow he was there's a bunch of quotes but he said
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:16.280]  extremism in defense of liberty is no vice and he said silence isn't golden
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:21.360]  it's yellow and so I was conflating a few of his statements but you know we we
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:25.960]  need the globalist or hardcore out of control and then they call us extreme
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:30.240]  no they're extreme great points absolutely devastating call we do have
[1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:36.400]  Jeffrey Smith there with us I don't like to get our callers on and not go to him
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:40.680]  so I'll tell you if you want to give your name and number to John Harmon up
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:44.600]  there at Genesis taking your calls when Lou Rockwell gets on an hour and 20
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:47.440]  minutes we'll just call you back and you'll be the college for Lou Rockwell
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:50.760]  because it'll be on the subject or if you don't want to do that it's fine I
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:54.680]  could whatever just try to get him when I open the phones up at that point Barry
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:59.640]  John Joe Mark and then others obviously coming in just try to get on with Lou
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:02.440]  Rockwell because I'll take about 15 minutes with him at letting him talk
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:05.800]  then I'm gonna take a few calls five or six calls for Lou Rockwell coming up
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:10.400]  we're gonna go to Jeffrey Smith here we carry all of his books films they're all
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:16.520]  amazing if you want to know what's really going on with this whole situation
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:24.560]  what's going on with GMO he is the leading speaker and kind of grand
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:30.360]  conductor of being able to fuse it all together and give you a gestalt analysis
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:34.160]  or briefing on what's going on his information is impeccable I had to
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:40.280]  criticize Jeff Smith in any way it would be he sometimes to be absolutely 100%
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:44.480]  correct holds back a bit because the truth is even worse than what he's
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.400]  saying but so you can you can assure what he's saying is accurate and quite
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:54.200]  frankly worse so we're gonna be talking to him here in just a moment and and
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:57.640]  we're gonna clean the phone lines out now so folks later can call in for him
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:02.520]  when I give the number on GMO and colony collapse disorder and what's
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:05.360]  happening to humans and all the other big environmental problems that are real
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:10.160]  not that let's have a carbon tax that taxes humans for breathing and taxes
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:14.240]  what plants respirate from and then let toxic waste dumping and cross species
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.080]  genetic engineering run wild we're talking to him in a moment but on those
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:21.880]  subjects we have the film in-game blueprint for global enslavement we
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:27.000]  have agenda 21 the green mask you know for the UN takeover available at
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:32.800]  info wars.com we have a films exposing government sponsored terror of course
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:38.000]  like a noble lie the Oklahoma City inside job operation incredible film we
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.120]  also and this is only going for another four or five days until this month ends
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:48.360]  and then it's gone it's gone until next year okay and that is all of my
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:55.720]  documentary films all 18 of them DVDs and Jason Burmese's film I produced
[1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.920]  Invisible Empire a new order to find that is excellent hundreds of clips of
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:03.160]  world leaders calling for global government and new world order and how
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:05.920]  they're gonna take over your life and the state will be God and we're gonna take
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:09.600]  all your property and blah blah blah I mean it's very well done it's the last
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:12.760]  film I produced I've been so busy with doing the news show and setting up all
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:16.800]  these new systems everything I haven't made an official film I mean we've made
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:20.720]  a 40-minute documentary we've premiered in Dallas and we're gonna be premiering
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:26.440]  it again and then putting it for Prison Planet TV next week in Orlando this
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:29.840]  Sunday and by the way that's almost sold out so if you want tickets info wars.com
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:36.080]  for slash events I think there's like a hundred tickets left or maybe less of
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.720]  over a thousand I've told you I've never had a big event that didn't sell out
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:44.840]  Dallas sold out and but by the time I drive out here and fly a crew out to
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:47.680]  film and everything we are basically gonna lose money on this because I'm
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:50.840]  also giving the local radio stations half the money from it just to support
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:54.800]  them for being affiliates so we're losing money on this but and I appreciate
[1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:57.920]  people coming out and financing is being able to do this that's how much this
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:05.840]  stuff is cost and is but the point I'm getting at here is that you can get all
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:12.920]  of my films in a visible empire for over 70% off 99.95 that's 19 films for 99.95

[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:35.760]  today I wanted to do a two-hour interview we cut it to an hour and a half and
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:41.760]  then I got behind but Jeffrey Smith is the author of a whole bunch of books
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:45.680]  genetic roulette you name it all available again at info wars calm see
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:51.440]  support him and us seeds of deception all these great films Monsanto world
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:55.000]  according to Monsanto award-winning I mean this is like I can't even say all
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:00.320]  the awards it's one it's like beyond you know the quality of something like HBO
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:08.000]  available at info wars calm but my point here is that this isn't a game I went
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:14.160]  and did the research GMO is reducing our fertility GMO is doing it and all the
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.480]  other animals they tested on they won't let human tests go on because they want
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:22.320]  to cover this up all the big eugenics as they call for population reduction are
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:26.040]  the ones funding it like Bill Gates buying into Monsanto I've got all the
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:29.280]  government documents about we could build Trojan horses into stuff you know
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:33.320]  30 years ago food water you name it they've done it they're coming out with
[1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:37.080]  new rices and things that reduce your fertility I mean this is not a debate I
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:41.920]  want to get him on about the latest threats from this and then expand into
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:46.600]  some other areas with our guest here because this is the big issue this is
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:50.320]  one of the areas where you can still try to avoid it but not for long they're
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.480]  trying to stop it from being labeled and they're trying to proliferate to every
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:57.320]  food crop there is not just the basic staples so this is the crossroads and
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:02.360]  Jeff Smith joins us Jeffrey good to have you with us what's what's front and
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:05.320]  center on your radar one of the biggest threats right now with this whole
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:10.560]  frank and food takeover well I've been working on a new film Alex and I've been
[1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:16.280]  interviewing veterinarians and pediatricians and other doctors and what
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:22.600]  I'm seeing now is extreme support for our concept the GMOs are causing the rise
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:27.080]  in so many diseases so that's one thing and so I want to talk about autism for
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:31.800]  example and irritable bowel syndrome and other problems and relate them to GMOs
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:36.640]  also we're seeing evidence of a new organism new to science you may have
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:41.280]  reported on it from dr. Huber which might be causing all that infertility
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:44.920]  we're talking about I want to talk about some experiences I'm getting from
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:49.680]  numerous farmers and others about animals spontaneously avoiding GMOs when
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:54.640]  given a choice and when they get on GMOs they get sick or die or have fertility
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.280]  problems and when they get off GMOs there's all sorts of improvements in
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:02.880]  those cysts in those symptoms and I want to talk about also what's happening on
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:07.080]  the ground as we're seeing an upsurge of awareness and concern about GMOs and
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:10.720]  what it means in terms of a way out of this madness and I think you're right on
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:15.360]  about labeling it turns out the expression of concern today is being
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.560]  expressed in I think 18 different states have bills floated about labeling GMOs
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:26.240]  plus there's an initiative in California that can drive it out in a single blow
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:31.280]  amazing and this is the genetic Armageddon this is the real provable thing
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:36.480]  not the system co-opting environmental concern with carbon dioxide I mean
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:39.520]  that's why they do that because they don't want us looking at the real real
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:42.040]  issue and then later I want to ask you from your deep research I know you
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:46.320]  don't speculate why the elite would be doing this when it's blowing back on
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:50.600]  them but we've got some time let's let's get into the first issues up front
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:55.520]  that is a powerful raft of info you just laid out I think we'll start with the
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:49:01.000]  stories of the animals that have been fed GMOs and what's happened to them and
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.440]  what's what changes they've seen when they take them off GMOs and then we can
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:09.520]  work in the autism issue because one of the one of the interviews I conducted
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:14.760]  recently was with Dr. Don Huber and he's been an expert in the impact of
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:19.480]  Roundup Monsanto's herbicide used on Roundup pretty crops and that has put him
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:24.040]  into a situation where he's studying about GMOs so he was speaking in Germany
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:27.880]  and going over the behavioral changes the neurological changes and the
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.160]  physiological changes that we're seeing in animals that are fed GMOs both
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:36.600]  livestock and laboratory animals and a doctor approached him afterwards and
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:41.880]  said you know this is exactly what we're seeing in autistic children so let's go
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:45.920]  into those animal studies those animal experiences and then we'll we'll circle
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:51.400]  back and see if autism may be implicated I talked to someone last week at a
[1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:55.920]  conference in Washington among farmers and he said he had just received a call
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.280]  in December from one of his agricultural clients a farmer who has
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:06.520]  thousands of pigs and he said that the guy was stammering and so excited he
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:11.040]  couldn't hardly get out what he wanted to say and what he eventually unfolded
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:17.600]  was that 11 days previous he took this guy's suggestion and shifted the corn
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:22.280]  that was being fed to his pigs in the nursery to non-genetically modified
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:26.240]  corn now after about three days they noticed the change and him and his
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:29.800]  brothers walked in and they kind of just joked for themselves saying maybe it's
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:35.200]  the non-gmo corn but by the 11th day he placed the call to this man and was so
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:41.600]  excited because he was absolutely sure it was the change to non-gmo corn that
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:46.920]  caused the dramatic change amazing I've been hearing this from farmers myself
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:52.240]  from ten years that their pigs and other smart animals will not eat the GMO
[1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:55.320]  because they have olfactory nerves hundreds of times better than ours a pig
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:50:58.640]  has better than a bloodhound we'll be right back this is incredible
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:04.560]  information stay with us you don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:10.080]  crisis everyone can feel it we know a tectonic struggle is now taking place
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:14.840]  between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness bondage and
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:21.640]  enslavement yes my friends evil is rising but take heart for every action
[1:51:21.640 --> 1:51:26.120]  there is an equal and opposite reaction recently new world order operative
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:30.440]  Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war we are in an
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:35.400]  information war and we are losing that war the globalist are scared they've
[1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:41.520]  overreached the future of the info war is in your hands join prison planet dot

[1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:07.400]  that's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:11.680]  that looks like no one is home don't let your home be the next target make it

[1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:24.320]  you know the problem with Jeffrey M. Smith investigative journalist researcher
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:28.800]  filmmaker author is when he says one point I I can think of like a hundred
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:32.560]  examples of what he's saying being on record I mean here's one of the
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:36.440]  Washington Post makers of genetically modified seeds say more farmers evading
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:41.280]  EPA rules this is from the Washington Post February 13th and you read in there
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:45.880]  and it says oh they're supposed to build a refuge or grow a refuge of corn next
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:51.000]  to their GMO corn because the oh it'll kill all the bugs if they don't have a
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.200]  refuge and they'll also get immunity so this is corn for humans that grow a
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:54:59.440]  natural pesticide but many times stronger but you can't have the bugs eating it so
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:03.480]  they have to have refuges from their own corn and I mean how many studies have
[1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:07.360]  been out all over the world big prestigious ones where you feed it to
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:11.280]  rodents Kenny pigs you name it three generations they're sterile I mean
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:16.360]  Smith covers it in his books with all the scientists so yeah now he's got farmers
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:20.400]  talking about staying this with their livestock I mean look at our disease
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:25.160]  rates Jeff continue going over all of this for people where where you left off
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:29.960]  when we went to break sure and I'll talk about that toxin producing corn
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:33.880]  because there's a new study out that came out last week which has very big
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:38.640]  implications for humans as well as the possibility for linking GMOs to autism
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:44.360]  but getting back to our pig discussion it turns out that this farmer worked as
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:47.960]  the person among his brother brothers he was the one in charge of the nursery
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:51.720]  and for years his brothers would kind of rile him because it was the easiest
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:57.600]  job there was never any problem but 14 years ago things got completely out of
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:56:02.320]  hand and the pigs started getting sick and their behavior changed and that's
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:05.680]  when they started introducing genetically engineered corn but they
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:09.160]  didn't realize that the corn was the problem because at the same time there
[1:56:09.160 --> 1:56:13.080]  were new confined animal feeding operations introduced into the area and
[1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:16.920]  new pigs imported from Canada and elsewhere so they just blamed it on the
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:21.280]  new type of pig but now when they switched for the first time in 14 years
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:26.560]  to non GMO corn they started seeing the pig behavior and health that they had
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:31.920]  seen prior to the introduction of GMOs and he was so excited he said even the
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:36.640]  even the animals would look like they're playing and happy and when he left the
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:41.400]  the nursery they'd still be playing whereas when they were on the GM corn for
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:45.240]  14 years they'd be and when they walked in they'd be agitated but then they'd
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:49.640]  get too tired and just lie down they said the whole level of sickness is less
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:53.840]  and he's going to document the changes because as it he has all the details from
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:58.600]  now is this BT corn because I mean there's different types with bacteria with
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:02.520]  funguses sometimes thousands of times stronger but they say because it's a
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.880]  natural thing that we just soup up and have it grow this way the bugs don't
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:11.240]  eat it but it's safe for you to eat I mean that's a no-brainer no wonder organ
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:15.000]  failure in these studies is off the chart I mean this is this is ridiculous
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.160]  when I heard the story about his pigs it reminded me of a veterinarian I
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:23.760]  interviewed a month earlier he talked about a South African farm where some
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:28.000]  of the pigs were dying and becoming cannibalistic on the GM corn biting each
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.800]  other's ears and tails he said for some it acted like they had Alzheimer's and
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:36.600]  they wandered around the pen couldn't figure out where the food was and died
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:42.880]  all of that reversed when they switched to non GM corn now this behavior of
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:48.720]  being agitated and antisocial it was also discovered in rats that were fed GM
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:53.440]  corn compared to non GM corn for those they were eating the non GM corn you can
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:57.240]  pick them up put them on the shoulder pet them like a pet however those they
[1:57:57.240 --> 1:58:01.400]  were eating the GM corn they were running around scared not involved with
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:06.880]  other animals and they were completely agitated and anxious this was also seen
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:12.480]  in rats fed genetically modified soy by Russian Academy of Sciences researcher
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:17.280]  arena or mikova even a undergraduate student in Holland when he did a study
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:21.240]  on mice found that the mice that were raised on genetically modified soy and
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:26.120]  corn were totally agitated and completely fearful where the other ones acted
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:32.800]  like mice well yeah because if you feed animals plants that are meant to kill
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.560]  bugs what's it gonna do to a larger animal a lot of drug heads take poison
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:51.680]  to get high you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hi this is
[1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:55.600]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:59.120]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:06.560]  true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:10.480]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:14.600]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:19.520]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:23.040]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[1:59:23.040 --> 1:59:26.880]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:31.520]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com

[1:59:38.920 --> 1:59:46.920]  877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[1:59:46.920 --> 1:59:54.920]  starter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com waging war
[1:59:54.920 --> 2:00:08.080]  on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream media
[2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:15.800]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the
[2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:25.360]  gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones you know some
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:29.240]  people out there will say well it's anecdotal evidence that you feed different
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:33.080]  animals things and they become sterile or they become vicious or they become
[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:38.680]  mentally degraded or retarded well if you walk out in front of a truck is an
[2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:43.040]  anecdotal or if you know take cocaine have a heart attack no where it happens
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:45.880]  enough you know this is what it causes you know that they still say cigarettes
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:49.960]  don't give you lung cancer you know that's a lie the point is we have
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:53.240]  literally hundreds and hundreds of studies with a gmo where it's admitted
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:57.040]  to be sterilizing I mean it's most this stuff that you really see the problems
[2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:02.200]  with this meant to kill insects that eat it do you understand ladies and gentlemen
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:06.800]  I mean that's no brainer that's not even two plus two equals four that's this
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:12.200]  kills bugs you're gonna eat it now hmm I'm a conspiracy theorist if I don't want
[2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:17.080]  that this is sort of segment long when coming up journalist filmmaker author
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:21.760]  Jeffrey Smith our guests please continue with the Russian researcher yeah and
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:24.760]  of course you tell the rest of story she's like this is sterilizing all the
[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:28.120]  rats and they go this is gonna sterilize humans she's like well there are too
[2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:32.680]  many humans in the world and then please continue well I think what you're
[2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:36.760]  referring to is when I was on the show a few months ago her and her study she
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:41.120]  fed female rats genetically modified soy and more than half of their babies
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:46.120]  died within three weeks the babies were sterile and the infants were smaller and
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:50.960]  she fed male rats genetically modified soy and the testicles changed from pink
[2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:56.000]  to blue well her boss was pressured from his boss and told her no more gmo
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.320]  studies so someone in her office tried to comfort her by saying well maybe the
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:05.520]  GMO soy will solve the overpopulation problem she was not impressed getting
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:10.680]  back to our animals I also heard last week at this farmer conference a story
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:15.640]  about a cattle farmer that was raising miniature steer just three feet high and
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:21.360]  he was feeding them non-gmo corn but ran out so he got the normal GM corn from a
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:27.840]  local feed mill and within two weeks 90% of his herd died so he rushed to get the
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:33.480]  non-gm corn was able to heal the rest and and they survived now what happened
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:38.800]  with the steer is that they bloated they weren't digesting this was raised
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:43.400]  during a talk and I immediately described what's happening in India with
[2:02:43.400 --> 2:02:49.840]  sheep goats and buffalo they are allowed to graze on BT cotton plants after
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:54.600]  harvest as you know the BT toxin breaks open the stomach of insects and kills
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:59.080]  them it's a built-in pesticide in these genetically engineered crops well
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:04.320]  thousands of sheep goats and buffalo have died and it turns out there's a lot
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:09.360]  of evidence suggesting that the the food that they're eating is not being
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:14.920]  broken up in the rumen by the bacteria that normally breaks down the cellulose
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:18.280]  and so they're starving to death because the food doesn't get into the
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:23.400]  intestines so they're bloating there they are dying because of lack of
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:28.480]  digestion now this doesn't happen with normal cows maybe because their system
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:33.200]  is so big but these miniature cattle as this farmer told me are like large sheep
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:40.040]  so it made sense for me that the BT corn may be having a similar impact as the
[2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:48.640]  BT cotton plants are having in buffalo sheep and goats in India and by the way
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:52.560]  we need to talk about that when we come back from break we've seen whether this
[2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:55.080]  stuff is good for you or not and obviously it's it's good for you like a
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:03:59.600]  hole in the head what it's done to farming across the world I mean it's
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:03.400]  consolidated it's devastated it's destroying Mexico it's destroying
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:09.360]  India it's causing suicides that that are just off the chart it's true in fact
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:14.520]  if you look at the impact overall it's been a disaster exactly opposite of what
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:18.160]  the governments claim that it's going to do when they approve this stuff without
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:24.720]  any safety studies when we look at some additional animal studies we see
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:29.400]  disorders like reproductive disorders I spoke to a goat herder who has lots of
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  goats that he sells for farms around the Midwest and when he was feeding roundup
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:40.720]  ready alfalfa and also other genetically modified crops to his goats they were
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:45.240]  not getting pregnant in large numbers and so he switched to the non GM and the
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:51.040]  pregnancies resumed yeah of course that's the main trait they want everything
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:54.880]  else is really just secondary but they sell you on one trait and it's got all
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:58.800]  the trojan horses in it thank God for the other side effects we wouldn't be
[2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:03.840]  catching the sterilization off you've heard Alex explaining how the silver
[2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:07.320]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[2:05:07.320 --> 2:05:11.280]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:14.840]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[2:05:14.840 --> 2:05:20.040]  anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:24.360]  the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless
[2:05:24.360 --> 2:05:28.480]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:33.360]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key
[2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:40.440]  target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and
[2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:44.960]  orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour
[2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:50.920]  of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about
[2:05:50.920 --> 2:05:55.600]  how the silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:06:01.960]  questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com I've been telling you
[2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:06.280]  about e-foods direct for a while now here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on
[2:06:06.280 --> 2:06:10.320]  food for me foods direct number 10 the food I get from e-foods direct taste

[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:04.720]  slash Alex I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:08.520]  was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:12.600]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and
[2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:17.120]  as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:21.680]  previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info
[2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:27.400]  wars team.com but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37

[2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:27.880]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:32.720]  I tell you I know why a lot of people like to live in Florida it is such a
[2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:38.600]  gorgeous state we're right outside Pensacola Florida I am looking out of
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:43.120]  our beach house in fact I had a turn around this laptop that we're shooting
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:46.720]  Skype video of who knows I'll probably pull a plug or something and take our
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:50.560]  broadcast down we're broadcasting over an access you know but sending video to
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:54.560]  prisonplanet.tv viewers over this I don't know you know what I'll take a
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:09:01.240]  photo and I'll Twitter it to twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones just
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:06.680]  how pretty it is here I'll send a couple of those up during the next break and
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:11.200]  we do have a beautiful planet spaceship earth it's the only planet we have I am
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:17.960]  a steward of the earth I am a conservationist I am someone who does
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:21.760]  believe in protecting our environment and all I see the elite doing is
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:26.240]  lecturing me all day about how I need to get my rights up to a UN agenda 21
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:31.120]  world government to protect to protect the earth and then I see Goldman Sachs
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:40.400]  JP Morgan Wells Fargo Warren Buffett Bella Melinda Gates Ted Turner Bill you
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:47.240]  know Gates's dad the Queen of England all of them funding open world
[2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:50.520]  government and then writing in all these white papers that go back to the 60s
[2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:54.640]  in the Rockefeller Foundation that we've linked to on their own side saying
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:09:59.200]  we're going to engineer GMO food that reduces fertility and does it over
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:03.320]  generations so that it's not noticed by the public or the White House science
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:06.240]  are hey we need to do this to reduce population we can engineer it into the
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:11.120]  food also added to the water fluoride reduces fertility so it's a cocktail of
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:16.640]  things and we now have not one not two not twenty not a hundred but hundreds and
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:23.480]  hundreds of documents like PDD 21 State Department random 200 all of these
[2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:27.400]  different programs and things that have been issued by presidents and others
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:34.320]  where they openly say it's our policy to reduce population covertly we had
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:38.000]  another article up yesterday with government documents where some black
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:42.160]  guy was in a wreck and they grabbed him and dissected him alive and we're
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:45.880]  injecting him with plutonium and they were doing it to other people they
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:49.800]  killed but he was able to crawl out one night was at a public hospital but they
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:53.880]  had it back in on corner ward the Pentagon he was able to crawl out and
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:11:01.280]  crawl away and survive I mean look like we're gonna go back to Jeffrey M.
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:04.600]  Smith journalist filmmaker author and I'm for the rest of the hour and at the
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:06.800]  bottom of the hour we're gonna open the phones up if you want to talk to him and
[2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:10.080]  have your questions but everything he's saying is so documented I want him to
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:15.840]  recap what he was getting to at the end of the last segment but again the big
[2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:21.120]  biggest threat I'm not against nuclear power but 9 out of 10 the associated
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:25.480]  press they're leaking of 400 and something and and and they're supposed
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:29.400]  to shut them down in for 20 years some are going for 40 years they're crazy
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:34.360]  people Fukushima blew up and it's still melting down the EPA just raises
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:39.360]  right radiation level that's a real environmental crisis and I have doctors
[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:44.640]  physicists chemical physicists on they say cancer rates will go up you know
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:49.280]  Chernobyl's killed a million people conservatively since 1986 this is the
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:52.720]  real threats we face and you're not hearing this from the big environmental
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:57.240]  grips because Monsanto and others are in their lobbying controlling instead it's
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:02.360]  how I need to pay the government more money or have them ban my light bulbs or
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:06.480]  don't take a hot shower this is what they actually teach I mean maybe I'd
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.600]  listen to them about not taking a hot shower I'm being sarcastic if okay let's
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:14.320]  stop right there you're splicing the entire biosphere grasses trees they're
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:18.680]  coming out with everything and all the allergies exploding and cancer up over
[2:12:18.680 --> 2:12:24.160]  2,000% infertility plunging and all of this it is a nightmare situation we
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:29.040]  covered my film in game blueprint for global enslavement okay Jeff you got
[2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:31.880]  the floor this is a longer segment in the next we're gonna go to calls but
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:37.080]  continue with some of the studies some of the facts the suicides what this has
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:41.040]  done to agriculture the results its cost and then I want you to talk about the
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:44.400]  population reduction angle because I remember talking to you ten years ago
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:48.160]  and you're like well mr. Jones there is you know this does there is some
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:51.840]  evidence it's linked to infertility but you know I'm not gonna go there but but
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:56.640]  now it's becoming so widespread even in the main line literature people are
[2:12:56.640 --> 2:13:01.200]  saying why does it always have traits that reduce fertility you know this can't
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:05.520]  just be an accident every time or maybe if these are live pesticides that's what
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.320]  it is but even products that aren't pesticide based are having it please
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:14.000]  continue okay we'll get to the reproductive thing and what I want to go
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.480]  is bring completely new stuff that we're preparing for a new film which by the
[2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:22.080]  way our mutual friend Mike Adams is doing a matching grant so that our
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:26.000]  institute can finish the production and promote that's an institute for it's a
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:31.680]  responsible technology.org what I want to focus in on is digestive issues and
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:36.280]  then we're going to link it to autism as you know with autism most of the kids
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:42.280]  have some form of digestive ailment and they also have behavioral disorders we've
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:46.760]  already talked about in the previous segment many animals having behavioral
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:52.560]  disorders when being fed GMOs let's look at their at their digestive tracks and
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:56.600]  see if it resembles at all the kind of gnarly and messed up digestion that we're
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:02.800]  seeing in autistic kids. I talked to butchers and farmers that butcher their
[2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:07.960]  own animals and whenever they've compared GM fed to non GM fed they say it's
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:13.600]  night and day they say for example the intestines of the GM fed animals are so
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:18.400]  disrupted they're like paper thin and they can tear apart so we no longer as a
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:23.480]  country use our own animals intestines for sausage casings we import them from
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:28.400]  New Zealand where they don't feed GMOs. I've also heard that the organs are
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:33.800]  discolored among the GM fed animals and have a foul stench. Now the stench is
[2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:38.560]  probably linked to the change in the gut flora. There's a complete changes
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:43.080]  according to many veterinarians as well as doctors in the gut
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:48.840]  flora both of animals fed GMOs. I'm going to stop you again I'm going to stop you
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:52.880]  again we've done deep research that no one is covering and I've seen I'm going
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:56.960]  to bring this up I know you've probably seen it but Aaron Dykes is exposed that
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:15:00.400]  Bill Gates is the big eugenicist for population reduction he's bought into
[2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:04.240]  Monsanto. His other big funding is studying and trying to buy up control
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:08.760]  of gut disorder investigations because it's a big new market because everybody's
[2:15:08.760 --> 2:15:11.800]  getting it and then all the studies are showing it's attacking the organs this
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:16.320]  is confirmed but here he is trying to take control of it so that no company's
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:21.080]  out there to expose what's going on. Were you aware of that? I was not aware that
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:25.200]  he was investing in that I do know he's a major investor in Monsanto that the
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:29.400]  person in charge of his agricultural section of his foundation is a former
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:34.040]  Monsanto guy I heard him speak at the World Food Prize a couple years ago when
[2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:38.560]  he said he was converted by a visit from the Rockefeller Foundation to become a
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:44.200]  GMO advocate so yeah I'm aware of Gates's position on GMOs I was not aware
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:49.600]  about the gastrointestinal investigations. I want to talk about it turns out work for
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:53.640]  the Rockefeller Foundation yeah it's all a big yeah please continue so so you're
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:58.040]  you're making a film with all the devastating evidence that of what this
[2:15:58.040 --> 2:16:02.920]  weapon systems doing. You know we've talked in the past in previous films and
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:07.360]  books about the laboratory studies for example the animals that are fed GM soy
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:11.520]  have changed uruses and ovaries damaged to the young sperm cells higher
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:16.240]  infant mortality, sterility by the third generation, hair growing in their mouths,
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:22.040]  fewer babies, smaller babies. We see the the work done in laboratories but what
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:26.280]  we're doing with this new film is correlating it with interviews with
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:31.320]  veterinarians and farmers pet owners and pet veterinarians and doctors and
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:35.360]  parents because what we're seeing is a correlation between the type of problems
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:40.440]  identified in the laboratory with the type of problems that are exploding in
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:44.880]  the doctor's offices in the United States. Now autism I'm just focusing on
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:47.920]  autism right now because it's an interesting link and I happen to be
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:52.000]  writing a very extensive paper on it this week so it's fresh in my mind
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:56.600]  but it's all new information. Now you mentioned earlier Alex about the
[2:16:56.600 --> 2:17:02.640]  insecticidal corn and cotton that's BT toxin produced in every cell of corn
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:07.240]  and cotton. They take a gene from soil bacteria, insert it into the DNA of the
[2:17:07.240 --> 2:17:11.920]  plant so every little cell has a little spray bottle. Now the excuse that the
[2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:16.520]  Environmental Protection Agency says is why they can put a pesticide that
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:20.080]  breaks open the stomach of insects and kills them. Why they can put that in
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:27.160]  food is that they say it has no impact on human cells or mammal cells. Well a
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:34.440]  study came out this past week from the Journal of Applied Toxicology where for
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:39.400]  the first time they took BT toxin derived from genetically modified plants
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:44.680]  and exposed it to human cells and lo and behold what we all knew but the EPA
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:50.040]  denied is that it caused the process of starting to kill the cells and it caused
[2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:56.080]  a break open of the membranes so that fluid leaked out and was detected in
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:00.660]  higher numbers. Now this is exactly what we think happens with insects and why
[2:18:00.660 --> 2:18:05.760]  this BT toxin kills insects. It destroys the integrity of their digestive tract.
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:10.560]  What I hear from... That was a German study six, seven years ago. Yeah, that it's
[2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:14.960]  destroying their intestines including the bees. So they're just... This is
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:19.480]  an Armageddon. Please continue. But I want to ask you from your research why
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:22.880]  do you think they're doing it? How do they think they'll get away with this?
[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:28.120]  Let's come back to that question because that's a lot of opinions and a lot
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:33.040]  of ideas but let's talk about the facts for just a moment. I'll get to that. When
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:40.160]  we look at the BT toxin causing these pores or openings in the intestines
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:45.800]  there's a whole new field among progressive cutting-edge medical
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:51.860]  practitioners that are treating or looking at gut permeability. If undigested
[2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:57.440]  food gets through these holes into the blood that might explain the rise in
[2:18:57.440 --> 2:19:03.600]  food allergies, autoimmune disease, inflammation, possibly autism. Because
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:09.120]  gut permeability is one of the factors that scientists are documenting a
[2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:13.360]  company autism in large numbers. So I was giving a talk recently... Wait, wait.
[2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:18.120]  There's also big studies out just to back you up again that just came out
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:23.440]  that they're finding the GMO DNA and RNA is actually going through the blood and
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:27.960]  into the cells. They'd always said that was impossible and Monsanto's come out
[2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:32.040]  and said it's fine to have our DNA in your cells. So it's actually going
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:36.280]  through now. I think that's more than just gut permeability. It's that, you
[2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:41.200]  know, before we are what we eat and all this stuff that's slowly developed on
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:45.160]  this planet we're able to absorb and it's part of the normal order. You start
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:50.320]  splicing and crossing and doing all of this it shows that at a micro
[2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:55.120]  level we're all interchanging at levels we never knew before. Let's talk about
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:59.400]  just this gene transfer because this is one of the scariest things that is
[2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:04.880]  currently documented. The only human feeding study ever published verified
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:09.800]  that part of the gene inserted into soybeans, making those soybeans round
[2:20:09.800 --> 2:20:14.760]  up ready, unkillable with roundup, transferred into the DNA of bacteria
[2:20:14.760 --> 2:20:20.640]  living inside our intestines and that bacteria was unkillable with roundup.
[2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:25.440]  So they had roundup ready gut bacteria suggesting that that gene was functioning.
[2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:30.880]  Now, pretend that you're eating genetically engineered BT corn chips and
[2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:37.200]  the same transfer occurs. What if the gene that produces this toxin that
[2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:41.760]  breaks open the stomach of insects and possibly human intestines? What if that
[2:20:41.760 --> 2:20:47.360]  gene were to transfer to our own gut bacteria and continue to function? It
[2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:52.080]  might turn our living, our living intestines, excuse me, it may turn our
[2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:56.600]  flora into living pesticide factories. Now, one of the studies that came out
[2:20:56.600 --> 2:21:03.120]  last year gives support for this. In Canada, they tested the blood of 30
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:08.640]  pregnant women and their unborn fetuses and found in 93% of the pregnant women
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:13.920]  the BT toxin was in their blood and in the blood of 80% of the cord blood of
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:21.080]  their unborn fetuses. So what this means is that somehow the BT toxin is getting
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:24.800]  into the bloodstream and this is not supposed to happen according to the EPA.
[2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:28.200]  According to the EPA, it's supposed to be destroyed during digestion. So the
[2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:32.280]  authors were wondering how come the frequency is so high? We don't eat that
[2:21:32.280 --> 2:21:37.520]  much corn chips and fresh corn to justify that. So they expected that it
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:41.760]  was the eating the meat and dairy from animals that have been fed Monsanto's
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:46.440]  corn, which was the source of the BT toxin. But I think it's more likely that
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:51.600]  it was the transformation of the gut bacteria inside the intestines of North
[2:21:51.600 --> 2:21:56.520]  Americans, which is causing this high constant exposure. And when I talk about
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:00.720]  this to medical conferences where I speak all the time, doctors invariably tell
[2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:04.840]  me that the rise in gastrointestinal problems has been astronomical. Irritable
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:10.760]  bowel syndrome, for example, is up 40% since GMOs were introduced.
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:17.760]  It is devastating and even the early autism work that's now been duplicated
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:21.120]  over and over again. They've tried to discredit the doctors and people that
[2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:24.280]  put that out. And of course there's now a lawsuit against the British medical
[2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:28.720]  journalist who came out and talked about Dr. Wakefield and said that his
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:33.080]  information was lies. And when you read what they said, they said, well, he did
[2:22:33.080 --> 2:22:37.320]  medical stuff that wasn't needed, like a colonoscopy. They say, he's been
[2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:41.400]  discredited, it's horrible. And then you read the fine print, he did a colonoscopy
[2:22:41.400 --> 2:22:47.440]  on children for, you know, things claiming that it was vaccines. Well, we
[2:22:47.440 --> 2:22:51.240]  say that's not needed. We'll know what he found. And now he's learned a bunch of
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:55.840]  studies before him it found. And after it found is that, and of course he was
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:59.320]  looking at the mercury causing problems, but then there's the GMO connected to it
[2:22:59.320 --> 2:23:02.920]  that the guts were highly toxic. And they're like, in the British Medical
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:06.080]  Journal, they actually say, that's ridiculous. The gut doesn't affect the
[2:23:06.080 --> 2:23:10.400]  brain. Really, is that why everybody knows that have farm animals, that the type
[2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:13.960]  of food you feed them affects the way they behave? Or that if you drink
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:18.040]  alcohol, or if you take pills, it affects the brain? I mean, this is just
[2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:22.720]  asinine. And now, I mean, when I was in high school, there were no autistic
[2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:27.600]  children. Now I take my children to a movie. The first two rows or more are
[2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:33.800]  autistic children. This is not over diagnosis. This is a Holocaust of children
[2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:37.520]  that are brain damaged. And then I talked to the countless families who get the
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:42.360]  news early enough at two or three, get them off GMO, get them all purified, do
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:47.200]  all these colon cleanses, do the probiotics and move to the country and
[2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:50.320]  have to hide out to get away from GMO because it's so prolific now. And
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:54.280]  suddenly their kids start developing and talking and they can reverse it. And the
[2:23:54.280 --> 2:24:00.520]  system gets so angry. And I've seen cases where they send CPS after them, even
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:03.400]  though their tickets better and say, you quit taking them to school, you're
[2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:07.080]  homeschooling them now, you quit taking them to their doctor. And they're like,
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:11.880]  but my child can talk again. I mean, this is like a cult. Listen, keep going
[2:24:11.880 --> 2:24:15.640]  through the evidence. But from your view, I know it's eugenics. I know it's a
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:19.760]  population control craziness, the Nazis that came out of eugenics, the system
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:22.880]  learned. You can't use guns and weapons to kill people. They'll fight back. You do
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:26.800]  it covertly through food, water. They're not going to notice. They're playing God.
[2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:30.280]  I know why they're doing it. My question is, how they think they're going to get
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:35.120]  away with this? Because I see the worm turning against this so fast that
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:39.400]  there's no way they've hurt so many people, the words coming out now. And I'm
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:43.680]  telling the world, the war criminals aren't the big GMO companies and the
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:47.560]  politicians that did this. And I want the wives and husbands, the politicians. You
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:24:51.160]  want to know why the grandson can't talk? You want to know why mommy got cancer at
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:56.280]  25? You want to know why you're plagued? You did this to yourselves and your husband
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:24:59.480]  that took money from these people was part of it. And the executives that did
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:03.440]  this and their engineers are a bunch of eugenicists who are the enemies of
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:08.240]  humanity. I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir. Well, for those that don't know much about
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:14.280]  GMOs, but I'm sure your normal audience does, there are two main traits. One is
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:18.520]  that which produces the insecticide, which we've talked about. And the other is
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:23.040]  that which withstands high doses of herbicide. And most popular for that is
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:28.280]  roundup ready crops that withstand large doses of roundup. Now, roundup has been
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:32.720]  shown to disrupt reproductive function. It can kill human placental cells. It
[2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:37.160]  disrupts estrogen. It causes birth defects. It causes abnormal and lower
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:42.240]  sperm count. Being an extremist. Come on, weed killer isn't bad for you. Next,
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:46.320]  you're going to tell me rat poison is not good for me either. One thing that it
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:25:52.920]  does is that it kills off beneficial bacteria in the gut of cows, which
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:57.920]  normally keep botulism bacteria in check. So a recent studies have shown that
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:02.680]  very tiny amounts of roundup, less than would be residue on the food of these
[2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:06.960]  animals, can reduce the controlling bacteria and cause an explosion of
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:11.600]  botulism within the animal's gut. And I've seen pictures of it and
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:15.840]  it's not pretty. So this is another way that roundup might be causing disaster.
[2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:20.480]  But I wanted to talk about a new way, one that some of your listeners might be
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:26.680]  familiar with. There was a study, a series of analyses done on aborted fetal
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:32.840]  tissue of livestock where the farmer was beside himself. There was such high
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:39.120]  rate of abortions, spontaneous abortions. And on the aborted fetal tissue was a
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:44.360]  new organism only, only visible under with an electron microscope. And they
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:47.840]  figured out where, where is this stuff coming from? So they did analysis of the
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:51.640]  feed. And when the feed was treated with roundup, either it was roundup ready
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:56.400]  crops or products that had roundup sprayed, there were high concentrations of
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:01.440]  this organism and high concentrations on diseased plants that are known to be
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:07.080]  getting. Wow. Because of roundup. What is it? They took this organism and they
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:12.440]  exposed it to a pregnant chicken. It killed the fetus in 24 to 48 hours. Now
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:17.080]  this organism has never been discovered before. It's completely new to science.
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:22.560]  It's the size of a virus. It operates. It looks like a fungus and it appears to
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:28.280]  be everywhere, but in high concentrations around diseased plants and infertile
[2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:33.960]  animals and animals that have spontaneous abortions. So a letter was written by a
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:40.480]  senior research lord by a professor emeritus. In fact, Professor Dr. Don
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:46.120]  Huber, Lord, had decades of study and was an expert at roundup effects. He was
[2:27:46.120 --> 2:27:51.000]  also on a military group that evaluates the threats of outbreak of disease, both
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:57.560]  natural and manmade and hid his letter to Secretary Vilsack of the USDA. He said
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:03.040]  this is an emergency. He pointed out that there is widespread infertility among
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:08.240]  animals, that there might be a huge link, of course, and that that Vilsack should
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.400]  not approve roundup-ready alfalfa because that would only increase the
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:17.520]  exposure of the population to roundup at a time when we need to put money now
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:21.880]  into investigating whether this organism is causing the problem and linked to
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:27.880]  roundup or GMOs. He sent that letter on January 17th privately to Secretary
[2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:32.560]  Vilsack. It was leaked onto the internet, so that's why I can talk about it. He was
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:37.240]  finally called weeks later by someone from the USDA. He gave them the names of
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:42.360]  the researchers and the researchers have not yet been contacted by the USDA and
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.400]  that was over a year. Let me stop you. Let me stop you. My god, I'm gonna have to
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:50.080]  have you back up next week because this, we've only got 30 minutes left, 35
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:54.720]  minutes for our next guest joins us. This is so bombshell because I research
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.360]  this stuff every day now and I didn't even know what you're just saying here,
[2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:03.160]  but I knew about how it's basically creating new bacteria in the stomach and
[2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:06.760]  displacing the others, where I guess you won't be able to live without the roundup
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:09.640]  now in some sick way. It's like they're turning us into these biological
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:13.040]  androids that are dependent on them and ill from their system and then they sell
[2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:17.480]  us expensive treatments, but I've seen these reports of GMOs crossing and
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:24.480]  creating new mutations, but now in new, not just species, but new whole organism
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:28.520]  families. This is exactly what many genetic engineers I've had on. I just got
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:33.000]  chills, have warned of and here's the key. We're gonna come back and talk about
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.760]  this. They're not just coming out with dozens of new crops. They're coming out
[2:29:35.760 --> 2:29:40.760]  with hundreds of new ones. Grasses, trees, they're just taking everything over.
[2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:45.560]  They're total psychos. Jeffrey M. Smith's our guest. This is the most important
[2:29:45.560 --> 2:29:49.760]  information we could be covering right now. Incredible.
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:59.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:08.560]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But
[2:30:08.560 --> 2:30:13.120]  if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:21.440]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[2:30:21.440 --> 2:30:30.960]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a
[2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:38.320]  diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it.
[2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:45.240]  Others don't. We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA
[2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:49.560]  with unparalleled quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset

[2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:05.600]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:09.360]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a
[2:32:09.360 --> 2:32:13.440]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[2:32:13.440 --> 2:32:16.960]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[2:32:16.960 --> 2:32:21.640]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:26.120]  bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then
[2:32:26.120 --> 2:32:30.960]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:34.880]  Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real
[2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:39.040]  nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to
[2:32:39.040 --> 2:32:45.280]  be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and
[2:32:45.280 --> 2:32:50.320]  minerals I need. Check it out for yourself, it's incredible. Go to infowarseteam.com

[2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:30.680]  If you're a new listener and you're thinking, man this can't be true, I'm
[2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:36.440]  begging you because I investigate things. That's where I get my views, my
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:43.000]  research, what I stand for. I've been researching GMO for about 16 years since
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:48.600]  I've been on air. And early on I noticed it was eugenicist world population
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:52.200]  reductionist, the very groups calling for global government and reducing
[2:33:52.200 --> 2:33:56.680]  population who are always running the programs to save people. And then wherever
[2:33:56.680 --> 2:34:00.360]  they go there's famine, death, wars, destruction. And then I found Memorandum
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:07.800]  200 and others. It's all a plan. But these people are so crazy that they're
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:11.640]  killing the honeybees, that the animals are dying, they're just screwing the whole
[2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:15.320]  earth of them. It's bad enough to say, well for the environment, humans are
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:19.880]  destructive, we're gonna covertly reduce human population, and then screw up the
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:24.840]  entire biosphere of the earth. I mean, even if you buy into this view, and I
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:27.720]  certainly know there are some technologies humans engage in and things
[2:34:27.720 --> 2:34:32.920]  that we screw up, we should make it better. But just kill everybody, and let's
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:37.960]  just say it's all a big accident. Okay, well governments now know about this and
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:42.200]  are doing nothing, well not in Europe and other areas, but here. Notice we have the
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:46.360]  highest cancer rate, the highest obesity rate, the highest everything rate that's
[2:34:46.360 --> 2:34:51.720]  bad, highest infant mortality now in the western world. I mean, highest heart
[2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:58.600]  attacks, higher neurological disorders, lowest test scores. Go look it up. I mean
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:02.280]  look, I'm not a rocket scientist. When I feed my kids a few times on the road or
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:07.320]  something, just even some fast food junk, they act horrible for days. I give them
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:11.080]  processed sugar, they're bad for days. It's not just when they're on it, it's
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:16.360]  screw them up. The dyes, the additives. This is a carnicopia. I mean, if you were
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:20.280]  trying to covertly poison people, you couldn't do a better job. And then you
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:25.720]  see how it's almost uncoordinated. It's just like nasty, mean, and then they let
[2:35:25.720 --> 2:35:29.320]  other corporations that just don't care do whatever they want. Now I'm ranting
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:32.040]  here, Jeffrey Smith. I'm going to give the number out and take some calls for you.
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:40.360]  800-259-9231. 800-2599-231. We have all of your books available on the online
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:46.680]  video bookstore at infowars.com, Genetic Roulette, Seeds of Deception, your film,
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:51.560]  other films that you've been involved in, great films like The World According to
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:55.640]  Monsanto that you think's hardcore. It's very well done, but it's even worse than that.
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:01.640]  But I want you to continue. The toll-free number to join us is 800-2599-231 on this
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:06.200]  subject, folks. 800-2599-231. In fact, I should have said this because the calls
[2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:10.680]  will load now. We won't have any room for others. I've done this before just by myself and called
[2:36:10.680 --> 2:36:17.160]  for farmers to call and said, have you had good luck with GMO? Or have you had problems?
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:23.720]  At every farmer that calls who has livestock says, you feed it to them. They have health
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:29.320]  problems. They start dying. You start having more calves that die. They're stillborn.
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:33.480]  More calves you got to pull. I'm going to get into what that is, but I've worked for a large
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:38.440]  animal vet and done it. All of it. Some people that just grow soybeans or whatever say,
[2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:44.600]  no, it's all right. Neighbors don't like it, though. They think to run off killing their fish and
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:49.720]  their tank. That's about what you get. The health problem is with it in your drinking water. But
[2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:54.600]  going back to Mr. Smith here, the author, the researcher, other key points you want to cover
[2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:58.040]  here before you get into my main question. Now, I think you answered it. The government
[2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:03.080]  just isn't even responding. How does the elite think they're going to get out of what they're
[2:37:03.080 --> 2:37:07.880]  doing to all of us when it's obviously affecting them as well? It's an interesting question.
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:13.800]  When Obama took his position at the White House, an article came out indicating that
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:20.280]  he had insisted that his kitchen was organic. And it came out in the same article. It's so, too,
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:27.080]  did the Bush administration that Laura Bush was emphatic that the would only serve organic. And
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:33.560]  of course, organic means non-GMO. Now, I talked to a former scientist from Monsanto, and he said
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:38.680]  that he knew of three colleagues that did safety studies on Monsanto's bovine growth hormone,
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:44.680]  found so much of the IGF-1 hormone elevated in the milk and its link to cancer. These three
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:50.840]  Monsanto scientists refused to drink milk thereafter unless it was organic, one bought his own cow.
[2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:58.280]  I also report in seeds of deception how the head of the restaurant that's found inside the UK
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:06.200]  headquarters of Monsanto responded to a request and said, we try to remove as many GMOs as possible
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:13.000]  because of requests by our customers. And of course, their customers are Monsanto employees. And
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:19.880]  someone told me just this year that an insider had actually had lunch with Monsanto employees. I
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:25.560]  think it was in England offsite, and they took several people offsite and he joked, well, we
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:30.280]  may, we have to be careful. We're getting GMOs. And the guy turned to very seriously and said,
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:37.080]  oh, don't worry, we get our food brought in specially. It's organic. So by the way, Jeff,
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:40.600]  Jeff, let me just back you up on that because I actually did a report on this two weeks ago. I
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:45.560]  didn't even know that. And I'd read your book. I must have forgotten it. But when I was told this
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:52.200]  by a listener and I went and checked it, there was BBC Associated Press, where all of the major
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:57.400]  Monsanto cafeterias, their engineers at the actual facilities where they make the stuff,
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:04.200]  not their chemical plants and stuff, all refuse and demand no GMO be allowed. Then I found articles
[2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:09.160]  with the Royal Family do that, headlines even in the LA Times and Asia Times where the Chinese
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:14.760]  Commies to Leet have, quote, secret gardens and farms and are obsessed with only non-GMO.
[2:39:14.760 --> 2:39:19.080]  I found articles with the German government does it. I found articles were all over the world
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:24.680]  and were all of the environmental eugenicists that are pushing this GMO on us. They're obsessed
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:31.000]  with it. And the Rockefellers have chefs, so does Prince Charles, and aircraft that follow them
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:38.120]  with the entire certified, in many cases on their own farms, food that has been gourmet produced.
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:44.120]  I mean, they are avoiding it like it's deadly poison. And then we found out the German government
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:48.360]  doesn't take vaccines and has special vaccines for themselves. I mean, you're not, again,
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:50.600]  I'm backing you up. You're not just saying this, please continue.
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:56.040]  Well, you know, one of the issues that you mentioned earlier is GMOs are not isolated.
[2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:02.280]  They cross pollinate, they mix. Even the roundup is now found in 60 to 100% of air,
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:07.720]  rain and water samples in the Midwest. It's found in the urine of urban dwellers. It's found in
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:13.880]  cord blood, in human blood. It's found in surface water and in groundwater. So it's become omnipresent,
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:20.200]  like Monsanto's PCBs, their previous poison. And the GMOs are now, of course, impacting organic
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:27.000]  and other places by increasing the levels of contamination slowly. So this begs the question,
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:33.080]  how stupid can these people be if their intention was to create a problem with GMOs because they'd
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:38.760]  be sawing off the branch that they're sitting on because we all live in the same biosphere and
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:45.480]  there is no way to contain it. Now, one of the ways that we can fight back, Alex, is through
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:51.560]  required labeling. And there's a ballot initiative in California on the November ballot. It's actually,
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:56.600]  they're actually gathering petition signatures right now. So if any of your audience lives in
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:04.600]  California, they can join the effort, go to label GMOs.org and get a training on how to fill out
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:11.160]  petitions with your friends. So right now, we have an unprecedented opportunity to pass a law in
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:16.120]  California that doesn't have to go through legislators that have been bought off by Monsanto.
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:24.040]  And if it gets passed, the food companies realize that 53% of Americans say they would avoid GMOs
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:29.800]  if labeled. So these companies would rather remove GMOs than admit that they used them. They've
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:35.080]  already removed GMOs in Europe because of a consumer tipping point against GMOs happen there.
[2:41:35.080 --> 2:41:40.920]  They've already removed largely most of the bovine growth hormone from their dairy cows because
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:48.120]  the consumers became aware of the cancer risk. So if they have to label GMOs, they will probably
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:53.800]  remove it. And there's been an upswell now of concern about GMOs. And one of the obvious things
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:42:00.360]  is to enforce labeling, which is now enforced in over 50 countries, but not the U.S. or Canada.
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:05.320]  So I encourage the people who are listening, who are in California to get involved and for
[2:42:05.320 --> 2:42:11.400]  everyone else, get on our website at responsibletechnology.org and join the tipping point
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:18.040]  network, which we've organized to do outreach to bring this information to the entire population,
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:24.040]  particularly the most receptive demographics. Parents of young kids, kids are most at risk.
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:29.080]  In fact, in April, we're going to be launching our campaign to protect children against GMOs,
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:33.400]  which this film is being created for. We're reaching out to religious groups that believe
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:38.120]  that GMO really means God move over. We're reaching out to health conscious shoppers,
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:43.080]  to healthcare professionals. I gave a talk at Andrew Wiles Integrative Medicine Conference
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:49.080]  in May of last year. And I asked the 8 or 900 healthcare practitioners to rate themselves
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:55.480]  from 1 to 100, how vigilant they have been at avoiding GMOs. And they did a show of hands as
[2:42:55.480 --> 2:43:00.840]  to how vigilant and how active they've been at educating their patients to avoid GMOs. At the
[2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:07.080]  beginning of the 45 minute talk, the vigilance was kind of low. At the end of the 45 minute talk,
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:11.800]  nearly everyone was in the highest category of vigilance going forward, saying they were going
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:16.920]  to avoid GMOs. They were going to prescribe it to their patients. They gave us a standing ovation.
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:22.760]  They swapped the table for non-GMO shopping guides, which you can get at non-gmo-shopping-guide.com
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:30.680]  or at the iPhone App Store, Shop No GMO. It's a free download. So the healthcare professionals
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:36.440]  are realizing now in larger and larger numbers that GMOs are almost certainly
[2:43:36.440 --> 2:43:41.720]  implicated in the rising incidence of disease that they're seeing in their practice. And now
[2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:47.000]  they have something that they can do. They can recommend non-GMO products, organic products.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.920]  And I've interviewed many healthcare practitioners that not only recommend it,
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:55.560]  but they report that their patients are getting better. And in my discussions with the patients,
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:44:01.640]  they are in fact getting better. Well, that's what we're getting. And I'm trying my best to
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:08.920]  keep my children away from this stuff. But the absolute total proof is that without even looking,
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:13.960]  I found more than 10 mainstream articles where the Chinese government, the German government,
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:19.880]  the UK government, the royalty, Bill and Melinda Gates, Rockefellers are all
[2:44:19.880 --> 2:44:27.160]  Al Gore obsessed with never eating GMO while they push it in our face all day. And it's very
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:32.440]  obvious what these super wicked people are doing. And folks, denial is going to get us all killed.
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:41.000]  I mean, the honey bees are dying. Animals that eat this are getting sick. And how many GMO crops
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:44.360]  they got coming out? Because I know there's a whole bunch of companies doing. I know it's in
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:51.320]  the hundreds. But I mean, I've read about tea tree oil and all these other systems and all these
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:56.200]  grasses and so, and Gates is saying they're going to release mosquitoes that forcibly
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:45:02.200]  inoculate us. And he knows best. I mean, who's going to save us from these lunatics? I guess
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:07.480]  ourselves, but they know we're waking up. So now they're counter strike. So you know, it's a military
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:13.880]  operation when where it's banned in Brazil, they catch these companies secretly leasing property
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:18.680]  and planting their corn on it to infect everything. I mean, they act like it's a weapon because it is.
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:24.200]  You're right about the mosquitoes, which most people think is just science fiction.
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:29.960]  They've already actually released genetically engineered mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands,
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:35.320]  in Brazil, in Malaysia, and they're now slated to be released in the Florida Keys.
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:42.440]  Now, some leaked documents showed that the company that was doing this, a UK operation,
[2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:47.800]  worked hard to hide the information that these mosquitoes, which are designed to lower the
[2:45:47.800 --> 2:45:52.600]  mosquito population by creating sterile offspring. These are the male mosquitoes that are genetically
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:57.240]  engineered so they don't bite. The mosquitoes are here for a reason. Don't kill off and sterilize
[2:45:57.240 --> 2:46:01.880]  one of the lowest levels of the food chain. That'll destroy the bats. It'll destroy our own
[2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:08.040]  immunity. Mosquitos are connected to giving us immunity. This is pure lunacy. And I don't want
[2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:13.400]  to be the person to do the recall of the GM mosquitoes later on when it turns out that there's
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:20.760]  problems. What they tried to hide was that under normal circumstances, up to 3% of their offspring
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:27.880]  of their supposedly sterile mosquitoes survive. And that when they're exposed to tetracycline,
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:35.640]  that number rises to 15%. Now, this means that it's definitely the case that people are going to be
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:43.400]  bitten by the offspring of Frankenbugs. And no one has evaluated the health risks of being bitten
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:47.560]  and having to saliva mix with your blood. That's the main use of them. Of course,
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:53.720]  they're going to survive and bite people. And like the GMO or like the Roundup Ready GMO,
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:58.600]  turn our bacteria into little GMO factories. That's the plan. Of course, they're going to live.
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:02.600]  They're meant to bite us. I'm going to love to find out what the Trojan horse is in that.
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:09.000]  Guaranteed it to be infertility. Or some little nanotech, biotech. That's what that fungoid thing
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:13.560]  is, I bet. Because you know they've got that nanotech too, Jeffrey. We're in a lot of trouble.
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:20.120]  These nut cases are 30 years advanced of what we probably know. Well, what's happening now, Alex,
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:25.720]  is we have consumers more and more on our side. The labeling issue is something that could topple it.
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:31.880]  But so too can even a small percentage of consumers avoiding GM ingredients. Here's my thinking.
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:38.120]  The same companies like Kraft and Nestle's and Hershey's and McDonald's removed GMOs in Europe
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:42.440]  because they were a marketing liability continue to sell them in the United States
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:49.000]  where they are not yet a marketing liability. If we see that there's any drop in market share
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:54.280]  that they can attribute directly to anti-GMO sentiment rising in the U.S.,
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:48:00.440]  there's no reason for them to continue to use GMOs. There's no consumer benefits. They either drink
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:09.880]  poisonous herbicide or produce poisonous bug killer. And so they will immediately rush away from GMOs
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:15.240]  in the United States like they did within a single week in Europe in late April 1999.
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:20.680]  So we're looking to get... Look at how they're all saying that we don't have corn syrup now.
[2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:26.840]  Every major brand. And so the corn syrup lobby comes out and wants to call it corn sugar.
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:32.600]  But the government's saying they can't do that because it's too obvious. We still have the power.
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:37.400]  That's why they tell us we don't have power. The minute we stop buying into all their garbage,
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:42.840]  the minute we get angry and start voting with our purchases, we can overthrow Bill Gates and
[2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:47.960]  all this trash in a minute. But you've got to use your power. And Jeffrey Smith, there's nobody
[2:48:47.960 --> 2:48:52.200]  out there like you. There's five of these people. It's got to feel good. I want to have you back
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:56.440]  up again next week. But I want to go out to break here and do two more short segments with calls.
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:49:02.760]  Without further ado here, what a hero. Jeffrey Smith is folks taking some calls. Diane, Roger,
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:07.720]  Elliot, Cindy, and Nathan. We've got to at least get to those. Diane and Louisiana, you're on the air with our guests. Go ahead.
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:14.600]  Hi, how are you today? I'm good. It's a fascinating show. Mr. Jeffrey, I'd like to ask you this.
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:24.360]  For a normal kid at the age of two, three years old, started school, all of a sudden he did all
[2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:32.280]  these vaccinations. And this mother told me her son slowly began to just withdraw. He's not even
[2:49:32.280 --> 2:49:37.160]  talking. He just... Yeah, they kill your kids in front of you. They kill your kid in front of you
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:41.320]  and tell you you're a cook when your kid's running around talking healthy and is now a zombie.
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:45.800]  They're killing them in front of you. They're murdering scum. I'm sorry, ma'am. Go ahead. Ask him the question.
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:52.600]  I heard you mentioned earlier, Alex, about probiotics and colon cleansing. Is there anything
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:57.880]  that I can suggest to the mother? Because this kid now is about six years old and this happened
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:02.600]  when you were like two or three years old. Well, look, look, they want to make him a zombie. Okay,
[2:50:02.600 --> 2:50:07.160]  so the killers and their little minions that do it, I'm not going to give medical advice. I know
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:11.640]  what the families have done that can reverse some of this. Now, it does make them behind. But look,
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:16.840]  they lie to you and say it's the law to take the vaccines. Right there, they're lying criminals.
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:22.920]  Jeffrey, you got anything to say to her? Well, I'm not a vaccine expert. I do have experience talking
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:28.680]  to people, for example, in the autistic community. Some people believe that GMOs are much bigger
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:33.960]  culprit than the vaccines. And there's not enough evidence. And like you say, I can't get medical
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:39.400]  advice. I'm not a doctor. But I do know it's a tragic thing. It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:45.400]  I've heard the same stories over and over again. I can just say, do a lot of research and find the
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:50.440]  people that have the experience of reversing it. Yeah, ma'am, stay there. I want you to have a
[2:50:50.440 --> 2:50:54.440]  comeback question. His skype's breaking up. We'll reconnect with Jeffrey Smith. Do two more
[2:50:54.440 --> 2:50:58.920]  little five minute segments. I'm going to try to get connected back on skype as well.
[2:50:58.920 --> 2:51:04.200]  We'll be right back, transmitting worldwide. Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going
[2:51:04.200 --> 2:51:08.920]  to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits? If you don't, you and your family may be
[2:51:08.920 --> 2:51:14.600]  without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes. You would be surprised how
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:21.320]  many people don't have these food items right now. 123survivalplan.com has set up a four-patriots only
[2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:26.520]  video with inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:33.400]  disaster strikes. The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need
[2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:39.320]  to prepare for any disaster, natural or manmade. And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry

[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:03.560]  that's 123survivalplan.com. In the past, I've taken a lot of different vitamins,
[2:52:03.560 --> 2:52:08.120]  some through health food stores, some that friends recommend. Colleen talking about her
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:12.680]  experience with Super Sea Veg. And with the Super Sea Veg, I was seeing a lot better results.
[2:52:12.680 --> 2:52:17.560]  Super Sea Veg with Vita D and Sea Cal is the most powerful dietary food supplement in the
[2:52:17.560 --> 2:52:23.800]  world today and nothing else comes close. Super Sea Veg is a whole food that makes me feel good.
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:29.320]  Think of Super Sea Veg as the un-vitamin. I have taken other things and they just didn't work.
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:33.640]  This seems to work for me. And Super Sea Veg comes with a 90-day money back guaranteed.
[2:52:33.640 --> 2:52:39.080]  Store-bought vitamins do not have the supplement and the full whole feeling I have from Super

[2:54:08.680 --> 2:54:21.800]  Okay, Diane, you heard me get angry there because I just think of the victims everywhere. They got
[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:25.720]  a three-year-old, they get them in school early because they can really hurt them good when they're
[2:54:25.720 --> 2:54:32.280]  two or three. They're telling all the mothers, put your kids in school now is the time. This stuff
[2:54:32.280 --> 2:54:41.000]  just goes on and on. I've heard the stories literally hundreds and hundreds of times in
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:45.320]  person where it's a two-year-old, they go over the third round of shots, have a convulsion,
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:49.400]  at the doctors many times. That's a blessing because if it happens at home, they try to take
[2:54:49.400 --> 2:54:53.240]  your kid from you. They go, there's blood on the brain. Yeah, you just hit me with a hard weapon
[2:54:53.240 --> 2:54:58.200]  here. Then they try to take your kids. But the point is, yes, that's part of it. The GMO,
[2:54:58.200 --> 2:55:03.480]  I mean, now the EPA saying radiation can be 100,000 times higher in many isotubes,
[2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:08.200]  and it's fine for you. I mean, it's like evil space aliens run things that want to kill us
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:15.000]  through human host or something. I'm not saying that literally, but that would be plausible
[2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:21.240]  in the science fiction world of how evil these people are. It's not just about profit. They hate
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:26.680]  us. Bayer knew for 10 years, they were shipping out stuff to hemophiliacs that had HIV and hepatitis
[2:55:26.680 --> 2:55:32.040]  in every shot. They came out, they knew, and quote, didn't care. Well, it's more than didn't care.
[2:55:33.400 --> 2:55:38.520]  This is sick. Some kind of sacrifice. Anything else, Diane, for Jeff Smith?
[2:55:39.160 --> 2:55:44.440]  Okay. I can't remember what year all this was about with the mad cow disease. Do you think it's
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:51.000]  round up in all these pesticides or linked to that mad cow disease epidemic we had years ago?
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:57.880]  Very good point. Thank you for the call, Jeffrey. Well, it's interesting. I talked to a fella who
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:03.400]  used to work at Monsanto, and he was there at the time when mad cow disease was a problem,
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:12.440]  and he discovered one of his colleagues told him that they had found new proteins in the cotton
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:17.800]  seed, in the cotton that was genetically engineered that he was supposed to sell. Moreover, they were
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:23.000]  selling this cotton seed cake to dairy cows down the street from him, and he said, wait a minute,
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:27.880]  these new proteins, they were never intended. They were part of the massive background noise and
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:32.600]  collateral damage that could occur as a result of this primitive process of genetic engineering.
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:37.720]  Shouldn't we characterize these proteins and make sure they're not prions or might cause some kind
[2:56:37.720 --> 2:56:43.880]  of mad cow disease? Well, first of all, the people at Monsanto, these PhDs, had never heard of mad
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:49.720]  cow disease, even though a Nobel Prize was awarded a few months later. But they said, I'm sorry,
[2:56:49.720 --> 2:56:55.000]  we've always fed the products of our trials to animals and we're not going to stop. So he was
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:00.360]  very agitated. He tried to blow the whistle and was ostracized from within Monsanto, and then he
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:05.480]  tried to blow the whistle outside of Monsanto. He told agricultural commissioners, he told university
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:11.720]  professors, he told me their eyes just glazed over. They had no idea of the potential problems
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:15.560]  that could happen with the genetic engineering. Well, he left the company and went and became
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:19.960]  a chiropractor, and now he took our speaker training and he's speaking against GMOs. In fact,
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:25.240]  he will be on a panel together at the Health Freedom Expo in Long Beach in early March. However,
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:31.080]  it turns out when I looked into this with a professor who was an expert at these proteins,
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:37.000]  he didn't think that these proteins that might be created from the genetic engineering process
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:42.520]  would likely have anything to do with prions because prions are out of control animal proteins
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:47.880]  that affect animal health, and these proteins that are produced in plants would be different.
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:55.080]  So there is not a direct understanding or correlation with GMOs right now and mad cows.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:58:01.640]  It shows how crazy they are feeding rotten dead cows and goats and sheep to cows who are
[2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:06.680]  herbivores and aren't meant to eat meat. Let's jam in one more call. Roger in Texas,
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:13.240]  Roger, you're on the gear. Go ahead. Hey, how are y'all today? Good. I want to commend y'all
[2:58:13.240 --> 2:58:18.920]  both on all the work that y'all have been doing. You, Alex, on just everything under the sun,
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:25.000]  and Jeffrey, I accidentally found your videos on GMOs about two years ago,
[2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:32.680]  and they've been a high-opening experience. I live in the heart of Texas here where
[2:58:32.680 --> 2:58:39.240]  corn is king. Hold on. We're coming back. I'm going to have you finish up a few more calls
[2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:48.600]  at Lou Rockwell. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.640 --> 2:58:56.600]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now. Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up

[2:59:56.760 --> 2:59:59.400]  to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:15.640]  You know, I haven't even told the story and I meant to do it today about speaking in Dallas
[3:00:15.640 --> 3:00:22.280]  last Sunday, and I took probably 30 questions or more after my speech, and like six or seven of them
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:26.360]  were people that were young people, young, healthy folks that were all of a sudden getting
[3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:30.680]  sick and almost dying. When they learned to get off GMO, stopped drinking Aspartame,
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:33.480]  the doctors were saying, get ready to be in a wheelchair, get ready to have this done,
[3:00:33.480 --> 3:00:36.440]  get ready to have that done. Suddenly, they just got completely better, and they said,
[3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:41.720]  your radio show and the guests you have saved us. I mean, folks, I don't tell you something unless
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:46.120]  I've researched it and I'm upset about it, and I think it's something you should be warned about.
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:50.200]  That's what real public service is about, and that's not because I'm some great guy either.
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:55.240]  This is affecting us all. I'm angry about being assaulted by a bunch of global control freaks.
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:58.040]  Roger, real fast, because I'm going to jam in a few more and I appreciate you holding.
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:03.480]  You were saying we're here in central Texas. Oh, he dropped off. I wanted to hear the story.
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:07.720]  Elliot in California, go ahead. You're on the air with Jeffrey Smith.
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:10.120]  California. California.
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:10.680]  Yeah, California.
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:16.920]  Thank you. Okay. I have something I've been meaning to call for a year, and this is really important.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:25.960]  In 2005, in 2006, I went to Romania five times. I was living over there more than here. I'm a
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:30.840]  baby boomer. It was developing arthritis in my fingers. When I went over there for the first
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:36.200]  time for a month, and I was with three other Americans, and we were drinking like fish and
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:43.240]  party, and I lost 11 pounds in one month, and the arthritis in my fingers disappeared. I came
[3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:47.880]  back to the United States. I didn't have a clue as to what was going on, but I said,
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:54.360]  is it the food? Is it chemicals? Pesticides? I went back four more times. Each time I went back,
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:59.480]  I lose weight. Over there, people are very thin until about 50 years old. The men don't like
[3:01:59.480 --> 3:02:04.120]  cigarettes. The French smoke cigarettes, eat like pigs, and don't look like us. No, everybody's
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:09.880]  pointing this out. Anywhere you bring GMO in with any mammal, they turn into these lethargic
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:16.760]  creatures. Incredible point, Jeff. We see this a lot, don't we? Yes. In fact, in my last newsletter,
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:22.280]  I asked people to email us at healthy at responsibletechnology.org to describe just
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:27.560]  those type of changes. No one in the world is monitoring this, and so we decided to take
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:32.680]  the responsibility to see what kind of changes are occurring in people when they switch from
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:37.400]  GM and non-GM. Sometimes it's going between organic and non-organic. Sometimes it's going
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:41.800]  between the United States and Europe. Thank you for that excellent description, and please
[3:02:41.800 --> 3:02:46.680]  send us a copy of your description written up. Amazing. Final comments, sir.
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:54.120]  Let me tell what happened. What I did was, and you just mentioned it, and I just started this
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:59.800]  like about a month ago, I was taking one probiotic once a week, and then I started taking it every
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:05.000]  day. I was taking ginger and turmeric for my fingers because I don't take any painkillers
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:10.040]  and stuff, and I'm a guitarist. So what happened was, I stopped taking turmeric in the ginger,
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:16.520]  and 80% of the arthritis in my fingers is gone because I'm taking probiotics every day.
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:23.240]  It's got to be changing the biology in your intestine. Yeah, there are many reasons-
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:27.640]  It's knocking out what, it's knocking out what Bill Gates and Co put in there. I'm sorry, go ahead,
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:33.480]  Jeff. There are many reasons why our gut bacteria is probably compromised by eating GMOs. We've
[3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:38.200]  already talked about the transfer of genes into our gut bacteria, which is probably occurring
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:44.120]  in a wide scale. But also, we eat products that have residues of Roundup, and Roundup
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:50.120]  is an antibiotic. It kills bacteria. So if we eat it, it destroys some of the bacteria that's in
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:56.280]  our gut. But if some of the genes transferred from soybeans making Roundup-ready gut bacteria,
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:04:00.760]  then they would have a survival advantage, and so we might have a colonization of these
[3:04:00.760 --> 3:04:05.640]  franken bacteria inside our gut. And there's many other ways that I want to go to it. They're too
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:11.480]  technical, why GMOs might be causing a huge disruption of this very important aspect of our
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:16.840]  health. There are 10 times the number of cells in our body as gut bacteria than the cells of our
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:20.600]  body. They're part of our immune system and our digestive system. So we've got to bomb them with
[3:04:20.600 --> 3:04:27.160]  good old-fashioned wide-spectrum healthy bacteria. We've got to bomb the Monsanto enemy colonies
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:31.640]  and other GMO colonies out of our guts. And once a week isn't enough, that's what I've been doing.
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:36.280]  I'm going on it. Every day, I'm going to annihilate the enemy. I'm going to lose the weight. I'm going
[3:04:36.280 --> 3:04:40.520]  to get healthy. I'm going to live longer. I'm going to win. The eugenicists that hate life and hate us
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:45.160]  all are not going to win. Jeffrey Smith, all your books and videos are available at InfoWars.com.
[3:04:45.160 --> 3:04:49.400]  Incredible job. Thank you so much. Let's get you back up in the next month if you'll do it.
[3:04:49.400 --> 3:04:53.720]  God bless you. All right, we're going to come back with Lou Rockwell. Is Ron Paul going to run with
[3:04:53.720 --> 3:04:57.480]  Mitt Romney? Stay with us. We'll talk about it straight ahead.
[3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:05.720]  I'd seen the Ungevity products work for many others. And so I bought a bunch of them, started
[3:05:05.720 --> 3:05:10.440]  using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day. But
[3:05:10.440 --> 3:05:16.280]  Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds. When I saw those results, I said,
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:21.320]  I'd better follow my own advice. I started taking the Ungevity products and it's been incredible.
[3:05:21.320 --> 3:05:28.280]  37 pounds in two months. Our bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift. But if our
[3:05:28.280 --> 3:05:33.560]  body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:38.520]  essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy. Folks, this isn't hype. I only bring to
[3:05:38.520 --> 3:05:44.120]  my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly believe in. And the amazing supplements

[3:06:25.440 --> 3:06:40.280]  surround the United States and it would fall. Is the United States being surrounded? This would be their third stage for world domination. They have Eastern Europe and the masses of Asia, China. We'd like to help you

[3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:14.520]  George Washington said, government is not reason. It is not eloquence. It is force like fire. It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector of our liberty, but has become that
[3:07:14.520 --> 3:07:35.760]  fearful master. We the people must understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country. America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one-world government. A God-given, unalienable rights of the Declaration of Independence are in jeopardy. We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men.

[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:09.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:28.520]  All right, it is Thursday. Of course, we are broadcasting worldwide here on this 23rd day of February 2012 and it's all over the watch and post. It's on hundreds of papers today.
[3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:41.520]  The system is pushing the idea that Ron Paul might run as a VP with Mitt Romney. Now, listeners are horrified by this idea. Ron Paul is a man of total integrity. Look at his voting record.
[3:08:41.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  Ron Paul, another great guy of total integrity, done everything he said he'd do once he got to Congress. You know, guest on the show, loves freedom, stands up against all this corruption. But I have seen some of the campaign people be like, oh, of course, it would be great to have Ron Paul as a VP.
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  And then Rans and Eisen says, well, it'd be an honor to be considered, but I think that's more of a gentlemanly thing he's saying. He wouldn't be considered if he wouldn't say that he'd go along with whatever their agenda is. And Ron Paul and Rans Paul aren't going to compromise.
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:28.520]  So I'm saying it isn't going to happen. But people are saying, well, don't leave the political spoils for liberty if they steal the elections. And this is far from over, but they have stolen a few states, obviously now in Iowa and Maine or no brainers,
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:37.520]  where they just have thrown out the Iowa election. And then now in Maine, they're saying, yeah, we didn't count all these counties that were two to one for Ron Paul in some areas, other areas, double-digit leads.
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:49.520]  But we're not saying what we're going to do. Just don't worry about it. We're so broke back now as a nation accepting the corruption, not my listeners, not freedom lovers, but some of the public, that it's kind of like not even an issue now.
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:10:08.520]  So we're going to believe that Mitt Romney, who steals elections and does all this and funded by Goldman Sachs like Obama, this globalist, this new world order stooge, who wrote Obamacare and supports carbon taxes, we're going to believe that this guy would whatever have Ron Paul in there.
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  Now, I could see, I guess, if you said to Ron Paul, you can do whatever you want. Speaking or whatever as vice president, then I'd say, okay, if he doesn't win, let him be VP. But they're not going to do that.
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:28.520]  This is higher ups talking to people in his campaign who know they're not going to have a job in a year if Ron Paul doesn't win. He's going to leave the house who are believing this.
[3:10:28.520 --> 3:10:40.520]  Because I've seen some of them out there going, basically saying nice things about Romney. And I'm not saying they're bad people. It's just that you don't join with Soran. You don't join with Darth Vader.
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:54.520]  You join with Obi-Wan Kenobi. That's Ron Paul. It's the idea that's valuable of liberty. We're not the extremist, the globalist are. They call us dangerous. They're the dangerous ones trying to implode our economy and cause World War III through Capitalism.
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:11:06.520]  Now, in this segment and one more short segment of the bottom of the hour, we're joined by, and I appreciate him coming on, on short notice, Lew Rockwell of LewRockwell.com. Probably the biggest libertarian website on the web out there.
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:31.520]  And great folks who also let us contribute their stuff to infowars.com. And Lew was the guy that was there, first to help get Ron Paul into Congress, was his chief of staff, the founder of the Von Mies Institute, trying to bring sound, real economics, not Keynesian, globalist, baloney garbage, which they know is baloney, folks, to cover up their crony takeover operation.
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:47.520]  He knows the real Ron Paul. And so, I mean, I was getting thousands of emails, phone calls, comments, freakouts. I told you a month ago they were going to push this. I think the Washington Post is a way to make it look like Ron Paul is establishment and is a way to cause more in fighting.
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:12:04.520]  And there's a way to, well, will he take a VP? He's out of the race. And I think the campaigns should come out strongly and say, we're not taking a VP, but then others will say, oh, well, then you're just leaving, you know, the libertarian constitutionalist vote unspoken for.
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:13.520]  No, we're not sullying ourselves. So they put something in the, in the, you know, Republican platform or something which they use like toilet paper.
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:21.520]  Now, that's my gut view. If Ron Paul later decides to do something like that and explains it to me, whatever, this is far from over. This is about them acting like it's over.
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:32.520]  Now, let me get really the omnibudsman of, you know, libertarian freedom thought, Lou Rockwell on to give us his perspective. I haven't found out what he thinks yet. I'm going to find out right now.
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:42.520]  I've put my cards on the table. Lou, what do you say about what I've said and what's your gut on this and what's the inside baseball on this subject because I haven't been able to get Ron on the last month or so.
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:49.520]  Well, Alex, remember, I'm not a spokesman for Ron or for the campaign. So I'm just going to, I'm just giving you my own view, but I think it's all a trick.
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:56.520]  It's, it's just another establishment trick to make it look like Ron Paul's just as a sellout like all the rest of them. Ron Paul has never sold out.
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:01.520]  Ron Paul will never sell out. And so this is, this is, has two, two pieces.
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:06.520]  You said to bring down Ron Paul to make him seem like he's just one of the regular criminal bunch.
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:13.520]  And the other is to make Ron Paul supporters like Romney. Well, if he's willing to consider Ron Paul as a VP, Romney must be a pretty good guy.
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:21.520]  Well, it was Romney exactly like Gingrich and Santorum. Even though Romney's a more pleasant person, and I'm sure his wife is a nice person.
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:26.520]  His kids are nice and all those kinds of questions. But really, he's, as you say, he's a globalist.
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:34.520]  He's a big government guy. He believes in corporatism and fascism and the partnership between big government and big business.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:40.520]  He's a warmonger. He's an imperialist. He's a protectionist. He's a big government guy, big spender, bailout the banks.
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:46.520]  I mean, he's bad on virtually everything. I guess, you know, he was against the bailout of GM.
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:50.520]  But my guess is if he were president, he would have done it and he would have made a lot of money out of it.
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  Because that's the kind of guy he is. He makes a lot of money out of government projects.
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:59.520]  So no, I think this is just another trick. And they would never let Ron Paul be vice president.
[3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:07.520]  Ron Paul has a chance, we all hope and pray, to push his way into office by the people putting him there.
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:12.520]  However, the idea that the regime would invite him into office is just science fiction.
[3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:20.520]  Now, Lou, I'm just speechless, you know, hearing you break this down because I totally concur with you.
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:23.520]  It's so obvious. I wanted to make sure that my instincts were right.
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:29.520]  How do we interpret then this latest activity?
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:36.520]  Is this another sign of desperation from the establishment trying to behave like, hey, we like Ron Paul too?
[3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:39.520]  Well, it is, but it also is a sign of fear.
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  Because even though, of course, every time, Ron made this point last night,
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:47.520]  every time there's a story about him, the first line is always, of course, he can't win.
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:52.520]  Well, of course, he can win. He is like the tortoise accumulating the delegates,
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:56.520]  especially if it's a brokered convention. He could have a very important role to play.
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:01.520]  They want to diminish him. They want to smear him. And this is smear number 185.
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:06.520]  And I'm sure there'll be others to come. It's just another trick.
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:10.520]  So they're not going to ask him to be vice president.
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:13.520]  It's just not going to happen now.
[3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:18.520]  If we go back to the original days of the American Republic and the way the Constitution was originally written,
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:22.520]  the president and the vice president were supposed to be antagonists
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:27.520]  because the vice president was the man who came in second in the presidential election.
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:30.520]  That's the way the founders wrote the Constitution originally.
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:35.520]  So if we think of that, you know, it would be if Ron were to go in there
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:39.520]  and fight hammer and tongs from the vice presidents against everything the president was doing,
[3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:41.520]  that would be pretty great.
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  But we can really, really have to state that to realize there's no way in a heck
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:48.520]  that they would allow Ron Paul to play that role.
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:51.520]  Well, that's exactly what I said earlier.
[3:15:51.520 --> 3:15:56.520]  And it's not because you and I are reading from the same song sheets because it's common sense.
[3:15:56.520 --> 3:16:00.520]  It's our American system. It's our constitutional republic.
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:03.520]  But yeah, they are putting this out there as a wedge.
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:06.520]  Now Rand is a great guy, obviously. Chip off the old block.
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:09.520]  He's done what he said he would do in the Senate. We're proud of him.
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:11.520]  But he's being a little too gentlemanly.
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:15.520]  And it's okay for us to give him advice. You know, they're not God, none of us are.
[3:16:15.520 --> 3:16:17.520]  And they like advice.
[3:16:17.520 --> 3:16:24.520]  But I, you know, whatever he was asked, would you take a VP slot for one of the other Republicans?
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:28.520]  He said, well, you know, it'd be a great honor to be considered.
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:33.520]  And I think by great honor to be considered for VP, well, it is an honor when you think about the American system.
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:39.520]  But I would say, no, I wouldn't from the other candidates. I can't compromise.
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:43.520]  I mean, that's a no brainer. And then I think what gives some fuel to this concern,
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:46.520]  I think Ron Paul needs to say something about it and soon.
[3:16:46.520 --> 3:16:53.520]  And I got, I saw this a month ago, you know, where Jesse Benton told the Dallas Morning News
[3:16:53.520 --> 3:16:58.520]  that any Republican should be looking at Rand Paul as a potential running mate
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:02.520]  because he's the smartest guy in the room and he has tremendous credibility with conservatives.
[3:17:02.520 --> 3:17:04.520]  So these are the type of quotes out there.
[3:17:04.520 --> 3:17:10.520]  We don't want to give our credibility to somebody like Mitt Romney, who we know is bought and paid for by the bad guys.
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:14.520]  This is going to destroy our credibility. And I guess it's a difference of thought processes,
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:16.520]  but I would imagine you would agree. I'm not attacking Benton.
[3:17:16.520 --> 3:17:19.520]  I've interviewed him. He's a nice guy, a smart guy, I'm sure.
[3:17:19.520 --> 3:17:25.520]  But this idea that we're going to co-opt them instead of them co-opting us, that's just not how this works.
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:28.520]  Their system's in the verge of coming down right now.
[3:17:28.520 --> 3:17:33.520]  This isn't when we want to merge with these people. I mean, what's your take on that?
[3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:38.520]  Well, Romney, I guess, is a more gentlemanly guy than Santorum or Gingrich.
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:44.520]  That wouldn't be hard. I'm sure he's a more pleasant guy, but he's a monster.
[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:47.520]  This is not a snuff. This is just because he looks good in a suit.
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:50.520]  Doesn't mean he's anything but one of the top creeps.
[3:17:50.520 --> 3:17:55.520]  Otherwise, he wouldn't be supported by the Republican establishment and by the establishment in general.
[3:17:55.520 --> 3:17:58.520]  So no, we don't want anything to do with him except to oppose him.
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:03.520]  Oppose him as a candidate. Oppose him if God forbid he becomes president.
[3:18:03.520 --> 3:18:08.520]  Well, I'm going to be honest. I could care less about the star stuff of politics.
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:11.520]  Holly would all that because I've been there. I've seen and I've done it.
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:16.520]  And I don't get critical of some of the people that advised Ron Paul because I know he runs the show at the end of the day.
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:21.520]  He's got to have helpers. But I mean, I look at people like you and others I've seen that have worked for Paul
[3:18:21.520 --> 3:18:24.520]  who are so 100% dead on laser beam.
[3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:27.520]  And then I see some of the other stuff coming out from these younger folks.
[3:18:27.520 --> 3:18:30.520]  And I think they should be sitting at your feet in Ron Paul's feet.
[3:18:30.520 --> 3:18:33.520]  Instead, every time I look, they're advising him.
[3:18:33.520 --> 3:18:36.520]  I see Ron saying, I'm getting advice from my staff.
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:39.520]  You're getting advice. You're getting advice.
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:44.520]  I mean, again, I'm not trying to get into inside baseball or infighting here.
[3:18:44.520 --> 3:18:49.520]  But I mean, why isn't Lou Rockwell in the campaign advising?
[3:18:49.520 --> 3:18:59.520]  Well, I've had enough of that. I've done real politics, which by which I mean evil politics.
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:01.520]  I've worked for regular Republicans.
[3:19:01.520 --> 3:19:05.520]  Really starting since I worked for Barry Goldwater when he ran for president.
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:07.520]  I had the great honor to work for Paul.
[3:19:07.520 --> 3:19:11.520]  You have a long history publishing true activism, so you're sick of it.
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:17.520]  Well, I must say, even though, of course, I make an exception for Ron Paul because he is the exception with a capital E.
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:20.520]  I must say, I don't like politics. I don't like the political system.
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:21.520]  I think it's corrupt.
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:24.520]  And Ron Paul is like the minister in the whorehouse.
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:29.520]  I mean, this is, he stands apart from the rest of these guys.
[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:37.520]  And nobody is going to advise him successfully to cut back on his views to say something he doesn't believe.
[3:19:37.520 --> 3:19:39.520]  He's a straight arrow. He's the real deal.
[3:19:39.520 --> 3:19:41.520]  And we constructed 100%.
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:44.520]  Stay there. Let's come back and talk about some positive areas then.
[3:19:44.520 --> 3:19:47.520]  But absolutely, this is the end of the day statement.
[3:19:47.520 --> 3:19:51.520]  If it doesn't come out of Ron Paul's mouth, it isn't attributable to him.
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:53.520]  Period. Period.
[3:19:53.520 --> 3:20:22.520]  He speaks for Ron Paul.
[3:20:23.520 --> 3:20:43.520]  He speaks for Ron Paul.
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:54.520]  The ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:21:05.520]  I think the national debt is $15 trillion. Boston U Economics professor Lawrence Kotlikoff astutely points out that after factoring in guarantees such as social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and defense expenditures,
[3:21:05.520 --> 3:21:14.520]  the national debt is closer to $211 trillion. Mathematically, this debt is not serviceable via taxation. And for politicians on Capitol Hill, default is not an option.
[3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:20.520]  So we can expect the Federal Reserve to monetize the short while resulting in even more confiscation of our hard earned savings via inflation.
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:24.520]  Hi, my name is Adam Miller with Midas Resources. In light of the MF Global Swindle,
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:32.520]  it is now more apparent than ever that our savings investments are not secure in the hands of traditional banking institutions overseen by government technocrats kept in their back pockets.

[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:54.520]  I'll even send you a booklet titled 10 reasons to own gold to serve as a guide. That number again is 800-686-2237-Extension 148-800-686-2237-Extension 148.
[3:21:54.520 --> 3:22:04.520]  What is the most abundant resource on earth? Water. It's essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available. When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves.
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:10.520]  Like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin, three days without water and your body begins to shut down.
[3:22:10.520 --> 3:22:16.520]  Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits. Get a flow jack hand well pump.
[3:22:16.520 --> 3:22:25.520]  An affordable flow jack drops right into almost any well and is easy to install without having to remove the existing pump, giving you immediate access to plenty of cool, clean water.
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:32.520]  You could risk your family's health on a limited supply of stored water, or you could be prepared with the reliable, affordable flow jack backup hand pump kit.

[3:22:54.520 --> 3:23:03.520]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. That bears repeating. Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:59.520]  Big John. Big John.
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:12.520]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive. He stood six foot six and waited 245 kind of broad at the shoulder. Narrowed to hip. And everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John.
[3:24:12.520 --> 3:24:27.520]  Yeah. Look, we only got four or five minutes left with Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com. Invaluable analysis from a common sense pro-liberty perspective. And this calling is kooks, extremists, dangerous. It's only helping us.
[3:24:27.520 --> 3:24:37.520]  Because the system is dangerous. They're kooky. They're out of touch with reality and common sense. Lou Rockwell shifting gears into some other areas.
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:44.520]  I had John a few weeks ago and there was some evidence of fraud. And you said, look, they've lied to us about everything else. Why wouldn't they?
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:52.520]  But now, Maine, they admit they didn't count these counties just so happens where Ron Paul was dominating. Same thing in Iowa. They're saying that's now up in the air.
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:25:03.520]  I mean, we've got some clear evidence of fraud here. Ron Paul has said he's looking into it now. What would you do? I know you don't speak for the campaign, but what? I mean, we know Ron listens to you. What would you do?
[3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:11.520]  Well, I think, I think exactly what Ron's going to do is going to look into it. He's going to make sure he's got the evidence. And then he's going to, if he feels it's appropriate, he's going to speak out.
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:22.520]  And he made a comment. In fact, in the debate last night, a funny comment about the votes in Maine. So, of course, it's clear that we only have to think of who goes into politics.
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:29.520]  It's the crookedest people we know, the demagogues, the liars, the thieves. So, of course, the elections are typically stolen.
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:40.520]  At least on the margin. Mayor Daley was not a unique figure in American life. So, that's why you have to have valid access, security, and to the extent you can.
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:51.520]  And it's wonderful, I would say, what happened in Maine and Nevada, where they were so openly taking it that I think it helps educate people to just watch out and to think that democracy is its practice in the United States.
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:58.520]  And as, of course, the United States proclaims around the world, they're going to force it on everybody else. This is not such a great system.
[3:25:58.520 --> 3:26:10.520]  The American Republic, a different story, but this mass, mass democracy of this sort, the crooked democracy is unpleasant and real negative for our country.
[3:26:10.520 --> 3:26:17.520]  I totally agree with you. I mean, we're not glad they're doing the bad things, but now that they're so out in the open, we are getting lemonade out of the lemons.
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:24.520]  I mean, look at how they're in the old paradigm where there wasn't new media to challenge them, stealing things in the open still.
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:31.520]  And I see what little bit of credibility they had bleeding out on the floor. Are you seeing the same thing, Liv?
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:36.520]  Sure. And it's subverting them. This is, as you say, it's not a good idea that they're stealing stuff.
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:43.520]  However, given that they're stealing, how much better it is that it's in the open, and this is subverting them, Americans are waking up.
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:50.520]  This is showing people in the Ron Paul campaign. In fact, anybody who's been following American politics in this election, the thing is crooked.
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:57.520]  So it's a good thing that people feel that way. It helps them understand that the entire government is crooked, that they always lie to us.
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:06.520]  Whatever they're claiming about Iran, about Syria, about Social Security, about banks, to go down the list of 150 subjects, they are always lying.
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:14.520]  That's the one thing you can be sure of. They always lie. So it's up to us to find out the truth. Alex, you help people find out the truth.
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:22.520]  And this is a very important thing. We are reaching the American people, and they are no longer going to put up with this.
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:30.520]  So I think this is why they're so worried. It's why they're calling Ron Paul a Romney assistant and all that sort of thing, the latest smear.
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:39.520]  Yeah, I agree with you. And having a Bilderberg guy set up a super pack and implying that Ron Paul's a globalist when I can set up a super pack,
[3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:45.520]  Jesse Jackson can set up a super pack for anybody. I mean, it's ridiculous. They're just pulling out all the stops.
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:51.520]  Now, in closing, we've got about two and a half minutes left. I like to always ask this question because we don't do pre-interviews, as you know.
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:59.520]  What is foremost in two and a half minute closing statement on your radar right now? What's really got you excited? What's got you angry?
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:09.520]  Well, first of all, what's got me angry and got me worried is another war. Obviously, they're attempting to overthrow the last secular regime in the Arab world in Syria.
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:15.520]  That's going to lead to vast massacres. This has happened in Libya, and it's going to put even worse people in charge.
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:23.520]  There are people worse than Saddam Hussein or Assad or the dictator of Libya, and they come into power. We call it democracy.
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:31.520]  Well, you know, it's just more corruption, more death. Then, of course, the real enemy, at least to this stage of things, is Iran.
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:39.520]  They killed a million people in Iraq. I don't know how many they plan to kill in Iran, but this is not only, of course, a moral disaster, but it's an economic disaster.
[3:28:39.520 --> 3:28:46.520]  We're going to have $10 a gallon gas if they do it. A lot of people think that's great. They think it's great to the environmentalists think so,
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:54.520]  and so do the neocons. Force Americans to use less gasoline, drive less, live at a lower standard of living for foreign purposes.
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:29:04.520]  So this is obviously not a good thing. It's frightening. They're going to spend trillions of dollars more on this war, and again, they're going to build up a mountain of corpses.
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:12.520]  All the pro-life people like Aramni and Santorum and Gingrich, they're happy to slit the throats of the little children in Iran, of course.
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:22.520]  So these people are not pro-life, they're pro-death. So what's got me excited is what Ron Paul is doing, the millions of young people he's reached,
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:30.520]  not only in this country, but around the world, because of liberty, Austrian economics. He's already won the election in this sense because of the young people he's created.
[3:29:30.520 --> 3:29:35.520]  He has. Great job, Lou Rockwell. Thank you so much, my friend. Thanks for coming on short notice.
[3:29:35.520 --> 3:29:42.520]  Lourockwell.com, our site's info wars.com. Great job, Lou. Talk to you again soon. All right, folks, stay with us.
