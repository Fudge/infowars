[00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:10.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.625]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.186]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:17.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:21.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.903]  Yeah.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.921]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.763]  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:53.588]  I am making my way towards my destination this Sunday, Orlando, Florida, where we're number one.
[00:00:53.588 --> 00:01:03.995]  Going from like number four, number five in every major demographic in the last six months on 810, the big talker, since they've had my show on there just for a year or so.
[00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:08.439]  First was on the weekend, then they picked it up for less than a year, weekdays, live.
[00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.641]  We're on there right now, and now number one in every major demographic, smashing Rush Limbaugh.
[00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:22.663]  We've seen that happen in other cities, even with smaller stations than a big blowtorch like A-10, where Goliath cannot stand against the truth.
[00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:29.429]  Again, the fact is, freedom is popular, the truth is popular.
[00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:38.738]  Jeffrey R. Smith, a real expert and investigative journalist and filmmaker, will be joining us the last hour and a half today to talk about GMO.
[00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:45.402]  And toxic fluoride, the history of Monsanto, aspartame, all of it.
[00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:46.903]  There's been a lot of big new developments.
[00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:56.149]  They're coming out with hundreds of new crops, not just the 30 or so that were force-fed and that governments are moving to pass laws where you're not allowed to even label it.
[00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.333]  Not that you have to label, or not that you don't have to label, but that you're not allowed to tell someone.
[00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.995]  So we're going to be talking to him about that eugenics operation.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:27.293]  Coming up in the second half of the transmission today Obviously there is a large flotilla of incredibly important news at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com That we're going to be covering today and I'm gonna give the number out
[00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:32.326]  During the third segment at 24 After.
[00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:34.387]  But I'm not going to open the phones yet.
[00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:38.430]  And I'm going to specifically tell callers that I do want you to call in on one subject.
[00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.631]  And we do this about once a week.
[00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:41.553]  No one follows the rule.
[00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:44.095]  And I sit there and politely let folks talk about whatever they want.
[00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.036]  That's not going to happen today.
[00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.018]  Just because things are getting a little too serious here.
[00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:54.823]  And we need to sometimes actually need to focus on some issues and actually hear from people that want to discuss the points that I'm raising.
[00:02:56.745 --> 00:03:14.331]  We do have free-for-alls most days, but we're going to be talking about something that I saw in the news a month ago in mainstream papers, something that Justin Raimondo of Annie War wrote a very good article about three weeks ago that I had highlighted and meant to cover on air, but never got to.
[00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:18.513]  I mean, I mentioned some of it, but didn't really read into the meat of it.
[00:03:18.513 --> 00:03:22.214]  Titled, Ron Paul Won't Sell Out, But Others Will.
[00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:38.904]  And I read the article, and I intended to read it, but I think I kind of subconsciously held back on reading it, because even though I think Raimondo is right in what he says in his article, and by the way, I want to get him on the show, guys, concerning that.
[00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:47.827]  I thought about doing it at the time, and I was on razor's edge, because it borders on infighting, but it's not.
[00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.568]  And I was at least going to mention the article and say, what do you think of this?
[00:03:52.197 --> 00:04:17.407]  And then I never got around to it basically and I think that was subconsciously my instinct is to not engage in a bunch of infighting or second-guessing of people that have bonafide, clear, decisive records of being no compromise and being absolutely committed to liberty and who I trust and who I've measured and looked into the soul of.
[00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:24.620]  As Putin said about George W. Bush in a joking way, I looked into his eyes and saw his soul and knew he was a good man.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.765]  That was a sick Russian joke, of course.
[00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:29.129]  You can look at Putin too and tell he's a killer.
[00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:31.512]  And I'm a thug.
[00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:50.524]  I wouldn't say the type of pervert that George W. Bush is, but the point is that guy that, you know, gets off on torture and makes jokes about it and stuff and sends military to prison, who follows the orders to torture as scapegoats, but then later writes a book admitting he ordered torture and says he'd do it again.
[00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:51.945]  Side issue.
[00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:53.546]  I'll tell you what I'm talking about when we come back.
[00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:57.388]  It deals with Ron Paul and Mitt Romney and a VP run.
[00:04:57.388 --> 00:04:58.229]  That's right, on the ticket.
[00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:03.827]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:07.509]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:08.029]  Number 10.
[00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.571]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:11.332]  Number 9.
[00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:13.153]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:17.075]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:17.395]  7.
[00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.337]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:20.397]  6.
[00:05:20.397 --> 00:05:22.599]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.802]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[00:05:26.802 --> 00:05:30.806]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:34.189]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.493]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:44.359]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:45.640]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.901]  Get prepared now.
[00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:48.862]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:51.444]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[00:05:51.444 --> 00:05:53.966]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:04.829]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:05.729]  Number one.
[00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.171]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.031]  Number two.
[00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:14.913]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.913 --> 00:06:15.653]  It's true.
[00:06:15.653 --> 00:06:20.215]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:21.356]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:24.939]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.863]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:29.643]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.643 --> 00:06:32.426]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:35.769]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:41.014]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:46.079]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.263]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.263 --> 00:06:52.044]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:56.649]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.957 --> 00:07:05.918]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:14.781]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:19.402]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:30.225]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:40.368]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:45.790]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:53.293]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:53.293 --> 00:07:55.694]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.234]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.234 --> 00:08:11.816]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:13.357]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:17.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:21.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:35.094]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday.
[00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:48.680]  The third day of February 2012, and we're going to have an absolutely vital and jam-packed transmission lined up for you here today.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:09:02.670]  Of course, the websites leading the pack of the exploding alternative media that is overthrowing the corporatist New World Order prostitute media are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.351]  InfoWars.com alone
[00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:13.135]  is the number one alternative news website in the world and PresidentPlanet.com is a distant second.
[00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:18.258]  Of course, I don't call the DrudgeReport.com an alternative site.
[00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:20.739]  It's kind of its own one-off
[00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:25.321]  Himalayan mountain range of media power.
[00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:31.344]  It's bigger than the New York Times and Twitter and Facebook and things like that combined with news drivers.
[00:09:31.344 --> 00:09:32.705]  So that's a totally different animal.
[00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:35.207]  When it comes to all other media, we are number one.
[00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:43.972]  When it comes to somebody who's doing a radio show, doing a TV show, who has a news system, InfoWars.com is it.
[00:09:43.972 --> 00:09:50.156]  And I raise that at least once a week at the start of the show more and more because we've had that position for a couple of years.
[00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:52.659]  You can go to Google Analytics.
[00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:53.881]  You can go to StatBrain.
[00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.046]  You can go to dozens of big systems.
[00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.150]  You can go to Alexa.com.
[00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.278]  On an average day, we have about 30 times the visitors of somebody like MSNBC.com.
[00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:15.264]  I mean, they're literally the mouse that roared, or a mouse that's too big, the mouse, the tiny baby mouse that squeaked.
[00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:23.633]  But because they've got teleprompters and fancy sets, the small group of people that actually watch it, most of their shows have 100,000 viewers, their biggest 500, 600, 800,000 some days.
[00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:24.854]  I mean, it is a giant illusion.
[00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:32.099]  And I point that out because it just runs from that point on.
[00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:37.501]  The mainstream media is an empty, rotten husk.
[00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:47.384]  Everywhere where the media is uncontrolled or long-form and open and unscripted, that's where you have the large audiences.
[00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:49.004]  And of course, look at talk radio.
[00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:50.405]  It is the only old media
[00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:53.858]  That is still extremely popular.
[00:10:53.858 --> 00:11:04.244]  Radio shows here in the United States, there are more than a hundred radio programs that are rated to have over a million listeners a day in this country.
[00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:04.825]  Think about that.
[00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:14.630]  There's only two cable network news systems that have a million people on average watching any hour.
[00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.292]  In fact, CNN doesn't even have that, so I guess it's only Fox.
[00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:20.914]  They are legends in your mind and in my mind.
[00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:31.988]  One of the last dominoes to fall is that we, the alternative press, are in awe even when we get on the dinosaur media.
[00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:35.510]  And wow, I happen to see you on Fox or CNN.
[00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.310]  Ooh, congratulations.
[00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.552]  That's one of the last dominoes to fall.
[00:11:40.932 --> 00:11:44.034]  Uh, is that we don't realize how powerful we are.
[00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:46.095]  I would have said legends in their own mind.
[00:11:46.095 --> 00:11:48.096]  And some of the anchors are legends in their own minds.
[00:11:48.096 --> 00:11:57.701]  Uh, but, uh, the system knows that they have a dwindling, tiny audience.
[00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:07.687]  Uh, 25 years ago, network broadcast news, on average, had 30 million viewers during a program, during the dinnertime hour, 5 or 6 o'clock.
[00:12:09.077 --> 00:12:36.972]  Nightline would have you know 15 million viewers at 10 30 or 11 at night came on different times I certainly know when I was up late when I was a kid my parents would watch it if they were up That hasn't been the case obviously with cable news more choice, and then that's now all in an exodus to the to the internet and so the the system the system knows what they're doing and
[00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:53.815]  The system is desperate to continue to add more teleprompters, more flash, more regalia, more flashing flashbulbs to create the perception that there is a separation between them and anybody else.
[00:12:54.776 --> 00:12:58.340]  More and more the internet has created a fair playing field.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:05.369]  They still have the big money, they have the big names, the big guests, but more and more it's a more and more of a level playing field.
[00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:11.096]  It's still somewhat slanted and they're losing because people won't trust them.
[00:13:11.096 --> 00:13:12.678]  They've been caught lying so many times.
[00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:40.111]  And it's because of that that you have the perfect storm of old dinosaur trader media, sewer stream media, Decepticon media, coming out and working with government and trying to massage the public and sell the public on the end of demonstrations, the end of rallies, the end of protest, the end of free speech, the end of the Fourth Amendment, the end of states' rights, the end of Internet freedom, supporting Internet taxes, supporting regulations, supporting copyright and trademark laws,
[00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:40.851]  We're good to go.
[00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:12.369]  In their desperate bid.
[00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:16.590]  And we're seeing the last gasp of the corporate horror media.
[00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.991]  Four years ago they were able to suppress Ron Paul and keep him from becoming a frontrunner.
[00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:21.991]  This time he's become the frontrunner.
[00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:26.232]  All the major polls, numbers, election fraud show that.
[00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.432]  And I've gone over that in detail.
[00:14:28.432 --> 00:14:33.013]  But now, now that illusion is threadbare.
[00:14:33.013 --> 00:14:34.533]  Now that's worn out.
[00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:44.586]  Like so many Gatorbacks, as they call them, the old 18-wheeler tires blown out on the side of the road.
[00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:47.688]  The system is running on bald tires.
[00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:49.909]  The system is blowing out more and more of its tires.
[00:14:49.909 --> 00:14:51.230]  It's not going to make it.
[00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.311]  So something's going to change.
[00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:53.972]  They're going to launch false flag attacks.
[00:14:53.972 --> 00:14:58.114]  They're going to start a whole bunch of big wars, not just proxy wars and covert wars.
[00:14:58.114 --> 00:14:59.215]  And they're going to go after domestic
[00:14:59.295 --> 00:14:59.615]  We're good.
[00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:32.156]  The opposition.
[00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:41.227]  But on this freer and freer playing field that we stand on collectively here,
[00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:44.721]  It is coming down to your brains.
[00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:46.142]  It's coming down to your eloquence.
[00:15:46.142 --> 00:15:48.123]  It's coming down to your analysis.
[00:15:48.123 --> 00:15:50.004]  It's coming down to reality.
[00:15:50.004 --> 00:16:01.773]  The Internet has allowed a giant spectrum of everything from corporatist propaganda to schizoid paranoia to hilarity and comedy.
[00:16:02.593 --> 00:16:17.557]  Straight through to the mundane, to incredible educational developments, and a love of learning, and a new renaissance being discovered, right through to exploding true journalism analysis, cutting satire.
[00:16:17.557 --> 00:16:29.540]  It is a cornucopia, a full spectrum for people to sample and research and develop their own palate, their own taste, their own repertoire of understanding.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.600]  And the system knows that.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.002]  And so they are moving to shut it down.
[00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:40.348]  And Ron Paul, the fact that they haven't been able to suppress him, and the fact that he really is, in almost every state, THE frontrunner.
[00:16:40.348 --> 00:16:46.333]  Remember, they said he couldn't win, and then when he would get in second place, they wouldn't mention in different primaries that he even got second place.
[00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:50.397]  Just like they wouldn't mention when he got first place in the straw poll, they'd mention second, third, and fourth place.
[00:16:50.897 --> 00:16:52.479]  Or they give him the least amount of time.
[00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:53.960]  You saw that that fix was in.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:59.805]  And despite that, he won Maine, he won Iowa, he won Nevada, and it's come out.
[00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:01.066]  It's in those local papers now.
[00:17:01.066 --> 00:17:10.955]  It's not a new story to those of us that listen to this show, or those of you that were delegates, or those of you that were there witnessing it, who reported it all state by state to us as it happened.
[00:17:10.955 --> 00:17:12.936]  And were our listeners proven accurate?
[00:17:13.897 --> 00:17:14.978]  After each of those primaries?
[00:17:14.978 --> 00:17:15.618]  Yeah.
[00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:16.198]  Weeks later.
[00:17:16.198 --> 00:17:20.761]  In the case of Iowa, months later, they cancel the election and say, we're just throwing the whole thing out.
[00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:22.142]  It was all a fraud.
[00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:23.603]  We say Santorum's the winner.
[00:17:23.603 --> 00:17:25.364]  We're not going to say if that means it gets the delegates.
[00:17:25.364 --> 00:17:27.005]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:27.705]  Same thing in Maine.
[00:17:27.705 --> 00:17:31.307]  Yeah, we didn't count all the big counties where Ron Paul had double-digit leads.
[00:17:31.307 --> 00:17:36.070]  Yeah, the head of the party even says it's a fraud, but we're not going to tell you when you ever get to cast those ballots.
[00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.910]  Mitt Romney keeps it.
[00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.491]  Okay?
[00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:40.172]  It's just the way it is.
[00:17:40.172 --> 00:17:41.953]  Same thing in South Carolina.
[00:17:41.953 --> 00:17:42.854]  Same thing in Nevada.
[00:17:43.727 --> 00:17:55.936]  And this is just revealing, they're using the old game that they had before of just cheating everybody out in the open back when they had media dominance or air superiority basically over us.
[00:17:55.936 --> 00:18:01.119]  And now they're doing their old tricks in front of everyone, just burning down their own house.
[00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:05.042]  Okay, you just stole it again, but this time people are watching.
[00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:09.045]  You know, before maybe 5% were aware and called conspiracy theorists for not trusting known liars.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.603]  Four years ago, maybe 35%.
[00:18:12.603 --> 00:18:14.725]  Now to basic fraud and election fraud.
[00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:17.408]  I saw a Gallup poll a year ago, like 85%.
[00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:22.573]  I've seen some polls as high as 91% don't trust the election process.
[00:18:22.573 --> 00:18:25.916]  Now, they've even got mainstream TV saying it looks suspicious.
[00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:29.220]  Even the New York Times to stay credible is saying it looks like Ron Paul won Maine.
[00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:34.949]  So see, it isn't working anymore.
[00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:37.890]  In the past, they could steal things because, oh, that doesn't happen in America.
[00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.471]  We have free and fair elections.
[00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:41.553]  And that's what allowed the corruption to grow.
[00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:44.074]  Now people are going, OK, I'm looking for the fraud.
[00:18:44.074 --> 00:18:45.074]  Oh, I guess it's there.
[00:18:45.074 --> 00:18:46.235]  Looks like fraud in Iowa.
[00:18:46.235 --> 00:18:47.616]  Oh, it's confirmed now?
[00:18:47.616 --> 00:18:50.097]  Oh, Maine fraud confirmed?
[00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:53.719]  Oh, South Carolina fraud confirmed?
[00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:54.780]  This is what's going on.
[00:18:56.659 --> 00:19:08.014]  And it's a sad prospect, but it's better than just sitting here and buying the lies and not having somebody run for office, because then you don't put somebody in there to prove that it's a fraud.
[00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:15.353]  It'd be kind of like if they had ten horses in a horse race and only one of them wasn't bought and paid for.
[00:19:15.353 --> 00:19:22.018]  And on the off chance that, you know, that jockey's not paid off and the horse is a good horse and starts, you know, running and winning.
[00:19:22.018 --> 00:19:33.906]  I mean, when he wins by, you know, five horse lengths, do they say, well, you know, the jockey did something wrong or lied on his weight, so now you don't win.
[00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:37.277]  Well, the first time you're like, yeah, maybe that is true.
[00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:43.399]  But if it happens 10 times, 20 times, 50 times, 100 times, you know what's going on.
[00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.960]  Now, when I come back, I'm getting into our big top story.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.862]  Has Ron Paul formed a political alliance with Mitt Romney?
[00:19:50.862 --> 00:19:53.103]  It's big news in the Washington Post as well.
[00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:55.743]  Is he going to run as VP with Mitt Romney?
[00:19:55.743 --> 00:19:59.725]  Unfortunately, people in his campaign are talking about this.
[00:20:00.779 --> 00:20:05.240]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.720]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:15.623]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:19.043]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:20.144]  But take heart.
[00:20:20.144 --> 00:20:23.885]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:20:23.885 --> 00:20:28.866]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:20:29.286 --> 00:20:33.129]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:20:33.129 --> 00:20:34.870]  The globalists are scared.
[00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.190]  They've overreached.
[00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.713]  The future of the Info War is in your hands.

[00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:35.310]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:41.134]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:41.134 --> 00:23:44.756]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:59.326 --> 00:23:59.414]  Yeah.
[00:24:19.947 --> 00:24:28.433]  Alright, we are back live and there is a special report by Paul Joseph Watson on the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:31.335]  In fact, I'm going to get that red link that's so important.
[00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:36.499]  Has Ron Paul formed a political alliance with Mitt Romney?
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:46.866]  And of course it follows the Washington Post, MSNBC, hundreds of publications and outfits today are running with the headlines.
[00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:50.408]  Will Ron Paul be the VP running mate of Mitt Romney?
[00:24:52.470 --> 00:25:02.381]  And the Romney people wouldn't answer the question but said that Ron Paul was an iconoclast and a guy that stands for what he believes in.
[00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:12.312]  So I have been following this and hearing about this for over a month because people in the Paul campaign have been talking to people about it.
[00:25:12.312 --> 00:25:13.693]  Not Ron Paul himself,
[00:25:14.894 --> 00:25:15.335]  I don't
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.282]  I guess more than that, probably 15 times now that I think about it.
[00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:40.711]  I used to interview him years ago, probably one of the first interviews ever, because I actually went out and looked for his family and people that were politically active locally.
[00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:45.956]  Like I've interviewed Wayne Paul, his brother, and I've interviewed Rand now that I think about it, probably a decade ago.
[00:25:45.956 --> 00:25:46.697]  Wow.
[00:25:46.697 --> 00:25:51.182]  But I've interviewed him five or six times, well a few times to get him to run.
[00:25:52.043 --> 00:25:53.464]  He's like, gee, I don't know.
[00:25:53.464 --> 00:25:55.725]  And, you know, I was calling him up at his house to get him on.
[00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:56.985]  And yeah, you need to do it.
[00:25:56.985 --> 00:25:58.866]  Form the exploratory committee.
[00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:01.247]  Oh, gee, Alex, I'd never get elected senator.
[00:26:01.247 --> 00:26:06.550]  You know, I just... And then, of course, they tried to block him from even being able to...
[00:26:09.249 --> 00:26:15.872]  Get on the ballot, and then the Republican establishment tried to keep him from being able to be at fundraisers, even speak to Republican groups.
[00:26:15.872 --> 00:26:24.636]  But all that failed, and we backed him, our audience backed him, and just like Ron Paul said four years ago on this show, half the initial money he got to run in 2008 was from this audience.
[00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:26.537]  In 2007.
[00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:53.787]  Next month.
[00:26:53.787 --> 00:26:55.407]  17 years next month on air.
[00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:57.728]  I've been interviewing Ron Paul about 16 and a half years.
[00:26:57.728 --> 00:27:02.669]  I've been on radio just a few months when I first interviewed him because his district used to come right up to South Austin.
[00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:03.769]  They've rewritten it a few times.
[00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:09.131]  But the reason I'm giving you some background before I even get into what I'm going to say here is because I'm really just thinking aloud.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.881]  I know Ron Paul is a person of impeccable integrity.
[00:27:13.881 --> 00:27:17.583]  His voting record is perfect constitutional voting record.
[00:27:17.583 --> 00:27:21.704]  He never compromises on what he believes in and he never waffles or waivers.
[00:27:21.704 --> 00:27:29.167]  And even if you don't believe in all of his ideas, I believe in about 99% of them because they're sound and make sense and they're just common sense and constitutional.
[00:27:30.017 --> 00:27:33.898]  That's how we have the same views on pretty much any issue without even seeing what each other think.
[00:27:33.898 --> 00:27:38.659]  Same thing with Lou Rockwell, same thing with Rand, because it's just the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:43.800]  If you know that, you know what America is, you know what made us great, and you're following the same road map.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:49.501]  You know, how does somebody drive from Austin, Texas to Pensacola, Florida, where I am right now?
[00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.121]  Or outside Pensacola.
[00:27:51.121 --> 00:27:51.741]  How do you do that?
[00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:53.642]  Well, you got a road map.
[00:27:53.642 --> 00:27:54.802]  Well, how does somebody else get there?
[00:27:54.802 --> 00:27:55.402]  Well, a road map.
[00:27:56.463 --> 00:27:57.844]  Same thing.
[00:27:57.844 --> 00:28:00.065]  So I know they're a family of integrity.
[00:28:00.065 --> 00:28:00.926]  And they're good people.
[00:28:00.926 --> 00:28:05.068]  And they're very shrewd and kind of a down-home way.
[00:28:05.068 --> 00:28:06.929]  And they're servant types.
[00:28:06.929 --> 00:28:08.550]  And they're hard-working, dedicated types.
[00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.132]  They're salt-of-the-earth Americana.
[00:28:11.132 --> 00:28:19.436]  That said, I've seen Ron Paul when he's on Jay Leno or on these shows and around a movie star or something.
[00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:23.799]  And he's not starstruck for his ego, but he does get starstruck by things.
[00:28:23.799 --> 00:28:25.100]  I've watched Ron Paul carefully.
[00:28:26.439 --> 00:28:27.333]  And, uh...
[00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:31.973]  On issues, he's 100%.
[00:28:31.973 --> 00:28:48.801]  But I think on relationships, and over time, you know, being kind of friendly to the Republican establishment just because he's in that party, and it's more of almost like Ron Paul, people that work for him and are around him, it's almost like it's a form of hospitality.
[00:28:48.801 --> 00:28:53.944]  That, well, you just tolerate what people around you are doing even though you don't agree with it.
[00:28:53.944 --> 00:28:56.365]  I know I do that with my employees and my crew.
[00:28:57.705 --> 00:29:03.348]  I don't sit there and hammer into them what I believe and what I think in some corporate handbook of our ideas.
[00:29:03.348 --> 00:29:05.409]  And I never try to dominate people.
[00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:14.313]  And so sometimes it starts turning around the other way, where because I'm not always trying to put my will on people, then sometimes it's the opposite.
[00:29:14.313 --> 00:29:19.355]  That's kind of why in a corporate environment, their reason to dominate you and do all that is so you understand that.
[00:29:20.922 --> 00:29:23.708]  And again, I'm getting into the complexities of these.
[00:29:23.708 --> 00:29:25.631]  We have a long 18-minute break coming up.
[00:29:25.631 --> 00:29:29.719]  And then after I cover this, I'll give the number out and get your take and your view on it.
[00:29:29.719 --> 00:29:32.525]  In fact, I'll give the number out now and come back and really tell you what I think.
[00:29:33.686 --> 00:29:34.587]  And I'm just going to say it.
[00:29:34.587 --> 00:29:49.979]  I'm going to tell you what I really think, the different angles of it, concerning all this hype with Ron Paul, the talk of him running as a VP with Mitt Romney, and some of the folks on his campaign that are excited about that.
[00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:53.902]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.902 --> 00:29:56.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:02.201]  I had tried everything.
[00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:07.683]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:30:07.683 --> 00:30:12.524]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:30:12.524 --> 00:30:18.886]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:30:19.386 --> 00:30:30.597]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:30.597 --> 00:30:35.082]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:30:35.082 --> 00:30:38.085]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:30:38.425 --> 00:30:41.326]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:41.326 --> 00:30:42.887]  Now that's results.
[00:30:42.887 --> 00:30:49.689]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:30:49.689 --> 00:30:55.411]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:01.878]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.878 --> 00:31:07.460]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:12.482]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.482 --> 00:31:17.504]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:23.266]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:30.389]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:31.509]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:37.852]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:38.192 --> 00:31:41.374]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:41.374 --> 00:31:43.595]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:43.595 --> 00:31:44.535]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:44.735]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:44.735 --> 00:31:48.177]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:48.177 --> 00:31:49.938]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:00.598 --> 00:32:03.541]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:07.224]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:07.744]  Number 10.
[00:32:07.744 --> 00:32:10.287]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[00:32:10.287 --> 00:32:11.027]  Number 9.
[00:32:11.027 --> 00:32:12.849]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[00:32:12.849 --> 00:32:16.772]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:17.093]  7.
[00:32:17.093 --> 00:32:19.055]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[00:32:19.055 --> 00:32:20.115]  6.
[00:32:20.115 --> 00:32:22.297]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:26.500]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.502]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[00:32:30.502 --> 00:32:33.884]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[00:32:33.884 --> 00:32:38.206]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:44.049]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:45.350]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.610]  Get prepared now.

[00:33:12.193 --> 00:33:15.356]  Alright, we are back live and we're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:33:15.356 --> 00:33:16.537]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:16.537 --> 00:33:17.678]  Central that's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:17.678 --> 00:33:18.039]  Eastern.
[00:33:37.751 --> 00:33:39.531]  That's 9 a.m.
[00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:43.912]  to noon Pacific, 10 to 1 Mountain.
[00:33:43.912 --> 00:33:49.653]  Again, thank you so much for joining us and many of our affiliates rebroadcast the show at different times.
[00:33:49.653 --> 00:34:01.135]  XM also carries the show live on channel 166 and we also go out on global shortwave WWCR and number one on the internet streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:12.021 --> 00:34:14.403]  I can get info wars.com stories.
[00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:16.064]  I said Google News.
[00:34:16.064 --> 00:34:17.225]  They write articles.
[00:34:17.225 --> 00:34:19.207]  Oh man, that's a lot of news.
[00:34:19.207 --> 00:34:22.630]  Jones says you can't search his articles on Google.
[00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.991]  Look at this liar!
[00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:29.976]  You know, every time I say Google News, News Feed, we were delisted two years ago.
[00:34:30.676 --> 00:34:32.118]  Now we're being dropped in the ranking.
[00:34:32.118 --> 00:34:33.840]  Same thing on YouTube.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.742]  They're admittingly doing it.
[00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:41.509]  Google admits they've had the government come out and send them requests to take down stuff, quote, critical of government.
[00:34:41.509 --> 00:34:43.471]  There's more news today on it.
[00:34:43.471 --> 00:34:48.036]  I told you Google had back doors to break your anti-spying software.
[00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:54.953]  Now, Microsoft and Apple have exposed it and Google's been caught.
[00:34:54.953 --> 00:34:57.634]  Of course, Microsoft does it themselves.
[00:34:57.634 --> 00:35:00.135]  They're just in competition with the NSA.
[00:35:00.135 --> 00:35:02.296]  Google is the NSA.
[00:35:02.296 --> 00:35:05.657]  Side issue, I'm digressing.
[00:35:05.657 --> 00:35:12.379]  Let me get into Ron Paul and just give you the short and skinny of it, okay?
[00:35:12.379 --> 00:35:18.841]  A month ago, I saw a quote by Jesse Benton in the news.
[00:35:21.548 --> 00:35:44.158]  And in that quote, in that article, he was talking about the fact that everyone should be considering Ron Paul as a VP because he's the smartest guy in the room.
[00:35:44.158 --> 00:35:45.978]  And that's an article again at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:53.035]  Of course, they had a movie called Smartest Guy in the Room, or Smartest Guys in the Room.
[00:35:53.035 --> 00:35:55.757]  It was about Enron.
[00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:59.939]  But, I mean, Ron Paul is one of the smartest guys in the room.
[00:35:59.939 --> 00:36:11.785]  And I saw his quote in several newspapers, and I didn't really say anything about it, because I wanted to let this ride out a little bit and see what was happening.
[00:36:11.785 --> 00:36:13.306]  This is his campaign chairman.
[00:36:13.306 --> 00:36:14.347]  This is the head of his campaign.
[00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:22.754]  Ron Paul campaign chairman Jesse Benton has also promoted Rand Paul as a suitable VP.
[00:36:22.754 --> 00:36:26.076]  Any Republican, this is a quote, should be looking at Rand Paul
[00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:29.015]  As a potential running mate.
[00:36:29.015 --> 00:36:30.836]  He's talking about Rand Paul, the Senator.
[00:36:30.836 --> 00:36:33.276]  Because he's the smartest guy in the room.
[00:36:33.276 --> 00:36:36.437]  And he has tremendous credibility with conservatives.
[00:36:36.437 --> 00:36:39.098]  Any Republican should have Rand Paul on the short list.
[00:36:39.098 --> 00:36:41.358]  And of course I go back and forth between Rand Paul and Ron Paul.
[00:36:41.358 --> 00:36:46.640]  Because the Washington Post, our article, all of them have the different quotes about Rand Paul, Ron Paul.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.580]  It's all up there being discussed.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:55.302]  And the Washington Post today is saying, you know, the word is that it is being discussed
[00:36:56.556 --> 00:36:59.458]  To have.
[00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:00.518]  Yeah, I'm good.
[00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:00.899]  I'm good.
[00:37:00.899 --> 00:37:01.699]  Thanks guys.
[00:37:01.699 --> 00:37:02.700]  Appreciate it.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:13.506]  I'm good.
[00:37:13.506 --> 00:37:18.829]  Let me just let me just try to start over here for just a minute.
[00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:22.792]  Takes some getting used to doing this on the road with your whole family and wherever you're at with you.
[00:37:26.533 --> 00:37:30.354]  Let me just start over, okay?
[00:37:30.354 --> 00:37:31.934]  And then I'm gonna give the phone number.
[00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:33.415]  I'll give you the phone number right now.
[00:37:33.415 --> 00:37:33.635]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:33.695]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:33.695 --> 00:37:36.715]  And we will get you up and on the air on this subject of Ron Paul.
[00:37:36.715 --> 00:37:40.296]  Should he, if he doesn't win the nomination for all the GOP fraud, should he?
[00:37:57.159 --> 00:38:01.261]  Run if he was offered it in a VP slot to Mitt Romney.
[00:38:01.261 --> 00:38:07.643]  And I'm going to give you my view, my research view, my well thought out view on that in a moment from different angles.
[00:38:07.643 --> 00:38:17.567]  But the point is, is that Rand Paul has come out and I've got his quotes in Watson's article and said he would be honored to be considered in a VP slot.
[00:38:19.284 --> 00:38:20.966]  He said that, when asked.
[00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:23.949]  And we have where he said it and links to it in our article.
[00:38:23.949 --> 00:38:31.797]  I think Rand Paul's a credible guy of integrity who I respect and like, and who's done a good job as a senator and done what he said he would do.
[00:38:31.797 --> 00:38:34.660]  His father is above reproach and I totally trust him.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:41.728]  But as Justin Raimondo wrote at anti-war a month ago or three weeks ago, Ron Paul will not sell out.
[00:38:43.274 --> 00:38:44.315]  But others can.
[00:38:44.315 --> 00:38:45.535]  Others around him can.
[00:38:45.535 --> 00:38:46.796]  In fact, I forget that exact headline.
[00:38:46.796 --> 00:38:48.197]  Were you guys ever able to pull that up for me?
[00:38:48.197 --> 00:38:52.780]  About 45 minutes ago when I was... I mean, I guess I could look it up here.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.102]  Here, I'll just do that right now.
[00:38:56.102 --> 00:39:08.829]  I'll just do that right now because I want to be able to give folks the headline.
[00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:09.990]  Go to music or whatever you need to.
[00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.752]  Because I need to be able to have this article before I continue.
[00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:55.522]  And I'll keep this world from dragging me down, gonna...
[00:40:04.486 --> 00:40:11.369]  Okay, uh, continuing here, uh, to break this down, the toll-free number to join us on this subject and this question is 800-259-9231.
[00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:11.469]  800-259-9231.
[00:40:11.469 --> 00:40:11.970]  On this one subject.
[00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.190]  I don't screen your calls.
[00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.572]  Uh, and then about once a week I say I want to talk about this topic and no one will ever...
[00:40:26.175 --> 00:40:29.638]  Maybe 1 out of 10 callers will even address anything I'm talking about.
[00:40:29.638 --> 00:40:32.881]  So if I do go to you and it's not on the subject, I'm going to hang up on you.
[00:40:32.881 --> 00:40:37.124]  Because we need to be able to occasionally have a focused discussion on something.
[00:40:37.124 --> 00:40:41.087]  Continuing here, it was behind the headlines, can Ron Paul be tamed?
[00:40:41.087 --> 00:40:48.533]  And my brain morphed that headline of, Ron Paul won't sell out, but his campaign could.
[00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:51.095]  And that's what Raimondo says.
[00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:53.658]  He says, no, but his campaign can't.
[00:40:54.502 --> 00:40:55.403]  That's the article.
[00:40:55.403 --> 00:40:56.844]  Can Ron Paul be tamed?
[00:40:56.844 --> 00:40:58.405]  No, but his campaign can.
[00:40:58.405 --> 00:41:00.006]  And that was less than, uh, three weeks ago.
[00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:01.347]  That was, uh, about three weeks ago.
[00:41:01.347 --> 00:41:04.629]  That was, that was February 3rd.
[00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:05.950]  That was, uh, February 3rd.
[00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:18.799]  He asked that and he's got all the quotes and the, uh, rest of it there in the article where they've got all these Republican insiders and people, uh, saying that,
[00:41:22.097 --> 00:41:27.725]  They think Ron Paul may be SVVP or Rand Paul.
[00:41:27.725 --> 00:41:39.320]  And then we have a top analyst who's rarely been wrong on Fox News betting and saying he believes and saying he thinks Ron Paul will be on the ticket.
[00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:49.133]  There'll be a broker convention and that the Paulians will force him onto it.
[00:41:49.133 --> 00:41:54.296]  And that's what used to happen until the political insiders took over the system.
[00:41:54.296 --> 00:42:04.081]  Generally, whoever was the second most powerful candidate was forced on as VP.
[00:42:04.081 --> 00:42:08.764]  Because yeah, whoever gets picked to be second to the president might as well be who had the second most votes.
[00:42:10.902 --> 00:42:17.426]  And the last 30 years ago, or in the last 30 years or so, that's basically been phased out.
[00:42:17.426 --> 00:42:20.047]  But thanks for pausing that for me guys here on air.
[00:42:20.047 --> 00:42:24.469]  We're live, but to play 30 seconds of news while we found that is a pause.
[00:42:24.469 --> 00:42:32.454]  So I can pause and find that specific article for you so that we can guarantee give you the right info.
[00:42:33.614 --> 00:42:40.659]  And again, my problem getting into this subject is I'm always so decisive on info because I've thought it out so well.
[00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:45.382]  But on something this complex, I can basically put myself inside the campaign.
[00:42:45.382 --> 00:42:46.803]  And I'm not judging them.
[00:42:46.803 --> 00:42:49.185]  I'm not saying they're bad.
[00:42:49.185 --> 00:42:52.927]  Because A, we don't even know what the truth is completely.
[00:42:52.927 --> 00:42:56.029]  We don't know where all of this is going.
[00:42:56.029 --> 00:42:59.792]  We don't know what Ron Paul is thinking.
[00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:02.094]  I will assure you next time I get him on the show,
[00:43:02.834 --> 00:43:03.074]  I'm good.
[00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:21.258]  I don't get butthurt as they say over that.
[00:43:21.258 --> 00:43:22.318]  It doesn't seem that big of a deal.
[00:43:22.318 --> 00:43:26.101]  I've interviewed Ron Paul probably a hundred times.
[00:43:26.101 --> 00:43:28.103]  It's just, you know, you also run into that.
[00:43:28.103 --> 00:43:31.685]  And I understand people on the campaign and the congressional staff's view.
[00:43:31.685 --> 00:43:35.928]  You know, he can go on any show he wants and they know they have this audience.
[00:43:35.928 --> 00:43:37.629]  Of course, it's growing all the time.
[00:43:37.629 --> 00:43:41.372]  And they know Ron Paul can say things that are dangerous on this show because I'll ask real questions.
[00:43:41.372 --> 00:43:43.253]  He's a real person.
[00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:44.774]  And so they want to try to control things.
[00:43:47.316 --> 00:43:49.720]  That's a side issue as well.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.469]  It's just that, I mean, here's an example to describe to you of what's inside the Ron Paul campaign.
[00:43:54.469 --> 00:43:57.694]  I've had family go to the Capitol.
[00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:05.682]  And one group of family goes in and says, hi, you know, we're cousins of Alex Jones and we're big fans of Ron Paul.
[00:44:05.682 --> 00:44:06.982]  And I've had him say, oh, wonderful.
[00:44:06.982 --> 00:44:08.083]  Yeah, we love him too.
[00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:09.183]  And boy, I like his show.
[00:44:09.183 --> 00:44:15.966]  Depends on who they end up talking to it at the congressional office or different campaign headquarters to people saying, we don't like Alex Jones.
[00:44:15.966 --> 00:44:17.046]  He's really bad.
[00:44:17.046 --> 00:44:18.227]  He makes Ron Paul look bad.
[00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:23.382]  And of course, I've heard that for years, and it's happened to friends, family, others.
[00:44:23.382 --> 00:44:26.984]  You just, basically, it's like Russian roulette, what response you get.
[00:44:26.984 --> 00:44:31.708]  Because he's got staffers, he's got internists, he's got whatever.
[00:44:31.708 --> 00:44:36.912]  You're just getting a pool of kind of Republican libertarian types, and some of them,
[00:44:37.612 --> 00:44:46.474]  You know, that work in there, verge off into just kind of mainstream patty cake world, who are just kind of into the whole rock star thing of Ron Paul.
[00:44:46.474 --> 00:44:49.494]  And they think, hey, if he just said nuke Iran, he'd get elected.
[00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:52.015]  The neocons would be for him in a minute.
[00:44:52.015 --> 00:44:53.315]  But that's not what this is all about.
[00:44:53.315 --> 00:44:56.335]  Ron Paul is successful.
[00:44:56.335 --> 00:44:58.356]  Ron Paul is admired.
[00:44:58.356 --> 00:45:05.117]  Ron Paul is loved because he's real, because he doesn't compromise, because
[00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.512]  He's a good person.
[00:45:09.512 --> 00:45:11.273]  And because he stands for what he believes in.
[00:45:11.273 --> 00:45:18.277]  And even if you're more of a big government type, those people, a lot of them still respect him because they know he is a man of integrity.
[00:45:18.277 --> 00:45:19.338]  And so is Rand.
[00:45:19.338 --> 00:45:20.759]  And so is most of his crew.
[00:45:20.759 --> 00:45:22.140]  And it's high-level people.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.322]  The head of his congressional office is an amazing guy.
[00:45:26.098 --> 00:45:26.739]  I don't know.
[00:45:50.575 --> 00:45:58.926]  So Ron Paul is surrounded around by a bunch of people, the good, the bad, and the ugly, mainly the good, who are all giving him his two cents worth.
[00:45:58.926 --> 00:46:07.616]  And you've got Rand quoted in our article, with links to where he said it, saying that he would be incredibly honored to be asked to be on any Republican VP ticket.
[00:46:08.547 --> 00:46:16.435]  When asked by reporters, Rand Paul said, a Tea Party favorite, that his response would be if Romney approached him about the offer of VP.
[00:46:16.435 --> 00:46:18.617]  He hardly poured cold water on the idea.
[00:46:18.617 --> 00:46:25.003]  I don't know if I can answer that question, but I can say it would be an honor to be considered, said Senator Paul.
[00:46:25.003 --> 00:46:28.147]  Just a classy, gentlemanly thing to say, but showing, yeah, I'm interested in that.
[00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:34.620]  And then you've got similar comments by Jesse Benton about Rand Paul in here.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:41.382]  The new debate is, is there a secret alliance between the Ron Paul and Mitt Romney campaign?
[00:46:41.382 --> 00:46:44.662]  And Raimondo's article goes through a lot of evidence to that.
[00:46:44.662 --> 00:46:49.863]  And by alliance, this happens a lot where they'll team up and attack one person and attack each other later.
[00:46:49.863 --> 00:46:51.524]  So that, this is why it's so complex.
[00:46:52.504 --> 00:46:57.745]  Is that just good strategy from Ron Paul to be shooting down Santorum and then Romney later?
[00:46:57.745 --> 00:47:01.366]  And that's what he's always done is targeted.
[00:47:01.366 --> 00:47:03.546]  That doesn't mean he's for Mitt Romney.
[00:47:03.546 --> 00:47:05.447]  So people could be misinterpreting that.
[00:47:05.447 --> 00:47:07.987]  Raimondo could be misinterpreting that.
[00:47:07.987 --> 00:47:10.488]  His final summation is he doesn't think he is.
[00:47:10.488 --> 00:47:11.068]  Maybe he's right.
[00:47:11.068 --> 00:47:12.168]  He's a smart guy.
[00:47:12.168 --> 00:47:14.509]  It's up to you to make that decision.
[00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:16.009]  Then we get into the whole other debate.
[00:47:16.009 --> 00:47:18.409]  That's why this is so complex.
[00:47:18.409 --> 00:47:21.210]  Is it good instead of just
[00:47:22.347 --> 00:47:34.296]  Losing and being cheated or whatever to take a VP run from Mitt Romney and bring all those voters in, defeat Barack Obama and now have Ron Paul with a bully pulpit.
[00:47:36.172 --> 00:47:37.893]  To be able to at least inject some sanity.
[00:47:37.893 --> 00:47:39.755]  Well, three things come into play.
[00:47:39.755 --> 00:47:48.341]  I don't think Mitt Romney's going to do that, even though this is what the evidence shows being discussed behind the scenes and being offered to Ron Paul if he plays ball and doesn't run third party.
[00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:50.103]  I think they'll betray Ron Paul.
[00:47:50.103 --> 00:47:52.585]  Let me just say, I think this is all a bad idea.
[00:47:52.585 --> 00:47:53.626]  My gut tells me that.
[00:47:54.266 --> 00:47:57.008]  But I know why the Paul campaign is looking at all options.
[00:47:57.008 --> 00:47:58.249]  And they clearly are.
[00:47:58.249 --> 00:48:00.871]  Does that mean Ron Paul is going to go with the bad idea?
[00:48:00.871 --> 00:48:01.531]  No.
[00:48:01.531 --> 00:48:07.936]  But it means some of the people below him who are younger and don't have his wisdom are certainly chomping at the bit at this.
[00:48:07.936 --> 00:48:09.116]  Because they get to go on.
[00:48:09.116 --> 00:48:11.638]  They get to be in the Vice President's office.
[00:48:11.638 --> 00:48:12.419]  If you're Jesse Benton.
[00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:13.939]  I think?
[00:48:35.294 --> 00:48:36.575]  And maybe that is a step up.
[00:48:36.575 --> 00:48:38.635]  Maybe Benton's right.
[00:48:38.635 --> 00:48:40.576]  I'm just stating all angles here.
[00:48:40.576 --> 00:48:43.237]  Because I can tell you that's what's going on in their brains.
[00:48:43.237 --> 00:48:45.318]  This isn't, oh my gosh, Ron Paul's bad.
[00:48:45.318 --> 00:48:47.239]  Some people are discussing him running as VP.
[00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:50.380]  When he hasn't done that, it's some of his people have.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.842]  When asked, over and over again, was it out of turn?
[00:48:53.842 --> 00:48:54.662]  Is it wrong?
[00:48:54.662 --> 00:48:55.322]  We don't know.
[00:48:55.322 --> 00:48:57.903]  We'll ask Ron Paul next time he's on with us.
[00:48:57.903 --> 00:48:58.584]  You better believe it.
[00:49:02.667 --> 00:49:06.711]  And by the way, if this keeps developing and I don't get an answer, I'll just go to a rally or go to a campaign event.
[00:49:06.711 --> 00:49:08.613]  I'll just go there with my microphone.
[00:49:08.613 --> 00:49:09.233]  It's pretty easy.
[00:49:09.233 --> 00:49:13.717]  Or I'll just send my fleets out of InfoWarriors.
[00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:22.224]  So, I've been watching this for a month, sitting back, reserving judgment, just because it was a quagmire that hadn't been officially entered yet.
[00:49:22.224 --> 00:49:23.866]  But now, it's one of the big national stories.
[00:49:25.385 --> 00:49:26.926]  It's in hundreds of papers today.
[00:49:26.926 --> 00:49:28.906]  And so we're here debating, we're discussing it.
[00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:31.607]  So, I don't think Mitt Romney would actually have him.
[00:49:31.607 --> 00:49:34.288]  Then the question is, if he would, would that be a co-opting?
[00:49:34.288 --> 00:49:40.530]  Because as the economy implodes, we want to be as far away from this power structure so we don't get blamed for it.
[00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.831]  I mean, he wouldn't be able to really change much in there with Romney.
[00:49:43.835 --> 00:49:47.036]  Because Romney's a globalist bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs money.
[00:49:47.036 --> 00:49:53.358]  So, I think this is a double-cross, and I think it's Romney people trying to play the Paul campaign.
[00:49:53.358 --> 00:49:54.639]  I don't think they're playing Benton.
[00:49:54.639 --> 00:49:57.020]  I don't think he's a good guy overall.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.440]  I don't think they're playing Paul.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.741]  I don't think they're playing Rand.
[00:49:59.741 --> 00:50:08.724]  I think Rand and all them are playing nice, because they know in Washington, if you make it personal, then they'll come after you ten times harder.
[00:50:08.724 --> 00:50:10.065]  It's kind of like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:50:10.065 --> 00:50:11.025]  So I have trust in Paul.
[00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:18.202]  I just know this is going to be used as a wedge now to try to take the sheen off Paul, that he's this maverick who never compromises.
[00:50:18.202 --> 00:50:22.523]  That's like when a Bilderberg guy created a super PAC for Ron Paul.
[00:50:22.523 --> 00:50:26.784]  Obviously, you know, as a way to make him look bad as a big sick joke.
[00:50:26.784 --> 00:50:27.984]  At one level.
[00:50:27.984 --> 00:50:35.966]  And at another level, they want a laissez-faire libertarian thing after they've collapsed stuff, so they can then say, hey, we've stolen trillions, but now we're exempt.
[00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:40.607]  I mean, you could have, you know, Louis Farrakhan, you could have
[00:50:43.635 --> 00:50:46.198]  George Clooney, you could have good, bad, whatever.
[00:50:46.198 --> 00:50:47.039]  Create a super PAC.
[00:50:47.039 --> 00:50:47.960]  I could create a super PAC.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.701]  You could create a super PAC.
[00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:51.463]  Gary Franchi, 9-11 truther did.
[00:50:51.463 --> 00:50:52.724]  Does that mean that's Ron Paul?
[00:50:52.724 --> 00:50:52.845]  No.
[00:50:54.648 --> 00:50:59.172]  So there's a lot of different tricks they're running here, a lot of different things.
[00:50:59.172 --> 00:51:00.533]  We'll discuss this more when we come back.
[00:51:00.533 --> 00:51:01.034]  Go to your calls.
[00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:23.794]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.794 --> 00:51:26.115]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[00:52:01.459 --> 00:52:08.804]  2012 is finally here, and while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the IRS is hard at work collecting.
[00:52:08.804 --> 00:52:10.845]  In fact, they're even sending agents

[00:54:13.955 --> 00:54:16.116]  I know you're thinking a lot of similar things.
[00:54:16.116 --> 00:54:21.958]  You probably have your own points you're going to make and we'll take 30 minutes of calls when we start the next hour on this subject at 800-259-9231.
[00:54:27.896 --> 00:54:42.429]  But I know that Ron Paul has come on this show over the years, even though the media has demonized him for it, even though I know some of his crew have said, you know, don't do it, play it safe, because he isn't a compromiser.
[00:54:42.429 --> 00:54:48.995]  And he appreciates people that love liberty and people that have supported him for 16 plus years.
[00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:50.236]  The issue is, though,
[00:54:53.935 --> 00:55:04.601]  If they start going more mainstream, if his minions start trying to get him to go more mainstream, you have to understand, I don't think Ron Paul will do that.
[00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:17.248]  And again, I don't think at the end of the day it is bad for Ron Paul to entertain, at least on the surface,
[00:55:20.307 --> 00:55:22.968]  Parlays for him to be VP.
[00:55:22.968 --> 00:55:24.269]  I think that should be a debate.
[00:55:24.269 --> 00:55:27.031]  And I think it shows how prominent the Liberty Movement's become.
[00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:29.892]  And it shows that he really is the guy that's winning all these states.
[00:55:29.892 --> 00:55:31.413]  They're having to steal it from him.
[00:55:31.413 --> 00:55:45.900]  And they know that if he runs third party, that's the only way they would give him a VP, is they understand that if he runs third party, it will create a wild card, and that even with election fraud, he's gonna be there for another six months.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.162]  After these primaries and all this is over, in the middle,
[00:55:49.466 --> 00:55:53.528]  of the campaign covering real issues and in national debates.
[00:55:53.528 --> 00:55:54.808]  They won't be able to shut him out.
[00:55:54.808 --> 00:55:58.270]  They are horrified of that.
[00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:03.772]  And you can kind of lock him up like Uncle Fester, like they've done Joe Biden, if they did make him a VP.
[00:56:03.772 --> 00:56:13.736]  But my gut says it's the Romney and big Republican machine, which they admit has tried to co-opt Rand and others and failed, and they're trying to co-op Ron Paul.
[00:56:13.736 --> 00:56:17.577]  And I guarantee you, they've been told, sell out on some issues, we'll make you VP.
[00:56:17.577 --> 00:56:18.918]  And I'll guarantee you Ron Paul said no.
[00:56:19.478 --> 00:56:20.399]  I don't even need to ask him.
[00:56:20.399 --> 00:56:22.060]  I'll ask him when we get him back on air.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.001]  I'm just chomping at the bit to do it.
[00:56:24.001 --> 00:56:25.101]  I'm not that chomping.
[00:56:25.101 --> 00:56:26.442]  I haven't called anybody yet.
[00:56:26.442 --> 00:56:27.863]  I've just sent an email every other day.
[00:56:27.863 --> 00:56:34.147]  But I'm going to make some phone calls today because I want to get a response on all this.
[00:56:34.147 --> 00:56:37.649]  My gosh, I got Rand Paul's home number, Ron Paul's home number.
[00:56:37.649 --> 00:56:39.490]  I never even call these.
[00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:41.891]  I've got most of his family's phone numbers.
[00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:42.972]  I've got the congressional
[00:56:44.605 --> 00:56:49.347]  His congressional head's phone number, who I know sends me emails and listens to the show.
[00:56:49.347 --> 00:56:51.348]  So I just gotta call Jeff up.
[00:56:51.348 --> 00:56:53.129]  That's the answer.
[00:56:53.129 --> 00:56:55.691]  No rest for those seeking liberty and freedom, I tell you.
[00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:57.331]  It just gives me a headache.
[00:56:57.331 --> 00:57:00.153]  And again, I'm not even enamored with the whole presidential system.
[00:57:00.153 --> 00:57:11.398]  I'm not... I'm one of those people that's had success, gained some notoriety, met a lot of Hollywood people, and I've learned it's just... I was a little starstruck a decade ago when I was first put in a few movies and stuff.
[00:57:11.398 --> 00:57:14.020]  People approached me and put me in some films, Rick Linklater and others.
[00:57:15.066 --> 00:57:20.053]  You know, being in a film, you know, shooting scenes with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson, you know.
[00:57:20.053 --> 00:57:25.020]  But I mean, knowing Charlie Sheen, knowing people even bigger than Charlie Sheen.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.743]  But I mean, now it's just all I want is freedom.
[00:57:27.743 --> 00:57:30.467]  I just want to be able to fly and not have somebody grab my genitals.
[00:57:31.428 --> 00:57:48.583]  I mean, really, for all of you that have Madison Avenue controlling you and thinking, oh, you never reached success because you don't know anybody famous, or people even get invited to low-level dinners with Congress, people that are traitors, but they're so starstruck they'll sell out just to be at an event with what's powerful.
[00:57:48.583 --> 00:57:52.066]  What's powerful is having healthy, happy children.
[00:57:52.066 --> 00:57:53.468]  What's powerful is loving God.
[00:57:54.228 --> 00:58:01.970]  Quite frankly, if I never meet another Hollywood person, if I never meet another famous person, quite frankly, if I never talk to another congressman again, I could care less.
[00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:10.252]  I would love to just live on a ranch and oil paint all day and raise crops and cattle and have a couple donkeys and horses.
[00:58:10.252 --> 00:58:15.074]  And, you know, quite frankly, drive down the road and shoot road signs with shotguns.
[00:58:15.074 --> 00:58:16.094]  Just joking.
[00:58:16.094 --> 00:58:18.695]  Not really, but, well.
[00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.075]  I mean, again,
[00:58:21.604 --> 00:58:33.770]  But I can see how a lot of folks in his campaign, because I'm putting myself in their mindset, I can see how a lot of them, it's just the idea of, we'll join the power, and we'll change things from within, and Ron Paul, come on, you can do it, you can do what's needed.
[00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:43.455]  I mean, that's the debates that are happening, because they haven't gotten real power yet, they haven't experienced it.
[00:58:43.455 --> 00:58:47.417]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.283 --> 00:58:57.926]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:57.926 --> 00:59:03.068]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:03.068 --> 00:59:18.195]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:59:20.288 --> 00:59:24.892]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:59:24.892 --> 00:59:28.715]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:59:28.715 --> 00:59:29.956]  Others don't.
[00:59:29.956 --> 00:59:32.098]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:32.098 --> 00:59:33.899]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:33.899 --> 00:59:36.781]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:43.407]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:43.407 --> 00:59:46.109]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:48.471]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:48.971]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.105]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.105 --> 00:59:58.870]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:10.313]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.313 --> 01:00:11.894]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.454]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.454 --> 01:00:17.635]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.635 --> 01:00:21.696]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:36.120]  Alright, for the next 30 minutes we're taking your phone calls one after the other with what you think about the establishment media saying, hey, there's discussion of Ron Paul running as VP under Romney.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.304]  Yeah, they're gonna steal the election and defraud him, but they're gonna let him run VP.
[01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:43.967]  I think it's all a co-opting by Romney, that's what my gut is.
[01:00:43.967 --> 01:00:48.592]  The question is, is it bad for people in his campaign to even be discussing it?
[01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:49.313]  And I don't think so.
[01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:54.016]  Hi, thank you for taking my call and it's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:58.059]  A new subscriber in January for my birthday and your site has a wealth of information.
[01:00:58.059 --> 01:00:59.800]  Everybody should take advantage of that.
[01:01:20.501 --> 01:01:23.902]  I think a bigger question is who is Ron Paul's running mate going to be?
[01:01:23.902 --> 01:01:30.924]  I suggest Judge Napolitano, but definitely he can consider the idea of being Vice President.
[01:01:30.924 --> 01:01:38.707]  It is an honor, but it would be a disgrace to what Ron Paul stands for and has stood for for many years.
[01:01:38.707 --> 01:01:44.749]  I think he should stay on the outside with us if anybody but him makes it into the presidency.
[01:01:44.749 --> 01:01:47.550]  That's what I'm thinking.
[01:01:49.384 --> 01:01:54.947]  You know, my gut is don't do it because, I mean, it'd be one thing if Mitt Romney wasn't a complete globalist.
[01:01:54.947 --> 01:01:58.908]  I mean, if it was somebody like Ronald Reagan who had some good traits, it'd be alright.
[01:01:58.908 --> 01:02:08.913]  But, I mean, Mitt Romney has been for abortion, open borders, now he's changed, but carbon taxes, gun control, I mean, he's Obama from the Republican Party.
[01:02:09.784 --> 01:02:14.209]  And again, these are people stealing the election from him right now.
[01:02:14.209 --> 01:02:17.993]  I think it's all smoke and mirrors and they're trying to manipulate folks in his campaign.
[01:02:17.993 --> 01:02:20.877]  And I'm not saying that manipulation has happened.
[01:02:20.877 --> 01:02:25.122]  But I mean, I've seen things about, yeah, people ought to consider, all the candidates ought to consider Rand.
[01:02:26.803 --> 01:02:29.885]  Well, you can't have Ron Paul with his son as his VP.
[01:02:29.885 --> 01:02:31.646]  And you can't have two people from the same state.
[01:02:31.646 --> 01:02:34.127]  I mean, I know he lives in Kentucky.
[01:02:34.127 --> 01:02:36.108]  But it's a serious issue and I appreciate your call.
[01:02:36.108 --> 01:02:37.529]  Good point, Sarah.
[01:02:37.529 --> 01:02:41.310]  I'll say this, by the way, people get confused when they hear folks calling and say, I'm a subscriber.
[01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:46.793]  That's PrisonPlanet.tv for the nightly news, the video, the daily radio show, all my films and more.
[01:02:46.793 --> 01:02:50.095]  Of course, InfoWars.com is free and the audio streams are free as well.
[01:02:50.095 --> 01:02:50.975]  But thank you, Sarah.
[01:02:50.975 --> 01:02:52.356]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:02:52.356 --> 01:02:53.897]  Justin in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:54.177]  Welcome!
[01:02:55.694 --> 01:02:57.696]  Hey, thanks for taking the call.
[01:02:57.696 --> 01:03:00.940]  I just want to say that I don't think Ron Paul would do this.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.782]  He's a rock solid guy.
[01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:11.473]  But if he does, I will call it selling out and I will withdraw my support and take down every video I've published and every piece of support I've given.
[01:03:14.451 --> 01:03:19.156]  Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen and I'll talk to Paul as soon as we get him back on the air.
[01:03:19.156 --> 01:03:25.163]  This has happened a few times before when he's not on in a month and I've got to actually make phone calls.
[01:03:25.163 --> 01:03:26.604]  I know they're really busy too.
[01:03:26.604 --> 01:03:29.407]  It's just that I'm chomping at the bit because this is the kind of question.
[01:03:29.407 --> 01:03:34.993]  In fact, I was waiting, I think, to talk about it because this has been going on for months now until I could get him on and ask him.
[01:03:36.034 --> 01:03:38.716]  Uh, because I don't just want to sit here and have a big drama.
[01:03:38.716 --> 01:03:45.841]  Uh, it's just that now there's more and more people in his campaign kind of acting like this, this could be discussed.
[01:03:45.841 --> 01:03:47.962]  I'm like, like, this might be something good.
[01:03:47.962 --> 01:03:48.723]  And I agree with you.
[01:03:48.723 --> 01:03:51.845]  This is, this is not something that's good.
[01:03:51.845 --> 01:03:53.846]  I mean, what, be co-opted?
[01:03:53.846 --> 01:03:58.009]  I mean, you're not going to, I mean, you cannot join with evil to make evil good.
[01:03:58.009 --> 01:03:58.669]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:01.431]  Never works.
[01:04:01.431 --> 01:04:01.912]  Never works.
[01:04:01.912 --> 01:04:03.813]  And I'll tell you what, like I said, I put out,
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:11.661]  Hundreds of videos, have thousands of subscribers, and I'll do my best to have them all follow me should this happen.
[01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:14.582]  But I don't think it will.
[01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:15.802]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:04:15.802 --> 01:04:16.983]  I mean, exactly.
[01:04:16.983 --> 01:04:17.843]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:04:17.843 --> 01:04:20.563]  And that's one reason the media is hyping this.
[01:04:20.563 --> 01:04:22.444]  Is they keep saying, when are you going to drop out, Ron Paul?
[01:04:22.444 --> 01:04:23.664]  When are you going to drop out?
[01:04:23.664 --> 01:04:25.164]  You're not really a Republican.
[01:04:25.164 --> 01:04:26.424]  You're going to run third party.
[01:04:26.424 --> 01:04:28.365]  They're trying to make everybody just forget him.
[01:04:29.718 --> 01:04:40.180]  Uh, and, and you know what, you get asked thousands of questions, you're gonna have someone like Benton occasionally say, oh, you know, it'd be an honor if Rand Paul or somebody else got, you know, asked to be VP.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:47.041]  Because, you know, again, in the Beltway, even if you're a Libertarian, and that success, oh, you're being brought into a coalition government.
[01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:49.842]  That's kind of a parliamentary-type thought system.
[01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:50.482]  But, but I agree.
[01:04:50.482 --> 01:04:56.523]  It'll go over like a lead balloon, and Ron Paul's mystique will go down the drain if he ever works with Mitt Romney.
[01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:08.116]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:25.682]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:05:25.962 --> 01:05:32.146]  I've been searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:05:32.146 --> 01:05:40.310]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:41.731]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:46.616]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:05:46.616 --> 01:05:47.898]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:05:47.898 --> 01:05:48.779]  It's incredible.
[01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:57.992]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:05:57.992 --> 01:05:59.834]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:00.515 --> 01:06:05.077]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.077 --> 01:06:05.997]  Number one.
[01:06:05.997 --> 01:06:09.418]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.418 --> 01:06:10.278]  Number two.
[01:06:10.278 --> 01:06:15.160]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:15.900]  It's true.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.782]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.782 --> 01:06:21.602]  Number three.
[01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:25.184]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.184 --> 01:06:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:29.886]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:32.648]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.648 --> 01:06:36.330]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.131]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.131 --> 01:06:41.274]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.274 --> 01:06:46.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:50.482 --> 01:06:52.284]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.284 --> 01:06:54.547]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:03.116]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.116 --> 01:07:08.442]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:09.964]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.964 --> 01:07:18.754]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:27.020]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:35.025]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:35.025 --> 01:07:40.268]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:40.268 --> 01:07:42.429]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:45.151 --> 01:07:50.772]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:50.772 --> 01:07:53.193]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.012 --> 01:08:25.914]  Okay, if you just joined us, it is Thursday, the 23rd day of February, 2012.
[01:08:25.914 --> 01:08:30.955]  I'm on my way to Orlando, Florida.
[01:08:30.955 --> 01:08:39.417]  TSA-free, no out-of-their-jurisdiction, unsworn, quasi-peace officers trying to grope my family.
[01:08:39.417 --> 01:08:43.857]  But I have seen police randomly pulling over vehicles and searching them all the way here.
[01:08:43.857 --> 01:08:46.098]  This country is really turning into a sad joke.
[01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:57.073]  We have the largest prison population and the government ships the drugs in and then idiots that are dumb enough to use them give the government a pretext to treat us all like it's a giant prison.
[01:08:57.073 --> 01:08:58.676]  I don't blame folks that are leaving this country.
[01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:15.894]  It's really, really sad what this nation's turned into, but I'm taking the long trek here from the road to be able to visit a few stations, one in Dallas and now one in Florida, and also speak to two crowds, kind of a beta test of what may become larger trips in the future.
[01:09:15.894 --> 01:09:21.457]  I don't know what it is about when I'm on the road, but I tend to like kind of mumble sometimes.
[01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:29.323]  And I'm just now getting accustomed to being here on the air doing broadcast from the road.
[01:09:30.243 --> 01:09:36.284]  That I tend to be a bit more, not so much lethargic, but relaxed.
[01:09:36.284 --> 01:09:43.566]  Which I guess in a way is a good thing compared to my manic type mindset that I get into when I'm there in the studio.
[01:09:43.566 --> 01:09:47.286]  Here is some of the top stories that we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:09:47.286 --> 01:09:52.967]  Pentagon says US citizens accused of supporting terrorism can be assassinated.
[01:09:52.967 --> 01:09:55.368]  And they're saying that if you even give money to a charity,
[01:09:56.368 --> 01:10:04.133]  I guess like Doctors Without Borders or others that they could connect to supporting a group that the banks running our country call enemies.
[01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:10.077]  That you can be killed, including here in the United States, secretly arrested, secretly tortured, secretly disappeared.
[01:10:10.077 --> 01:10:13.660]  So now they're getting around to announcing they want to use the NDAA against you.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.742]  And they're saying they'll use mercenaries, Israelis or others to do the killing.
[01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:26.475]  And of course a few years ago I saw quotes in the Israeli news where they said, we'll assassinate people anywhere we want in the world anytime, including Americans in America.
[01:10:26.475 --> 01:10:30.121]  So more and more we're kind of getting the Israeli policy here in the United States.
[01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:48.292]  Continuing here, and it's not that I'm an enemy of Israel or hate Israel itself, but I don't like Israeli agents coming in and buying off elements of our government and then setting up a policy saying I have no sovereignty and they'll kill me in my country if they feel like it because they're God.
[01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:52.384]  I kind of like my Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:10:52.384 --> 01:10:55.907]  Imagine if the Ruskies were influencing our government like this.
[01:10:55.907 --> 01:11:05.576]  But instead, the British, the EU people, the UN, Israel, all these big megacorporations, the defense contractors, they just use this country like a latrine or something.
[01:11:06.397 --> 01:11:13.919]  And then my property rights, my constitution, it's all destroyed, my taxes are raised to pay for their empire.
[01:11:13.919 --> 01:11:15.500]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.421]  And the Israelis, in mass, are protesting a demonstration.
[01:11:19.421 --> 01:11:20.762]  You know, having huge demonstrations.
[01:11:20.762 --> 01:11:24.403]  In some cases, over 70% of the republic don't want these wars.
[01:11:24.403 --> 01:11:28.184]  It's just these elements running all of our countries want this, and I've had enough of it.
[01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:30.532]  So Pentagon says U.S.
[01:11:30.532 --> 01:11:38.955]  citizens accused of supporting terrorism can be assassinated, unvaccinated kids banned from Indiana school due to measles outbreak.
[01:11:38.955 --> 01:11:43.877]  Now I thought if you've had the measles shots, you're protected.
[01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:49.171]  But see, now they have panics if one person gets measles and shut down the school.
[01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:54.013]  But when you take the shot and actually get measles from it, as you do about a third of the time, that's a non-issue.
[01:11:54.013 --> 01:11:58.914]  So it's all about a bunch of panic attack, making a big drama queen issue out of stuff.
[01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:01.235]  That article's at InfoWars.com.
[01:12:01.235 --> 01:12:05.636]  Document proves DHS is monitoring social media for government criticism.
[01:12:05.636 --> 01:12:06.376]  Huge news.
[01:12:06.376 --> 01:12:09.397]  Paul Watson, InfoWars.com, PrisonButter.com.
[01:12:09.397 --> 01:12:12.778]  Pelosi blames profiteering for skyrocketing gas prices.
[01:12:12.778 --> 01:12:14.759]  No, it's dollar devaluation and talk of
[01:12:15.279 --> 01:12:16.804]  An Iran strike, that's what's doing it.
[01:12:18.587 --> 01:12:21.928]  Again, has Ron Paul formed a political alliance with Mitt Romney?
[01:12:21.928 --> 01:12:23.389]  Infowars.com story.
[01:12:23.389 --> 01:12:25.730]  We're going to get Red Link for folks.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:31.613]  Ron Paul highlights from the last debate last night.
[01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.953]  Fed's new rules written behind closed doors.
[01:12:33.953 --> 01:12:35.654]  Infowars Nightly News.
[01:12:35.654 --> 01:12:39.476]  Kurt Haskell, new video out, Witness to Government False Flag Part 2.
[01:12:39.476 --> 01:12:44.378]  We sent Rob Due to Michigan, to Detroit to actually interview him, so it's high quality.
[01:12:44.378 --> 01:12:45.498]  It's very powerful.
[01:12:45.498 --> 01:12:46.579]  Now, I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:12:47.677 --> 01:12:57.620]  For those that missed the first hour, The Washington Post, hundreds of publications, it's big news today, are saying that behind the scenes, Mitt Romney is basically reaching out to Paul about a VP run.
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:58.860]  A, I don't believe that.
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:07.723]  If he is doing it, it's to betray Paul because he knows that he's the real winner of this whole situation.
[01:13:09.045 --> 01:13:10.866]  That's what's really going on.
[01:13:10.866 --> 01:13:16.370]  So the very system that's stealing these primaries from Ron Paul on record is not going to make him VP.
[01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:18.271]  A, I think that's going on.
[01:13:18.271 --> 01:13:30.399]  B, I think the Washington Post and others are making a big deal out of this to make it look like Ron Paul is going to compromise and sell out to kill his image of a stalwart independent who doesn't ever compromise.
[01:13:30.399 --> 01:13:33.541]  Ron Paul is not going to compromise and run VP with Mitt Romney.
[01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:35.142]  I can tell you that right now.
[01:13:35.142 --> 01:13:38.665]  Just like I told you a year before he announced this presidential run, he would do it.
[01:13:39.685 --> 01:13:41.506]  Just like I told you Rand Paul would win.
[01:13:41.506 --> 01:13:47.327]  I can look at the situation and tell you what's going to happen.
[01:13:47.327 --> 01:13:48.468]  One more point I need to make.
[01:13:48.468 --> 01:13:57.930]  I don't have the power cord for this central computer that we're on Skype with, and it's going to go out of power here by the next segment if we don't do that.
[01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:02.372]  I can see Richard, our on-the-road engineer, right out there listening to us, and I'm waving at him.
[01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:03.352]  Hey, buddy, how you doing?
[01:14:04.577 --> 01:14:06.118]  Side issue, as I like to say.
[01:14:06.118 --> 01:14:07.119]  Segway there.
[01:14:07.119 --> 01:14:08.500]  Back to your calls.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.842]  That said, though, this is becoming a big issue.
[01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:14.105]  Will Ron Paul do this or will Rand Paul do this?
[01:14:14.105 --> 01:14:20.311]  Jesse Benton has said, you know, Rand Paul's the smartest guy in the room and, you know, anybody would want to have him as their VP.
[01:14:20.311 --> 01:14:22.392]  And Rand has said he'd be honored.
[01:14:22.392 --> 01:14:25.255]  So I think that's just being gentlemanly.
[01:14:26.055 --> 01:14:37.004]  When they say that, but I think it's a bad idea, and I don't think Ron Paul would do it in the final equation, and I don't think Rand would either, because they're not going to have their will to liberty subverted, and they're not going to sell out.
[01:14:37.004 --> 01:14:38.966]  These are men of integrity.
[01:14:38.966 --> 01:14:49.314]  But it is a big issue that we're discussing here today, and let's go back to your phone calls until about 40 after, then we'll get Jeffrey Smith on, because I need to get to these calls.
[01:14:49.314 --> 01:14:51.276]  Nicholas in Illinois, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:55.874]  Alex, I love how your show is so human.
[01:14:55.874 --> 01:14:58.658]  It just shows your actual person.
[01:14:58.658 --> 01:15:07.648]  My personal opinion on the Ron Paul situation is, as you well know, this is not his first Rodale, so I trust his campaign and what he's doing.
[01:15:07.648 --> 01:15:09.931]  And I'm going to have to disagree with the first two callers.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.821]  Um, he's, you know, he's a chess player.
[01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:17.243]  He's, uh, thinking many moves ahead, and that's what you need to do to stay in the game.
[01:15:17.243 --> 01:15:19.184]  Um, he's thinking worst-case scenario.
[01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:22.206]  So worst-case scenario, he does get offered the VP.
[01:15:22.206 --> 01:15:27.249]  Me, personally, I say take it, because it's under the philosophy of a ninja.
[01:15:27.249 --> 01:15:33.332]  You might be outpowered or outnumbered, but you run away and swallow your pride and live to fight another day.
[01:15:33.332 --> 01:15:39.475]  And we need him in politics to be injecting serious issues, as you said, for even if he doesn't get the nomination.
[01:15:40.267 --> 01:15:44.632]  Well listen, if... Look, but I guarantee you that this is what I'm saying.
[01:15:44.632 --> 01:15:53.221]  It's meant to become a political distraction so that people think he might sell out because that's how it's seen by some.
[01:15:53.221 --> 01:15:54.562]  Okay?
[01:15:54.562 --> 01:15:55.243]  And it's also...
[01:15:56.104 --> 01:16:00.387]  You know, meant to imply that these two are working together against Santorum.
[01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:06.851]  And I don't see a system that's going to steal primaries from him ever doing that and giving him that bully pulpit.
[01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:10.953]  So, you know, that's my reason that I say that I think it's a bad idea.
[01:16:12.014 --> 01:16:20.276]  Now, if I saw Ron Paul go for it, and he gave me his reasons for it, and they made sense, then I might entertain the idea.
[01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:23.716]  But my gut tells me, run from this, Ron Paul.
[01:16:23.716 --> 01:16:25.256]  Run from this.
[01:16:25.256 --> 01:16:32.218]  I can understand why some of the people in his campaign might say, ooh, that sounds interesting, because they're young and they want to go work at the White House.
[01:16:32.218 --> 01:16:34.358]  They want to work for the vice president.
[01:16:34.358 --> 01:16:38.999]  But Ron Paul has not fought for almost 40 years, never compromising to do this now.
[01:16:39.739 --> 01:16:42.041]  And so I think it's a non-issue at the end of the day.
[01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:46.225]  But I mean, we flesh it out, we've covered a lot of angles of it, and we're getting your perspectives.
[01:16:46.225 --> 01:16:47.026]  Good points.
[01:16:47.026 --> 01:16:48.027]  Anything else on Nicholas?
[01:16:48.027 --> 01:16:50.229]  Just a little thing.
[01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:55.674]  Mark Dice has a new show on Vocal.com, and I think a lot of truthers need to do their own shows, get the word out there.
[01:16:55.674 --> 01:16:59.738]  It's a good alternative media to use against the people within their own system.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:01.160]  It is.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.141]  Mark is just a wonderful person and does a great job.
[01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:08.843]  Let's go ahead and talk to Hunter in Florida.
[01:17:08.843 --> 01:17:09.563]  You're on the air.
[01:17:09.563 --> 01:17:10.884]  Go ahead.
[01:17:10.884 --> 01:17:12.544]  Hey Alex, I'll see you Sunday.
[01:17:12.544 --> 01:17:14.065]  I look forward to it.
[01:17:14.065 --> 01:17:19.327]  I just want a couple points on Ron Paul that people may not have heard that the media did not publicize.
[01:17:19.327 --> 01:17:22.868]  Only one-third of Republican people actually voted in Florida.
[01:17:22.868 --> 01:17:25.309]  That's number one and I literally just heard an hour and
[01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:43.071]  Uh just over an hour ago that our local ABC affiliate was talking about the debate last night that not one candidate talked about the birth control issue and that was actually incorrect because Ron Paul did address it and he addressed it directly and uh and the third the third point with Ron Paul is uh
[01:17:43.591 --> 01:17:53.757]  I hope he's planning on focusing on, you know, because the establishment, the way they work, of getting his independent in line and running as an independent.
[01:17:53.757 --> 01:18:10.027]  Because I think that we need to make sure that the left-right paradigm does not continue, and these debates of the Democrat-Republicans don't continue, and having him on the front line debating of the left-right paradigm in the end of the game will show a lot of people and awaken a lot more people.
[01:18:13.382 --> 01:18:15.644]  I totally agree with you and I appreciate what you've said here.
[01:18:15.644 --> 01:18:18.507]  I'm going to get Lou Rockwell on tomorrow if we can.
[01:18:18.507 --> 01:18:24.753]  I'm going to fire the bat search line up into the sky and see if we can get him on.
[01:18:24.753 --> 01:18:26.655]  Maybe even today and just go into the fourth hour.
[01:18:26.655 --> 01:18:30.078]  In fact, even try that because this is so important.
[01:18:31.272 --> 01:18:38.275]  We need to get his perspective because he was the former head of the congressional office and of the first congressional run and other issues.
[01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:39.335]  Good friends with Ron Paul.
[01:18:39.335 --> 01:18:41.356]  He can give us the deep inside skinning.
[01:18:41.356 --> 01:18:46.579]  And I'll tell you right now, he's going to say, I don't think Ron Paul is going to do that.
[01:18:46.579 --> 01:18:49.660]  But if he did, it's because he's been guaranteed he can act autonomously.
[01:18:50.937 --> 01:18:59.004]  And if Ron Paul comes out and says, I've been told I can be VP and do and say whatever I want, well then that's a different subject.
[01:18:59.004 --> 01:19:02.647]  And then Ron Paul would say and do what he wanted, but I'll guarantee you Ron Paul's a man of his word.
[01:19:02.647 --> 01:19:05.969]  So they'd come to him and say, well promise you'll do what the president says and we'll make you VP.
[01:19:05.969 --> 01:19:07.150]  He'll say no.
[01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:08.872]  So it's not going to happen.
[01:19:08.872 --> 01:19:15.797]  But because this is a big issue now, and because it will be used against Ron Paul, like the whole Bilderberg thing, a Bilderberg attendee,
[01:19:16.778 --> 01:19:30.145]  Big libertarian guy, a mainline libertarian, the guy that created a bunch of different websites and systems like PayPal, New Money, he created a super PAC and it's supporting Ron Paul.
[01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:31.885]  Everybody's like, it's Bilderberg, they're supporting him!
[01:19:33.749 --> 01:19:36.830]  He doesn't control what people create super PACs and do.
[01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:39.971]  I mean, is that done deliberately to make him look bad?
[01:19:39.971 --> 01:19:40.731]  Probably not.
[01:19:40.731 --> 01:19:44.953]  It's probably done because Bilderberg wants to try to co-op that movement.
[01:19:44.953 --> 01:19:47.373]  It doesn't mean it's going to co-op, Ron Paul.
[01:19:47.373 --> 01:19:49.434]  But that's how they come at you.
[01:19:49.434 --> 01:19:52.035]  I mean, I've had the system come and offer me big jobs to sell out.
[01:19:52.035 --> 01:19:57.277]  I'm like, no, I'm going to be who I am, stay true to my principles, and build my own system.

[01:21:30.131 --> 01:21:31.372]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.372 --> 01:21:35.955]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:35.955 --> 01:21:41.759]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.759 --> 01:21:45.401]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.223]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.223 --> 01:21:53.166]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:16.776]  Now, more than ever, civilians and communities must communicate with family, friends, and neighbors in the event of civil unrest, natural disasters, or other emergencies.

[01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:58.400]  Peace through preparedness.
[01:23:00.546 --> 01:23:06.611]  If you're having any problems with the IRS or a local revenue agency, I understand and I can help.
[01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:08.513]  I'm tax attorney Tony Dennison.
[01:23:08.513 --> 01:23:13.578]  When I was a kid, the IRS came after my mother's house because of mistaken information.
[01:23:13.578 --> 01:23:18.802]  Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to defending people in trouble with the IRS.
[01:23:18.802 --> 01:23:27.390]  I'm a real tax attorney, which means I have two law degrees, a standard law degree known as a JD, and a tax law degree known as a Masters of the Laws in Taxation.
[01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:33.076]  I've been practicing for 10 years and I've helped many of your fellow citizens in tax trouble.
[01:23:33.076 --> 01:23:38.902]  If you're in tax trouble, you don't need to be alone and you don't need to call one of those fake lawyer clearinghouses.
[01:23:38.902 --> 01:23:41.244]  Call me, Tony Denison, at DenisonTaxLaw.
[01:23:41.244 --> 01:23:43.086]  952-886-7141 or on the web at DenisonTaxLaw.com.
[01:23:47.831 --> 01:23:49.792]  It may be the best call you make all year.
[01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:51.152]  Denison Tax Law 952-886-7141.
[01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:53.653]  And again, on the web at DenisonTaxLaw.com.
[01:23:53.653 --> 01:23:55.393]  I just talked to Richard Reeves.
[01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:20.653]  Worked as a delegate more stalwartly for many years fighting for Ron Paul.
[01:24:20.653 --> 01:24:22.955]  And he said, look, they're just trying to damage him.
[01:24:22.955 --> 01:24:24.276]  That's why the media is covering this.
[01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:27.458]  That's why they're getting into it.
[01:24:27.458 --> 01:24:28.960]  And Ron Paul is not going to do that.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.261]  And I agree with him.
[01:24:31.261 --> 01:24:37.646]  It's just they can take statements by his campaign people, you know, about, oh, yes, you know, Rand Paul would be great in there.
[01:24:37.646 --> 01:24:41.149]  Or, you know, little, you know, cutesy stuff with
[01:24:43.058 --> 01:24:45.259]  Romney and they can use that against him.
[01:24:45.259 --> 01:24:55.084]  But again, Ron Paul says this himself, he is only a focal point of liberty, just like I am, just like so many others are, just like you are.
[01:24:55.084 --> 01:24:57.425]  He's just the biggest focal point.
[01:24:57.425 --> 01:25:08.611]  All over the world, they're trying to black him out because people are looking at what he stands for and using it as an example of freedom across the planet.
[01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:08.751]  And
[01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:12.501]  It's a bellwether.
[01:25:12.501 --> 01:25:13.422]  It's a barometer.
[01:25:13.422 --> 01:25:15.963]  It's a gauge.
[01:25:15.963 --> 01:25:21.806]  And the fact that the system would be dangling that in front of Ron Paul only shows the success he's had.
[01:25:21.806 --> 01:25:23.486]  So I have total confidence in Ron Paul.
[01:25:23.486 --> 01:25:27.888]  I have total confidence in Rand Paul.
[01:25:27.888 --> 01:25:35.092]  But we're taking your calls on this subject because it is the type of complex issue I like to cover so we can really think and get at different angles of this.
[01:25:36.378 --> 01:25:40.564]  Jeffrey Smith is going to be joining us, expert on GMO.
[01:25:40.564 --> 01:25:43.088]  We're continuing with your calls right now.
[01:25:43.088 --> 01:25:44.229]  Who's up next here?
[01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:47.614]  Greg in New York?
[01:25:47.614 --> 01:25:48.575]  Greg in New York.
[01:25:48.575 --> 01:25:50.298]  I'm good, welcome.
[01:25:50.967 --> 01:25:51.768]  Thank you.
[01:25:51.768 --> 01:25:57.271]  I was just named Delegate for Ron Paul's 23rd Congressional District here in New York State.
[01:25:57.271 --> 01:26:06.256]  I've worked so hard for this man that I can't believe for a second that Jesse or anyone would really try to talk him into taking the VP.
[01:26:06.256 --> 01:26:09.779]  It just would go against everything that this man has stood up for.
[01:26:09.779 --> 01:26:11.420]  And personally, Alex, I just don't see it.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.722]  I see Ron taking this all the way in upstate New York.
[01:26:15.722 --> 01:26:20.125]  We're right up here and we've got so many followers and they just can't keep
[01:26:20.465 --> 01:26:21.786]  They can't keep us down.
[01:26:21.786 --> 01:26:27.351]  And with Ron going with Mitt, it's oil and water.
[01:26:27.351 --> 01:26:28.692]  It would just never work.
[01:26:28.692 --> 01:26:31.375]  And even with Rand, Rand has too many principles.
[01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:33.156]  He's too much of his own man.
[01:26:33.156 --> 01:26:38.661]  And I can't see him bowing down to the elite as well.
[01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:39.282]  What are your thoughts?
[01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:43.171]  No, I think that's what's happening.
[01:26:43.171 --> 01:26:47.776]  And then I think Rand says, oh, I'd be honored to be considered.
[01:26:47.776 --> 01:26:52.440]  First he said, well, I don't know if I can really speak to this, but I'd be honored to be considered.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:56.363]  It's an honor to be considered, yeah, to be the Vice President of America.
[01:26:56.363 --> 01:26:58.245]  He sees that as, he's very polite.
[01:26:58.245 --> 01:26:59.486]  He's very nice.
[01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:03.770]  During the NDAA, he's like, now, do my colleagues know this subsection says?
[01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:06.011]  It can secretly arrest citizens.
[01:27:06.011 --> 01:27:11.013]  I know you don't want to get rid of habeas corpus and basic liberties.
[01:27:11.013 --> 01:27:14.214]  I know you don't want to overthrow the American system.
[01:27:14.214 --> 01:27:17.015]  And then meanwhile, Lindsey Graham and all of them are like, yes, we do.
[01:27:17.015 --> 01:27:17.675]  We're going to do it.
[01:27:17.675 --> 01:27:19.596]  I mean, literally acting like that.
[01:27:19.596 --> 01:27:21.897]  So I think it's a lot of high road behavior.
[01:27:21.897 --> 01:27:25.539]  And Ron Paul and Randall both been criticized for
[01:27:26.619 --> 01:27:27.619]  They're gentle ways.
[01:27:27.619 --> 01:27:28.820]  I mean, I was watching the other night.
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.461]  We played a clip of it on the Nightly News last week.
[01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:34.562]  We watched like 30 minutes of it to find the clip of him hitting a home run.
[01:27:34.562 --> 01:27:41.865]  I'm trying to find the clip where he knocked it out of the park, but the clip on YouTube didn't have that, that congressional baseball game.
[01:27:41.865 --> 01:27:43.806]  And I was just watching his mannerisms and everything.
[01:27:43.806 --> 01:27:54.450]  And it's just kind of like a non-assuming, you know, almost nerdliness, but just real polite, real friendly, real, you know, the business, you know, get the job done.
[01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:57.372]  And that's just how they are.
[01:27:57.372 --> 01:28:03.596]  So they just don't start really being mean to people until if you say something nasty to them, then they'll come back at you.
[01:28:03.596 --> 01:28:05.057]  They're just gentlemanly.
[01:28:05.057 --> 01:28:07.940]  But I think that attracts more people than it turns folks off.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.841]  And yeah, we'd like to see a little more fire.
[01:28:09.841 --> 01:28:11.142]  We'd like to see a little more attack.
[01:28:11.142 --> 01:28:12.803]  Maybe there should be more of that.
[01:28:12.803 --> 01:28:15.846]  But we're not in the arena at that level.
[01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:17.447]  But I mean, what do you think of what I've said here?
[01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:18.506]  I don't know.
[01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:44.252]  I've met Bill Russell and sports stars.
[01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:49.154]  I used to chef in Arizona, and I've never been starstruck until I met Dr. Paul.
[01:28:49.154 --> 01:28:50.515]  And I'll leave it at that.
[01:28:50.515 --> 01:28:53.436]  Alex, I'm a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[01:28:53.436 --> 01:28:54.416]  You are the man.
[01:28:54.416 --> 01:28:57.297]  Keep up the fight, my friend.
[01:28:57.297 --> 01:28:57.757]  Thank you.
[01:28:57.757 --> 01:28:59.818]  I appreciate you calling into the show.
[01:28:59.818 --> 01:29:02.819]  Do we have time to get another caller before we got a break here?
[01:29:02.819 --> 01:29:03.260]  Probably not.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.160]  We've got about one minute.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:15.368]  I will enter some of the other news briefly when we come back that I haven't gotten to, and then we will go to Jeffrey Smith.
[01:29:15.368 --> 01:29:16.829]  But I know I've got all these callers.
[01:29:16.829 --> 01:29:17.109]  You know what?
[01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:18.450]  I'll tell you what I'll do.
[01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:23.234]  When we come back, Daniel, Barry, John, and Joe, those are the oldest callers.
[01:29:23.234 --> 01:29:24.916]  I'll give each one of you about a minute and a half.
[01:29:25.416 --> 01:29:28.337]  And then we'll get Jeffrey Smith on, okay?
[01:29:28.337 --> 01:29:30.917]  And we'll have him for about an hour and 20 minutes with us or so.
[01:29:30.917 --> 01:29:35.378]  I was going to have him for two hours today, but just this Ron Paul news, all the rest of it.
[01:29:35.378 --> 01:29:37.399]  And it's an important discussion.
[01:29:37.399 --> 01:29:39.699]  I mean, it's about this journey of liberty.
[01:29:39.699 --> 01:29:46.941]  And the fact that Ron Paul is now public property of the movement for liberty worldwide, of 1776, worldwide.
[01:29:46.941 --> 01:29:47.761]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:47.761 --> 01:29:50.321]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.321 --> 01:29:51.722]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.722 --> 01:29:53.222]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.227 --> 01:30:01.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:04.235]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:07.917]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[01:30:07.917 --> 01:30:08.418]  Number 10.
[01:30:08.418 --> 01:30:10.980]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.720]  Number 9.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.561]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:17.484]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:17.785]  7.
[01:30:17.785 --> 01:30:19.746]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[01:30:19.746 --> 01:30:20.807]  6.
[01:30:20.807 --> 01:30:22.988]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[01:30:24.029 --> 01:30:27.210]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:31.191]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[01:30:31.191 --> 01:30:34.572]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[01:30:34.572 --> 01:30:38.893]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[01:30:38.893 --> 01:30:45.095]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[01:30:45.095 --> 01:30:46.055]  Folks, don't wait.

[01:30:47.296 --> 01:30:48.956]  We all need to be self-sufficient.

[01:31:01.894 --> 01:31:03.596]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.596 --> 01:31:08.901]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.901 --> 01:31:10.443]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.443 --> 01:31:19.232]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.953 --> 01:31:27.498]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.498 --> 01:31:35.503]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.503 --> 01:31:40.726]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:31:40.726 --> 01:31:42.887]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:32:00.518 --> 01:32:07.721]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:25.630]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:29.732]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:32:30.012 --> 01:32:31.773]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:32:31.773 --> 01:32:39.939]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:32:39.939 --> 01:32:46.263]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:32:46.263 --> 01:32:47.544]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:32:47.544 --> 01:32:48.404]  It's incredible.
[01:32:48.404 --> 01:32:57.631]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:32:57.631 --> 01:32:59.472]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:33:04.253 --> 01:33:07.254]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:33:07.254 --> 01:33:12.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:12.235 --> 01:33:20.918]  Okay, we've got Jeffrey Smith joining us, author, researcher, investigative journalist.
[01:33:21.838 --> 01:33:28.061]  On GMO and beyond, because a lot of big studies are coming out showing now that it's actually getting into human DNA.
[01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:31.163]  It's not just going through your stomach and causing health problems.
[01:33:31.163 --> 01:33:34.965]  The latest on that, the honeybee collapse, all of it.
[01:33:34.965 --> 01:33:36.586]  And then I'm going to go into the fourth hour today.
[01:33:37.486 --> 01:33:42.370]  Lou Rockwell is going to come on and give us his take for 30 minutes on Ron Paul.
[01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:46.194]  Now, amazing the campaign is, what it signifies for Liberty.
[01:33:46.194 --> 01:33:47.735]  What I believe is clear election fraud.
[01:33:47.735 --> 01:33:49.957]  What they've admitted in two states is fraud.
[01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:53.180]  But it's not getting any coverage, Iowa and Maine.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.862]  So he'll be joining us coming up in about an hour and a half.
[01:33:55.862 --> 01:33:56.643]  A lot of balloting.
[01:33:57.143 --> 01:34:03.225]  In an hour and 27 minutes from now, he'll be joining us as I come to you here from the road.
[01:34:03.225 --> 01:34:04.126]  This is great today.
[01:34:04.126 --> 01:34:07.227]  No hiccups on the road as it normally does.
[01:34:07.227 --> 01:34:14.129]  We had a few hiccups the last few days, but I'm told listeners and stations say that it was just a little bit of hiccups and kind of made it more exciting.
[01:34:14.129 --> 01:34:19.151]  It's kind of like when you're watching the news and you see like a problem or a light go out.
[01:34:19.151 --> 01:34:23.573]  Or that time Hillary was on 60 Minutes, they released the tape and the light falls on her.
[01:34:23.573 --> 01:34:25.834]  It's kind of fun to watch the train wreck when you're not part of it, huh?
[01:34:27.455 --> 01:34:27.896]  I don't think so.
[01:34:37.864 --> 01:34:42.049]  The more money they spend, the more they fall apart because of all the scams and dollar devaluation.
[01:34:42.049 --> 01:34:56.145]  Now we got Jeffrey Smith coming up here in just a moment, but let's jam in these callers on their take on the establishment trying to dangle the idea of Ron Paul taking a VP slot after they steal the election from him, if they're able to do that.
[01:34:56.145 --> 01:34:57.727]  Daniel in Texas, give us your take.
[01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:11.638]  Yeah, Alex, before I get to my Ron Paul question, I just wanted to suggest the name Mockingbird Media for the mainstream media, both as an homage to Operation Mockingbird and also the way that they parrot each other's talking points.
[01:35:11.638 --> 01:35:12.859]  That's a good idea.
[01:35:15.959 --> 01:35:21.362]  I think Mockingbird Media has got a good ring to it, but I know time is limited, let me get to my questions.
[01:35:21.362 --> 01:35:30.808]  For Ron Paul, my concern is that they're going to dangle not the VP slot, but rather a convention speaking slot, and maybe altering the party platform to include an audit of the Fed.
[01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:35.531]  And as we head into the possibility of a brokered convention where Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich combine delegates,
[01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:35.871]  Wow.
[01:35:53.639 --> 01:36:00.303]  But in these two questions, on the topic of Iran and anti-imperialism, Ron Paul has been an absolute leader on opposing this.
[01:36:00.303 --> 01:36:07.348]  What concerns me is that he hasn't directly attacked Mitt Romney, both for his warmongering, his neocon cabinet that he's establishing.
[01:36:07.348 --> 01:36:10.850]  You know, Romney has been the leading warmonger in many of these debates.
[01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:12.071]  It disappoints me.
[01:36:12.071 --> 01:36:13.411]  No, that's the one thing.
[01:36:13.411 --> 01:36:17.154]  I don't think Ron Paul has been attacking Mitt Romney enough.
[01:36:17.154 --> 01:36:18.375]  And I just want to say something right now.
[01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:23.198]  Daniel in Texas should be hosting this show.
[01:36:23.198 --> 01:36:28.541]  In 30 seconds he said what I tried to say in an hour and that was all the points.
[01:36:28.541 --> 01:36:30.563]  I even wrote notes this morning that I wanted to cover.
[01:36:30.563 --> 01:36:40.830]  I didn't get to half of them because instead I got into like background and you know how I know you know these people and know they're real and what can be affecting them and let's get inside their minds.
[01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:42.971]  Yes it's going towards a brokered convention.
[01:36:42.971 --> 01:36:43.652]  That's admitted.
[01:36:44.612 --> 01:36:49.434]  Uh, Romney may need Paul, and so that's why if they do need him, they're trying to be friendly.
[01:36:49.434 --> 01:36:54.715]  And I think some of the people lower down, not Paul, but some of the people that get the work done, have become enamored.
[01:36:54.715 --> 01:36:57.396]  And they've made some enamored statements of Romney.
[01:36:57.396 --> 01:37:08.720]  And I think the fact that they know Ron Paul's retiring, their jobs are going away in a year or less, uh, you know, when he steps down from Congress, uh, that, you know, they kind of want some lifeboats.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.141]  And so Ron Paul doesn't end up selling out.
[01:37:11.781 --> 01:37:17.586]  But some of the people that work for him, I don't want to call it selling out, but compromise to an extent.
[01:37:17.586 --> 01:37:19.948]  And I don't think Ron Paul should let that happen.
[01:37:19.948 --> 01:37:23.852]  He's a very nice person to people that are close to him.
[01:37:23.852 --> 01:37:24.913]  And I understand that.
[01:37:24.913 --> 01:37:26.554]  People that are married to the family and other things.
[01:37:28.456 --> 01:37:28.696]  I think?
[01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:50.052]  You know, nothing where the Fed sets up a blue ribbon committee and says, OK, give us more power.
[01:37:50.052 --> 01:37:51.472]  That's what they did a few years ago.
[01:37:51.472 --> 01:37:55.055]  Not in the financial overhaul.
[01:37:55.055 --> 01:37:57.837]  Not what Paul proposed, but what they ended up having.
[01:37:57.837 --> 01:37:59.037]  And so you're right on that.
[01:37:59.037 --> 01:38:02.139]  You're right on every facet of what you just said.
[01:38:02.139 --> 01:38:11.826]  And so I can see the perspective of some of the people in his campaign saying, well, look, if we're talking about them stealing it from us, which is clearly going on,
[01:38:12.526 --> 01:38:15.987]  You know, let's not be sore losers or then we may not even get anything on the platform.
[01:38:15.987 --> 01:38:23.049]  Well, the Republican platform of Texas reads like Alex Jones wrote it, but they don't follow one stinking piece of it.
[01:38:23.049 --> 01:38:25.009]  That's the same thing nationally.
[01:38:25.009 --> 01:38:27.590]  The platform's got some good stuff in it, nothing like Texas.
[01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:29.410]  They don't follow any of it.
[01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:30.151]  So you're right.
[01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:36.672]  Ron Paul needs to both barrels attack and savage them and use the platform he's got to point out there's no difference.
[01:38:36.672 --> 01:38:38.373]  And he's been doing that to a certain extent.
[01:38:39.093 --> 01:38:45.938]  Yeah, the last point I'd like to make is I think as Ron Paul supporters, it's the job of people now to say, for all the money and time and effort and organization that people have put in,
[01:38:58.101 --> 01:38:58.881]  Don't do this.
[01:38:58.881 --> 01:39:07.404]  Don't end up supporting Mitt Romney because Mitt Romney means more wars, it means an attack of Iran, it means more CIA color revolutions, and frankly it means more austerity.
[01:39:07.404 --> 01:39:17.827]  I think there are many people who are voting for Ron Paul on economics, who are pushing the very same tax cuts for Wall Street, tax cuts for the Fortune 500, and exchange for cuts to social programs in this country.
[01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:25.589]  And they may see Mitt Romney as simpatico on austerity, and I think Ron Paul needs to be aware of this, and his supporters need to say, look, don't do this.
[01:39:27.209 --> 01:39:43.394]  Sure, and let's be clear, when this becomes a national debate, and the Republican insiders openly say they're trying to co-opt Rand and Ron, we're the supporters, we're America, we're the people that took the great man Ron Paul and put him where he is, and he said that.
[01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:50.535]  So it's our job to tell his camp followers, hey listen, we're the boss, not you.
[01:39:50.535 --> 01:39:52.436]  Ron Paul's the boss, not you.
[01:39:52.976 --> 01:39:55.198]  So don't tell him to moderate.
[01:39:55.198 --> 01:39:58.260]  He got where he is by not moderating.
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:01.242]  What did Barry Goldwater, who he admires and who I admire as well, say?
[01:40:01.242 --> 01:40:10.007]  You know, moderation in defense of liberty is not golden, it's basically yellow.
[01:40:10.007 --> 01:40:16.772]  There's a bunch of quotes, but he said extremism in defense of liberty is no vice, and he said silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[01:40:17.452 --> 01:40:20.074]  And so I was conflating a few of his statements.
[01:40:20.074 --> 01:40:24.416]  But, you know, we need the globalists are hardcore out of control.
[01:40:24.416 --> 01:40:26.037]  And then they call us extreme.
[01:40:26.037 --> 01:40:27.558]  No, they're extreme.
[01:40:27.558 --> 01:40:28.379]  Great points.
[01:40:28.379 --> 01:40:29.840]  Absolutely devastating call.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.842]  We do have Jeffrey Smith there with us.
[01:40:33.742 --> 01:40:48.656]  I don't like to get our callers on and not go to them, so I'll tell you, if you want to give your name and number to John Harmon up there at Genesis taking your calls, when Lou Rockwell gets on, in an hour and 20 minutes, we'll just call you back and you'll be the caller for Lou Rockwell, because it'll be on the subject.
[01:40:49.216 --> 01:40:51.217]  Or if you don't want to do that, it's fine.
[01:40:51.217 --> 01:40:54.498]  Whatever, just try to get in when I open the phones up at that point.
[01:40:54.498 --> 01:40:58.900]  Barry, John, Joe, Mark, and then others, obviously, coming in.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:40:59.900]  Just try to get on with Lou Rockwell.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:05.462]  Because I'll take about 15 minutes with him, letting him talk, then I'm going to take a few calls, five or six calls for Lou Rockwell.
[01:41:05.462 --> 01:41:08.423]  Coming up, we're going to go to Jeffrey Smith here.
[01:41:08.423 --> 01:41:10.904]  We carry all of his books, films, they're all amazing.
[01:41:10.904 --> 01:41:13.025]  If you want to know what's really going on,
[01:41:14.325 --> 01:41:18.907]  Uh, with, uh, this whole situation, what's going on with GMO.
[01:41:18.907 --> 01:41:32.172]  Uh, he is the leading speaker and kind of, uh, grand conductor of being able to fuse it all together and give you a gestalt analysis or briefing on what's going on.
[01:41:32.172 --> 01:41:33.933]  His information is impeccable.
[01:41:33.933 --> 01:41:36.894]  If I had to criticize, uh, Jeff Smith in any way, it would be,
[01:41:37.794 --> 01:41:42.818]  He sometimes, to be absolutely 100% correct, holds back a bit.
[01:41:42.818 --> 01:41:44.920]  Because the truth is even worse than what he's saying.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:48.042]  But you can assure what he's saying is accurate and quite frankly worse.
[01:41:48.042 --> 01:41:51.505]  So we're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[01:41:53.895 --> 01:42:05.848]  And we're going to clean the phone lines out now so folks later can call in for him when I give the number on GMO and Colony Collapse Disorder and what's happening to humans and all the other big environmental problems that are real.
[01:42:05.848 --> 01:42:08.571]  Not the let's have a carbon tax that taxes humans for breathing.
[01:42:09.824 --> 01:42:15.668]  Taxes what plants respirate from and then let toxic waste dumping and cross-species genetic engineering run wild.
[01:42:15.668 --> 01:42:17.430]  We'll be talking to him in a moment.
[01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:21.773]  But on those subjects, we have the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:42:21.773 --> 01:42:22.694]  We have Agenda 21, The Green Mask.
[01:42:25.355 --> 01:42:28.838]  And for the UN takeover available at Infowars.com.
[01:42:28.838 --> 01:42:37.904]  We have films exposing government-sponsored terror, of course, like A Noble Lie, The Columbus City Inside Job Operation, incredible film.
[01:42:37.904 --> 01:42:43.908]  We also, and this is only going for another four or five days, until this month ends, and then it's gone.
[01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:45.809]  It's gone until next year.
[01:42:45.809 --> 01:42:46.810]  Okay?
[01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:52.614]  And that is all of my documentary films, all 18 of them, DVDs, and
[01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:58.928]  Jason Bermas' film I produced, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, that is excellent.
[01:42:58.928 --> 01:43:08.171]  Hundreds of clips of world leaders calling for global government and New World Order and how they're going to take over your life and the state will be God and we're going to take all your property and blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:08.171 --> 01:43:09.231]  I mean, it's very well done.
[01:43:09.231 --> 01:43:10.292]  It's the last film I produced.
[01:43:10.292 --> 01:43:13.933]  I've been so busy with doing the news show and setting up all these news systems and everything.
[01:43:13.933 --> 01:43:16.173]  I haven't made an official film.
[01:43:16.173 --> 01:43:17.834]  I mean, we've made a 40-minute documentary.
[01:43:17.834 --> 01:43:20.835]  We premiered in Dallas and we're going to be premiering it.
[01:43:21.935 --> 01:43:23.477]  I've never had a big event that didn't sell out.
[01:43:23.477 --> 01:43:23.837]  Dallas sold out.
[01:43:42.935 --> 01:43:47.398]  By the time I drive out here and fly a crew out to film it and everything, we are basically going to lose money on this.
[01:43:47.398 --> 01:43:52.602]  Because I'm also giving the local radio stations half the money from it just to support them for being affiliates.
[01:43:52.602 --> 01:43:57.365]  So we're losing money on this, and I appreciate people coming out and financing us being able to do this.
[01:43:57.365 --> 01:43:59.206]  That's how much this stuff costs and is.
[01:44:03.226 --> 01:44:10.012]  The point I'm getting at here is that you can get all of my films, Invisible Empire, for over 70% off, $99.95.
[01:44:10.012 --> 01:44:12.674]  That's 19 films for $99.95 on DVD.
[01:44:12.674 --> 01:44:19.500]  They have hard archive copies that they can't just erase like they do, you know, off these different internet systems.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:24.724]  To have them in your archive, to have them on record, a treasure trove of research and great things to hand out to people.
[01:44:24.724 --> 01:44:27.707]  You get 19 InfoWar weapons to give to people.
[01:44:27.707 --> 01:44:29.969]  We're also selling bumper stickers at cost.
[01:44:31.127 --> 01:44:31.708]  At cost.
[01:44:31.708 --> 01:44:37.753]  We've got all these new InfoWars.com, you know, variety of stickers, all these different looks.
[01:44:37.753 --> 01:44:41.817]  And they've got different packs of them, variety packs at cost.
[01:44:41.817 --> 01:44:46.801]  Spray paint stencils for lawfully to spray paint your own car, barn, or your own business.
[01:44:46.801 --> 01:44:48.963]  Don't do it on private property that isn't yours.
[01:44:48.963 --> 01:44:51.145]  That's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:51.145 --> 01:44:52.386]  A lot of activist stuff.
[01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:53.787]  Every order gets a Citizen Rule book.
[01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:57.749]  Again, the website InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:57.749 --> 01:44:58.469]  888-253-3139.
[01:44:58.469 --> 01:45:15.933]  And we also have a 15-day free trial running at PrisonPlanet.tv to see the radio show during the day and also get the highly produced, very well done, amazing nightly news with a team of reporters and anchors, myself included, that we've built.
[01:45:15.933 --> 01:45:17.293]  We're just beating our brains out.
[01:45:17.293 --> 01:45:20.374]  It's really paying off in the InfoWars, thanks to you supporting us.
[01:45:20.374 --> 01:45:23.295]  We're reaching so many people and that's our main goal.
[01:45:23.295 --> 01:45:24.155]  And we're financing it.
[01:45:24.475 --> 01:45:26.678]  I apologize for getting him on 15 minutes late here today.
[01:45:26.678 --> 01:45:29.982]  We wanted to do a two-hour interview and we cut it to an hour and a half and then I got behind.
[01:45:39.964 --> 01:45:40.024]  Is
[01:45:54.884 --> 01:45:55.064]  I don't
[01:46:12.327 --> 01:46:15.329]  GMO is doing it in all the other animals they tested on.
[01:46:15.329 --> 01:46:19.811]  They won't let human tests go on because they want to cover this up.
[01:46:19.811 --> 01:46:25.634]  All the big eugenicists that call for population reduction are the ones funding it, like Bill Gates buying into Monsanto.
[01:46:25.634 --> 01:46:30.377]  I've got all the government documents about, we could build Trojan horses into stuff, you know, 30 years ago.
[01:46:30.377 --> 01:46:31.418]  Food, water, you name it.
[01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:31.838]  They've done it.
[01:46:32.538 --> 01:46:35.859]  They're coming out with new rices and things that reduce your fertility.
[01:46:35.859 --> 01:46:37.659]  I mean, this is not a debate.
[01:46:37.659 --> 01:46:46.342]  I want to get him on about the latest threats from this, and then expand into some other areas with our guest here, because this is the big issue.
[01:46:46.342 --> 01:46:50.183]  This is one of the areas where you can still try to avoid it, but not for long.
[01:46:50.183 --> 01:46:55.444]  They're trying to stop it from being labeled, and they're trying to proliferate to every food crop there is, not just the basic staples.
[01:46:56.044 --> 01:46:59.386]  This is The Crossroads and Jeff Smith joins us.
[01:46:59.386 --> 01:47:01.787]  Jeffrey, good to have you with us.
[01:47:01.787 --> 01:47:03.128]  What's front and center on your radar?
[01:47:03.128 --> 01:47:06.830]  What are the biggest threats right now with this whole Frankenfood takeover?
[01:47:07.728 --> 01:47:24.303]  Well I've been working on a new film Alex and I've been interviewing veterinarians and pediatricians and other doctors and what I'm seeing now is extreme support for our concept that GMOs are causing the rise in so many diseases.
[01:47:24.303 --> 01:47:31.910]  So that's one thing and so I want to talk about autism for example and irritable bowel syndrome and other problems and relate them to GMOs.
[01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:36.335]  Also, we're seeing evidence of a new organism new to science.
[01:47:36.335 --> 01:47:42.722]  You may have reported on it from Dr. Huber, which might be causing all that infertility we're talking about.
[01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:50.431]  I want to talk about some experiences I'm getting from numerous farmers and others about animals spontaneously avoiding GMOs when given a choice.
[01:47:50.991 --> 01:47:55.434]  And when they get on GMOs, they get sick or die or have fertility problems.
[01:47:55.434 --> 01:48:00.397]  And when they get off GMOs, there's all sorts of improvements in those symptoms.
[01:48:00.397 --> 01:48:09.944]  And I want to talk about also what's happening on the ground as we're seeing an upsurge of awareness and concern about GMOs and what it means in terms of a way out of this madness.
[01:48:09.944 --> 01:48:11.985]  And I think you're right on about labeling.
[01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:16.128]  It turns out the expression of concern today is being expressed in
[01:48:16.468 --> 01:48:24.546]  I think 18 different states have bills floated about labeling GMOs, plus there's an initiative in California that can drive it out in a single blow.
[01:48:26.906 --> 01:48:27.366]  Amazing.
[01:48:27.366 --> 01:48:29.508]  And this is the genetic Armageddon.
[01:48:29.508 --> 01:48:32.070]  This is the real, provable thing.
[01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:36.333]  Not the system co-opting environmental concern with carbon dioxide.
[01:48:36.333 --> 01:48:37.574]  I mean, that's why they do that.
[01:48:37.574 --> 01:48:39.836]  Because they don't want us looking at the real issue.
[01:48:39.836 --> 01:48:46.681]  And then later I'm going to ask you, from your deep research, I know you don't speculate, why the elite would be doing this when it's blowing back on them.
[01:48:46.681 --> 01:48:48.922]  But we've got some time.
[01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:50.703]  Let's get into the first issues up front.
[01:48:50.703 --> 01:48:53.485]  That is a powerful raft of info you just laid out.
[01:48:54.346 --> 01:49:06.672]  I think we'll start with the stories of the animals that have been fed GMOs and what's happened to them and what changes they've seen when they've taken off GMOs, and then we can work in the autism issue.
[01:49:06.672 --> 01:49:11.474]  Because one of the interviews I conducted recently was with Dr. Don Huber.
[01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:18.756]  And he's been an expert in the impact of Roundup, Monsanto's herbicide used on Roundup ready crops.
[01:49:18.756 --> 01:49:22.717]  And that has put him into a situation where he's studying about GMOs.
[01:49:22.717 --> 01:49:34.861]  So he was speaking in Germany and going over the behavioral changes, the neurological changes, and the physiological changes that we're seeing in animals that are fed GMOs, both livestock and laboratory animals.
[01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:40.703]  And a doctor approached him afterwards and said, you know, this is exactly what we're seeing in autistic children.
[01:49:41.423 --> 01:49:49.806]  So let's go into those animal studies, those animal experiences, and then we'll circle back and see if autism may be implicated.
[01:49:49.806 --> 01:50:02.410]  I talked to someone last week at a conference in Washington among farmers, and he said he had just received a call in December from one of his agricultural clients, a farmer who has thousands of pigs.
[01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:08.552]  And he said that the guy was stammering and so excited he couldn't hardly get out what he wanted to say.
[01:50:09.332 --> 01:50:22.678]  And what eventually unfolded was that 11 days previous, he took this guy's suggestion and shifted the corn that was being fed to his pigs in the nursery to non-genetically modified corn.
[01:50:23.553 --> 01:50:31.642]  Now after about three days, they noticed a change and him and his brothers walked in and they kind of just joked for themselves saying, maybe it's the non-GMO corn.
[01:50:31.642 --> 01:50:43.176]  But by the 11th day, he placed the call to this man and was so excited because he was absolutely sure it was the change to non-GMO corn that caused the dramatic change.
[01:50:44.511 --> 01:50:44.931]  Stay there.
[01:50:44.931 --> 01:50:45.292]  Amazing.
[01:50:45.292 --> 01:50:55.079]  I've been hearing this from farmers myself from 10 years that their pigs and other smart animals will not eat the GMO because they have olfactory nerves hundreds of times better than ours.
[01:50:55.079 --> 01:50:56.660]  A pig has better than a bloodhound.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:57.581]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.581 --> 01:50:59.842]  This is incredible information.
[01:50:59.842 --> 01:51:00.263]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.243 --> 01:51:05.684]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:51:05.684 --> 01:51:07.184]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:51:07.184 --> 01:51:16.067]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:51:16.067 --> 01:51:19.508]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:51:19.508 --> 01:51:20.388]  But take heart.
[01:51:20.388 --> 01:51:24.349]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:51:24.349 --> 01:51:29.310]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:33.593]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:51:33.593 --> 01:51:35.314]  The globalists are scared.
[01:51:35.314 --> 01:51:36.655]  They've overreached.
[01:51:36.655 --> 01:51:40.158]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:51:55.549 --> 01:51:57.831]  We are going to use their system against them.
[01:51:57.831 --> 01:51:59.092]  The Info War now.
[01:51:59.352 --> 01:52:00.702]  Goes into high gear!
[01:52:04.363 --> 01:52:09.546]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:09.546 --> 01:52:11.427]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:52:11.427 --> 01:52:14.950]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:22.414]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:52:22.414 --> 01:52:26.917]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:52:26.917 --> 01:52:32.661]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:34.782]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[01:54:18.819 --> 01:54:30.785]  You know, the problem with Jeffrey M. Smith, investigative journalist, researcher, filmmaker, author, is when he says one point, I can think of like a hundred examples of what he's saying being on record.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.520]  I mean, here's one out of the Washington Post.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.982]  Makers of genetically modified seeds say more farmers evading EPA rules.
[01:54:37.982 --> 01:54:40.602]  This is from the Washington Post, February 13th.
[01:54:40.602 --> 01:54:52.646]  And you read in there and it says, oh, they're supposed to build a refuge or grow a refuge of corn next to their GMO corn because, you know, it'll kill all the bugs if they don't have a refuge and they'll also get immunity.
[01:54:53.326 --> 01:54:57.607]  So this is corn for humans that grow a natural pesticide, but many times stronger.
[01:54:57.607 --> 01:54:59.327]  But you can't have the bugs eating it.
[01:54:59.327 --> 01:55:01.928]  So they have to have refuges from their own corn.
[01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:04.268]  And I mean, how many studies have been out?
[01:55:04.268 --> 01:55:05.248]  All over the world.
[01:55:05.248 --> 01:55:09.289]  Big prestigious ones where you feed it to rodents, skinny pigs, you name it.
[01:55:09.289 --> 01:55:11.109]  Three generations, they're sterile.
[01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:14.050]  I mean, Smith covers it in his books with all the scientists.
[01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:18.291]  So yeah, now he's got farmers talking about seeing this with their livestock.
[01:55:19.456 --> 01:55:21.418]  I mean, look at our disease rates.
[01:55:21.418 --> 01:55:24.060]  Jeff, continue going over all of this for people.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:26.702]  Where were you left off when we went to break?
[01:55:26.702 --> 01:55:38.890]  Sure, and I'll talk about that toxin-producing corn because there's a new study out that came out last week, which has very big implications for humans, as well as the possibility for linking GMOs to autism.
[01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:47.957]  But getting back to our pig discussion, it turns out that this farmer worked as the person, among his brothers, he was the one in charge of the nursery.
[01:55:48.457 --> 01:55:53.884]  And for years, his brothers would kind of rile him because it was the easiest job, there was never any problem.
[01:55:53.884 --> 01:55:58.509]  But 14 years ago, things got completely out of hand.
[01:55:58.509 --> 01:56:02.053]  And the pigs started getting sick, and their behavior changed.
[01:56:02.053 --> 01:56:04.817]  And that's when they started introducing genetically engineered corn.
[01:56:05.437 --> 01:56:15.841]  But they didn't realize that the corn was the problem because at the same time there were new confined animal feeding operations introduced into the area and new pigs imported from Canada and elsewhere.
[01:56:15.841 --> 01:56:18.401]  So they just blamed it on the new type of pig.
[01:56:18.401 --> 01:56:28.925]  But now when they switched for the first time in 14 years to non-GMO corn, they started seeing the pig behavior and health that they had seen prior to the introduction of GMOs.
[01:56:29.505 --> 01:56:31.247]  And he was so excited.
[01:56:31.247 --> 01:56:47.021]  He said even the animals would look like they're playing and happy, and when he left the nursery they'd still be playing, whereas when they were on the GM corn for 14 years, when they walked in they'd be agitated, but then they'd get too tired and just lie down.
[01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:55.632]  They said the whole level of sickness is less, and he's going to document the changes because he has all the details from... Now, is this VT corn?
[01:56:55.632 --> 01:57:01.395]  Because, I mean, there's different types with bacteria, with funguses, sometimes thousands of times stronger.
[01:57:01.395 --> 01:57:08.819]  But they say because it's a natural thing that we just soup up and have it grow, this way the bugs don't eat it, but it's safe for you to eat.
[01:57:08.819 --> 01:57:10.380]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:13.582]  No wonder organ failure in these studies is off the chart.
[01:57:13.582 --> 01:57:15.003]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:57:15.646 --> 01:57:20.929]  When I heard the story about his pigs, it reminded me of a veterinarian I interviewed a month earlier.
[01:57:20.929 --> 01:57:29.593]  He talked about a South African farm where some of the pigs were dying and becoming cannibalistic on the GM corn, biting each other's ears and tails.
[01:57:29.593 --> 01:57:37.317]  He said for some, they acted like they had Alzheimer's and they wandered around the pen, couldn't figure out where the food was, and died.
[01:57:37.317 --> 01:57:39.959]  All of that reversed when they switched to non-GM corn.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:51.534]  Now, this behavior of being agitated and antisocial, it was also discovered in rats that were fed GM corn compared to non-GM corn.
[01:57:51.534 --> 01:57:55.980]  For those that were eating the non-GM corn, you can pick them up, put them on the shoulder, pet them like a pet.
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:05.851]  However, those that were eating the GM corn, they were running around scared, not involved with other animals, and they were completely agitated and anxious.
[01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:13.460]  This was also seen in rats fed genetically modified soy by Russian Academy of Sciences researcher Irina Ermakova.
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:28.805]  Even a undergraduate student in Holland, when he did a study on mice, found that the mice that were raised on genetically modified soy and corn were totally agitated and completely fearful where the other ones acted like mice.
[01:58:28.805 --> 01:58:36.867]  Well, yeah, because if you feed animals plants that are meant to kill bugs, what's it going to do to a larger animal?
[01:58:36.867 --> 01:58:41.668]  A lot of drug heads take poison to get high.
[01:58:41.668 --> 01:58:43.369]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:52.470]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:58.051]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:58.051 --> 01:59:03.072]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:03.072 --> 01:59:08.093]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:59:08.633 --> 01:59:13.875]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.875 --> 01:59:20.977]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.977 --> 01:59:22.098]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:22.098 --> 01:59:28.460]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:31.962]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:31.962 --> 01:59:34.183]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:34.183 --> 01:59:35.044]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:35.044 --> 01:59:35.284]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:35.284 --> 01:59:38.766]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:38.766 --> 01:59:40.507]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:54.119 --> 01:59:56.500]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:05.805]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.805 --> 02:00:07.106]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.106 --> 02:00:08.867]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.867 --> 02:00:10.628]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.628 --> 02:00:12.209]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.209 --> 02:00:13.769]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.769 --> 02:00:17.952]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.952 --> 02:00:22.034]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.858 --> 02:00:37.106]  You know, some people out there will say, well, it's anecdotal evidence that you feed different animals things and they become sterile, or they become vicious, or they become mentally degraded or retarded.
[02:00:37.106 --> 02:00:39.307]  Well, if you walk out in front of a truck, is it anecdotal?
[02:00:39.307 --> 02:00:41.569]  Or if you, you know, take cocaine and have a heart attack?
[02:00:41.569 --> 02:00:42.549]  No.
[02:00:42.549 --> 02:00:44.471]  When it happens enough, you know this is what it causes.
[02:00:44.471 --> 02:00:46.752]  You know, they still say cigarettes don't give you lung cancer.
[02:00:46.752 --> 02:00:49.274]  We know that's a lie.
[02:00:49.274 --> 02:00:54.177]  The point is, we have literally hundreds and hundreds of studies with the GMO where it's admitted to be sterilizing.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.850]  I mean, most of this stuff that you really see the problems with is meant to kill insects that eat it.
[02:01:00.850 --> 02:01:02.914]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:01:02.914 --> 02:01:04.236]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[02:01:04.236 --> 02:01:05.939]  That's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:01:05.939 --> 02:01:07.863]  That's... This kills bugs!
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:10.702]  You're going to eat it now.
[02:01:10.702 --> 02:01:11.883]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:01:11.883 --> 02:01:12.744]  I don't want that.
[02:01:12.744 --> 02:01:15.307]  This is a short segment, long one coming up.
[02:01:15.307 --> 02:01:18.850]  Journalist, filmmaker, author, Jeffrey Smith's our guest.
[02:01:18.850 --> 02:01:21.393]  Please continue with the Russian researcher.
[02:01:21.393 --> 02:01:23.234]  Yeah, and of course you tell the rest of the story.
[02:01:23.234 --> 02:01:25.076]  She's like, this is sterilizing all the rats.
[02:01:25.076 --> 02:01:27.399]  And I go, this is going to sterilize humans.
[02:01:27.399 --> 02:01:30.802]  She's like, well, there are too many humans in the world.
[02:01:30.802 --> 02:01:31.443]  Please continue.
[02:01:31.983 --> 02:01:34.965]  Well, I think what you're referring to is when I was on the show a few months ago.
[02:01:34.965 --> 02:01:42.728]  During her study, she fed female rats genetically modified soy and more than half of their babies died within three weeks.
[02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:46.490]  The babies were sterile and the infants were smaller.
[02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:51.333]  And she fed male rats genetically modified soy and the testicles changed from pink to blue.
[02:01:51.873 --> 02:01:56.476]  Well, her boss was pressured from his boss and told her, no more GMO studies.
[02:01:56.476 --> 02:02:03.320]  So someone in her office tried to comfort her by saying, well maybe the GMO soy will solve the overpopulation problem.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.181]  She was not impressed.
[02:02:05.287 --> 02:02:19.492]  Getting back to our animals, I also heard last week at this farmer conference a story about a cattle farmer that was raising miniature steer, just three feet high, and he was feeding them non-GMO corn, but ran out.
[02:02:19.492 --> 02:02:25.174]  So he got the normal GM corn from a local feed mill, and within two weeks, 90% of his herd died.
[02:02:26.795 --> 02:02:32.780]  So he rushed to get the non-GM corn, was able to heal the rest, and they survived.
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:36.483]  Now what happened with the steer is that they bloated.
[02:02:36.483 --> 02:02:38.205]  They weren't digesting.
[02:02:38.205 --> 02:02:45.511]  This was raised during a talk, and I immediately described what's happening in India with sheep, goats, and buffalo.
[02:02:46.457 --> 02:02:50.700]  They are allowed to graze on BT cotton plants after harvest.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:55.224]  As you know, the BT toxin breaks open the stomach of insects and kills them.
[02:02:55.224 --> 02:02:58.967]  It's a built-in pesticide in these genetically engineered crops.
[02:02:58.967 --> 02:03:03.130]  Well, thousands of sheep, goats, and buffalo have died.
[02:03:03.130 --> 02:03:11.117]  And it turns out there's a lot of evidence suggesting that the food that they're eating is not being broken up in the rumen
[02:03:11.952 --> 02:03:19.440]  By the bacteria that normally breaks down the cellulose, and so they're starving to death because the food doesn't get into the intestines.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.705]  So they're bloating, they are dying because of lack of digestion.
[02:03:24.705 --> 02:03:33.874]  Now this doesn't happen with normal cows, maybe because their system is so big, but these miniature cattle, as this farmer told me, are like large sheep.
[02:03:33.874 --> 02:03:35.095]  So it made sense for me
[02:03:35.936 --> 02:03:45.502]  That the BT corn may be having a similar impact as the BT cotton plants are having in buffalo, sheep and goats in India.
[02:03:48.126 --> 02:03:50.808]  And by the way, we need to talk about that when we come back from break.
[02:03:50.808 --> 02:03:59.192]  We've seen whether this stuff's good for you or not, and obviously it's good for you like a hole in the head, what it's done to farming across the world.
[02:03:59.192 --> 02:04:07.217]  I mean, it's consolidated, it's devastated, it's destroying Mexico, it's destroying India, it's causing suicides that are just off the chart.
[02:04:08.553 --> 02:04:09.054]  It's true.
[02:04:09.054 --> 02:04:13.383]  In fact, if you look at the impact overall, it's been a disaster.
[02:04:13.383 --> 02:04:19.095]  Exactly the opposite of what the governments claim that it's going to do when they approve this stuff without any safety studies.
[02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:26.731]  When we look at some additional animal studies, we see disorders like reproductive disorders.
[02:04:26.731 --> 02:04:32.793]  I spoke to a goat herder who has lots of goats that he sells for farms around the Midwest.
[02:04:32.793 --> 02:04:43.057]  And when he was feeding Roundup Ready alfalfa and also other genetically modified crops to his goats, they were not getting pregnant in large numbers.
[02:04:43.057 --> 02:04:46.998]  And so he switched to the non-GM and the pregnancies resumed.
[02:04:48.208 --> 02:04:50.729]  Yeah, of course, that's the main trait they want.
[02:04:50.729 --> 02:04:52.850]  Everything else is really just secondary.
[02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:57.071]  But they sell you on one trait, and it's got all the Trojan horses in it.
[02:04:57.071 --> 02:05:02.093]  Thank God for the other side effects, we wouldn't be catching the sterilization op.
[02:05:02.093 --> 02:05:16.519]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:22.245]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:22.245 --> 02:05:35.011]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:35.011 --> 02:05:42.275]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:42.975 --> 02:05:53.349]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:53.349 --> 02:05:57.274]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:05:57.274 --> 02:06:00.399]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:06:01.314 --> 02:06:04.216]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[02:06:04.216 --> 02:06:07.919]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[02:06:07.919 --> 02:06:08.420]  Number 10.
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:10.982]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[02:06:10.982 --> 02:06:11.722]  Number 9.
[02:06:11.722 --> 02:06:13.544]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[02:06:13.544 --> 02:06:17.467]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[02:06:17.467 --> 02:06:17.787]  7.

[02:06:20.449 --> 02:06:20.810]  6.
[02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:22.991]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.

[02:08:01.748 --> 02:08:07.291]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.522 --> 02:08:32.224]  I tell you, I know why a lot of people like to live in Florida.
[02:08:32.224 --> 02:08:33.705]  It is such a gorgeous state.
[02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:37.546]  We're right outside Pensacola, Florida.
[02:08:37.546 --> 02:08:40.028]  I am looking out of our beach house.
[02:08:40.028 --> 02:08:44.090]  In fact, I had to turn around this laptop that we're shooting a Skype video of.
[02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:45.271]  Who knows?
[02:08:45.271 --> 02:08:48.355]  I'll probably pull a plug or something and take our broadcast down.
[02:08:48.355 --> 02:08:53.040]  We're broadcasting over an access unit, but sending video to PrisonPlanet.tv viewers over this.
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:53.942]  I don't know.
[02:08:53.942 --> 02:08:54.242]  You know what?
[02:08:54.242 --> 02:08:59.669]  I'll take a photo and I'll Twitter it to Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:09:01.116 --> 02:09:02.278]  Just how pretty it is here.
[02:09:02.278 --> 02:09:05.422]  I'll send a couple of those up during the next break.
[02:09:05.422 --> 02:09:09.026]  And we do have a beautiful planet, Spaceship Earth.
[02:09:09.026 --> 02:09:10.909]  It's the only planet we have.
[02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:13.892]  I am a steward of the Earth.
[02:09:13.892 --> 02:09:16.576]  I am a conservationist.
[02:09:16.576 --> 02:09:19.659]  I am someone who does believe in protecting our environment.
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:29.563]  And all I see the elite doing is lecturing me all day about how I need to give my rights up to a UN agenda 21 world government to protect the earth.
[02:09:29.563 --> 02:09:44.267]  And then I see Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Warren Buffett, Bill and Melinda Gates, Ted Turner, Bill Gates' dad, the Queen of England, all of them
[02:09:45.527 --> 02:10:02.180]  Funding open world government and then writing in all these white papers that go back to the 60s and the Rockefeller Foundation that we've linked to on their own site, saying we're going to engineer GMO food that reduces fertility and does it over generation so that it's not noticed by the public.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:05.442]  Or the White House science czar, hey we need to do this to reduce population.
[02:10:05.442 --> 02:10:07.964]  We can engineer it into the food, also add it to the water.
[02:10:07.964 --> 02:10:09.586]  Fluoride reduces fertility.
[02:10:09.586 --> 02:10:14.890]  So it's a cocktail of things and we now have not one, not two, not twenty, not a hundred,
[02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:28.479]  But hundreds and hundreds of documents like PDD 21, State Department Miranda 200, all of these different programs and things that have been issued by presidents and others, where
[02:10:29.813 --> 02:10:34.177]  They openly say it's our policy to reduce population covertly.
[02:10:34.177 --> 02:10:48.489]  We had another article up yesterday with government documents where some black guy was in a wreck and they grabbed him and dissected him alive and were injecting him with plutonium and they were doing it to other people they killed but he was able to crawl out one night.
[02:10:48.489 --> 02:10:52.753]  It was at a public hospital but they had it back in a corner ward, the Pentagon.
[02:10:52.753 --> 02:10:56.336]  He was able to crawl out and crawl away and survive.
[02:10:58.897 --> 02:11:04.320]  I mean, look, look, we're going to go back to Jeffrey M. Smith, journalist, filmmaker, author, and have him for the rest of the hour.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:07.462]  And at the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up if you want to talk to him and have your questions.
[02:11:07.462 --> 02:11:09.784]  But everything he's saying is so documented.
[02:11:09.784 --> 02:11:14.186]  I want him to recap what he was getting to at the end of the last segment.
[02:11:14.186 --> 02:11:24.773]  But again, the biggest threat, I'm not against nuclear power, but 9 out of 10, the Associated Press say are leaking of 400 and something.
[02:11:24.773 --> 02:11:26.714]  And they're supposed to shut them down for 20 years.
[02:11:26.714 --> 02:11:27.695]  Some are going for 40 years.
[02:11:29.036 --> 02:11:30.858]  They're crazy people.
[02:11:30.858 --> 02:11:33.461]  Fukushima blew up and is still melting down.
[02:11:33.461 --> 02:11:35.803]  The EPA just raises radiation levels.
[02:11:35.803 --> 02:11:38.546]  That's a real environmental crisis.
[02:11:38.546 --> 02:11:41.309]  And I have doctors, physicists, chemical physicists on.
[02:11:41.309 --> 02:11:42.831]  They say cancer rates will go up.
[02:11:44.548 --> 02:11:48.749]  You know, Chernobyl's killed a million people conservatively since 1986.
[02:11:48.749 --> 02:11:51.090]  This is the real threats we face.
[02:11:51.090 --> 02:11:53.770]  And you're not hearing this from the big environmental groups.
[02:11:53.770 --> 02:11:56.771]  Because Monsanto and others are in there lobbying and controlling.
[02:11:56.771 --> 02:12:03.653]  Instead, it's how I need to pay the government more money, or have them ban my light bulbs, or don't take a hot shower.
[02:12:03.653 --> 02:12:04.633]  This is what they actually teach.
[02:12:05.970 --> 02:12:08.551]  I mean, maybe I'd listen to him about not taking a hot shower.
[02:12:08.551 --> 02:12:09.852]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:12:09.852 --> 02:12:11.372]  If, okay, let's stop right there.
[02:12:11.372 --> 02:12:13.253]  You're splicing the entire biosphere.
[02:12:13.253 --> 02:12:15.574]  Grasses, trees they're coming out with.
[02:12:15.574 --> 02:12:16.374]  Everything.
[02:12:16.374 --> 02:12:17.875]  And all the allergies exploding.
[02:12:17.875 --> 02:12:19.035]  And cancer up over 2,000%.
[02:12:19.035 --> 02:12:20.936]  And fertility plunging.
[02:12:20.936 --> 02:12:22.237]  And all of this.
[02:12:22.237 --> 02:12:23.997]  It is a nightmare situation.
[02:12:23.997 --> 02:12:25.958]  And we cover it in my film, Endgame.
[02:12:25.958 --> 02:12:27.199]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:12:27.879 --> 02:12:29.400]  Okay, Jeff, you've got the floor.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:49.816]  This is a longer segment than the next, and we're going to go to calls, but continue with some of the studies, some of the facts, the suicides, what this has done to agriculture, the results it's caused, and then I want you to talk about the population reduction angle, because I remember talking to you 10 years ago, and you're like, well, Mr. Jones, there is, you know, this does, there is some evidence that's linked to infertility, but
[02:12:50.596 --> 02:12:51.737]  I'm not going to go there.
[02:12:51.737 --> 02:13:00.822]  But now it's becoming so widespread, even in the mainline literature, people are saying, why does it always have traits that reduce fertility?
[02:13:00.822 --> 02:13:03.043]  This can't just be an accident every time.
[02:13:03.043 --> 02:13:05.765]  Or maybe if these are live pesticides, that's what it is.
[02:13:05.765 --> 02:13:10.127]  But even products that aren't pesticide-based are having it.
[02:13:10.127 --> 02:13:10.768]  Please continue.
[02:13:11.448 --> 02:13:13.369]  Okay, we'll get to the reproductive thing.
[02:13:13.369 --> 02:13:24.574]  Where I want to go is bring completely new stuff that we're preparing for a new film, which, by the way, our mutual friend Mike Adams is doing a matching grant so that our institute can finish the production and promote.
[02:13:24.574 --> 02:13:27.316]  That's at responsibletechnology.org.
[02:13:28.956 --> 02:13:33.118]  What I want to focus in on is digestive issues, and then we're going to link it to autism.
[02:13:33.118 --> 02:13:42.142]  As you know, with autism, most of the kids have some form of digestive ailment, and they also have behavioral disorders.
[02:13:42.142 --> 02:13:49.805]  We've already talked about in the previous segment, many animals having behavioral disorders when being fed GMOs.
[02:13:49.805 --> 02:13:57.768]  Let's look at their digestive tracts and see if it resembles at all the kind of gnarly and messed up digestion that we're seeing in autistic kids.
[02:13:58.962 --> 02:14:09.310]  I talk to butchers and farmers that butcher their own animals, and whenever they've compared GM-fed to non-GM-fed, they say it's night and day.
[02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:17.376]  They say, for example, the intestines of the GM-fed animals are so disrupted, they're like paper-thin and they can tear apart.
[02:14:17.376 --> 02:14:22.680]  So we no longer, as a country, use our own animals' intestines for sausage casings.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:25.863]  We import them from New Zealand, where they don't feed GMOs.
[02:14:26.523 --> 02:14:32.925]  I've also heard that the organs are discolored among the GM fed animals and have a foul stench.
[02:14:32.925 --> 02:14:37.366]  Now the stench is probably linked to the change in the gut flora.
[02:14:37.366 --> 02:14:48.009]  There's a complete change according to many veterinarians as well as doctors in the gut flora, both of animals fed GMOs and in... Okay, I'm going to stop you again.
[02:14:48.009 --> 02:14:49.830]  I'm going to stop you again.
[02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:52.690]  We've done deep research that no one is covering that I've seen.
[02:14:52.690 --> 02:14:53.491]  I'm going to bring this up.
[02:14:53.491 --> 02:14:54.531]  I know you've probably seen it.
[02:14:55.271 --> 02:14:59.993]  But Aaron Dykes has exposed that Bill Gates is the big eugenicist for population reduction.
[02:14:59.993 --> 02:15:01.274]  He's bought into Monsanto.
[02:15:01.274 --> 02:15:07.236]  His other big funding is studying and trying to buy up control of gut disorder investigations.
[02:15:07.236 --> 02:15:09.777]  Because it's a big new market because everybody's getting it.
[02:15:09.777 --> 02:15:11.738]  And all the studies are showing it's attacking the organs.
[02:15:11.738 --> 02:15:12.979]  This is confirmed.
[02:15:12.979 --> 02:15:18.781]  But here he is trying to take control of it so that no company's out there to expose what's going on.
[02:15:18.781 --> 02:15:19.662]  Were you aware of that?
[02:15:20.282 --> 02:15:22.523]  I was not aware that he was investing in that.
[02:15:22.523 --> 02:15:30.805]  I do know he's a major investor in Monsanto, that the person in charge of his agricultural section of his foundation is a former Monsanto guy.
[02:15:30.805 --> 02:15:40.608]  I heard him speak at the World Food Prize a couple years ago when he said he was converted by a visit from the Rockefeller Foundation to become a GMO advocate.
[02:15:40.608 --> 02:15:43.709]  So yeah, I'm aware of Gates' position on GMOs.
[02:15:43.709 --> 02:15:46.270]  I was not aware about the gastrointestinal investigations.
[02:15:47.824 --> 02:15:50.768]  I want to talk about... Well, his data turns out to work for the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:15:50.768 --> 02:15:53.211]  Yeah, it's all a big... Yeah, please continue.
[02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:59.140]  So you're making a film with all the devastating evidence of what this weapons system's doing.
[02:15:59.847 --> 02:16:05.209]  You know, we've talked in the past, in previous films and books, about the laboratory studies.
[02:16:05.209 --> 02:16:18.633]  For example, the animals that are fed GM soy have changed uteruses and ovaries, damaged young sperm cells, higher infant mortality, sterility by the third generation, hair growing in their mouths, fewer babies, smaller babies.
[02:16:18.633 --> 02:16:21.854]  We see the work done in laboratories.
[02:16:21.854 --> 02:16:25.895]  But what we're doing with this new film is correlating it with interviews
[02:16:26.195 --> 02:16:32.258]  With veterinarians and farmers, pet owners and pet veterinarians, and doctors and parents.
[02:16:32.258 --> 02:16:43.442]  Because what we're seeing is a correlation between the type of problems identified in the laboratory with the type of problems that are exploding in the doctor's offices in the United States.
[02:16:43.442 --> 02:16:52.326]  Now autism, I'm just focusing on autism right now because it's an interesting link and I happen to be writing a very extensive paper on it this week, so it's fresh in my mind.
[02:16:52.326 --> 02:16:53.687]  But it's all new information.
[02:16:54.437 --> 02:16:59.101]  Now, you mentioned earlier, Alex, about the insecticidal corn and cotton.
[02:16:59.101 --> 02:17:03.565]  That's Bt toxin produced in every cell of corn and cotton.
[02:17:03.565 --> 02:17:10.351]  They take a gene from soil bacteria, insert it into the DNA of the plant, so every little cell has a little spray bottle.
[02:17:10.911 --> 02:17:26.320]  Now the excuse that the Environmental Protection Agency says is why they can put a pesticide that breaks open the stomach of insects and kills them, why they can put that in food, is that they say it has no impact on human cells or mammal cells.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:41.608]  Well, a study came out this past week from the Journal of Applied Toxicology, where for the first time they took Bt toxin derived from genetically modified plants and exposed it to human cells.
[02:17:42.208 --> 02:17:57.332]  And lo and behold what we all knew but the EPA denied is that it caused the process of starting to kill the cells and it caused a break open of the membranes so that fluid leaked out and was detected in higher numbers.
[02:17:57.332 --> 02:18:03.093]  Now this is exactly what we think happens with insects and why this BT toxin kills insects.
[02:18:03.093 --> 02:18:05.754]  It destroys the integrity of their digestive tract.
[02:18:06.374 --> 02:18:09.777]  What I hear from... Yeah, that was a German study six, seven years ago.
[02:18:09.777 --> 02:18:13.160]  Yeah, that it's destroying their intestines, including the bees.
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:17.283]  So they're just... This is an Armageddon.
[02:18:17.283 --> 02:18:17.924]  Please continue.
[02:18:17.924 --> 02:18:20.906]  But I want to ask you from your research, why do you think they're doing it?
[02:18:20.906 --> 02:18:23.208]  How do they think they'll get away with this?
[02:18:23.208 --> 02:18:23.809]  Go ahead.
[02:18:23.809 --> 02:18:28.753]  Well, let's come back to that question because that's a lot of opinions and a lot of ideas.
[02:18:28.753 --> 02:18:31.015]  But let's talk about the facts for just a moment.
[02:18:31.015 --> 02:18:31.536]  I'll get to that.
[02:18:32.936 --> 02:18:49.562]  When we look at the BT toxin causing these pores or openings in the intestines, there's a whole new field among progressive cutting-edge medical practitioners that are treating or looking at gut permeability.
[02:18:50.362 --> 02:19:03.365]  If undigested food gets through these holes into the blood, that might explain the rise in food allergies, autoimmune disease, inflammation, possibly autism.
[02:19:03.365 --> 02:19:11.227]  Because gut permeability is one of the factors that scientists are documenting accompany autism in large numbers.
[02:19:13.268 --> 02:19:24.853]  Wait, there's also big studies out, just to back you up again, that just came out, that they're finding the GMO, DNA, and RNA is actually going through the blood and into the cells.
[02:19:24.853 --> 02:19:30.596]  They'd always said that was impossible, and Monsanto's come out and said, it's fine to have our DNA in your cells.
[02:19:30.596 --> 02:19:33.057]  So it's actually going through now.
[02:19:33.057 --> 02:19:35.619]  I think that's more than just gut permeability.
[02:19:35.619 --> 02:19:38.460]  It's that before, we are what we eat.
[02:19:39.441 --> 02:19:44.789]  And all this stuff that's slowly developed on this planet, we're able to absorb and it's part of the normal order.
[02:19:44.789 --> 02:19:53.822]  You start splicing and crossing and doing all of this, it shows that at a micro level we're all interchanging at levels we never knew before.
[02:19:54.543 --> 02:20:01.146]  Let's talk about just this gene transfer because this is one of the scariest things that is currently documented.
[02:20:01.146 --> 02:20:11.930]  The only human feeding study ever published verified that part of the gene inserted into soybeans, making those soybeans Roundup ready, unkillable with Roundup.
[02:20:12.530 --> 02:20:12.990]  I don't know.
[02:20:31.337 --> 02:20:33.758]  And the same transfer occurs.
[02:20:33.758 --> 02:20:46.523]  What if the gene that produces this toxin that breaks open the stomach of insects and possibly human intestines, what if that gene were to transfer to our own gut bacteria and continue to function?
[02:20:47.370 --> 02:20:54.474]  It might turn our living, our pesticide, our living intestines, excuse me, it may turn our flora into living pesticide factories.
[02:20:54.474 --> 02:20:59.697]  Now, one of the studies that came out last year gives support for this.
[02:20:59.697 --> 02:21:15.086]  In Canada, they tested the blood of 30 pregnant women and their unborn fetuses, and found in 93% of the pregnant women, the BT toxin was in their blood, and in the blood of 80% of the cord blood of their unborn fetuses.
[02:21:15.726 --> 02:21:24.895]  So what this means is that somehow the BT toxin is getting into the bloodstream, and this is not supposed to happen according to the EPA.
[02:21:24.895 --> 02:21:27.999]  According to the EPA, it's supposed to be destroyed during digestion.
[02:21:27.999 --> 02:21:31.682]  So the authors were wondering, how come the frequency is so high?
[02:21:31.682 --> 02:21:35.226]  We don't eat that much corn chips and fresh corn to justify it.
[02:21:35.786 --> 02:21:44.370]  So they expected that it was the eating the meat and dairy from animals that have been fed Monsanto's corn, which was the source of the BT toxin.
[02:21:44.370 --> 02:21:55.716]  But I think it's more likely that it was the transformation of the gut bacteria inside the intestines of North Americans, which is causing this high constant exposure.
[02:21:55.716 --> 02:22:04.260]  And when I talk about this to medical conferences where I speak all the time, doctors invariably tell me that the rise in gastrointestinal problems has been astronomical.
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:08.821]  Irritable Bowel Syndrome, for example, is up 40% since GMOs were introduced.
[02:22:13.456 --> 02:22:21.919]  It is devastating, and even the early autism work that's now been duplicated over and over again, they've tried to discredit the doctors and people that put that out.
[02:22:21.919 --> 02:22:31.042]  And of course there's now a lawsuit against the British medical journal Journalist, who came out and talked about Dr. Wakefield and said that his information was lies.
[02:22:31.042 --> 02:22:34.543]  And when you read what they said, they said, well, he did medical stuff that wasn't needed.
[02:22:35.143 --> 02:22:36.303]  Like a colonoscopy.
[02:22:36.303 --> 02:22:47.126]  They say, he's been discredited, it's horrible, and then you read the fine print, he did a colonoscopy on children for, you know, things claiming that it was vaccines.
[02:22:47.126 --> 02:22:49.007]  Well, we say that's not needed.
[02:22:49.007 --> 02:23:01.550]  We'll know what he found, and now he's learned a bunch of studies before him it found, and after it found, is that, and of course he was looking at the mercury causing problems, but then there's the GMO connected to it, that the guts were highly toxic.
[02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:04.191]  And they're like, in the British Medical Journal, they actually say,
[02:23:04.451 --> 02:23:05.212]  That's ridiculous.
[02:23:05.212 --> 02:23:06.973]  The gut doesn't affect the brain.
[02:23:06.973 --> 02:23:09.995]  Really, is that why everybody knows that they have farm animals?
[02:23:09.995 --> 02:23:13.157]  That the type of food you feed them affects the way they behave?
[02:23:13.157 --> 02:23:17.180]  Or that if you drink alcohol, or if you take pills, it affects the brain?
[02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:19.601]  I mean, this is just asinine.
[02:23:19.601 --> 02:23:23.064]  And now... I mean, when I was in high school, there were no autistic children.
[02:23:23.584 --> 02:23:25.565]  Now, I take my children to a movie.
[02:23:25.565 --> 02:23:28.586]  The first two rows or more are autistic children.
[02:23:28.586 --> 02:23:30.067]  This is not over-diagnosis.
[02:23:30.067 --> 02:23:35.409]  This is a holocaust of children that are brain damaged.
[02:23:35.409 --> 02:23:49.896]  And then I talk to the countless families who get the news early enough at two or three, get them off GMO, get them all purified, do all these choline cleanses, do the probiotics, and move to the country and have to hide out to get away from GMO because it's so prolific now.
[02:23:50.216 --> 02:23:57.078]  And suddenly their kids start developing and talking, and they can reverse it, and the system gets so angry.
[02:23:57.078 --> 02:24:03.240]  And I've seen cases where they send CPS after them, even though their kid gets better, and say, you quit taking them to school.
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:04.701]  You're homeschooling them now.
[02:24:04.701 --> 02:24:06.742]  You quit taking them to their doctor.
[02:24:06.742 --> 02:24:08.562]  And they're like, but my child can talk again.
[02:24:08.562 --> 02:24:11.043]  I mean, this is like a cult.
[02:24:11.043 --> 02:24:13.304]  Listen, keep going through the evidence, but from your view,
[02:24:14.444 --> 02:24:15.265]  I know it's eugenics.
[02:24:15.265 --> 02:24:16.747]  I know it's a population control.
[02:24:16.747 --> 02:24:17.367]  Craziness.
[02:24:17.367 --> 02:24:18.128]  The Nazis.
[02:24:18.128 --> 02:24:19.349]  It came out of eugenics.
[02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:21.651]  The system learned you can't use guns and weapons to kill people.
[02:24:21.651 --> 02:24:22.673]  They'll fight back.
[02:24:22.673 --> 02:24:24.875]  You do it covertly through food, water.
[02:24:24.875 --> 02:24:26.116]  They're not going to notice.
[02:24:26.116 --> 02:24:26.937]  They're playing God.
[02:24:26.937 --> 02:24:28.298]  I know why they're doing it.
[02:24:28.298 --> 02:24:30.921]  My question is how they think they're going to get away with this?
[02:24:31.201 --> 02:24:36.108]  Because I see the worm turning against this so fast that there's no way.
[02:24:36.108 --> 02:24:39.212]  They've hurt so many people, the word's coming out now.
[02:24:39.212 --> 02:24:45.060]  And I'm telling the world, the war criminals are at the big GMO companies and the politicians that did this.
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:47.223]  And I want the wives and husbands of the politicians.
[02:24:47.503 --> 02:24:49.505]  You want to know why the grandson can't talk?
[02:24:49.505 --> 02:24:51.186]  You want to know why mommy got cancer at 25?
[02:24:51.186 --> 02:24:53.568]  You want to know why you're plagued?
[02:24:53.568 --> 02:24:55.630]  You did this to yourselves.
[02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:58.372]  And your husband that took money from these people was part of it.
[02:24:58.372 --> 02:25:04.618]  And the executives that did this and their engineers are a bunch of eugenicists who are the enemies of humanity.
[02:25:04.618 --> 02:25:05.419]  I'm sorry, go ahead sir.
[02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:13.744]  Well, for those that don't know much about GMOs, but I'm sure your normal audience does, there are two main traits.
[02:25:13.744 --> 02:25:26.477]  One is that which produces the insecticide, which we've talked about, and the other is that which withstands high doses of herbicide, and most popular for that is Roundup-ready crops that withstand large doses of Roundup.
[02:25:27.057 --> 02:25:30.919]  Now, Roundup has been shown to disrupt reproductive function.
[02:25:30.919 --> 02:25:32.640]  It can kill human placental cells.
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:34.141]  It disrupts estrogen.
[02:25:34.141 --> 02:25:35.501]  It causes birth defects.
[02:25:35.501 --> 02:25:37.902]  It causes abnormal and lower sperm count.
[02:25:37.902 --> 02:25:39.223]  Being an extremist!
[02:25:39.223 --> 02:25:39.863]  Come on!
[02:25:39.863 --> 02:25:42.045]  Weed killer isn't bad for ya!
[02:25:42.045 --> 02:25:44.446]  Next you're gonna tell me rat poison's not good for me either.
[02:25:45.726 --> 02:25:56.393]  One thing that it does is that it kills off beneficial bacteria in the gut of cows, which normally keep botulism bacteria in check.
[02:25:56.393 --> 02:26:10.682]  So, recent studies have shown that very tiny amounts of Roundup, less than would be residue on the food of these animals, can reduce the controlling bacteria and cause an explosion of botulism within the animal's gut.
[02:26:10.682 --> 02:26:12.223]  I've seen pictures of it and it's not pretty.
[02:26:12.683 --> 02:26:16.386]  So this is another way that Roundup might be causing disaster.
[02:26:16.386 --> 02:26:21.769]  But I wanted to talk about a new way, one that some of your listeners might be familiar with.
[02:26:21.769 --> 02:26:24.852]  There was a study, a series of analyses done,
[02:26:25.732 --> 02:26:25.912]  I think?
[02:26:44.125 --> 02:26:44.205]  Wow!
[02:27:04.633 --> 02:27:05.833]  What is it?
[02:27:05.833 --> 02:27:09.094]  They took this organism and they exposed it to a pregnant chicken.
[02:27:09.094 --> 02:27:12.335]  It killed the fetus in 24 to 48 hours.
[02:27:12.335 --> 02:27:15.575]  Now this organism has never been discovered before.
[02:27:15.575 --> 02:27:17.356]  It's completely new to science.
[02:27:17.356 --> 02:27:19.036]  It's the size of a virus.
[02:27:19.036 --> 02:27:21.677]  It operates, it looks like a fungus.
[02:27:21.677 --> 02:27:31.439]  And it appears to be everywhere but in high concentrations around diseased plants and infertile animals and animals that have spontaneous abortions.
[02:27:32.446 --> 02:27:45.913]  So a letter was written by a senior researcher, by Professor Emeritus, in fact, Professor, um, Dr. Don Huber, who had decades of study and was an expert at round-up effects.
[02:27:45.913 --> 02:27:53.057]  He was also on a military group that evaluates the threats of outbreak of disease, both natural and man-made.
[02:27:53.057 --> 02:27:58.780]  And in his letter to Secretary Vilsack of the USDA, he said, this is an emergency.
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:23.044]  He pointed out that there's widespread infertility among animals, that there might be a human link, of course, and that Vilsack should not approve Roundup Ready alfalfa because that would only increase the exposure of the population to Roundup at a time when we need to put money now into investigating whether this organism is causing the problem and linked to Roundup or GMOs.
[02:28:23.624 --> 02:28:28.869]  He sent that letter on January 17th privately to Secretary Vilsack.
[02:28:28.869 --> 02:28:32.333]  It was leaked onto the internet, so that's why I can talk about it.
[02:28:32.333 --> 02:28:36.277]  He was finally called weeks later by someone from the USDA.
[02:28:36.277 --> 02:28:43.424]  He gave them the names of the researchers, and the researchers have not yet been contacted by the USDA, and that was over a year ago.
[02:28:43.424 --> 02:28:44.004]  Let me stop him.
[02:28:44.665 --> 02:28:45.285]  Let me stop you.
[02:28:45.285 --> 02:28:51.709]  My God, I'm going to have to have you back up next week because we've only got 30 minutes left, 35 minutes before our next guest joins us.
[02:28:51.709 --> 02:29:07.737]  This is so bombshell because I research this stuff every day now and I didn't even know what you're just saying here but I knew about how it's basically creating new bacteria in the stomach and displacing the others where I guess you won't be able to live without the Roundup now in some sick way.
[02:29:07.737 --> 02:29:12.579]  It's like they're turning us into these biological androids that are dependent on them and ill from their system and then they
[02:29:12.879 --> 02:29:14.000]  Sell us expensive treatments.
[02:29:31.011 --> 02:29:32.272]  And here's the key.
[02:29:32.272 --> 02:29:33.633]  We're gonna come back and talk about this.
[02:29:33.633 --> 02:29:35.354]  They're not just coming out with dozens of new crops.
[02:29:35.354 --> 02:29:37.336]  They're coming out with hundreds of new ones.
[02:29:37.336 --> 02:29:39.197]  Grasses, trees.
[02:29:39.197 --> 02:29:41.179]  They're just taking everything over.
[02:29:41.179 --> 02:29:42.640]  They're total psychos.
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.321]  Jeffrey M. Smith's our guest.
[02:29:44.321 --> 02:29:47.724]  This is the most important information we could be covering right now.
[02:29:47.724 --> 02:29:50.486]  Incredible.
[02:29:50.486 --> 02:29:51.867]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.867 --> 02:29:54.409]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.409 --> 02:29:57.091]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.795 --> 02:30:08.438]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.438 --> 02:30:13.580]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:28.707]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:35.402]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:30:35.402 --> 02:30:39.224]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:30:39.224 --> 02:30:40.465]  Others don't.
[02:30:40.465 --> 02:30:42.606]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.606 --> 02:30:44.407]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:30:58.974 --> 02:30:59.495]  Others don't.
[02:31:02.185 --> 02:31:03.887]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:03.887 --> 02:31:09.192]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:31:09.192 --> 02:31:10.734]  Saving means to make money.
[02:31:10.734 --> 02:31:19.522]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:31:20.243 --> 02:31:27.788]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:31:27.788 --> 02:31:35.793]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:35.793 --> 02:31:41.016]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:31:41.016 --> 02:31:43.177]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:32:00.808 --> 02:32:08.011]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:32:08.011 --> 02:32:25.900]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:30.022]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:32:30.302 --> 02:32:32.063]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:32:32.063 --> 02:32:40.229]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:32:46.533 --> 02:32:47.814]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:32:47.814 --> 02:32:48.694]  It's incredible.

[02:33:01.702 --> 02:33:03.243]  If you're a new listener,
[02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:30.662]  And you're thinking, man, this can't be true.
[02:33:30.662 --> 02:33:32.123]  I'm begging you.
[02:33:32.123 --> 02:33:34.604]  Because I investigate things.
[02:33:34.604 --> 02:33:38.887]  That's where I get my views, my research, what I stand for.
[02:33:38.887 --> 02:33:43.591]  I've been researching GMO for about 16 years since I've been on air.
[02:33:45.456 --> 02:33:56.286]  And early on I noticed it was eugenicists, world population reductionists, the very groups calling for global government and reducing population who are always running programs to save people.
[02:33:56.286 --> 02:33:59.309]  And then wherever they go there's famine, death, wars, destruction.
[02:33:59.309 --> 02:34:01.331]  And then I found Memorandum 200 and others.
[02:34:01.331 --> 02:34:03.994]  It's all a plan.
[02:34:03.994 --> 02:34:04.834]  But these people
[02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:12.013]  Are so crazy that they're killing the honeybees, that the animals are dying, they're just screwing the whole earth up.
[02:34:12.013 --> 02:34:16.454]  I mean, it's bad enough to say, well, for the environment, humans are, you know, destructive.
[02:34:16.454 --> 02:34:21.416]  We're going to covertly reduce human population and then screw up the entire biosphere of the earth.
[02:34:21.416 --> 02:34:29.660]  I mean, even if you buy into this view, and I certainly know there are some technologies humans engage in and things that we screw up, we should make it better.
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:30.980]  But just kill everybody?
[02:34:30.980 --> 02:34:34.302]  And let's just say it's all a big accident.
[02:34:35.839 --> 02:34:39.020]  Okay, well, governments now know about this and are doing nothing.
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:41.721]  Well, not in Europe and other areas, but here.
[02:34:41.721 --> 02:34:47.863]  Notice we have the highest cancer rate, the highest obesity rate, the highest everything rate that's bad.
[02:34:47.863 --> 02:34:50.064]  Highest infant mortality now in the Western world.
[02:34:50.064 --> 02:34:52.464]  I mean, highest heart attacks.
[02:34:52.464 --> 02:34:55.165]  Highest neurological disorders.
[02:34:55.165 --> 02:34:56.266]  Lowest test scores.
[02:34:56.266 --> 02:34:57.106]  Go look it up!
[02:34:58.430 --> 02:35:06.995]  I mean, look, I'm not a rocket scientist, but when I feed my kids a few times on the road or something, just even some fast food junk, they act horrible for days.
[02:35:06.995 --> 02:35:09.496]  I give them processed sugar, they're bad for days.
[02:35:09.496 --> 02:35:12.158]  It's not just when they're on it, it screws them up.
[02:35:12.158 --> 02:35:14.099]  The dyes, the additives.
[02:35:14.099 --> 02:35:15.380]  This is a cornucopia!
[02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:19.822]  I mean, if you were trying to covertly poison people, you couldn't do a better job.
[02:35:19.822 --> 02:35:22.042]  And then you see how it's almost uncoordinated.
[02:35:22.042 --> 02:35:28.685]  It's just, like, nasty, mean, and then they let other corporations that just don't care do whatever they want.
[02:35:28.685 --> 02:35:30.166]  Now, I'm ranting here, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:35:30.166 --> 02:35:32.066]  I'm going to give the number out and take some calls for you.
[02:35:32.066 --> 02:35:32.126]  800-259-9231.
[02:35:32.126 --> 02:35:32.206]  800-259-9231.
[02:35:32.206 --> 02:35:33.447]  We have all of your books.
[02:35:33.447 --> 02:35:34.787]  It's available on the online video bookstore.
[02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:55.652]  At Infowars.com, Genetic Roulette, Seeds of Deception, your film, other films that you've been involved in, great films like The World According to Monsanto, that you think is hardcore, it's very well done, but it's even worse than that.
[02:35:56.733 --> 02:35:57.874]  But I want you to continue.
[02:35:57.874 --> 02:36:02.480]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 on this subject, folks.
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:02.560]  800-259-9231.
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:09.048]  In fact, I should have said this, because the calls will load now, and we won't have any room for others.
[02:36:09.048 --> 02:36:13.913]  I've done this before just by myself and called for farmers to call and said, have you had good luck with GMO?
[02:36:15.961 --> 02:36:18.003]  Or have you had problems?
[02:36:18.003 --> 02:36:31.895]  And every farmer that calls who has livestock says, you feed it to them, they have health problems, they start dying, you start having more calves that die, they're stillborn, more calves you gotta pull.
[02:36:31.895 --> 02:36:34.458]  I'm not gonna get into what that is, but I've worked for a large animal vet and done it.
[02:36:35.726 --> 02:36:36.066]  All of it.
[02:37:05.686 --> 02:37:07.987]  It's an interesting question.
[02:37:07.987 --> 02:37:17.731]  When Obama took his position at the White House, an article came out indicating that he had insisted that his kitchen was organic.
[02:37:17.731 --> 02:37:22.412]  And it came out in the same article that so too did the Bush administration.
[02:37:22.412 --> 02:37:28.915]  That Laura Bush was emphatic that the, would only serve organic, and of course organic means non-GMO.
[02:37:29.715 --> 02:37:44.203]  Now, I talked to a former scientist from Monsanto, and he said that he knew of three colleagues that did safety studies on Monsanto's bovine growth hormone, found so much of the IGF-1 hormone elevated in the milk, and it's linked to cancer.
[02:37:44.203 --> 02:37:49.906]  These three Monsanto scientists refused to drink milk thereafter, unless it was organic.
[02:37:49.906 --> 02:37:50.827]  One bought his own cow.
[02:37:51.764 --> 02:38:09.896]  I also report in Seeds of Deception how the head of the restaurant that's found inside the UK headquarters of Monsanto responded to a request and said, we try to remove as many GMOs as possible because of requests by our customers.
[02:38:09.896 --> 02:38:13.759]  And of course their customers are Monsanto employees.
[02:38:13.759 --> 02:38:20.483]  And someone told me just this year that an insider had actually had lunch with Monsanto employees.
[02:38:20.483 --> 02:38:21.384]  I think it was in England.
[02:38:21.824 --> 02:38:33.838]  Off-site, and they took several people off-site, and he joked, well, we have to be careful, we're getting GMOs, and the guy turned to him very seriously and said, oh, don't worry, we get our food brought in specially, it's organic.
[02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:40.674]  By the way, Jeff, let me just back you up on that, because I actually did a report on this two weeks ago.
[02:38:40.674 --> 02:38:42.816]  I didn't even know that, and I'd read your book.
[02:38:42.816 --> 02:38:44.237]  I must have forgotten it.
[02:38:44.237 --> 02:39:03.153]  But when I was told this by a listener, and I went and checked it, there was BBC, Associated Press, where all of the major Monsanto cafeterias, their engineers at the actual facilities where they make the stuff, not their chemical plants and stuff, all refuse and demand no GMO be allowed.
[02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:06.134]  Then I found articles with the Royal Family do that.
[02:39:06.134 --> 02:39:15.016]  Headlines even in the LA Times and Asia Times where the Chinese Communist elite have, quote, secret gardens and farms and are obsessed with only non-GMO.
[02:39:15.016 --> 02:39:17.257]  I found articles where the German government does it.
[02:39:17.257 --> 02:39:32.061]  I found articles where all over the world and where all of the environmental eugenicists that are pushing this GMO on us, they're obsessed with it and the Rockefellers have chefs, so does Prince Charles, and aircraft that follow them with the entire
[02:39:33.382 --> 02:39:38.206]  Certified, in many cases on their own farms, food that has been gourmet produced.
[02:39:38.206 --> 02:39:42.770]  I mean, they are avoiding it like it's deadly poison.
[02:39:42.770 --> 02:39:47.655]  And then we found out the German government doesn't take vaccines and has special vaccines for themselves.
[02:39:47.655 --> 02:39:49.176]  I mean, you're not, again, I'm backing you up.
[02:39:49.176 --> 02:39:50.077]  You're not just saying this.
[02:39:50.077 --> 02:39:50.658]  Please continue.
[02:39:51.218 --> 02:39:56.201]  Well, you know, one of the issues that you mentioned earlier is GMOs are not isolated.
[02:39:56.201 --> 02:39:57.522]  They cross-pollinate.
[02:39:57.522 --> 02:39:58.242]  They mix.
[02:39:58.242 --> 02:40:04.806]  Even the Roundup is now found in 60 to 100 percent of air, rain, and water samples in the Midwest.
[02:40:04.806 --> 02:40:07.228]  It's found in the urine of urban dwellers.
[02:40:07.228 --> 02:40:09.970]  It's found in cord blood, in human blood.
[02:40:09.970 --> 02:40:12.491]  It's found in surface water and in groundwater.
[02:40:12.491 --> 02:40:16.694]  So it's become omnipresent, like Monsanto's PCBs, their previous poison.
[02:40:17.154 --> 02:40:24.801]  And the GMOs are now, of course, impacting organic and other places by increasing the levels of contamination slowly.
[02:40:24.801 --> 02:40:36.492]  So this begs the question, how stupid can these people be if their intention was to create a problem with GMOs because they'd be sawing off the branch that they're sitting on?
[02:40:36.492 --> 02:40:40.356]  Because we all live in the same biosphere and there is no way to contain it.
[02:40:41.036 --> 02:40:47.540]  Now, one of the ways that we can fight back, Alex, is through required labeling.
[02:40:47.540 --> 02:40:51.722]  And there's a ballot initiative in California on the November ballot.
[02:40:51.722 --> 02:40:58.726]  They're actually gathering petition signatures right now, so if any of your audience lives in California, they can join the effort.
[02:40:58.726 --> 02:41:06.971]  Go to labelgmos.org and get a training on how to fill out petitions with your friends.
[02:41:06.971 --> 02:41:10.013]  So, right now, we have an unprecedented opportunity
[02:41:10.573 --> 02:41:17.584]  To pass a law in California that doesn't have to go through legislators that have been bought off by Monsanto.
[02:41:17.584 --> 02:41:25.415]  And if it gets passed, the food companies realize that 53% of Americans say they would avoid GMOs if labeled.
[02:41:26.016 --> 02:41:30.302]  So these companies would rather remove GMOs than admit that they use them.
[02:41:30.302 --> 02:41:35.749]  They've already removed GMOs in Europe because of a consumer tipping point against GMOs happened there.
[02:41:35.749 --> 02:41:44.140]  They've already removed largely most of the bovine growth hormone from their dairied cows because the consumers became aware of the cancer risk.
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:49.766]  So, if they have to label GMOs, they will probably remove it.
[02:41:49.766 --> 02:42:00.539]  And there's been an upswell now of concern about GMOs, and one of the obvious things is to enforce labeling, which is now enforced in over 50 countries, but not the US or Canada.
[02:42:01.099 --> 02:42:05.722]  So I would encourage the people who are listening, who are in California, to get involved.
[02:42:05.722 --> 02:42:21.813]  And for everyone else, get on our website at responsibletechnology.org and join the Tipping Point Network, which we've organized to do outreach to bring this information to the entire population, particularly the most receptive demographics.
[02:42:22.173 --> 02:42:23.474]  Parents of young kids.
[02:42:23.474 --> 02:42:24.815]  Kids are most at risk.
[02:42:24.815 --> 02:42:32.059]  In fact, in April, we're going to be launching our campaign to protect children against GMOs, which this film is being created for.
[02:42:32.059 --> 02:42:36.662]  We're reaching out to religious groups that believe that GMO really means God move over.
[02:42:36.662 --> 02:42:40.685]  We're reaching out to health conscious shoppers, to health care professionals.
[02:42:40.685 --> 02:42:45.048]  I gave a talk at Andrew Weil's Integrative Medicine Conference in May of last year.
[02:42:45.868 --> 02:43:01.217]  And I asked the eight or nine hundred healthcare practitioners to rate themselves from one to a hundred how vigilant they have been at avoiding GMOs, and they did a show of hands as to how vigilant, and how active they've been at educating their patients to avoid GMOs.
[02:43:01.217 --> 02:43:05.280]  At the beginning of the 45-minute talk, the vigilance was kind of low.
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:23.827]  At the end of the 45-minute talk, nearly everyone was in the highest category of vigilance going forward, saying they were going to avoid GMOs, they were going to prescribe it to their patients, they gave us a standing ovation, they swapped the table for non-GMO shopping guides, which you can get at non-gmo-shopping-guide.com or at the iPhone
[02:43:24.347 --> 02:43:26.969]  App Store, ShopNoGMO.
[02:43:26.969 --> 02:43:28.370]  It's a free download.
[02:43:28.370 --> 02:43:41.620]  So the healthcare professionals are realizing now in larger and larger numbers that GMOs are almost certainly implicated in the rising incidence of disease that they're seeing in their practice.
[02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:43.682]  And now they have something that they can do.
[02:43:43.682 --> 02:43:47.224]  They can recommend non-GMO products, organic products.
[02:43:47.224 --> 02:43:53.509]  And I've interviewed many healthcare practitioners that not only recommend it, but they report that their patients are getting better.
[02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:57.401]  And in my discussions with the patients they are in fact getting better.
[02:43:59.144 --> 02:44:04.645]  Well, that's what we're getting, and I'm trying my best to keep my children away from this stuff.
[02:44:04.645 --> 02:44:25.731]  But the absolute, total proof is that, without even looking, I found more than 10 mainstream articles where the Chinese government, the German government, the UK government, the royalty, Bill and Melinda Gates, Rockefellers, are all Al Gore, obsessed with never eating GMO, while they push it in our face all day.
[02:44:26.511 --> 02:44:30.486]  And it's very obvious what these super wicked people are doing.
[02:44:30.486 --> 02:44:32.554]  And folks, denial is going to get us all killed.
[02:44:33.516 --> 02:44:41.878]  I mean, the honeybees are dying, animals that eat this are getting sick, and how many GMO crops they got coming out?
[02:44:41.878 --> 02:44:44.099]  Because I know there's a whole bunch of companies doing it.
[02:44:44.099 --> 02:44:59.383]  I know it's in the hundreds, but I mean, I've read about tea tree oil and all these other systems and all these grasses, and Gates is saying they're going to release mosquitos that forcibly inoculate us, and he knows best.
[02:45:00.043 --> 02:45:01.964]  Who's going to save us from these lunatics?
[02:45:01.964 --> 02:45:06.585]  I guess ourselves, but they know we're waking up, so now they're counter-strike.
[02:45:06.585 --> 02:45:16.208]  See, you know it's a military operation when, where it's banned in Brazil, they catch these companies secretly leasing property and planting their corn on it to infect everything.
[02:45:16.208 --> 02:45:18.749]  I mean, they act like it's a weapon, because it is.
[02:45:19.977 --> 02:45:24.364]  You're right about the mosquitoes, which most people think is just science fiction.
[02:45:24.364 --> 02:45:35.360]  They've already actually released genetically engineered mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands, in Brazil, in Malaysia, and they're now slated to be released in the Florida Keys.
[02:45:36.261 --> 02:45:53.681]  Now, some leaked documents show that the company that was doing this, a UK operation, worked hard to hide the information that these mosquitoes, which are designed to lower the mosquito population by creating sterile offspring, these are the male mosquitoes that are genetically engineered so they don't bite.
[02:45:54.161 --> 02:45:55.363]  Mosquitoes are here for a reason.
[02:45:55.363 --> 02:45:59.790]  Don't kill off and sterilize one of the lowest levels of the food chain.
[02:45:59.790 --> 02:46:01.253]  That'll destroy the bats.
[02:46:01.253 --> 02:46:02.775]  It'll destroy our own immunity.
[02:46:02.775 --> 02:46:04.899]  Mosquitoes are connected to giving us immunity.
[02:46:04.899 --> 02:46:06.561]  This is pure lunacy!
[02:46:07.648 --> 02:46:14.256]  And I don't want to be the person to do the recall of the GM mosquitoes later on when it turns out that there's problems.
[02:46:14.256 --> 02:46:24.328]  What they tried to hide was that under normal circumstances, up to 3% of their offspring of their supposedly sterile mosquitoes survived.
[02:46:25.029 --> 02:46:29.953]  And that when they're exposed to tetracycline, that number rises to 15%.
[02:46:29.953 --> 02:46:39.381]  Now this means that it's definitely the case that people are going to be bitten by the offspring of Frankenbugs.
[02:46:39.381 --> 02:46:45.446]  And no one has evaluated the health risks of being bitten and having the saliva mixed with your blood.
[02:46:45.486 --> 02:46:47.208]  That's the main use of them.
[02:46:47.208 --> 02:46:49.731]  Of course they're going to survive and bite people.
[02:46:49.731 --> 02:46:56.640]  And like the GMO, or like the Roundup Ready GMO, turn our bacteria into little GMO factories.
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:57.581]  That's the plan.
[02:46:57.581 --> 02:46:58.743]  Of course they're going to live.
[02:46:58.743 --> 02:47:00.245]  They're meant to bite us.
[02:47:00.245 --> 02:47:02.508]  I'm going to love to find out what the Trojan horse is in that.
[02:47:02.808 --> 02:47:04.690]  Guaranteed it'll be infertility.
[02:47:04.690 --> 02:47:07.672]  Or some little nanotech biotech.
[02:47:07.672 --> 02:47:09.674]  That's what that fungoid thing is, I bet.
[02:47:09.674 --> 02:47:12.696]  Because you know they've got that nanotech too, Jeffrey.
[02:47:12.696 --> 02:47:13.537]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:47:13.537 --> 02:47:17.120]  These nutcases are 30 years advanced of what we probably know.
[02:47:18.308 --> 02:47:23.189]  Well, what's happening now, Alex, is we have consumers more and more on our side.
[02:47:23.189 --> 02:47:30.731]  The labeling issue is something that could topple it, but so too can even a small percentage of consumers avoiding GM ingredients.
[02:47:30.731 --> 02:47:32.072]  Here's my thinking.
[02:47:32.072 --> 02:47:44.955]  The same companies like Kraft and Nestle's and Hershey's and McDonald's removed GMOs in Europe because they were a marketing liability, continue to sell them in the United States, where they are not yet a marketing liability.
[02:47:45.576 --> 02:47:49.011]  If we see that there's any drop in market share...
[02:47:49.764 --> 02:47:55.045]  That they can attribute directly to anti-GMO sentiment rising in the U.S.
[02:47:55.045 --> 02:47:57.886]  There's no reason for them to continue to use GMOs.
[02:47:57.886 --> 02:47:59.767]  There's no consumer benefits.
[02:47:59.767 --> 02:48:04.688]  They either drink poisonous herbicide or produce poisonous bug killer.
[02:48:04.688 --> 02:48:14.391]  And so they will immediately rush away from GMOs in the United States like they did within a single week in Europe in late April 1999.
[02:48:16.031 --> 02:48:17.293]  So, we're looking to get...
[02:48:34.611 --> 02:48:44.456]  The minute we stop buying into all their garbage, the minute we get angry and start voting with our purchases, we can overthrow Bill Gates and all this trash in a minute.
[02:48:44.456 --> 02:48:46.177]  But you've got to use your power.
[02:48:46.177 --> 02:48:50.820]  And Jeffrey Smith, there's nobody out there like you, those five-ish people.
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:51.560]  It's got to feel good.
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:53.141]  And I want to have you back up again next week.
[02:48:53.141 --> 02:48:56.663]  But I want to go out to break air and do two more short segments with calls.
[02:48:56.663 --> 02:48:57.904]  Without further ado here.
[02:48:58.944 --> 02:49:00.766]  Hi, how are you today?
[02:49:00.766 --> 02:49:01.687]  It's a fascinating show.
[02:49:01.687 --> 02:49:03.228]  Mr. Jeffrey, I'd like to ask you this.
[02:49:03.228 --> 02:49:06.991]  For a normal kid at the age of 2-3 years old, started school, all of a sudden needed all these vaccinations,
[02:49:26.545 --> 02:49:31.531]  And this mother told me her son slowly began to just withdraw.
[02:49:31.531 --> 02:49:32.772]  He's not even talking.
[02:49:32.772 --> 02:49:35.776]  He just... Yeah, they kill your kids in front of you.
[02:49:35.776 --> 02:49:41.462]  They kill your kid in front of you and tell you you're a kook when your kid's running around talking healthy and is now a zombie.
[02:49:41.462 --> 02:49:42.904]  They're killing them in front of you.
[02:49:42.904 --> 02:49:44.226]  They're murdering scum.
[02:49:44.226 --> 02:49:44.846]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[02:49:44.846 --> 02:49:45.187]  Go ahead.
[02:49:45.187 --> 02:49:45.827]  Ask him the question.
[02:49:46.733 --> 02:49:51.896]  I heard you mention earlier, Alex, about probiotics and colon cleansing.
[02:49:51.896 --> 02:49:54.297]  Is there anything that I can suggest to the mother?
[02:49:54.297 --> 02:50:00.201]  Because this kid now is about six years old and this happened when he was like two or three years old.
[02:50:00.201 --> 02:50:02.762]  Well, look, look, they want to make him a zombie, okay?
[02:50:02.762 --> 02:50:05.844]  So the killers and their little minions that do it.
[02:50:05.844 --> 02:50:07.124]  I'm not going to give medical advice.
[02:50:07.124 --> 02:50:09.446]  I know what the families have done that can reverse some of this.
[02:50:10.287 --> 02:50:14.956]  Now, it does make them behind, but look, they lie to you and say it's the law to take the vaccines.
[02:50:14.956 --> 02:50:17.040]  Right there, they're lying criminals.
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:18.262]  Jeffrey, you got anything to say to her?
[02:50:19.076 --> 02:50:20.716]  Well, I'm not a vaccine expert.
[02:50:20.716 --> 02:50:26.698]  I do have experience talking to people, for example, in the autistic community.
[02:50:26.698 --> 02:50:30.699]  Some people believe that GMOs are a much bigger culprit than the vaccines.
[02:50:30.699 --> 02:50:32.319]  And there's not enough evidence.
[02:50:32.319 --> 02:50:34.420]  And like you say, I can't get medical advice.
[02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:35.580]  I'm not a doctor.
[02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:37.741]  But I do know it's a tragic thing.
[02:50:37.741 --> 02:50:39.661]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[02:50:39.661 --> 02:50:42.282]  I've heard the same stories over and over again.
[02:50:42.282 --> 02:50:47.743]  I can just say, do a lot of research and find the people that have the experience of reversing it.
[02:50:49.226 --> 02:50:50.046]  Yeah, ma'am, stay there.
[02:50:50.046 --> 02:50:51.467]  I want you to have a comeback question.
[02:50:51.467 --> 02:50:52.527]  His Skype's breaking up.
[02:50:52.527 --> 02:50:56.268]  We'll reconnect with Jeffrey Smith, do two more little five-minute segments.
[02:50:56.268 --> 02:50:59.129]  I'm gonna try to get connected back on Skype as well.
[02:50:59.129 --> 02:51:01.650]  We'll be right back, transmitting worldwide.
[02:51:01.650 --> 02:51:06.711]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[02:51:07.031 --> 02:51:13.416]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes.
[02:51:13.416 --> 02:51:18.239]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now.
[02:51:18.239 --> 02:51:21.822]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video.
[02:51:22.022 --> 02:51:37.113]  With inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes, the video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[02:51:37.113 --> 02:51:41.996]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[02:51:41.996 --> 02:51:47.400]  See the video that over 1 million other smart patriots have already seen in the last 4 months.
[02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:48.261]  Prepare now!
[02:51:48.621 --> 02:51:54.483]  Go to 123survivalplan.com and learn which 37 food items you should hoard.
[02:51:54.483 --> 02:51:56.343]  Easy to remember.

[02:51:57.904 --> 02:52:01.325]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:52:01.325 --> 02:52:06.906]  In the past, I've taken a lot of different vitamins, some through health food stores, some that friends recommend.
[02:52:06.906 --> 02:52:09.667]  Colleen, talking about her experience with Super C Veg.
[02:52:09.887 --> 02:52:12.809]  And with the Super C-Veg, I was seeing a lot better results.
[02:52:12.809 --> 02:52:20.074]  Super C-Veg with Vita-D and C-Cal is the most powerful dietary food supplement in the world today, and nothing else comes close.
[02:52:20.074 --> 02:52:23.916]  Super C-Veg is a whole food that makes me feel good.
[02:52:23.916 --> 02:52:26.478]  Think of Super C-Veg as the un-vitamin.
[02:52:26.478 --> 02:52:29.460]  I have taken other things, and they just didn't work.
[02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:30.741]  This seems to work for me.
[02:52:30.741 --> 02:52:33.763]  And Super C-Veg comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee.
[02:52:33.763 --> 02:52:39.627]  Store-bought vitamins do not have the supplement and the full, whole feeling I have from Super C-Veg.

[02:53:01.189 --> 02:53:05.391]  Do you use a CPAP breathing device to help treat sleep apnea and prevent snoring?
[02:53:05.391 --> 02:53:11.215]  If so, you should know big insurance companies and government regulations can affect the way you buy sleep apnea equipment.
[02:53:11.215 --> 02:53:16.097]  They decide what devices you receive, when you get replacement equipment, and even what you pay.
[02:53:16.097 --> 02:53:18.078]  Why limit the quality of your treatment?
[02:53:18.078 --> 02:53:23.041]  Break away from institutionalized healthcare and shop where you set the sleep therapy standard.
[02:53:23.041 --> 02:53:25.002]  Shop at CPAP.com.
[02:53:25.002 --> 02:53:25.683]  See what?
[02:53:25.683 --> 02:53:26.083]  CPAP.
[02:53:26.303 --> 02:53:28.944]  It stands for continuous positive airway pressure.

[02:53:55.217 --> 02:53:55.878]  CPAP.
[02:53:55.878 --> 02:53:56.638]  Your money.
[02:53:56.638 --> 02:53:57.659]  Your treatment.
[02:53:57.659 --> 02:53:58.339]  Your choice.
[02:54:17.156 --> 02:54:21.679]  Okay, uh, Diane, you heard me get angry there, because I just think of the victims everywhere.
[02:54:21.679 --> 02:54:26.362]  They got a three-year-old, they get him in school early, because they can really hurt him good when they're two or three.
[02:54:26.362 --> 02:54:31.105]  They're telling all the mothers, put your kids, uh, in, you know, school, now is the time.
[02:54:31.105 --> 02:54:34.708]  Uh, this stuff just goes on and on.
[02:54:34.708 --> 02:54:46.716]  And then, yeah, I have, I mean, I've heard the stories literally, literally hundreds and hundreds of times in person, where it's a two-year-old, they go in for the third round of shots, have a convulsion, at the doctors many times.
[02:54:47.596 --> 02:54:50.178]  And that's a blessing, because if it happens at home, they try to take your kid from you.
[02:54:50.178 --> 02:54:51.358]  And they go, oh, there's blood on the brain.
[02:54:51.358 --> 02:54:54.400]  Yeah, you just hit me with a hard, you know, weapon here.
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:55.741]  And then they try to take your kids.
[02:54:55.741 --> 02:54:57.562]  But the point is, yes, that's part of it.
[02:54:57.562 --> 02:55:04.666]  The GMO, I mean, now the EPA is saying radiation can be 100,000 times higher in many isotopes, and it's fine for you.
[02:55:04.666 --> 02:55:08.268]  I mean, it's like evil space aliens run things that want to kill us.
[02:55:08.968 --> 02:55:10.709]  through human hosts or something.
[02:55:10.709 --> 02:55:19.596]  And I'm not saying that literally, but that would be plausible in a science fiction world of how evil these people are.
[02:55:19.596 --> 02:55:20.837]  It's not just about profit.
[02:55:20.837 --> 02:55:22.118]  They hate us.
[02:55:22.118 --> 02:55:28.382]  Bayer knew for 10 years they were shipping out stuff to hemophiliacs that had HIV and hepatitis in every shot.
[02:55:28.382 --> 02:55:30.944]  And it came out they knew and quote didn't care.
[02:55:30.944 --> 02:55:32.105]  Well, it's more than didn't care.
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:34.681]  This is sick.
[02:55:34.681 --> 02:55:36.761]  Some kind of sacrifice.
[02:55:36.761 --> 02:55:39.322]  Anything else, Diane, for Jeff Smith?
[02:55:39.322 --> 02:55:40.082]  Okay.
[02:55:40.082 --> 02:55:43.924]  I can't remember what year all this was about with the mad cow disease.
[02:55:43.924 --> 02:55:51.126]  Do you think this Roundup and all these pesticides are linked to that mad cow disease epidemic we had years ago?
[02:55:51.126 --> 02:55:52.386]  Very good point.
[02:55:52.386 --> 02:55:53.867]  Thank you for the call, Jeffrey.
[02:55:54.909 --> 02:56:12.886]  Well it's interesting, I talked to a fellow who used to work at Monsanto and he was there at the time when mad cow disease was a problem and he discovered one of his colleagues told him that they had found new proteins in the cottonseed
[02:56:13.627 --> 02:56:17.089]  In the cotton that was genetically engineered that he was supposed to sell.
[02:56:17.089 --> 02:56:21.971]  Moreover, they were selling this cottonseed cake to dairy cows down the street from him.
[02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:23.191]  And he said, wait a minute.
[02:56:23.191 --> 02:56:25.132]  These new proteins, they were never intended.
[02:56:25.132 --> 02:56:32.715]  They were part of the massive background noise and collateral damage that could occur as a result of this primitive process of genetic engineering.
[02:56:32.715 --> 02:56:38.818]  Shouldn't we characterize these proteins and make sure that they're not prions or might cause some kind of mad cow disease?
[02:56:39.378 --> 02:56:48.362]  Well, first of all, the people at Monsanto, these PhDs, had never heard of mad cow disease, even though a Nobel Prize was awarded a few months later.
[02:56:48.362 --> 02:56:54.245]  But they said, I'm sorry, we've always fed the products of our trials to animals, and we're not going to stop.
[02:56:54.625 --> 02:56:55.966]  So he was very agitated.
[02:56:55.966 --> 02:57:00.169]  He tried to blow the whistle and was ostracized from within Monsanto.
[02:57:00.169 --> 02:57:02.470]  And then he tried to blow the whistle outside of Monsanto.
[02:57:02.470 --> 02:57:04.612]  He told agriculture commissioners.
[02:57:04.612 --> 02:57:06.513]  He told university professors.
[02:57:06.513 --> 02:57:08.454]  He told me their eyes just glazed over.
[02:57:08.454 --> 02:57:13.978]  They had no idea of the potential problems that could happen with the genetic engineering.
[02:57:13.978 --> 02:57:16.420]  Well, he left the company and went and became a chiropractor.
[02:57:16.420 --> 02:57:19.542]  And now he took our speaker training and he's speaking against GMOs.
[02:57:19.542 --> 02:57:24.285]  In fact, he will be on a panel together at the Health Freedom Expo in Long Beach in early March.
[02:57:24.945 --> 02:57:47.558]  However, it turns out when I looked into this with a professor who was an expert at these proteins, he didn't think that these proteins that might be created from the genetic engineering process would likely have anything to do with prions, because prions are out-of-control animal proteins that affect animal health, and these proteins that are produced in plants would be different.
[02:57:48.038 --> 02:57:55.263]  So, there is not a direct understanding or correlation with GMOs right now and mad cow disease.
[02:57:55.263 --> 02:58:04.049]  That shows how crazy they are feeding rotten dead cows and goats and sheep to cows who are herbivores and aren't meant to eat meat.
[02:58:04.049 --> 02:58:05.611]  Let's jam in one more call.
[02:58:05.611 --> 02:58:06.811]  Roger in Texas.
[02:58:06.811 --> 02:58:07.792]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:58:07.792 --> 02:58:08.232]  Go ahead.
[02:58:08.232 --> 02:58:11.795]  Hey, how are y'all today?
[02:58:11.795 --> 02:58:12.295]  Good.
[02:58:12.295 --> 02:58:15.738]  I want to commend y'all both on all the work that y'all have been doing.
[02:58:16.658 --> 02:58:19.760]  You, Alex, on just everything under the sun.
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:26.306]  And Jeffrey, I accidentally found your videos on GMOs about two years ago.
[02:58:26.306 --> 02:58:30.349]  And they've been an eye-opening experience.
[02:58:30.349 --> 02:58:36.674]  I live in the heart of Texas here where corn is king.
[02:58:36.674 --> 02:58:37.654]  Hold on, we're coming back.
[02:58:37.654 --> 02:58:40.236]  I'm gonna have you finish up a few more calls and we'll rock well.
[02:58:40.236 --> 02:58:44.339]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.434 --> 02:58:51.797]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.797 --> 02:58:54.718]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[02:58:54.718 --> 02:58:58.400]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:01.462]  Number 10, the food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[02:59:01.462 --> 02:59:04.064]  Number 9, the eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[02:59:04.064 --> 02:59:07.365]  8, eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[02:59:07.365 --> 02:59:10.227]  7, most of these meals cost less than $2.
[02:59:10.227 --> 02:59:13.449]  6, with their large variety, I can eat it every day.
[02:59:14.529 --> 02:59:17.712]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[02:59:17.712 --> 02:59:21.696]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[02:59:21.696 --> 02:59:25.079]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[02:59:25.079 --> 02:59:29.383]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[02:59:29.383 --> 02:59:35.249]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[02:59:35.589 --> 02:59:36.530]  Folks, don't wait.
[02:59:36.530 --> 02:59:37.790]  Get prepared now.
[02:59:37.790 --> 02:59:39.752]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[02:59:39.752 --> 02:59:44.855]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[02:59:44.855 --> 02:59:52.419]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:52.419 --> 02:59:53.960]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.960 --> 02:59:56.001]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.001 --> 02:59:59.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:11.460 --> 03:00:20.507]  You know, I haven't even told the story, and I meant to do it today, about speaking in Dallas last Sunday, and I took probably 30 questions or more after my speech.
[03:00:20.507 --> 03:00:27.952]  And like six or seven of them were people that were young people, young, healthy folks that were all of a sudden getting sick and almost dying.
[03:00:27.952 --> 03:00:34.577]  When they learned to get off GMO, stop drinking aspartame, the doctors were saying, get ready to be in a wheelchair, get ready to have this done, get ready to have that done.
[03:00:34.577 --> 03:00:35.817]  Suddenly they just got completely better.
[03:00:35.817 --> 03:00:39.040]  And they said, your radio show and the guests you have saved us.
[03:00:40.199 --> 03:00:44.403]  I mean, folks, I don't tell you something unless I've researched it, and I'm upset about it.
[03:00:44.403 --> 03:00:46.224]  And I think it's something you should be warned about.
[03:00:46.224 --> 03:00:50.428]  That's what real public service is about, and it's not because I'm some great guy either.
[03:00:50.428 --> 03:00:51.689]  This is affecting us all.
[03:00:51.689 --> 03:00:55.452]  I'm angry about being assaulted by a bunch of global control freaks.
[03:00:55.452 --> 03:00:59.635]  Roger, real fast, because I'm going to jam in a few more, and I appreciate you holding.
[03:00:59.635 --> 03:01:02.117]  You were saying we're here in Central Texas.
[03:01:02.117 --> 03:01:02.798]  Oh, he dropped off.
[03:01:02.798 --> 03:01:04.219]  I wanted to hear the story.
[03:01:04.219 --> 03:01:06.421]  Elliot in California.
[03:01:06.421 --> 03:01:06.661]  Go ahead.
[03:01:06.661 --> 03:01:07.642]  You're on the air with Jeffrey Smith.
[03:01:09.701 --> 03:01:10.182]  California.
[03:01:10.182 --> 03:01:11.703]  Yeah, California.
[03:01:11.703 --> 03:01:12.124]  Thank you.
[03:01:12.124 --> 03:01:12.864]  Okay.
[03:01:12.864 --> 03:01:13.785]  I have something.
[03:01:13.785 --> 03:01:17.629]  I've been meaning to call for a year and this is really important.
[03:01:17.629 --> 03:01:23.295]  In 2005 and 2006, I went to Romania five times.
[03:01:23.295 --> 03:01:25.337]  I was living over there more than here.
[03:01:25.337 --> 03:01:29.422]  I'm a baby boomer with developing arthritis in my fingers.
[03:01:29.422 --> 03:01:32.365]  When I went over there for the first time for a month,
[03:01:33.209 --> 03:01:37.091]  And I was with three other Americans, and we were drinking like fish and partying.
[03:01:37.091 --> 03:01:42.934]  I lost 11 pounds in one month, and the arthritis in my fingers disappeared.
[03:01:42.934 --> 03:01:44.895]  I came back to the United States.
[03:01:44.895 --> 03:01:48.877]  I didn't have a clue as to what was going on, but I said, is it the food?
[03:01:48.877 --> 03:01:49.757]  Is it chemicals?
[03:01:49.757 --> 03:01:50.898]  Pesticides?
[03:01:50.898 --> 03:01:52.499]  I went back four more times.
[03:01:52.959 --> 03:01:55.321]  Each time I went back, I lose weight.
[03:01:55.321 --> 03:01:58.723]  Over there, people are very thin until about 50 years old.
[03:01:58.723 --> 03:02:03.467]  The French smoke cigarettes, eat like pigs, and don't look like us.
[03:02:03.467 --> 03:02:05.008]  No, everybody's pointing this out.
[03:02:05.008 --> 03:02:11.553]  Anywhere you bring GMO in with any mammal, they turn into these lethargic creatures.
[03:02:11.553 --> 03:02:12.714]  Incredible point, Jeff.
[03:02:12.714 --> 03:02:14.255]  We see this a lot, don't we?
[03:02:14.375 --> 03:02:24.078]  Yes, in fact in my last newsletter I asked people to email us at healthy at responsible technology dot org to describe just those type of changes.
[03:02:24.078 --> 03:02:34.181]  No one in the world is monitoring this and so we decided to take the responsibility to see what kind of changes are occurring in people when they switch from GM and non-GM.
[03:02:34.181 --> 03:02:39.443]  Sometimes it's going between organic and non-organic, sometimes it's going between the United States and Europe.
[03:02:39.443 --> 03:02:43.804]  So thank you for that excellent description and please send us a copy of your description written up.
[03:02:45.211 --> 03:02:45.973]  Amazing.
[03:02:45.973 --> 03:02:46.735]  Final comments, sir.
[03:02:47.583 --> 03:02:50.184]  Yeah, so let me just tell what happened.
[03:02:50.184 --> 03:02:56.365]  So what I did was, and you just mentioned it, and I just started this like about a month ago.
[03:02:56.365 --> 03:03:00.206]  I was taking one probiotic once a week, and then I started taking it every day.
[03:03:00.206 --> 03:03:06.687]  I was taking ginger and turmeric for my fingers, because I don't take any painkillers and stuff, and I'm a guitarist.
[03:03:06.687 --> 03:03:16.589]  So what happened was, I stopped taking turmeric and the ginger, and 80% of the arthritis in my fingers is gone because I'm taking probiotics every day.
[03:03:18.377 --> 03:03:24.960]  It's got to be, it's changing the biology in your intestine.
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:26.621]  It's knocking out what Bill Gates and co.
[03:03:26.621 --> 03:03:27.142]  put in there.
[03:03:27.142 --> 03:03:28.382]  I'm sorry, go ahead Jeff.
[03:03:28.382 --> 03:03:33.465]  There are many reasons why our gut bacteria is probably compromised by eating GMOs.
[03:03:33.465 --> 03:03:39.248]  We've already talked about the transfer of genes into our gut bacteria, which is probably occurring in a wide scale.
[03:03:39.688 --> 03:03:45.469]  But also we eat products that have residues of Roundup, and Roundup is an antibiotic.
[03:03:45.469 --> 03:03:46.890]  It kills bacteria.
[03:03:46.890 --> 03:03:51.070]  So if we eat it, it destroys some of the bacteria that's in our gut.
[03:03:51.070 --> 03:04:02.993]  But if some of the genes transferred from soybeans, making Roundup-ready gut bacteria, then they would have a survival advantage, and so we might have a colonization of these frankenbacteria inside our gut.
[03:04:03.553 --> 03:04:05.434]  And there's many other ways that I don't want to go into it.
[03:04:05.434 --> 03:04:06.555]  They're too technical.
[03:04:06.555 --> 03:04:12.078]  Why GMOs might be causing a huge disruption of this very important aspect of our health.
[03:04:12.078 --> 03:04:17.501]  There are ten times the number of cells in our body as gut bacteria than the cells of our body.
[03:04:17.501 --> 03:04:19.562]  They're part of our immune system and our digestive system.
[03:04:19.582 --> 03:04:24.006]  We've got to bomb them with good, old-fashioned, wide-spectrum, healthy bacteria.
[03:04:24.006 --> 03:04:29.892]  We've got to bomb the Monsanto, enemy colonies, and other GMO colonies out of our guts.
[03:04:29.892 --> 03:04:31.013]  And once a week isn't enough.
[03:04:31.013 --> 03:04:31.754]  That's what I've been doing.
[03:04:31.754 --> 03:04:33.536]  I'm going on it every day.
[03:04:33.536 --> 03:04:34.977]  I'm going to annihilate the enemy.
[03:04:34.977 --> 03:04:36.199]  I'm going to lose the weight.
[03:04:36.199 --> 03:04:36.939]  I'm going to get healthy.
[03:04:36.939 --> 03:04:37.820]  I'm going to live longer.
[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:38.501]  I'm going to win.
[03:04:38.501 --> 03:04:41.384]  The eugenicists that hate life and hate us all are not going to win.
[03:04:41.784 --> 03:04:45.327]  Jeffery Smith, all your books and videos are available at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:45.327 --> 03:04:46.287]  Incredible job.
[03:04:46.287 --> 03:04:47.288]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:47.288 --> 03:04:49.530]  Let's get you back up in the next month if you'll do it.
[03:04:49.530 --> 03:04:50.130]  God bless you.
[03:04:50.130 --> 03:04:52.532]  All right, we're going to come back with Lou Rockwell.
[03:04:52.532 --> 03:04:54.973]  Is Ron Paul going to run with Mitt Romney?
[03:04:54.973 --> 03:04:55.514]  Stay with us.
[03:04:55.514 --> 03:04:56.454]  We'll talk about it.
[03:04:56.454 --> 03:04:56.915]  Straight ahead.
[03:05:01.698 --> 03:05:10.385]  I'd seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[03:05:10.385 --> 03:05:14.588]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[03:05:14.588 --> 03:05:18.291]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[03:05:18.291 --> 03:05:21.793]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[03:05:21.793 --> 03:05:23.915]  37 pounds in two months.
[03:05:24.395 --> 03:05:27.898]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[03:05:27.898 --> 03:05:36.764]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[03:05:36.764 --> 03:05:37.965]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[03:05:37.965 --> 03:05:42.228]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly believe in.
[03:05:42.228 --> 03:05:48.312]  And the amazing supplements available at infowarsteam.com have certainly delivered my life.
[03:05:48.312 --> 03:05:49.373]  I hope you'll give them a try.
[03:05:49.753 --> 03:05:51.253]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:05:51.253 --> 03:05:55.155]  Did you know that Russian fighter jets have joined with Venezuela in training?
[03:06:09.899 --> 03:06:16.602]  Did you know that the Russian destroyers held training exercises with Venezuela?
[03:06:16.602 --> 03:06:24.645]  Did you know that those Russian destroyers sailed into Cuba in 2010 to hold training exercises?
[03:06:24.645 --> 03:06:29.027]  Lenin said they would surround the United States and it would fall.
[03:06:29.027 --> 03:06:31.308]  Is the United States being surrounded?
[03:06:31.308 --> 03:06:34.530]  This would be their third stage for world domination.
[03:06:35.390 --> 03:06:35.810]  We're good to go.
[03:07:01.448 --> 03:07:02.489]  George Washington said,
[03:07:18.809 --> 03:07:21.430]  If we are to be successful in saving our country.
[03:07:21.430 --> 03:07:28.513]  America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one-world government.
[03:07:28.513 --> 03:07:32.735]  The God-given, unalienable rights of the Declaration of Independence are in jeopardy.
[03:07:32.735 --> 03:07:35.556]  We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men.
[03:07:35.956 --> 03:07:41.961]  Utopia Silver Supplements believes it is our God-given right to make our own health care decisions however we deem best.

[03:08:01.601 --> 03:08:07.005]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.005 --> 03:08:09.287]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:14.133 --> 03:08:16.374]  Alright, it is Thursday.
[03:08:16.374 --> 03:08:23.819]  Of course, we are broadcasting worldwide here on this 23rd day of February 2012.
[03:08:23.819 --> 03:08:27.041]  And it's all over the Washington Post.
[03:08:27.041 --> 03:08:29.123]  It's on hundreds of papers today.
[03:08:29.123 --> 03:08:35.126]  The system is pushing the idea that Ron Paul might run as a VP with Mitt Romney.
[03:08:35.126 --> 03:08:35.307]  Now,
[03:08:36.307 --> 03:08:38.248]  Listeners are horrified by this idea.
[03:08:38.248 --> 03:08:40.870]  Ron Paul's a man of total integrity.
[03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:42.951]  Look at his voting record.
[03:08:42.951 --> 03:08:47.493]  Rand Paul, another great guy of total integrity, done everything he said he'd do once he got to Congress.
[03:08:47.493 --> 03:08:52.957]  You know, guest on the show, loves freedom, stands up against all this corruption.
[03:08:53.997 --> 03:09:01.779]  But I have seen some of the campaign people be like, oh, of course, you know, it'd be great to have Rand Paul as a VP.
[03:09:01.779 --> 03:09:04.559]  And then Rand's nice and says, well, it'd be an honor to be considered.
[03:09:04.559 --> 03:09:07.260]  But I think that's more of a gentlemanly thing he's saying.
[03:09:07.260 --> 03:09:10.880]  He wouldn't be considerate if he wouldn't say that he'd go along with whatever their agenda is.
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:13.161]  And Ron Paul and Rand Paul aren't going to compromise.
[03:09:13.161 --> 03:09:15.121]  So I'm saying it isn't going to happen.
[03:09:15.121 --> 03:09:19.442]  But people are saying, well, don't leave the political spoils for Liberty.
[03:09:20.622 --> 03:09:39.215]  If they steal the elections, and this is far from over, but they have stolen a few states, obviously now, in Iowa and Maine are no-brainers, where they just have thrown out the Iowa election, and then now in Maine they're saying, yeah, we didn't count all these counties that were 2-1 for Ron Paul in some areas, other areas double-digit leads, but we're not saying what we're going to do.
[03:09:39.215 --> 03:09:40.436]  Just don't worry about it.
[03:09:40.436 --> 03:09:49.323]  We're so broke back now as a nation accepting the corruption, not my listeners, not freedom lovers, but some of the public, that it's kind of like not even an issue now.
[03:09:50.063 --> 03:10:08.656]  So we're going to believe that Mitt Romney, who steals elections and does all this, and funded by Goldman Sachs like Obama, this globalist, this New World Order stooge, who wrote Obamacare and supports carbon taxes, we're going to believe that this guy would ever have Ron Paul in there?
[03:10:08.656 --> 03:10:17.463]  Now I could see, I guess, if he said to Ron Paul, you can do whatever you want, speaking or whatever as Vice President, then I'd say, okay, if he doesn't win, let him be VP.
[03:10:18.220 --> 03:10:19.861]  But they're not going to do that.
[03:10:19.861 --> 03:10:29.367]  This is higher-ups talking to people in his campaign who know they're not going to have a job in a year if Ron Paul doesn't win, he's going to leave the House, who are believing this.
[03:10:29.367 --> 03:10:33.670]  I've seen some of them out there basically saying nice things about Romney.
[03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:35.451]  I'm not saying they're bad people.
[03:10:35.451 --> 03:10:36.232]  It's just that
[03:10:37.252 --> 03:10:39.232]  You don't join with Soran.
[03:10:39.232 --> 03:10:40.893]  You don't join with Darth Vader.
[03:10:40.893 --> 03:10:42.273]  You join with Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[03:10:42.273 --> 03:10:43.773]  That's Ron Paul.
[03:10:43.773 --> 03:10:46.334]  It's the idea that's valuable of liberty.
[03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:47.534]  We're not the extremists.
[03:10:47.534 --> 03:10:48.574]  The globalists are.
[03:10:48.574 --> 03:10:49.795]  They call us dangerous.
[03:10:49.795 --> 03:10:54.856]  They're the dangerous ones trying to deploat our economy and cause World War III draconian capitalism.
[03:10:54.856 --> 03:11:05.598]  Now, in this segment and one more short segment at the bottom of the hour, we're joined by, and I appreciate him coming on on short notice, Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com, probably the biggest libertarian website on the web.
[03:11:06.607 --> 03:11:07.067]  I don't know.
[03:11:29.253 --> 03:11:31.637]  Uh, to cover up their crony takeover operation.
[03:11:31.637 --> 03:11:33.219]  He knows the real Ron Paul.
[03:11:33.219 --> 03:11:38.327]  And so I've, I mean, I was getting thousands of emails, phone calls, comments, freak outs.
[03:11:38.327 --> 03:11:40.190]  I told you a month ago they were going to push this.
[03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:41.492]  I think the Washington Post.
[03:11:42.415 --> 03:11:50.219]  There's a way to make it look like Ron Paul is establishment, and there's a way to cause more infighting, and there's a way to make it look like, well, will he take a VP?
[03:11:50.219 --> 03:11:52.280]  He's out of the race.
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:56.502]  And I think the campaign should come out strongly and say, we're not taking a VP.
[03:11:56.502 --> 03:12:04.406]  But then others will say, oh, well, then you're just leaving, you know, the libertarian constitutionalist vote unspoken for.
[03:12:04.406 --> 03:12:07.187]  No, we're not sullying ourselves.
[03:12:07.187 --> 03:12:08.327]  So they put something in the
[03:12:09.548 --> 03:12:09.668]  Yes.
[03:12:24.785 --> 03:12:30.067]  Omnibudsman of libertarian freedom thought, Lou Rockwell, on to give us his perspective.
[03:12:30.067 --> 03:12:31.707]  I haven't found out what he thinks yet.
[03:12:31.707 --> 03:12:33.267]  I'm going to find out right now.
[03:12:33.267 --> 03:12:34.708]  I've put my cards on the table.
[03:12:34.708 --> 03:12:39.949]  Lou, what do you say about what I've said, and what's your gut on this, and what's the inside baseball on this subject?
[03:12:39.949 --> 03:12:42.530]  Because I haven't been able to get Ron on in the last month or so.
[03:12:43.217 --> 03:12:48.280]  Well Alex, remember I'm not a spokesman for Ron or for the campaign, so I'm just giving you my own view.
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:49.340]  But I think it's all a trick.
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:54.984]  It's just another establishment trick to make it look like Ron Paul is just a sellout like all the rest of them.
[03:12:54.984 --> 03:12:56.745]  Ron Paul has never sold out.
[03:12:56.745 --> 03:12:58.626]  Ron Paul will never sell out.
[03:12:58.626 --> 03:13:01.427]  And so this has two pieces.
[03:13:01.427 --> 03:13:07.231]  You said to bring down Ron Paul to make him seem like he's just one of the regular criminal bunch.
[03:13:07.231 --> 03:13:09.852]  And the other is to make Ron Paul supporters like Ron
[03:13:10.092 --> 03:13:14.394]  Well, if he's willing to consider Ron Paul as a VP, Romney must be a pretty good guy.
[03:13:14.394 --> 03:13:17.616]  Well, it was Romney, exactly like Gingrich and Santorum.
[03:13:17.616 --> 03:13:24.019]  Even though Romney's a more pleasant person, and I'm sure his wife is a nice person, his kids are nice, and all those kinds of questions.
[03:13:24.019 --> 03:13:27.521]  But really, he's, as you say, he's a globalist.
[03:13:27.521 --> 03:13:28.902]  He's a big government guy.
[03:13:28.902 --> 03:13:34.945]  He believes in corporatism and fascism and the partnership between big government and big business.
[03:13:34.945 --> 03:13:35.725]  He's a warmonger.
[03:13:35.725 --> 03:13:36.626]  He's an imperialist.
[03:13:37.306 --> 03:13:41.290]  Uh, he's a protectionist, he's a big government guy, big spender, bail out the banks.
[03:13:41.290 --> 03:13:43.492]  I mean, he's bad on virtually everything.
[03:13:43.492 --> 03:13:47.255]  I guess, you know, he was against the bailout of GM.
[03:13:47.255 --> 03:13:51.659]  But my guess is if he were president, he would have done it and he would have made a lot of money out of it, because that's the kind of guy he is.
[03:13:51.659 --> 03:13:53.861]  He makes a lot of money out of government projects.
[03:13:54.622 --> 03:13:59.743]  So no, I think this is just another trick, and they would never let Ron Paul be Vice President.
[03:13:59.743 --> 03:14:07.526]  Ron Paul has a chance, we all hope and pray, to push his way into office by the people putting him there.
[03:14:07.526 --> 03:14:12.127]  However, the idea that the regime would invite him into office is just science fiction.
[03:14:13.482 --> 03:14:20.706]  Now, Lou, I'm just speechless hearing you break this down because I totally concur with you.
[03:14:20.706 --> 03:14:21.687]  It's so obvious.
[03:14:21.687 --> 03:14:24.228]  I wanted to make sure that my instincts were right.
[03:14:24.228 --> 03:14:30.091]  How do we interpret, then, this latest activity?
[03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:36.235]  Is this another sign of desperation from the establishment trying to behave like, hey, we like Ron Paul, too?
[03:14:37.093 --> 03:14:40.435]  Well, it is, but it also is a sign of fear.
[03:14:40.435 --> 03:14:47.878]  Because even though, of course, every time Ron made this point last night, every time there's a story about him, the first line is always, of course, he can't win.
[03:14:47.878 --> 03:14:49.879]  Well, of course he can win.
[03:14:49.879 --> 03:14:53.221]  He is like the tortoise accumulating the delegates.
[03:14:53.221 --> 03:14:56.882]  Especially if it's a brokered convention, he could have a very important role to play.
[03:14:56.882 --> 03:14:58.683]  They want to diminish him.
[03:14:58.683 --> 03:15:00.104]  They want to smear him.
[03:15:00.104 --> 03:15:01.104]  And this is smear number 185.
[03:15:01.104 --> 03:15:04.586]  And I'm sure there'll be others to come.
[03:15:04.586 --> 03:15:05.326]  It's just another trick.
[03:15:06.787 --> 03:15:11.829]  So, they're not going to ask him to be Vice President.
[03:15:11.829 --> 03:15:13.329]  It's just not going to happen.
[03:15:13.329 --> 03:15:23.733]  Now, if we go back to the original days of the American Republic and the way the Constitution was originally written, the President and the Vice President were supposed to be antagonists.
[03:15:23.733 --> 03:15:27.234]  Because the Vice President was the man who came in second in the presidential election.
[03:15:27.984 --> 03:15:31.145]  That's the way the Founders wrote the Constitution originally.
[03:15:31.145 --> 03:15:41.708]  So, if we think of that, you know, it would be, if Ron were to go in there and fight hammer and tongs from the Vice Presidents against everything the President was doing, that would be pretty great.
[03:15:41.708 --> 03:15:47.530]  But, we can really only have to state that to realize there's no way in heck that they would allow Ron Paul to play that role.
[03:15:49.434 --> 03:15:56.339]  Well, that's exactly what I said earlier, and it's not because you and I are reading from the same, you know, song sheets, because it's common sense.
[03:15:56.339 --> 03:15:57.920]  It's our American system.
[03:15:57.920 --> 03:16:01.483]  It's our constitutional republic.
[03:16:01.483 --> 03:16:03.744]  But, yeah, they are putting us out there as a wedge.
[03:16:03.744 --> 03:16:05.946]  Now, Rand is a great guy, obviously.
[03:16:05.946 --> 03:16:07.387]  Chip off the old block.
[03:16:07.387 --> 03:16:08.868]  He's done what he said he would do in the Senate.
[03:16:08.868 --> 03:16:10.169]  We're proud of him.
[03:16:10.169 --> 03:16:11.870]  But he's being a little too gentlemanly.
[03:16:12.310 --> 03:16:14.291]  And it's okay for us to give them advice.
[03:16:14.291 --> 03:16:15.011]  They're not God.
[03:16:15.011 --> 03:16:16.212]  None of us are.
[03:16:16.212 --> 03:16:17.993]  And they like advice.
[03:16:17.993 --> 03:16:28.838]  But whenever he was asked, would you take a VP slot for one of the other Republicans, he said, well, it'd be a great honor to be considered.
[03:16:28.838 --> 03:16:34.421]  And I think by great honor, to be considered for VP, well, it is an honor when you think about the American system.
[03:16:34.421 --> 03:16:38.162]  But I would say, no, I wouldn't from the other candidates.
[03:16:38.162 --> 03:16:39.123]  I can't compromise.
[03:16:39.663 --> 03:16:41.085]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[03:16:41.085 --> 03:16:45.790]  And then I think what gives some fuel to this concern, I think Ron Paul needs to say something about it soon.
[03:16:45.790 --> 03:16:53.339]  I saw this a month ago, where Jesse Benton told the Dallas Morning News.
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:17:02.667]  That any Republican should be looking at Rand Paul as a potential running mate because he's the smartest guy in the room and he has tremendous credibility with conservatives.
[03:17:02.667 --> 03:17:04.648]  So these are the type of quotes out there.
[03:17:04.648 --> 03:17:10.353]  We don't want to give our credibility to somebody like Mitt Romney who we know is bought and paid for by the bad guys.
[03:17:10.353 --> 03:17:11.734]  This is going to destroy our credibility.
[03:17:12.094 --> 03:17:15.778]  And I guess it's a difference of thought processes, but I would imagine you would agree.
[03:17:15.778 --> 03:17:16.699]  I'm not attacking Benton.
[03:17:16.699 --> 03:17:17.239]  I've interviewed him.
[03:17:17.239 --> 03:17:18.300]  He's a nice guy.
[03:17:18.300 --> 03:17:19.601]  A smart guy, I'm sure.
[03:17:19.601 --> 03:17:25.767]  But this idea that we're going to co-opt them instead of them co-opting us, that's just not how this works.
[03:17:25.767 --> 03:17:28.910]  Their system's in the verge of coming down right now.
[03:17:28.910 --> 03:17:31.833]  This isn't when we want to merge with these people.
[03:17:31.833 --> 03:17:33.415]  I mean, what's your take on that?
[03:17:33.815 --> 03:17:38.356]  Well, Romney, I guess, is a more gentlemanly guy than Santorum or Gingrich.
[03:17:38.356 --> 03:17:39.757]  That wouldn't be hard.
[03:17:39.757 --> 03:17:42.597]  I'm sure he's a more pleasant guy.
[03:17:42.597 --> 03:17:46.138]  But he's a monster.
[03:17:46.138 --> 03:17:50.820]  Just because he looks good in a suit doesn't mean he's anything but one of the top creeps.
[03:17:50.820 --> 03:17:55.481]  Otherwise, he wouldn't be supported by the Republican establishment and by the establishment in general.
[03:17:55.481 --> 03:17:58.502]  So, no, we don't want anything to do with him except to oppose him.
[03:17:58.502 --> 03:17:59.822]  Oppose him as a candidate.
[03:17:59.822 --> 03:18:02.883]  Oppose him if, God forbid, he becomes president.
[03:18:04.599 --> 03:18:06.420]  Well, I'm going to be honest.
[03:18:06.420 --> 03:18:12.043]  I could care less about the star stuff of politics, Hollywood, all that, because I've been there, I've seen it, I've done it.
[03:18:12.043 --> 03:18:16.425]  And I don't get critical of some of the people that advise Ron Paul, because I know he runs the show at the end of the day.
[03:18:16.425 --> 03:18:18.407]  He's got to have helpers.
[03:18:18.407 --> 03:18:22.729]  But, I mean, I look at people like you and others I've seen that have worked for Paul who are so 100% dead on laser beam.
[03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:31.133]  And then I see some of the other stuff coming out from these younger folks, and I think they should be sitting at your feet and Ron Paul's feet.
[03:18:31.133 --> 03:18:33.714]  Instead, every time I look, they're advising him.
[03:18:33.714 --> 03:18:36.976]  I see Ron saying, I'm getting advice from my staff.
[03:18:36.976 --> 03:18:38.297]  You're getting advice?
[03:18:38.297 --> 03:18:39.337]  You're getting advice?
[03:18:39.337 --> 03:18:48.942]  I mean, again, I'm not trying to get into inside baseball or infighting here, but I mean, why isn't Lou Rockwell in the campaign advising?
[03:18:50.580 --> 03:18:54.123]  Well, I've had enough of that.
[03:18:54.123 --> 03:18:59.467]  I've done real politics, by which I mean evil politics.
[03:18:59.467 --> 03:19:05.952]  I've worked for regular Republicans, really starting since I worked for Barry Goldwater when he ran for president.
[03:19:05.952 --> 03:19:07.053]  I had the great honor to work for him.
[03:19:07.053 --> 03:19:10.676]  You have a long history publishing true activism, so you're sick of it.
[03:19:11.482 --> 03:19:19.270]  Well, I must say, even though, of course, I make an exception for Ron Paul, because he is the exception with a capital E, I must say I don't like politics.
[03:19:19.270 --> 03:19:20.572]  I don't like the political system.
[03:19:20.572 --> 03:19:22.093]  I think it's corrupt.
[03:19:22.093 --> 03:19:24.936]  And Ron Paul's like the minister in the whorehouse.
[03:19:24.936 --> 03:19:29.441]  I mean, he stands apart from the rest of these guys.
[03:19:31.443 --> 03:19:37.596]  Nobody is going to advise him successfully to cut back on his views, to say something he doesn't believe.
[03:19:37.596 --> 03:19:41.143]  He's a straight arrow, he's the real deal, and we can trust him 100%.
[03:19:42.808 --> 03:19:43.148]  Stay there.
[03:19:43.148 --> 03:19:45.410]  Let's come back and talk about some positive areas then.
[03:19:45.410 --> 03:19:47.991]  But absolutely, this is the end of the day statement.
[03:19:47.991 --> 03:19:52.654]  If it doesn't come out of Ron Paul's mouth, it isn't attributable to him.
[03:19:52.654 --> 03:19:53.495]  Period.
[03:19:53.495 --> 03:19:54.336]  Period.
[03:19:54.336 --> 03:19:55.476]  He speaks for Ron Paul.
[03:19:55.476 --> 03:19:56.857]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:19:56.857 --> 03:20:07.544]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:20:07.544 --> 03:20:08.405]  InfoWars.com.
[03:20:09.145 --> 03:20:09.485]  I don't know.
[03:20:25.996 --> 03:20:29.498]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:20:29.498 --> 03:20:35.641]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:20:35.641 --> 03:20:45.526]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:20:45.526 --> 03:20:47.027]  The war is here.
[03:20:47.027 --> 03:20:48.928]  It's an info war.
[03:20:48.928 --> 03:20:50.549]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:20:55.091 --> 03:20:57.373]  Think the national debt is $15 trillion?
[03:20:57.373 --> 03:21:08.321]  Boston U Economics Professor Lawrence Kotlikoff astutely points out that after factoring in guarantees such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and defense expenditures, the national debt is closer to $211 trillion.
[03:21:08.321 --> 03:21:11.364]  Mathematically, this debt is not serviceable via taxation.
[03:21:11.364 --> 03:21:14.446]  And for politicians on Capitol Hill, default is not an option.
[03:21:14.446 --> 03:21:20.471]  So we can expect the Federal Reserve to monetize the shortfall resulting in even more confiscation of our hard-earned savings via inflation.
[03:21:20.471 --> 03:21:21.792]  Hi, my name is Adam Miller with
[03:21:21.892 --> 03:21:22.992]  Midas Resources.
[03:21:22.992 --> 03:21:32.495]  In light of the MF Global Swindle, it is now more apparent than ever that our savings investments are not secure in the hands of traditional banking institutions overseen by government technocrats kept in their back pockets.
[03:21:32.495 --> 03:21:42.297]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 extension 148 to find out how you can protect your savings from confiscation with liquid, portable, and private precious metals.
[03:21:42.577 --> 03:21:45.839]  I'll even send you a booklet titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold to serve as a guide.
[03:21:45.839 --> 03:21:50.983]  That number again is 800-686-2237, extension 148.
[03:21:50.983 --> 03:21:54.926]  800-686-2237, extension 148.
[03:21:54.926 --> 03:21:57.267]  What is the most abundant resource on Earth?
[03:21:57.267 --> 03:21:57.808]  Water.
[03:21:57.808 --> 03:22:01.230]  It's essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available.
[03:22:01.230 --> 03:22:07.895]  When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves, like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin.
[03:22:08.015 --> 03:22:10.739]  Three days without water and your body begins to shut down.
[03:22:10.739 --> 03:22:14.664]  Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits.
[03:22:14.664 --> 03:22:16.206]  Get a FlowJack hand well pump.
[03:22:16.206 --> 03:22:25.219]  The affordable FlowJack drops right into almost any well and is easy to install without having to remove the existing pump, giving you immediate access to plenty of cool, clean water.
[03:22:25.359 --> 03:22:32.883]  You could risk your family's health on a limited supply of stored water, or you could be prepared with the reliable, affordable FloJack Backup Hand Pump Kit.
[03:22:32.883 --> 03:22:35.624]  Delivered to your door for only $3.99 complete.

[03:22:52.772 --> 03:22:53.993]  Peace of mind in a box.
[03:22:54.873 --> 03:22:58.757]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[03:22:58.757 --> 03:22:59.778]  That bears repeating.
[03:22:59.778 --> 03:23:03.661]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[03:23:03.661 --> 03:23:08.226]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[03:23:08.226 --> 03:23:13.711]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[03:23:14.071 --> 03:23:16.532]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.
[03:23:16.532 --> 03:23:19.033]  Contains all natural and certified organic ingredients.
[03:23:19.033 --> 03:23:21.194]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[03:23:21.194 --> 03:23:23.275]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[03:23:23.275 --> 03:23:24.295]  Supports weight loss.
[03:23:24.295 --> 03:23:26.136]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[03:23:26.136 --> 03:23:27.757]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[03:23:27.757 --> 03:23:29.337]  Is never freeze-dried.
[03:23:29.337 --> 03:23:33.199]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.

[03:23:44.063 --> 03:23:45.144]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[03:24:01.400 --> 03:24:05.643]  Yeah, look, we've only got four or five minutes left with Lew Rockwell of LewRockwell.com.
[03:24:05.643 --> 03:24:09.066]  Invaluable analysis from a common sense, pro-liberty perspective.
[03:24:24.278 --> 03:24:28.404]  And this calling us kooks, extremists, dangerous, it's only helping us.
[03:24:28.404 --> 03:24:29.907]  Because the system is dangerous.
[03:24:29.907 --> 03:24:30.908]  They're kooky.
[03:24:30.908 --> 03:24:33.993]  They're out of touch with reality and common sense.
[03:24:33.993 --> 03:24:37.458]  Lew Rockwell shifting gears into some other areas.
[03:24:39.321 --> 03:24:43.963]  Yeah, I had you on a few weeks ago and there was some evidence of fraud and you said, look, they've lied to us about everything else.
[03:24:43.963 --> 03:24:44.523]  Why wouldn't they?
[03:24:44.523 --> 03:24:47.264]  But now Maine, they admit they didn't count these counties.
[03:24:47.264 --> 03:24:49.485]  Just so happens where Ron Paul is dominating.
[03:24:49.485 --> 03:24:50.706]  Same thing in Iowa.
[03:24:50.706 --> 03:24:52.667]  They're saying that's now up in the air.
[03:24:52.667 --> 03:24:54.687]  I mean, we've got some clear evidence of fraud here.
[03:24:54.687 --> 03:24:57.909]  Ron Paul has said he's looking into it now.
[03:24:57.909 --> 03:24:59.469]  What would you do?
[03:24:59.469 --> 03:25:01.350]  I know you don't speak for the campaign, but what?
[03:25:01.350 --> 03:25:02.491]  I mean, we know Ron listens to you.
[03:25:02.491 --> 03:25:02.911]  What would you do?
[03:25:04.209 --> 03:25:06.470]  Well, I think exactly what Ron's going to do.
[03:25:06.470 --> 03:25:12.333]  He's going to look into it, he's going to make sure he's got the evidence, and then he's going to, if he feels it's appropriate, he's going to speak out.
[03:25:12.333 --> 03:25:18.456]  And he made a comment, in fact, in the debate last night, a funny comment about the votes in Maine.
[03:25:18.456 --> 03:25:19.497]  So, of course, it's clear that
[03:25:20.098 --> 03:25:22.721]  We only have to think of who goes into politics.
[03:25:22.721 --> 03:25:27.086]  It's the crookedest people we know, the demagogues, the liars, the thieves.
[03:25:27.086 --> 03:25:32.071]  So of course elections are typically stolen, at least on the margin.
[03:25:32.071 --> 03:25:36.717]  Mayor Daley was not a unique figure in American life, so that's why you have to have those.
[03:25:37.117 --> 03:25:37.357]  Thank you.
[03:25:59.022 --> 03:26:00.163]  The American Republic.
[03:26:00.163 --> 03:26:01.183]  I agree with you.
[03:26:01.183 --> 03:26:09.649]  This mass, mass democracy of this sort, the crooked democracy, is unpleasant and a real negative for our country.
[03:26:11.733 --> 03:26:12.754]  I totally agree with you.
[03:26:12.754 --> 03:26:18.160]  I mean, we're not glad they're doing the bad things, but now that they're so out in the open, we are getting lemonade out of the lemons.
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:30.172]  I mean, look at how they're in the old paradigm where there wasn't new media to challenge them, stealing things in the open still, and I see what little bit of credibility they had bleeding out onto the floor.
[03:26:30.172 --> 03:26:31.273]  Are you seeing the same thing, Lou?
[03:26:31.713 --> 03:26:33.055]  Sure, and it's subverting them.
[03:26:33.055 --> 03:26:37.101]  As you say, it's not a good idea that they're stealing stuff.
[03:26:37.101 --> 03:26:42.970]  However, given that they're stealing, how much better it is that it's in the open, and this is subverting them.
[03:26:42.970 --> 03:26:44.212]  Americans are waking up.
[03:26:44.212 --> 03:26:47.497]  This is showing people in the Ron Paul campaign, in fact, anybody who's been following
[03:26:47.557 --> 03:26:47.897]  We're good.
[03:27:16.068 --> 03:27:17.291]  This is a very important thing.
[03:27:17.291 --> 03:27:19.655]  We are reaching the American people.
[03:27:19.655 --> 03:27:22.279]  And they are no longer going to put up with this.
[03:27:22.279 --> 03:27:23.762]  So I think this is why they're so worried.
[03:27:23.762 --> 03:27:27.909]  It's why they're calling Ron Paul a Romney assistant and all that sort of thing.
[03:27:27.909 --> 03:27:28.510]  The latest smear.
[03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:31.920]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:41.903]  And having a Bilderberg guy set up a super PAC and implying that Ron Paul's a globalist when I can set up a super PAC, Jesse Jackson can set up a super PAC for anybody.
[03:27:41.903 --> 03:27:43.843]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:27:43.843 --> 03:27:45.544]  They're just pulling out all the stops.
[03:27:45.544 --> 03:27:47.844]  Now, in closing, we've got about two and a half minutes left.
[03:27:47.844 --> 03:27:51.705]  I like to always ask this question because we don't do pre-interviews, as you know.
[03:27:51.705 --> 03:27:56.846]  What is foremost in two and a half minute closing statement on your radar right now?
[03:27:56.846 --> 03:27:58.027]  What's really got you excited?
[03:27:58.027 --> 03:27:58.807]  What's got you angry?
[03:27:59.878 --> 03:28:04.621]  Well, first of all, what's got me angry and got me worried is another war.
[03:28:04.621 --> 03:28:09.285]  Obviously, they're attempting to overthrow the last secular regime in the Arab world, in Syria.
[03:28:09.285 --> 03:28:13.028]  That's going to lead to vast massacres, just as has happened in Libya.
[03:28:13.028 --> 03:28:15.690]  And it's going to put even worse people in charge.
[03:28:15.690 --> 03:28:22.875]  There are people worse than Saddam Hussein or Assad or the dictator of Libya, and they come into power.
[03:28:22.875 --> 03:28:24.136]  We call it democracy.
[03:28:24.136 --> 03:28:27.158]  Well, you know, it's just more corruption, more death.
[03:28:27.938 --> 03:28:32.662]  Then, of course, the real enemy, at least at this stage of things, is Iran.
[03:28:32.662 --> 03:28:34.124]  They killed a million people in Iraq.
[03:28:34.124 --> 03:28:40.629]  I don't know how many they plan to kill in Iran, but this is not only, of course, a moral disaster, but it's an economic disaster.
[03:28:40.629 --> 03:28:42.951]  We're going to have $10 a gallon gas if they do it.
[03:28:43.351 --> 03:28:44.532]  A lot of people think that's great.
[03:28:44.532 --> 03:28:48.334]  They think it's great if the environmentalists think so, and so do the neocons.
[03:28:48.334 --> 03:28:54.817]  Force Americans to use less gasoline, drive less, live at a lower standard of living for foreign purposes.
[03:28:54.817 --> 03:28:58.179]  So this is obviously not a good thing.
[03:28:58.179 --> 03:28:58.899]  It's frightening.
[03:28:58.899 --> 03:29:02.781]  They're going to spend trillions of dollars more on this war.
[03:29:02.781 --> 03:29:05.503]  And again, they're going to build up a mountain of corpses.
[03:29:05.503 --> 03:29:09.365]  All the pro-life people like Romney and Santorum and Gingrich
[03:29:09.925 --> 03:29:13.189]  They're happy to slit the throats of the little children in Iran, of course.
[03:29:13.189 --> 03:29:16.833]  So these people are not pro-life, they're pro-death.
[03:29:16.833 --> 03:29:20.678]  So what's got me excited is what Ron Paul is doing.
[03:29:20.678 --> 03:29:24.222]  The millions of young people he's reached, not only in this country, but around the world.
[03:29:24.742 --> 03:29:25.182]  Exactly.
[03:29:25.182 --> 03:29:27.604]  Because of liberty, Austrian economics.
[03:29:27.604 --> 03:29:30.765]  He's already won the election in this sense because of the young people.
[03:29:30.765 --> 03:29:31.186]  He has.
[03:29:31.186 --> 03:29:32.707]  Great job, Lew Rockwell.
[03:29:32.707 --> 03:29:34.007]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[03:29:34.007 --> 03:29:35.628]  Thanks for coming on on short notice.
