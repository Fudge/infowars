[00:20.720 --> 00:23.920]  Voting numbers. It's been a record-breaking turnout. Those stories.
[00:23.920 --> 00:28.240]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:28.240 --> 00:30.640]  Check your watch. It's four o'clock.

[00:37.040 --> 00:42.240]  Barack Obama's campaign manager says they've achieved their goal of creating more than one way
[00:42.240 --> 00:48.640]  to win. David Pluff has told Fox News Sunday that Obama has expanded the electoral map.
[00:48.640 --> 00:54.320]  We feel good about Kerry States, Iowa, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia,
[00:54.320 --> 00:57.520]  all of the prime takeaway targets that we've been working on for so long.
[00:57.520 --> 01:02.480]  And McCain campaign manager Rick Davis says undecided voters are likely to break in favor
[01:02.480 --> 01:08.560]  of McCain. Guess who's the undecided voters? People who, in the suburbs, ex-burbs, and rural
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.760]  areas, a lot of them Democrats who just haven't bought into the Obama message. And guess what?
[01:13.760 --> 01:15.760]  If they haven't bought in by now, they probably aren't going to.
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.720]  Both John McCain and Barack Obama will be east of the Mississippi this final Sunday before the
[01:20.720 --> 01:26.480]  election. McCain will stump in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire while Obama returns to Ohio.
[01:26.480 --> 01:29.360]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[01:30.480 --> 01:35.360]  Hi, this is Dale Denton from Maryland. I came from a real estate background. My traditional
[01:35.360 --> 01:40.720]  business, my overhead was enormous and a downturn put me out of business. The problem with my
[01:40.720 --> 01:45.760]  traditional business was that my overhead grew as the company grew and it eventually grew to
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.720]  about a half million dollars a month, which I couldn't sustain during every session and a downturn.
[01:50.720 --> 01:55.360]  I found myself near 50 and having to start over with no retirement plan. And I've been working
[01:55.360 --> 02:00.960]  in the three-step plan for just over two and a half years, something under three years. And the
[02:00.960 --> 02:06.720]  great thing about the Andy Willoughby three-step plan, the minimum investment compared to the
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.000]  return that I got was just awesome. The three-step plan has given me my life back.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.640]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby with the three-step plan home
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.800]  business system. To find out how you could make more money working from home, go to

[02:30.960 --> 02:35.760]  Poll workers in Wilton, New Hampshire have come up with a seat of the pants way to make sure
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.480]  ballots aren't counted twice. Once tallied, they're stacked in bundles of 25 and someone sits on them.
[02:43.040 --> 02:48.720]  One town official calls it primitive but effective. In contrast, Maryland House of
[02:48.720 --> 02:53.840]  Delegates Republican leader Anthony O'Donnell says he has problems with some of the provisions
[02:53.840 --> 02:58.480]  of the early voting amendment. People will be able to vote anywhere in the state so someone can come
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.040]  to the lesbian vote from another part of the state and then go to Western Maryland and vote and then
[03:03.040 --> 03:09.440]  go to the Eastern Shore and vote. That to me is very, very frightening in terms of people who want
[03:09.440 --> 03:15.440]  to or wish to abuse the system. In aid parliamentary soldiers are dead in Pakistan after a suicide
[03:15.440 --> 03:20.960]  car bomber rammed his vehicle into a checkpoint near the Afghan border. The troops were washing
[03:20.960 --> 03:28.320]  vehicles at the time. For more news and analysis, log on to irnnews.com.
[03:30.800 --> 03:34.640]  Here's a word about Israel from Dr. Jack Hayford, President of the International
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.200]  Church of the Four Square Gospel. You go to Israel is to change the way you will ever approach the
[03:39.200 --> 03:44.960]  Bible. The Bible becomes faced in an entirely deeper and richer way because you have been
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.400]  where it happened. You'll never be the same when you visit Israel. To start planning your trip to
[03:50.400 --> 03:53.920]  Israel today, visit www.goisrael.com.
[04:00.960 --> 04:06.000]  Britain's Prime Minister is in Saudi Arabia where he's trying to coax oil-rich countries in the
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.840]  Middle East to donate to the bell-out reserves of the International Monetary Fund. Gordon Brown
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.080]  says he's confident the Saudis will help. I think we will persuade you're talking about hundreds
[04:16.080 --> 04:22.720]  of billions of dollars here and I think we will persuade countries from China to the oil states
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.360]  to make their contribution as well. More on the run for the White House, where Israel political
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.760]  analyst Ronan Gissin says the outcome of the election won't change the US-Israeli bond. Whoever
[04:33.760 --> 04:40.400]  is going to be the American president, he is committed to Israel's security, to Israel's needs,
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.560]  and that strategic partnership I believe will continue. Some states report record turnouts
[04:46.560 --> 04:52.560]  for early voting. This voter in Charlotte, North Carolina says the lines were not moving very fast.
[04:52.560 --> 04:57.680]  At the end of the block there, so in about two hours we've made it about halfway down the block.
[04:57.680 --> 05:03.200]  In House Republican leader John Boehner has used a vulgar expression to refer to Democrat
[05:03.200 --> 05:08.560]  Barack Obama and his voting record in the Illinois Legislator. Here's Matt Reid.
[05:08.560 --> 05:14.080]  Boehner criticized Obama for not taking a stand on various issues. He feels that as a legislator
[05:14.080 --> 05:18.960]  you should vote yes or no on an issue and to do otherwise is chicken followed by a four letter
[05:18.960 --> 05:25.360]  word. The comments alluded to Obama's record of voting present 129 times as a state lawmaker.
[05:25.920 --> 05:33.120]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News. Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.720]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.520]  parasitic infection. You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.720]  debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it. In fact,
[05:48.720 --> 05:54.400]  clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain
[05:54.400 --> 05:59.040]  due to misdiagnosis. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high

[07:18.960 --> 07:21.360]  Second day of November 2000.
[07:21.360 --> 07:30.880]  And eight. We're going to be live here for the next two hours. We're going to have open phones at
[07:30.880 --> 07:42.560]  877-590-5525. That's 877-590-5525. We're less than 48 hours out from Tuesday's election,
[07:43.200 --> 07:47.760]  national election. They're talking about record turnout of around 75% nationwide.
[07:47.760 --> 07:52.480]  Just heard local news here in Austin on the station I'm syndicated out of.
[07:52.480 --> 07:59.280]  It's radio 590-KLBJ talking about 80 plus percent turnout being predicted by the Travis County
[07:59.280 --> 08:05.440]  clerk, Dennis Dubois. We're seeing similar numbers of 80 plus percent around the country.
[08:05.440 --> 08:10.400]  That is just unprecedented. Normally you get about a 55 to 60% turnout in a
[08:11.600 --> 08:16.080]  presidential election. Don't forget there's all the senatorial elections, house elections
[08:16.080 --> 08:20.960]  going on, the state elections, legislative elections, local county city elections. And
[08:20.960 --> 08:27.040]  unfortunately we shall have a national average of about 8.5% for local turnout.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.480]  But we get over 50% for national turnout on average, again close to 80% this time they're
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.080]  predicting. The real power is locally. The big foreign multinational corporations,
[08:38.080 --> 08:42.720]  the special interest, the people creating a world government is an in-run around our
[08:42.720 --> 08:49.760]  liberties and freedoms in the western world. They are for a long time buying off the leaders of
[08:49.760 --> 08:54.000]  the House and Senate and of course the executive branch, but they don't have total control over
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  the local area and that's where we can still have a huge effect. I want to open the phones up today
[09:00.560 --> 09:06.240]  for your take on who you're voting for. Third party, is it Ralph Nader or is it the Constitution
[09:06.240 --> 09:13.360]  party? Chuck Baldwin, are you voting for Barack H. Obama? Are you voting for John McCain?
[09:15.120 --> 09:20.480]  Your take on the future of this country and the military and police. Now we told you they were
[09:20.480 --> 09:24.880]  hearing up for Marshall Law a long time ago. We're not saying that's going to happen. We're
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.120]  saying they're locked and loaded for it. But now they've openly in the last few weeks been saying
[09:29.120 --> 09:37.040]  yes, we are ready for national riots and cities burning if Barack Obama doesn't win. But most
[09:37.040 --> 09:43.200]  polls show Barack Obama at least five points ahead. Some show him as many as 13 points ahead,
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.400]  but the electoral college is a little bit different and his lead is slightly less there.
[09:49.600 --> 09:52.960]  I don't like either one of the candidates. They're both anti-gun, pro-open,
[09:52.960 --> 09:59.360]  border, pro-new-world order candidates. My main problem with Barack Obama is that I've found
[09:59.360 --> 10:05.520]  writings of his when he first got in the U.S. Senate four years ago calling for carbon taxes
[10:05.520 --> 10:10.800]  in the name of stopping CO2, that's actually what plants breathe, to regulate every facet of our
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.840]  lives, to shut down a lot of power plants, giving us cheap energy and killing a lot of jobs.
[10:15.840 --> 10:23.280]  And he also wants these tattletale brigades, over a million-man youth brigade as domestic spies.
[10:24.800 --> 10:30.080]  Now, about nine months ago, I first reported this, and then about six months ago it was in the
[10:32.160 --> 10:38.000]  major newspapers across the country. The first big one I saw it in was the Chicago Tribune,
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.720]  and we wrote stories about it up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. But people didn't believe me.
[10:44.720 --> 10:52.000]  So I just want to remind you once more that a domestic force of spies, A, isn't Barack Obama's
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.280]  idea, but B, he's pushing it, and C, this has been stated for a long time, the government's plan
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.880]  to bring us into a high-tech police state. So let's go ahead and play a clip of Barack Obama.
[11:03.520 --> 11:09.760]  This is, again, he's talked about this for years, but here he is last July in Colorado Springs,
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.640]  Colorado, the real seat of the Northcom U.S. government that is really running things,
[11:16.640 --> 11:24.080]  and here he is calling for these youth brigades. Here it is. We cannot continue to rely only on
[11:24.080 --> 11:29.520]  our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got
[11:29.520 --> 11:36.000]  to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well
[11:36.000 --> 11:45.760]  funded. Now, that's why, and if you read the fine print, it's going to be arrogant,
[11:45.760 --> 11:52.560]  full of themselves, ignorant, 18 to 20-year-olds. The CIA illegally for decades has been off
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.280]  operating inside the United States, and we've exposed that with governors and police chiefs
[11:57.280 --> 12:01.680]  and others they've tried to buy off. But Barack Obama is only pushing what the establishment
[12:01.680 --> 12:08.720]  wants. John McCain, incidentally, and you can pull this clip up as well, has called repeatedly for
[12:08.720 --> 12:14.080]  having a domestic surge of U.S. Army on the streets of America to, quote, fight crime.
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.160]  We've now seen the Illinois governor about two months ago say we're going to use
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.760]  National Guard for door-to-door gun confiscation. So this is really happening, and both parties
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.800]  are pushing this. The entire presidential election is a giant distraction, a giant diversion,
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.520]  to sell the public that presidents actually run something and that they're actually in power.
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.600]  A long time ago, the continuity of government system took power, not just from Congress,
[12:37.600 --> 12:42.320]  but away from the president, and the National Security Council controlled by a select group
[12:42.320 --> 12:48.080]  of private banks through the military controls the United States. And this is all over foreign
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.480]  newspapers. This is well known in a lot of white papers, even put out by our own government,
[12:52.480 --> 12:58.640]  but the general public is not aware of that. Shifting gears into another subject that I'd
[12:58.640 --> 13:04.960]  like to discuss today with everybody, that's the fact that a month ago, I told you on there,
[13:04.960 --> 13:11.600]  because I read the Banker Takeover Bill, that it would allow a small group of four U.S. banks,
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.280]  and about eight to nine different foreign banks, depending on how you read it,
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.640]  come in and be given governmental power through the Treasury Department in total anonymity,
[13:22.640 --> 13:28.720]  that secrecy, and immunity, and that no one could even review or look at what they did henceforth.
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.440]  And we read that many times on air, and people attacked me saying, the small minority that was
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.120]  for it, National Poll showed about 95 to 98 percent against the Banker Takeover Bill,
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.960]  and congressmen that I interviewed on air, and also in the press reported, about a thousand
[13:42.960 --> 13:50.320]  to one phone calls, about a thousand to one phone calls against it. But still, the shadow government
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.680]  did what they wanted and gave this new power to them, and then not one red cent has been loaned
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.600]  out to the American people. Not one red cent has been given anybody for their mortgages,
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.720]  or to back up any bad mortgages that have been securitized and sold into derivatives,
[14:04.720 --> 14:12.320]  and that's the real issue. Not one red cent was spent for that, and out of the trillion plus that's
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.440]  been pumped out, it's not 700 billion, not 840 billion. Bloomberg got it right, Ron Paul's
[14:17.440 --> 14:24.080]  reported on it too. It's about five trillion if you read the Banker Takeover Bill. It states that
[14:24.800 --> 14:31.040]  they are just going to give it to their CEOs, their employees, as cash bonuses. And I have
[14:31.040 --> 14:37.040]  several mainstream news articles up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, where they are giving,
[14:37.680 --> 14:46.160]  well, a loan in the United States around 25 billion of the bailout directly to Goldman Sachs
[14:46.160 --> 14:54.400]  alone will go to bonuses. That money directly will be used as bonuses, and the banks are in the news
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.880]  saying we're just keeping the money, and we're using it to acquire other banks and insurance
[14:58.880 --> 15:05.040]  companies and sports teams, institutions, companies with your money. You have to pay for that in
[15:05.040 --> 15:11.760]  tax money, and it also devalues the currency via the overprinting and over issuance of it on the
[15:11.760 --> 15:19.280]  world market and sold it globally as bonds, U.S. bonds, and different securities. So there are
[15:19.280 --> 15:24.240]  the facts. Here's the Associated Press from a few days ago. I talked a lot about this on the
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.600]  weekday show. It says, uses for 700 billion dollar bailout money ever shifting. First,
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.760]  the 700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying the valued mortgage-backed securities
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.560]  from tottering banks to unplug frozen credit markets. Then it was about using the 250
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.880]  billion of it to buy stakes in banks. That idea was that the banks would use the money to start
[15:42.880 --> 15:47.520]  making loans, but reports surfaced that banks are instead using the money to buy other banks,
[15:47.520 --> 15:52.320]  pay dividends, and give employees raises and executives bonuses. It goes on to say that,
[15:53.680 --> 15:59.840]  see, these are offshore corporations, and they're totally ruthless. The New York Times even reported
[15:59.840 --> 16:08.560]  two days ago, actually Thursday, three days ago now, back on October 29th. They actually reported,
[16:09.280 --> 16:14.640]  and they even have recordings of this, the head of Chase and the head of Morgan,
[16:16.400 --> 16:19.920]  admitting that, oh, this is great for us. We're just going to have bonuses
[16:19.920 --> 16:26.960]  and take over other institutions. So there you go, folks. Total criminality. We'll be right back
[16:26.960 --> 16:33.280]  with your phone calls and a lot more. Stay with us. I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.560]  anything anymore. What? Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible. I read something
[16:38.560 --> 16:42.800]  and forget. I forget people's names. I hear all this great information on the radio and I want
[16:42.800 --> 16:48.560]  to tell people, but I forget. Okay, slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.360]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods,
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.600]  the way the education system taught you. It's all meant to dumb you down. You know,
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.120]  I can remember everything now, even entire books. What? How? There is this website called School of
[17:03.120 --> 17:08.080]  Phenomenal Memory. Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[17:08.080 --> 17:13.440]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information,
[17:13.440 --> 17:20.320]  including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons. And they offer a no questions asked,
[17:20.320 --> 17:25.920]  no time limit, money back guarantee. Wow. What's the website? Now, don't forget,
[17:25.920 --> 17:34.320]  it's pmemory.net, the letter pmemory.net. Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[19:10.240 --> 19:17.840]  Or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple in the corporate control flock. But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.800]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[19:34.800 --> 19:40.720]  world health is staggering. We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[19:40.720 --> 19:46.080]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live,
[19:46.080 --> 19:51.840]  is unable to remove all toxins. The solution. Detoxification integrated with the electro-cheap

[20:26.640 --> 20:38.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[20:47.280 --> 20:54.960]  Welcome back. We are live. 48 hours out from the 2008 presidential election. The globalists
[20:54.960 --> 20:59.920]  have given us two puppets. I'll go to your calls here in a moment, but going back to the banker
[20:59.920 --> 21:06.080]  takeover empowerment bill of a month ago, remember they said if Congress didn't pass it,
[21:06.080 --> 21:12.320]  there would be a depression. They had to have that money that week to shore up these companies,
[21:12.320 --> 21:17.600]  and then not one red cent a month later has gone to any of those companies that's going into bonuses.
[21:18.160 --> 21:22.000]  I mentioned the tens of billions of dollars for Goldman Sachs here in the U.S.
[21:22.000 --> 21:30.240]  in England, it's $14 billion or 7.5 million pounds to begin with for bonuses, and they're bragging
[21:30.240 --> 21:36.080]  and laughing, and then Congress was given some of the details of who's being paid what last week,
[21:36.080 --> 21:40.720]  and they were all blacked out, and the public was told, well, that was in the bill, total secrecy.
[21:42.400 --> 21:48.240]  See, corruption on its face, and when they passed the banker bailout bill a month ago,
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.960]  I had members of Congress on the show, not just on C-SPAN, we saw them on C-SPAN saying,
[21:52.960 --> 21:59.280]  we were threatened with martial law if we don't pass this on that Friday.
[22:00.560 --> 22:05.440]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, throughout history, powerful interests seek to get control of governments
[22:05.440 --> 22:12.560]  to then loot the public treasury. That's happening now, and Barack Obama and John McCain supported
[22:12.560 --> 22:16.720]  the banker takeover bill, and Barack Obama has gotten three times the Wall Street money that
[22:16.720 --> 22:21.680]  John McCain got, and four times the Goldman Sachs money. I'm not even seeing go out and vote for
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.880]  either one of these guys or vote for John McCain. I'm just stating the facts here. John McCain
[22:26.880 --> 22:31.520]  isn't running TV ads where he's already in the Oval Office. John McCain isn't running ads about how
[22:31.520 --> 22:38.800]  he's our global savior. It's very, very frightening, the whole messianic, cult-like thing we're seeing
[22:38.800 --> 22:44.240]  with Barack Obama, and I really feel sorry for all the leftist and people, just like I felt sorry
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.960]  for Republicans. I said, look, George Bush isn't going to be your savior. He isn't going to, you
[22:48.960 --> 22:53.360]  know, not have wars or take your liberties or restore the Second Amendment like he promised to
[22:53.360 --> 22:57.600]  do. It's going to get bad. It did, and it's going to get even worse under Barack Obama
[22:58.240 --> 23:05.360]  if he is indeed our new furor. So that's just some of the issues I wanted to go over today.
[23:05.360 --> 23:12.000]  Also, every few days I see reports in Europe, in Canada, in the United States of a woman being mugged
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.640]  in the street or raped in the street or a child being beaten to death or a cop hit by a car
[23:18.640 --> 23:22.560]  bleeding to death on the road that even happened in Austin a few years ago, and no one stops to
[23:22.560 --> 23:31.040]  help them. Hundreds of passers-by's drive by, and at most they call 9-11, you know, they call 9-1-1,
[23:31.920 --> 23:36.080]  and Americans never behaved like that. People of the West, people worldwide, never behaved like
[23:36.080 --> 23:40.960]  that. How did we change? We became a nation of spectators, trained at the governments going to
[23:40.960 --> 23:46.320]  handle it. The government's going to do it. And so we'll be, we'll be going over that a little
[23:46.320 --> 23:51.920]  bit later in the show with a case in California of a man for the press reports, say about 30
[23:51.920 --> 23:56.880]  minutes, beating a toddler to death in the street, and everybody called the police, but none of them
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.120]  stopped. I mean, if I see somebody stomping a baby in the street, I'm going to pull over and I'm
[24:01.120 --> 24:05.040]  going to, I'm going to attack them. And it's not because I'm a tough guy. It's because I've got my
[24:05.040 --> 24:11.040]  instincts straight. And by the way, I'm not just saying that. I told the story. You know, I said
[24:11.040 --> 24:18.320]  I'd get into it later, and I will get more detail and open the phones up about this whole psychology,
[24:19.200 --> 24:24.480]  and I've got a lot of thoughts on it. But I was in the Madeline in Northern Austin about five and
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.200]  a half years ago, and we were getting ready to leave, and I went up to go to the bathroom, and I
[24:29.200 --> 24:32.960]  heard a bunch of yelling and stuff, and I came back out, and it was this crowd of people. It was
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.920]  full, like seven o'clock at night, you know, on a weeknight at the little restaurant, and this
[24:37.920 --> 24:42.960]  woman was choking, turning purple, falling on the table, and everyone was screaming, call 911,
[24:42.960 --> 24:48.560]  and I said, do the Heimlich, and they would scream at me angrily, no, 911. Like, how dare you slave?
[24:48.560 --> 24:51.760]  We're meant to stand here and do nothing. You know, there's so conditioned to be pathetic
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.520]  chicken neck slaves, and there were probably about 20 people around. I had to start pushing through
[24:55.520 --> 24:59.040]  them, and I had some physically trying to stop me, and I said, do the Heimlich, and they wouldn't
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.200]  do it. They kept saying 911, 911, and they couldn't even call 911. They're like chickens,
[25:03.200 --> 25:09.840]  you know, just, just, just, just balking or, or sheepling. And I had to physically get past them,
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.800]  and as I'm grabbing her to do the Heimlich, you know, which I, they offered it as a free course
[25:14.800 --> 25:19.040]  for the fire department when I was in the swim team back in Dallas in junior high, so I, you know,
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.080]  have a basic course on it. And the point is, is that I grab her, and I do the Heimlich, and a big
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.480]  piece of bread comes out, and then they were all kind of looking at me weird, and some of them
[25:30.480 --> 25:33.360]  thanking me, some of them looking at me strange, and I thought, before I get arrested, I'm just
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.000]  getting out of here, because that's a crime to be involved, to have that, to take action in America.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.800]  And so, you know, only men in black uniforms and submachine guns can do it. We've been
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.800]  trained to be slaves, so I got out of there quickly. But, but that, that is what's wrong
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.880]  with this country. And, you know, people are more concerned with UT losing to Texas tech,
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.400]  and they're crying, and whining, and literally sobbing over it. Meanwhile, foreign banks are
[25:56.400 --> 26:00.560]  completely taken over the government. Northcom has, you know, already taken control of the
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.280]  government, and we're, we're under total police state being looted, and they don't care. They,
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.760]  you know, they care of the Cowboys lose, or of the Titans lose, or of the Dolphins lose, and
[26:10.960 --> 26:14.880]  we're a gilded population meant to stand by, where action is looked down upon.
[26:15.440 --> 26:18.560]  All right, I've already been ranting too long here. I want to go to your phone calls.
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.720]  Steve in Utah, you're on the air worldwide. Welcome.
[26:22.720 --> 26:24.960]  Hey, what's up? How you doing?
[26:24.960 --> 26:25.840]  Good, sir. Go ahead.
[26:25.840 --> 26:33.440]  I just wanted to bring up some, like, subtle things. I've seen a toy advertisement on TV
[26:33.440 --> 26:41.840]  the other day for a police helmet and handlebars for your kid to run around the house, and they
[26:41.840 --> 26:47.760]  believe he's a police officer, and it showed a picture of Dad behind bars. I just thought that
[26:47.760 --> 26:48.640]  was pretty interesting.
[26:48.640 --> 26:52.480]  Yeah, that's all part of, they did it at the Soviet Union in Nazi Germany. They tell the
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.240]  children, you're going to be over your parents. You're going to command them. Time magazine
[26:56.240 --> 27:00.720]  for kids and two different issues has said, you're going to take the microchip. You're cool.
[27:00.720 --> 27:05.760]  You know what to do. Your parents are dumb. And all over the country, the name of the war on
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.840]  drugs, not to be war on terror, they have the kids write dossiers on their parents. I mean,
[27:09.840 --> 27:15.520]  the country is so far gone, and for about a decade, all the children's toys go to the store.
[27:15.520 --> 27:19.520]  None of it's a USA flag on the tanker of the jet of the helicopter or the troops.
[27:19.520 --> 27:24.480]  It's all troops wearing black masks, troops, you know, United Nations force, global force.
[27:25.120 --> 27:26.640]  They're brainwashing the children.
[27:28.160 --> 27:34.800]  Well, I just wanted to bring up, you know, you made me aware of things like that, and then I
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.560]  just, I just seen it, and I was just like, whoa, that's kind of weird. And then another thing,
[27:38.560 --> 27:47.520]  there was this rap star TI, he was involved in some kind of federal gun issue where he was charged
[27:47.520 --> 27:54.080]  federally for some, having some machine guns or what have you. And he's coming to concert,
[27:54.080 --> 27:58.960]  and I know it's one of the sponsors was the US Army. I thought that was kind of weird. I don't,
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.040]  I don't remember the US Army sponsored any concerts.
[28:03.040 --> 28:10.080]  So, well, that's how they got Oliver Stone to sell out and make all these brainwashing movies
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.120]  like W that makes him some lovable idiot savant. And he really thought WMDs were there, all lies.
[28:15.680 --> 28:19.200]  That's how they got him to make, you know, these pro government view 9 11 film
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.880]  out of people in Hollywood is it's all these drug convictions. And they just said, look,
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.200]  you're going to play ball. The average American doesn't know that billions of years spent on
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.040]  fake newscasts, buying reporters, placing propaganda in TV and movies that are pro government,
[28:33.040 --> 28:38.480]  pro new world order. You know, the average American doesn't know that we didn't have Halloween till
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.720]  the 50s. Madison Avenue created that. They don't know that Santa Claus wasn't even involved in
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.200]  Christmas till Coca Cola promoted it. They don't know that bacon and eggs was Edward Bernays,
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.880]  the father of modern advertising. They don't understand our whole culture is fake,
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.400]  and it's manufactured. And now they're shifting that same social brainwashing system
[28:56.400 --> 29:00.800]  into conditioning the public to totally give up their liberties and freedoms so they'll acquiesce
[29:00.800 --> 29:06.160]  to becoming third world slaves. And now Barack Obama and John McCain are sending global taxes,
[29:06.160 --> 29:11.520]  carbon taxes, regulating your life, bureaucrats involved in your daily life, million man youth
[29:11.520 --> 29:17.600]  brigades, 3 million man, tattletail environmental brigades. They're here. And none of it has anything
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.160]  to do with the environment or helping the earth. It's all about control, feudalism, serfdom.
[29:22.160 --> 29:28.160]  And things are just going to get worse and worse. The elite are eating our lunch. We'll be right
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.800]  back with more calls from Canada, New York. Everyone knows that omega three should be an
[29:32.800 --> 29:37.040]  essential part of our daily diet with so many different methods of consumption. How do you
[29:37.040 --> 29:41.840]  choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake? The friendly, knowledgeable folks
[29:41.840 --> 29:47.600]  at North American nutrition have the answer. Nature's gem, premium omega three. Unlike other

[30:59.680 --> 31:06.560]  of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends. I hope Mr. Bush will

[31:30.640 --> 31:34.800]  Phase one of the insetters plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent
[31:34.800 --> 31:40.000]  bailout. International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.560]  new currency and a new world bank to act as savior. But we've only seen the beginning.
[31:44.560 --> 31:48.720]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[31:48.720 --> 31:53.360]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land. The insetters have
[31:53.360 --> 31:59.200]  discovered that they must control two things to seize total power. Phase one is a one-world currency
[31:59.200 --> 32:03.840]  which we are currently being prepared to accept. Phase two of their insidious plan is complete
[32:03.840 --> 32:13.760]  control of our food supplies. Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details. That's www.foodshortageusa.com

[33:29.760 --> 33:38.480]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[33:48.320 --> 33:54.800]  We are back live, 48 hours out from the big diversion, the big corporate diversion, the big
[33:54.800 --> 34:01.360]  PR extravaganza to make you think that the president's actually run things. You know,
[34:01.360 --> 34:06.800]  the big foreign banks engineered the derivatives crisis. They gave themselves unlimited power
[34:06.800 --> 34:10.960]  through Congress by terrorizing the Congress, threatening them with martial law. Now they're
[34:10.960 --> 34:15.520]  openly stealing all the money for themselves. You'll have to pay back in tax money.
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.680]  And when I talk about corporate propaganda, you know, how we didn't celebrate Halloween
[34:21.680 --> 34:28.320]  till the 50s or how we didn't celebrate Christmas the way we do until going back into
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.960]  the 1920s with Christmas and Coca-Cola and Santa Claus. I'm not even attacking those
[34:34.960 --> 34:43.600]  supposed institutions. My point is that that shows you how they mold your mind. That shows you how
[34:43.600 --> 34:49.680]  they're able to engineer societies. I mean, how did they get women to smoke cigarettes?
[34:49.680 --> 34:54.000]  Women had always seen it unladylike to smoke cigarettes. Well, they had the women's live
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.200]  movement and they funded them hundreds of thousands of dollars. That was millions at the time and
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.000]  equivalent. Then they had them go out and lead the parades and the newspapers would publish,
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.840]  oh, look, they're free. They're radical. They're smoking cigarettes.
[35:06.960 --> 35:12.400]  This is another example of how they form your ideas. And all I'm asking people to do is start
[35:12.400 --> 35:19.040]  realizing that we are living in a sea of propaganda. We are living in a sea of
[35:19.040 --> 35:25.600]  manipulation. We live under a completely federalized, micromanaged society.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.160]  I mean, I have a stack of news articles here in front of me. Some of them are up on infowars.com,
[35:32.160 --> 35:37.360]  the headline, The New Technology of Repression by Consortium News. And it goes through what
[35:37.360 --> 35:41.200]  Bob Woodward a few months ago talked about these secret weapons that are as big as the
[35:41.200 --> 35:46.640]  Manhattan Project and our military, really the globalist military is using in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.320]  And they're now admitting what a lot of it is, something I told you about years ago.
[35:50.320 --> 35:55.280]  Face scanning cameras, retina scanning cameras, license plate scanning cameras,
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.680]  systems that track you everywhere you go, even if you cover your face by the way you walk.
[35:59.680 --> 36:06.400]  That is all in place here in the United States under Northcom. That is the power of oppression
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.360]  and tyranny that has already been set up in all over the country. You may not be aware of this,
[36:11.360 --> 36:14.560]  but you should ask your children in public schools and even in private schools under
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.440]  federal accreditation, which is through the states. They are training your children to spy on you,
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.840]  to tattle on you, the cartoons, the movies, the culture. It's all about being spies.
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.160]  They are not just selling us on a new holiday or a new style, or that you got to have bacon
[36:30.160 --> 36:35.520]  with your eggs, and that was a PR thing. Nobody ate bacon with eggs. They are now selling you to
[36:35.520 --> 36:41.200]  be a snitch, to be a tattletale. They are now selling you on just so many things that are
[36:41.200 --> 36:47.040]  horrible, but the good news is their propaganda isn't working. You get 95 percent in major
[36:47.040 --> 36:51.680]  polls or higher against the bank or takeover bill, but it still happens. That's the bad news,
[36:51.680 --> 36:55.600]  or 91 percent in the Gallup polls against open borders, but still the borders are open,
[36:55.600 --> 36:58.880]  or 75 percent or higher against the war, but it continues.
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.440]  So the good news is the people are waking up. The bad news is the establishment
[37:05.440 --> 37:13.280]  is completely ignoring everything we're saying, everything we're doing.
[37:14.560 --> 37:20.240]  They are setting up a tyranny here in the United States. I was listening to another
[37:20.240 --> 37:26.320]  talk show earlier today on the radio, a well-known doctor, Dr. Dina Dell. We've actually interviewed
[37:26.320 --> 37:31.360]  him. Trey, I want to get him back on, because I was nice to him the last time we had him on,
[37:31.360 --> 37:35.520]  and then made him backpedal on a bunch of things, but this time I'm not going to be as nice, but
[37:35.520 --> 37:40.160]  I want you to set him up again for an hour, please, the next few weeks. And I heard a lady call in,
[37:40.160 --> 37:45.120]  and she said a few hours ago, because they were on the weekend here on the station we
[37:45.120 --> 37:48.960]  transmit out of and syndicate across the country, again, 590 a.m. here in Central Texas.
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.640]  And it's an interesting entertaining show. I'm not even attacking the show.
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.080]  It's just that the tactic, one of your calls here in a moment after that, the tactic he uses is the
[37:58.080 --> 38:02.400]  one I see used by the mainstream media and people on the left and the right who all work for the
[38:02.400 --> 38:09.360]  same masters. The lady called in and she said, I can't find chewing gum, bubble gum, any gum that
[38:09.360 --> 38:15.600]  doesn't have aspartame with sugar now, and that's true. You go to a 7-eleven or you go to a store,
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.800]  you go to the grocery store, they may have 20 different types of gum. Read on the back, they
[38:18.800 --> 38:26.640]  all say aspartame. And it's an artificial sweetener approved in 1982 by Searle. Searle got it approved,
[38:26.640 --> 38:32.240]  Rumsfeld was the head of it. And she said, I remember when I was in college, the former head
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.840]  of the EPA came and he said that on his speech, he said, I know I wouldn't feed this stuff to
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.360]  my family. And she said, is it true? It's bad for you. And he said, no, no, it's nothing's wrong
[38:43.360 --> 38:49.520]  with it. It's wonderful. Since the internet got big in the late 90s, there's a fake email that goes
[38:49.520 --> 38:55.840]  around listing fake doctors and fake information. And it's all fake and aspartame is good for you.
[38:56.880 --> 39:06.160]  You know, it's funny, I probably interviewed more than 50 or 60 scientists, doctors, neurologists,
[39:06.160 --> 39:15.120]  toxicologists. We went back and got the documents from the approval of aspartame in 1982.
[39:15.120 --> 39:20.400]  And so that they could get aspartame universally adopted as the new sweetener, the media falsely
[39:20.400 --> 39:27.920]  demonized and lobbyists from Searle demonized saccharin, which they found, if you fed rats,
[39:27.920 --> 39:32.880]  I think it was half their diet for something like a year, you can go pull the actual study up,
[39:32.880 --> 39:38.640]  half their diet, I mean, half of what they were eating was saccharin, just thousands of times
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.520]  and what a human would ingest per capita for their body weight, that they got these fatty,
[39:43.520 --> 39:52.880]  non-cancerous benign tumors in their kidneys. And so they demonized a artificial sweetener
[39:52.880 --> 40:00.080]  that actually wasn't really bad for you, comparatively. And then they got aspartame approved,
[40:00.080 --> 40:05.680]  known as Nutrisweet or equal as the brand names. And it's patent ran out about five years ago,
[40:05.680 --> 40:12.160]  that's why now it's in tens of thousands of foods, not just a few. So it's so inexpensive now.
[40:12.160 --> 40:19.520]  And it's 64 times sweeter per gram than sugar. And at 87 degrees in the stomach,
[40:20.400 --> 40:26.640]  at 87 degrees, it breaks down into what alcohol? And that's a fact. And I've read on air,
[40:26.640 --> 40:30.960]  I mean, these are from universities, the studies of when it got approved, where they gave it to
[40:30.960 --> 40:36.000]  rhesus monkeys and half the baby rhesus monkeys they gave it to in their milk was more than half
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.880]  of them died. And so, I mean, there's so much evidence that aspartame is an excitotoxin,
[40:42.880 --> 40:48.160]  is toxic, is deadly, that it'll make your head spin. And I've interviewed the medical doctors,
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.160]  the scientists, I've held those documents in my hand. So I'm going to get him on.
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.840]  And then I'm going to, I'm going to read him those studies. And these were FDA studies.
[40:59.840 --> 41:06.880]  And that reminds me of two weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration came out and said, well,
[41:08.080 --> 41:14.240]  there's melamine from China and it's sick in 56,000 children there, killed a bunch of people.
[41:14.240 --> 41:20.160]  But we're saying melamine is no longer bad for you. And I've got government reports coming
[41:20.160 --> 41:28.960]  out now saying mercury and the shots isn't bad for you. And I even have a CBS news report here,
[41:28.960 --> 41:33.840]  it's up on infowars.com. We're not going to play it, but it's a link where they have a medical
[41:33.840 --> 41:42.080]  doctor on and the FDA scientist unanimously came out and said that the BPA that's in most of the
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.520]  plastics, most of the plastic products you and your family, your babies drink out of,
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.400]  is an estrogen mimicker and very toxic. And that's why we have girls when they're five going
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.920]  into puberty. That's why we have boys that are hyperfeminine. And Europe and Japan banned this
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.480]  stuff years ago. And there's no reason most plastics don't have it. And it's just the one that they
[42:00.480 --> 42:09.840]  chose to put in here. But the head of the FDA, the EPA is also saying it's bad, but this is the
[42:09.840 --> 42:16.320]  FDA ignore science advisory panel on poisonous baby bottles, BPA. And they just said, we don't
[42:16.320 --> 42:23.920]  care, it's going to stay in the plastic here in the United States. Now, I'm sorry, melamine
[42:23.920 --> 42:30.240]  will kill you. We'll make you sick. We'll attack your kidneys. BPA that leaches out of these plastics
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.920]  is a big problem. And it's been well known. And you just can't set up there and say that it's not.
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.920]  There are thousands of studies that cell phones are giving people brain tumors
[42:39.920 --> 42:44.640]  from governments and universities. It's an absolute fact. It's a microwave relay system.
[42:44.640 --> 42:47.280]  That's why your computers go crazy when your cell phone rings.
[42:47.280 --> 42:54.960]  It's powerful. And it's microwaving right through your skull. And the people get the tumor right
[42:54.960 --> 43:00.720]  there. It's the same thing with sodium fluoride put in the water. I have all these reports about
[43:00.720 --> 43:05.040]  they give it to horses and cows, fluoride water, they all die, but they put it in our water.
[43:06.480 --> 43:13.200]  So I'm tired of the denial here, ladies and gentlemen. And I'm tired of the fact that
[43:13.200 --> 43:18.320]  we have a criminal eugenics elite putting this in our water and our food on purpose. Yes, it's all
[43:18.320 --> 43:24.160]  on purpose. Okay, your calls from Chris, Matt, Chad, George, Joe, Joe, Jim, everybody.

[47:38.160 --> 47:50.560]  Okay, let's continue with your phone calls right now talking about the private banks
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.720]  taking over the United States openly announcing they want a quote new world order using that term
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.680]  run for and by a private group of banks that will control our governments and set our taxes
[48:01.680 --> 48:07.360]  and levy a bunch of new carbon taxes, phony environmental taxes on us. That's all openly
[48:07.360 --> 48:10.400]  being announced exactly as we told you they would because we have their own documents.
[48:11.680 --> 48:14.800]  You can stand up against these people or I guess just stand down.
[48:15.680 --> 48:18.240]  And like Americans do now when they see a crime being committed.
[48:19.360 --> 48:22.960]  From the land of the free home of the brave to the land of the thumb-sucking cowards.
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.080]  That's not all of us, but that's a large portion of us. We have to wait for the mainstream media
[48:28.080 --> 48:31.200]  or the establishment to tell us that we can stand up or take action.
[48:31.200 --> 48:34.720]  See, that's all part of the mind control to be a bunch of passive TV watching
[48:34.720 --> 48:39.280]  sick of fans. Chris in the San Marcos, Texas, you're on the air. Welcome.
[48:41.280 --> 48:46.960]  I wanted to talk about the election. I went in on the 20th and I voted Bob Barr for Libertarian
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.160]  because I'll die with a smile on my face. I don't ever have to vote Republican or Democrat again.
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.520]  I mean, it's gotten so bad that two parties emerged into the same enemy. And if people
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.360]  don't even realize that it's time they shut off the Rush Limbaugh, you know.
[49:01.360 --> 49:07.680]  Well, what's happened is they have sold the public on voting like it's a horse race or a
[49:07.680 --> 49:13.120]  football game on who you think is going to win instead of whose policies you actually agree with.
[49:13.120 --> 49:16.800]  And you notice the two parties don't ever want to make it about policies,
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.280]  because their policies are almost identical. It turns into what is Sarah Palin wearing or
[49:21.280 --> 49:24.800]  are you a racist if you don't like Barack Obama on and on and on.
[49:24.800 --> 49:32.400]  You know, it's no longer a viable option to say on voting for the lesser of two evils.
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.400]  The system's never going to recover if we don't start voting for our beliefs.
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.120]  And the way I see it, the Libertarians are the only people that still seem to care about the
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.760]  Constitution. I mean, there was that one guy, Ron Paul, but oh, he was a wacko.
[49:46.640 --> 49:50.320]  Yeah, he was a wacko. He told us the derivatives market was being set up
[49:50.320 --> 49:54.640]  for collapse and they were devaluing the currency. All right, he's voting for Bombard.
[49:55.520 --> 50:00.480]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Jawad in New York. You're on the air. Welcome.
[50:01.440 --> 50:02.720]  Hello, Alex. Hi.
[50:03.520 --> 50:06.320]  Hey, thank you very much for taking my call. I'm a first-time caller.
[50:07.360 --> 50:09.120]  I'm calling from Binghamton, New York.
[50:10.960 --> 50:13.520]  I'd just like to say thank you for all the hard work that you're doing.
[50:13.520 --> 50:15.040]  We really appreciate it here in Binghamton.
[50:15.040 --> 50:22.320]  I really got working up. I have just three quick things and one question for you.
[50:22.320 --> 50:28.320]  The first thing is that on November 6th at my school, BTC, my college, we're showing your film
[50:28.320 --> 50:33.520]  Endgame at Titian Hall at 3 p.m. to anyone out there in Binghamton who's listening or Ithaca.
[50:34.320 --> 50:41.200]  Also, regarding the insider trading that took place on 9-11, I was watching a film today on
[50:41.200 --> 50:45.440]  Google videos. It's called Ring of Fire. I don't know how good it is or whatever,
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.560]  basically, because we had the trouble with the I Guys thing. I don't know how good it is.
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.680]  It's kind of really critical of religion. But it's called Ring of Fire. It mentioned that
[50:53.680 --> 50:59.680]  regarding the insider trading at the place of 9-11, it said Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Morgan Stanley,
[51:00.320 --> 51:04.720]  Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, and General Motors and a few others were the ones involved
[51:04.720 --> 51:08.480]  in the insider trading. The reason I brought this up is because you keep mentioning that the
[51:08.480 --> 51:14.000]  Banker bailouts, and these are the same guys. Well, for those that don't know, there was record
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.240]  put options, never before that big and never after that big, specifically not just on airlines,
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.800]  but specifically on United and American in the four days leading up to it. And we all heard,
[51:24.800 --> 51:28.480]  we're going to find out who was behind it because of the insider trading. And then it led
[51:28.480 --> 51:33.840]  to Buzzy Crongaard, executive director of the CIA, and Alex Brown, the company and others,
[51:33.840 --> 51:40.240]  so it got shut down. Yes, absolutely. And then the third thing is, I'm not sure if you're
[51:40.240 --> 51:43.360]  familiar with this one guy. People call him a scholar, but I don't know too much about him.
[51:43.360 --> 51:51.040]  His name is Cornel West, but he was on C-SPAN about a year ago, and he mentioned Will Smith,
[51:51.040 --> 51:54.800]  and said it was a Scientologist or something like that. Now, the reason I bring this up is that
[51:55.760 --> 52:00.880]  I remember a movie just recently called I Am Legend. And in that movie, it would be like
[52:00.880 --> 52:06.880]  some virus that caused 85% of the world's population. Yeah, it's a vaccine that's supposed
[52:06.880 --> 52:11.120]  to cure people of cancer, and then it kills the majority of the world population.
[52:11.920 --> 52:16.800]  Absolutely. So my point is, do you see this being part of the global agenda where
[52:17.920 --> 52:22.240]  they're intending on using something similar to the picture in this movie? If this man, again,
[52:22.240 --> 52:27.760]  is an insider, he's like maybe a Scientologist, and he's in, and he has some insight into what
[52:27.760 --> 52:33.760]  the plan is, but he glorifies it in some way. Well, I Am Legend was written back in the early 1950s,
[52:34.960 --> 52:39.280]  and then it was made into Omega Man, and then they made I Am Legend, and then they made the
[52:39.280 --> 52:46.880]  newest one under the same title. You know, when I get up on air, and I say that the United Nations
[52:46.880 --> 52:51.600]  and the IMF and the World Bank and the Club of Rome and the Council on Foreign Relations put out
[52:51.600 --> 52:57.760]  white papers saying they want to exterminate 80% to 90% of the population. I mean, my films,
[52:57.760 --> 53:02.560]  Road to Terror, and Endgame cover that. And by the way, a lot of my films have bibliographies,
[53:02.560 --> 53:10.560]  Endgame, three hour film. It's about two hours, 40 minutes, and it's an hour extra. So the point
[53:10.560 --> 53:16.320]  is, is that it has a bibliography. And every second of the film, every video, clip, every document,
[53:16.320 --> 53:25.760]  we have linked up on WhatIsTheEndgame.com, www.WhatIsTheEndgame.com. And yes, they are putting
[53:25.760 --> 53:32.160]  sodium fluoride in the water, just Google sodium fluoride cancer. And I mean, hundreds of main
[53:32.160 --> 53:37.840]  line studies that it, more than doubles cancer, just in bone cancer alone, or that they decided
[53:37.840 --> 53:42.480]  in the 50s to put the particular type, there were hundreds of types of plastic they could adopt,
[53:42.480 --> 53:47.120]  but they adopted the BPA-based plastic that they knew would sterilize men in the West.
[53:47.120 --> 53:52.800]  That's why sperm counts are down about 85%. Women are infertile because too much of this
[53:52.800 --> 53:57.520]  hormone ends up sterilizing you. And I could go on and on. But I mean, how do you get the public
[53:57.520 --> 54:01.920]  to come to grips with that? I mean, I'm sorry. I told you the Banker bailout bill was a scam,
[54:01.920 --> 54:05.920]  and it is. I told you everything. I told you 9-11 was going to happen before it happened.
[54:05.920 --> 54:11.120]  This is what I do. I'm not an expert on Texas Tech and UT and the Cowboys. I'm an expert on
[54:11.120 --> 54:15.360]  the New World Order, folks. And let me tell you, they're eugenicists. If you don't know what that
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.560]  term is, Google it. Okay. Let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas. George, you're on the air.
[54:20.560 --> 54:27.600]  Welcome. Good afternoon, Alex. Hi. Yes. You know, mom, last week, my wife came home in tears.
[54:29.040 --> 54:34.720]  She was threatened to arrest at the DPS because she refused to give a thumb scan.
[54:34.720 --> 54:39.520]  That's right. That's all part of the international agreement. That is a World ID card,
[54:39.520 --> 54:44.400]  not just a national ID card. It's all part of submitting to your enslavement.
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.560]  I mean, is it a color of law to do that? You will thumb print to buy and sell. They're going
[54:48.560 --> 54:53.520]  on the tanning salons, the stores, the churches, the libraries, parents to get their children
[54:53.520 --> 54:58.080]  at public schools, you know, thumb scanning. And what it is they say, driving is a privilege.
[54:58.080 --> 55:02.880]  It isn't. I have the Supreme Court rulings. But in the 30s, they said, well, these trucks
[55:02.880 --> 55:08.080]  are tearing up the road. If you're involved in commerce, trucks need a driver's license.
[55:08.080 --> 55:13.360]  And then 15, 20 years later, depending on the state, they phased in that it was a privilege to
[55:13.360 --> 55:19.440]  drive, but only under commerce. And the state police were really federal set up in the late 30s,
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.360]  and they have no idea what's going on. And they don't believe me. They love the system. So
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.600]  give your children more fluoride water. Don't believe me. Just give them more mercury shots.
[55:27.600 --> 55:30.880]  You know, don't believe me. Just love your government. Well, it's not your government.
[55:30.880 --> 55:35.040]  It's criminal bankers. You're under eugenics, thumb scan. Enjoy yourselves. You're going to have a
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.760]  national sales tax on top of the income tax, everything you're doing being tracked under
[55:39.760 --> 55:45.520]  carbon credits on your card. Also, so I mean, what they said to your wife, well, they told
[55:45.520 --> 55:49.120]  if you don't take the thumb print, you're going to be arrested. And I'm like, is the color of
[55:49.120 --> 55:52.560]  water take that down? I mean, they should have just said, well, you know, you don't get a license,
[55:52.560 --> 55:56.480]  and then you'll, you'll get arrested. Now, now citizens get arrested for no idea. Legal
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.600]  aliens don't. And I've had police admit this, but it's been in the news. So again, it's all
[56:01.600 --> 56:05.920]  part of humiliation, all part of domination, all part of bringing the country to its knees,
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.120]  all part of us learning how to be slaves. And we are, we are now slaves. The public just sits
[56:11.120 --> 56:15.920]  down and shuts up and goes along with anything. And also too, she went to the health department
[56:15.920 --> 56:21.520]  as for a federal vaccine waiver form. And they say there ain't no such thing. Well, that's another
[56:21.520 --> 56:27.520]  line. Number one, there's no law to take any vaccines. Number two, they then kick your kids
[56:27.520 --> 56:32.960]  out under truancy laws saying it's a school policy, then criminal charges kick in for the truancy,
[56:32.960 --> 56:38.720]  not for the quote, non-existent law of taking vaccines. And so yes, they are criminals,
[56:38.720 --> 56:46.720]  they will lie. Google this vaccine exemption or vaccine waiver form, but why do you need a waiver
[56:46.720 --> 56:53.440]  for something that isn't a law to begin with? Hey, hey, Google forced vaccine Maryland, and I
[56:53.440 --> 56:59.360]  even had the head of the state on that they had attorney who they had police dogs barking and
[56:59.360 --> 57:04.560]  thousands of kids showing up crying, being quote forcibly injected under color of law. It is a
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.440]  bankrupt criminal government and anybody that doubts me, only a criminal government would lie
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.160]  and say that you have to take a vaccine. Well, I kind of when there's no law, I kind of see the
[57:14.160 --> 57:18.800]  people down a road pushing back. I mean, when they are going to push back, that's why they've,
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.200]  that's why they openly admit the local police are now dialing in to the spice satellite.
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.800]  The control grids, the FEMA camps, every major city has helicopters standing by according to
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.600]  declassified documents in 2000 of the sunshine project with helicopters with opiate knockout
[57:33.600 --> 57:40.800]  gases waiting to gas every major city. Well, I just pray like that this election is peaceful,
[57:40.800 --> 57:44.880]  but I don't think it's going to be peaceful. I talked to a woman who lives in the Caribbean,
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.600]  who came from Africa, and this is what she said. She's a black woman. She sat there and said,
[57:49.600 --> 57:55.840]  Barack Obama will lead the black people down to the slaughter. I said, he said he's charismatic
[57:55.840 --> 58:01.680]  leaders once they get in power. I said, that's when the horror starts. Yeah, we have a completely
[58:01.680 --> 58:07.680]  criminal elite looting everything in power. During the break, I'm going to Google vaccine
[58:07.680 --> 58:13.360]  exemption form and then you will be on official state websites and you will know anyone that
[58:13.360 --> 58:19.120]  tells you it's the law is a criminal liar piece of filth. Period. Don't believe me. Check for

[59:20.960 --> 59:26.320]  Gee, honey, those new shoes look great on you. And look, they show off my new toenails too.
[59:26.320 --> 59:31.680]  New toenails? What happened to the old ones? Well, they're not really new, just clear and
[59:31.680 --> 59:37.360]  healthy looking. Remember how embarrassed I was? They were so discolored. Really awful looking.
[59:37.360 --> 59:43.200]  Well, they sure look clear now. I wish I could wear sandals again. My toenails are a disaster.
[59:43.200 --> 59:47.600]  Look, this one looks white and that one's thick and yellow. Here's my secret,
[59:47.600 --> 59:53.440]  non-x nail gel. It clears out yellowing keratin debris the cause of nail discoloration.
[59:53.440 --> 59:59.440]  So that's it. I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails. And non-x nail gel gets rid
[59:59.440 --> 1:00:04.960]  of it. You'll need to use it daily, but clear nails are worth it. You bet. When we go to the
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:10.960]  beach next summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do. Thanks to non-x nail gel.
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:16.560]  Non-x nail gel for clear, healthy looking nails. Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, CVS, Longs, Meyer,
[1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:20.640]  Target, and other fine pharmacies and mass retailers in the foot care section.
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:24.160]  Andy will not face charges. We'll have those stories and more.
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:35.040]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network. Texas, it's five o'clock.
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:41.360]  I R.M. USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. He may be leading in the polls, but Barack Obama is not
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:47.520]  easing up on a final weekend before the election. The campaign today in Ohio, hoping to pocket a
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:52.240]  traditionally Republican state. Don't believe for a second this election is open. Don't think
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:56.320]  for a minute that power will concede without a fight. John McCain will spend his last day of
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:00.800]  campaigning in Pennsylvania in New Hampshire. He says he's fighting back from being down in the
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:06.480]  polls and urges voters to prove the pundits wrong. Britain's prime minister is in Saudi Arabia,
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:11.040]  where he's trying to coax oil-rich countries in the Middle East to donate to the bell-out
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:17.520]  reserves of the International Monetary Fund. Gordon Brown says he's confident the Saudis will help.
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:22.480]  If we're going to protect the world against what we might call the contagion of something happening in one country,
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:28.320]  affecting another, then we do need the countries with reserves and resources to contribute to that.
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:34.480]  This is IRN, USA Radio News. Here's a word about Israel from Dr. Jack Hayford,
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:39.040]  president of the International Church of the Four Square Gospel. You go to Israel as to change the
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.880]  way you will ever approach the Bible. The Bible becomes faced in an entirely deeper and richer
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:50.320]  way because you have been where it happened. You'll never be the same when you visit Israel.

[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:33.920]  Call 800-515-4749. And more on the road to the White House,
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.960]  where Republican presidential candidate John McCain will be busy between now and election day.
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.800]  Here's Warren Levinson. New Hampshire has revived John McCain before
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:47.840]  in the Republican primaries of 2000 and 2008, and the campaign makes a symbolic visit to a
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:51.760]  town meeting in Peterborough on the last Sunday before election day. Before that,
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:56.400]  a return to Pennsylvania, where he campaigned yesterday and a late night rally in crucial Florida.
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:59.520]  The pundits of Canada's South McCain told supporters again,
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:05.600]  When I see this momentum, when I see this great support, I know, I know we're going to win.
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:09.280]  I know we're going to win. Warren Levinson with the McCain campaign, New York.
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:13.120]  And it's a small group of people who would willingly stick a pumpkin on their head and
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:18.480]  run down a crowded city street naked, at least in part. That's because it's illegal.
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:23.280]  Police in Boulder, Colorado, ticketed about a thousand people for making such a run Friday night,
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:30.400]  despite cries of protest from the crowd. For more news and analysis, log on to irnnews.com.
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:35.360]  I'm Errol Squires, inventor of Relieve One Day Cold Sore Symptom Treatment.
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:39.520]  I invented Relieve because I wanted a very effective, natural treatment for cold sores
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:44.720]  that work really fast. Relieve works so well and so fast for me, my family and friends.
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:49.040]  I wanted to help other people who suffer from cold sores. I think people are smart enough to
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:54.240]  know if something works. If you suffer from cold sores, try Relieve and find out if it works for
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:59.840]  you. Relieve is comprised of botanical extracts and is guaranteed by Relieve Now at all major
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:06.880]  stores. Boeing's commercial airplane factories began getting back to normal tonight, now that
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:13.360]  the Machinist Union has accepted a new contract. A key issue of the eight-week strike was job
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:19.760]  security. Tom Robowski is the president of the local union. You can't please everyone 100% of
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:27.920]  the time. I think that a 74% acceptance is a strong, strong acceptance by the membership,
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:32.640]  and they feel good about it. And more on the run for the White House, where Barack Obama is
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:39.840]  campaigning with the boss today as he barnstorms across Ohio two days before Election Day. Here's
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:48.000]  Mark Smith. With Obama running to make history, Bruce Springsteen's his warm-up act in Cleveland,
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:53.360]  one of three cities Obama's hitting here. Polls get the Democrat a narrow lead in a state that
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:58.080]  decided the outcome four years ago, but he's telling supporters take nothing for granted.
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:02.560]  I need you to close the deal because the time for change is coming, you know it,
[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:07.440]  and we've got a righteous win in our backs. Coming full circle, Obama ends this day in
[1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:13.760]  Florida, where the run for the White House was decided in 2000. Mark Smith with the Obama campaign,
[1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:19.840]  Columbus, Ohio. And Afghan officials are waiting to hear from kidnappers who seized the brother of
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:25.680]  Afghanistan's Finance Minister Friday. No word yet on who they are or what they may want.
[1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:34.080]  I'm Joe Lee Jordan for IRN USA Radio News. Senator Barkley, I presume. Governor Ventura,
[1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:38.640]  what are you doing down here? Looking for a way out for me and all these taxpayers.
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:43.280]  Are we where I think we are? Yes, it appears we are at the bottom of a very deep hole.
[1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:48.080]  Did we do something wrong? Not us. It seems some schemers on Wall Street dug this hole,
[1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:52.000]  and we're down here to get them out of it. I don't see too many investment bankers or
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:56.240]  insurance company executives down here. I don't see L. Frank in here either. Senator,
[1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:02.480]  I said we're down here with taxpayers. I don't see Norm Coleman down here either. Well, since
[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:07.760]  Norm Coleman became senator, the federal deficit went up $3 trillion. Governor, you and I know
[1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:13.680]  the first rule of getting out of a hole. Stop digging. During my administration, we ran budget
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:18.960]  surpluses. And we gave money back to taxpayers. That's the kind of thinking we need in Washington.

[1:06:52.240 --> 1:07:06.800]  show. Call Alex now toll free at 877-590-5525. Now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:13.760]  All right. I want to take a lot of phone calls on the election, the economy, the new world order
[1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:20.480]  being openly announced by all these world leaders. But this is a microcosm of everything we're
[1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:26.800]  dealing with that I'm about to cover here briefly. A caller calls in and I see it in the news
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:33.680]  every day. I scan hundreds of newspapers and he says, yeah, my wife went in to the health department
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:39.360]  department to get the exemption for vaccination and they have them for certain jobs. They claim
[1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:44.880]  you have to do it. They have it for the public schools, the private schools. They claim it's
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:51.440]  the law. It's the law. It's the law. And I said, sir, just Google Texas vaccine exemption form
[1:07:51.440 --> 1:08:00.080]  or just add your state's name. And for Texas, I got 56,200 hits. Texas vaccine exemption form.
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:05.600]  Texas vaccine exemption, state of Texas, the state of Texas law grants and acknowledges,
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:10.720]  well, see that's the new system. They grant us because we're slaves and acknowledges the rights
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:17.040]  of parents to exempt their children or themselves from vaccinations because the vaccine exemption
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:24.800]  forms for reasons of conscious including and you can go through. It's a dshs.state.texas.us
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:33.040]  forward slash immunization forward slash school forward slash default dot s h t m but but just
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:38.960]  Google Texas vaccine exemption form. Now, now here's the issue. Every year in August, right
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:45.120]  before school starts on Austin news on Dallas news on New York news everywhere, they announce
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:50.800]  it's the law. You'll be arrested. Thousands show up for free immunization at the local Zilker Park
[1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:59.760]  where thousands show up at the, you know, Texas stadium and in up in Dallas or thousands show
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:07.200]  up at the health department in St. George County, Maryland. And on hand was the state attorney
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:12.240]  making sure they follow the law. And then there were images just in that case in Maryland. We
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:19.680]  called and got the guy on. This is at the start of school this year. And it shows police dogs
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:24.960]  barking police and riot gear because they got a lot of threatening phone calls and over 2000
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:30.080]  children and thousands of parents lined up with these mobile vans being injected and parents crying
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:34.720]  on the news. You can go pull these up was on CNN, ABC, everywhere going, I just think it's wrong.
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:39.280]  It's the law. We got to take these. I don't like these. I can't believe it. You know, vaccines
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:44.080]  are can make you sick. I can't believe they're threatening to arrest us. And I had the guy on
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:48.640]  the state attorney and he said, well, it's true. I don't vaccinate my children and started
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:53.280]  laughing. You can go YouTube that it's, it's been posted. People take the audio of it and
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:58.960]  post it to video on the web. And he said, well, you're right. There is no law. And he said,
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:03.360]  oh, you want to be a lawyer. You're real smart. Yeah, it's our policy. And then we kick you out
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:10.960]  for truancy and then criminal charges come in. But on the news nationwide, they advertised
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:15.680]  it's the law got to do it. Police dogs barking at the people as they were herded into the stadium.
[1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:22.320]  Now, people also email me and say, I'm a liar. It's the law. You've got to take it. No, you don't.
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.960]  Not to be a doctor, not to be a nurse, not to go to college, not to go to public school,
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:32.400]  not to go anywhere. And by the way, then they try this idiot line of, well, we've got to lie and
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:37.520]  say it's the law because you can infect other children if you don't have it. Well, wait a
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:43.520]  minute. If they're protected with a smallpox shot or a flu shot or whatever it is, MMR,
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:50.160]  measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, hepatitis on and on and on again. Of course, tetanus isn't even
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:55.760]  communicable. So reportedly for other people, what the point is, then your child is protected.
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:00.880]  And by the way, the last six years in a row now, they haven't even guessed a year before
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:08.560]  what mutated version of the flu shot to produce. So when you take it, it does nothing. By the way,
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:16.880]  here's another one. Google flu shot Alzheimer's. Hundreds of studies. And the lowest study shows
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.640]  a doubling in Alzheimer's for those that have taken more than three flu shots in their life.
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:24.640]  And they got some studies show a five-fold. Oh, don't believe me? Just Google it. And you're
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:31.520]  going to be on government sites, research facilities. It's all there. Now imagine if they're lying to
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:37.280]  you about that, lying to you and saying it's the law, you've got to take shots. I mean, they see
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:43.680]  PS people's kids, they kidnap people's kids because the parents don't know. They do this all the time.
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:50.080]  We have a rogue criminal government that cons us and manipulates us. Now there's no law that you've
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:58.960]  got to have a vaccines. And so it's a fraud that they even tell you that you then need a waiver
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:04.000]  form. Okay, let's get some calls and we'll come back and take the rest of them. Joe in Wisconsin,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:11.360]  you're on the air. Go ahead, Joe. The sacrum study, didn't they use cancer rats also? I just
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:16.160]  thought I'd throw that out. But I was going to make the point that government is your psychotic
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:21.760]  neighbor. Now most people don't think your psychotic controlled freak piece of filth neighbor
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.160]  with no accountability in a black uniform with a machine gun. Oh, yeah. But most people,
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:31.680]  they don't go for people like that, individuals, but they will go for organizations. So I was
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:37.360]  going to make the point that if Ted Bundy was your neighbor, do you A, want him to like you? Or would
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:44.320]  you say, B, Ted, I think I'll pass on that barbecue. Most people would say, yeah, we'll pass on it.
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:51.760]  And if you are across the street from him, one side, the neighbor he does like, and on the other
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:57.280]  side, this guy does not go along with my kind of thinking, I don't like him. So who would you
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:03.680]  rather spend time with, the one he does approve of, or the one he doesn't? My point is, if we have
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:09.120]  a psychotic government, why is everyone trying to be liked by it? Why are they trying to be
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:15.600]  favored by it? Wouldn't you close the up to Tony Soprano and, you know, you get what you deserve?
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:19.920]  Absolutely. They do it out of cowardice. Let's jam in one more. Matt in Canada, thanks for holding
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:27.440]  your on the ear. Hey, Alex, how's it going? Pretty good. Just watching Total Criminality take over.
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:34.560]  I'm really freaked out. Nice to talk to you. Anyways, I had a question for you. If, you know,
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:39.760]  we're putting our money all into gold, who's to say that they couldn't create like a gold
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:43.920]  seizure like they did in 1933? They could do anything. The point is, if your money's in the
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.480]  bank, they can grab it that much easier. Well, if you have the gold in your safe at home, like,
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:55.840]  can they come with like black cop uniforms, come to your door? Hey, they come with black
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:01.280]  cop with the black uniform cops and take your children. Sometimes if you don't vaccinate,
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:05.680]  because the cops are dumb and don't know there's no law and the CPS workers get bounties on your
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:11.200]  kids heads. This is all eugenics. This is a government taking over. You know, the Nazis
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:15.120]  in the Soviets took people's children. I mean, this is a rogue criminal government. So there's
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:19.040]  no way to completely protect yourself. It's just we're asking the question, is it safer to have
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:23.200]  some gold and silver, not all your money in that, than to just keep it all in the bank?
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:27.040]  Yeah, it's better to get it out of the bank. But like, if we get the gold in our hands,
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:30.400]  we should probably hide it pretty good. Yeah, I think most of us don't have the problem of
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:35.520]  having a whole bunch of extra money to have that going on. But, you know, look, bottom line, sir,
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:41.120]  that that's the whole point. The government doesn't follow a law. It's a private management group for
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:46.160]  private offshore corporations to suck off us. And they use high tech brainwashing and public
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:51.200]  relations to neutralize and confuse the public. And we're going into hardcore tyranny right now.
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:54.240]  I mean, no matter who gets elected, it's just going to get worse. They're puppets. They don't
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:58.320]  run anything. The New World Order is in control. We're not going to get our power back until we
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:04.320]  admit that. And I see it like locally here in Vancouver on the trains, the transit cops all
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:07.760]  have tasers. That's right. And they catch you without a ticket. If you don't have a ticket,
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:13.920]  they'll just taser you. They taser you and they say, and then the police chief, the transit
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:18.480]  had gotten in trouble. And he said, yes, we're going to punish you. It's cattle prods.
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:24.000]  And tasers have killed almost 400 people they admit to. And so what do they do? They say,
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.200]  we're going to go from 50,000 volts to 75,000 volts. And you're going to like it. You're going
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:36.240]  to learn how to be a pathetic slave. Okay, I mean, look, 20, 30 years ago, and I've seen the studies
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:40.400]  on this. Americans would help somebody in need. They would help somebody being mugged or attacked
[1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:44.560]  or killed or bleeding to death in the street. They don't now on average because they've been trained.
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:49.840]  They watch four or five hours of TV a day. They wait for somebody else to do it. They're cowardly.
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:57.840]  Stop being cowards. Get angry. And stop defending the rat infested government. It's just stealing
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:01.760]  everything. I mean, here in Texas, they said, there's no toll roads. There's no plan for toll
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:07.360]  roads. The company is at foreign and then now they're doing it all. They just lie, lie, lie, lie,
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:11.680]  lie, lie. Take the neighbor analogy. What if you had a neighbor who lied to you a thousand times?
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.680]  Neighbor you'd caught doing all these horrible things. I mean, the government gets caught
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:19.840]  every week shipping heroin and cocaine in. It's just a, I mean, the Texas youth commission runs
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:24.640]  giant rape rooms with children in them. I mean, just the whole government's totally filled with
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:34.000]  scum. They ride back with warrior calls. Stay with us. Senator Barkley, I presume. Governor Ventura,
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.560]  what are you doing down here? Looking for a way out for me and all these taxpayers.
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:43.680]  Are we where I think we are? Yes, it appears we are at the bottom of a very deep hole. Did we do
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.960]  something wrong? Not us. It seems some schemers on Wall Street dug this hole and we're down here to
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:53.920]  get them out of it. I don't see too many investment bankers or insurance company executives down here.
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:17:00.080]  I don't see L. Frank in here either. Senator, I said we're down here with taxpayers. I don't see
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:04.800]  Norm Coleman down here either. Well, since Norm Coleman became senator, the federal deficit
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:11.360]  went up $3 trillion. Governor, you and I know the first rule of getting out of a hole. Stop digging.
[1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:16.800]  During my administration, we ran budget surpluses. And we gave money back to taxpayers. That's the
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:22.320]  kind of thinking we need in Washington. Please go to senatorbarkley.com to make a contribution
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:28.800]  and help take back our country. I'm senator Dean Barkley and I approve this message. And so do I.

[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.520]  A survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die. It is a place out of the mainstream of events
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:46.720]  that contains the means to survive without outside support. A place where you find shelter,
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:53.360]  protection, food, water, medicine and warmth you prepared for yourself. It is defensible and is
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:59.040]  put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers will be. Ragnar Benson also said,
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:05.200]  Why retreat? This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer. If they
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:10.640]  could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they are now.
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:15.440]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat. Something completely impossible for the
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:21.760]  average American to do. Act now before it's too late. In order to find your new high-security,

[1:20:56.160 --> 1:21:06.000]  years. Just Google Alex Jones radio 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005 and I laid out exactly how they would
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  implode the derivatives, how they would give the banks unlimited governmental power, how they would
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:15.520]  then call for a world solution, the banks being given global government power. They're even calling
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:20.640]  in a new world order now and then exactly what I said would happen has now happened. Why? I have
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:26.560]  the IMF and World Bank documents. We published them. We posted them. We talked about it. We know
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:30.720]  what we're talking about here. All right. Look, I'm going to rampage through your calls. I'm going
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:36.240]  to play this clip of a psycho schizophrenic beating a toddler to death. It's coming up later.
[1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:43.200]  Beating a toddler to death and people just drive by and nobody stopped to help. And again,
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:47.840]  this issue goes to everything we're facing as a society. So that's coming up.
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:52.720]  Jim and Syracuse, I guess that's in New York. You're on the air. Go ahead, Jim.
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:59.520]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Alex. I listen to your show every day. Actually, I listen to all the GCN shows every
[1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:06.320]  day. I'm a member of the prison clan and I got all your movies. And wow, all I can say is wow,
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:11.280]  it's on the news every day. New world order, this new world government, new world currency.
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:17.360]  And I'm still being laughed at. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, it's funny. Haha. Yeah, great.
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:22.240]  Around in April, I told my dad, I worked with my dad, I told him and a guy, we were talking,
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:27.600]  I told him, you know, around October, we're going to find out that our government is bankrupting.
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:32.720]  Oh boy, they had such a hard, even though I knew it then, they had a hearty laugh and they were
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:37.360]  almost rolling on the ground. But um, yeah, they laugh at anybody that tells them they have a
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:43.120]  responsibility. Go ahead. That's two converts. They are. Anyway, you know, so they woke up after
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:48.800]  that will be good men out here. Good man. I'm a good man. Uh, and all I can say about a woman
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:54.240]  being raped or a baby being beaten, not on my shift. I don't care. I'd stop it. I don't care
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:59.360]  if it was a cop with a gun, you're not going to rape a woman around me. A good man is a good man,
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:04.480]  regardless of the new world order. Well, now they're even griping at the cops. Finally cops
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:09.040]  landed in the helicopter and the guy was still stomping. So they shot him and then they criticized
[1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:14.160]  that. They should have shot the piece of filth. But the point is, is that what happened to us is
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:18.080]  a country. This could never have happened. We had so much wealth and so much liberty because we
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:22.000]  wouldn't put up with being slaves. People knew government was bad. They knew it was bad to have
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:26.400]  it become big. But, but you're saying your dad and the guy that he works with that you warned
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:32.480]  about the banks months before it happened, they now woke up. Yes, they did. Well, you ought to go
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:36.320]  give them the video. You ought to go give them the video clips that are on YouTube of where I was
[1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:40.480]  warning on Austin TV months before 9-11 saying the government's going to blow up the World Trade
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:45.200]  Centers and blame it on bin Laden. Give them that and see what they say. Folks, we know what's
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:49.840]  going to happen. Okay. I'm telling you, they're already poisoning your water and your food.
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:55.280]  The average person in government isn't aware and isn't involved. Okay. It's compartmentalized. I know
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:24:00.800]  it's hard to believe, but it's true. Go to the documents. Chad, in Canada, you're on the air,
[1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:06.720]  Chad. Hello, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Thanks for calling. First time caller. Now,
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:12.960]  you mentioned fluoride and I'd like to basically, you know, state some credibility here. I have a
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:18.640]  degree in chemistry and biology from a Laurentian university up here in Canada. And I'd like to
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:24.640]  point out to your listeners that fluoride is actually deposited in all glands, but more so in
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:32.400]  the pineal gland, up to 21,000 parts per million than any other tissue in the body, including teeth
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:36.960]  and bone. And they, of course, call that gland the seat of the soul. That's right. Even in my own
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:42.240]  Catholic religion, they call that the seat of the soul, the eye of horus. And you know, it's
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:46.720]  interesting. Well, it regulates the other hormones involved in the... They're toning and melanin.
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:53.120]  That's right. And also, you know, our amphibian friends actually have a retina and a crystal and
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:58.640]  a, you know, attached to this hormone that's seated in the both hemispheres of our brain.
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:05.600]  Well, sodium fluoride attacks the entire, all the glands, all the bones. And over 90% of EPA
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:12.240]  scientists and toxicologists, two years ago, I've had the head guy on, signed a letter to the head
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:17.920]  of the EPA saying, we've got to get this out of the water. It's toxic poison. That's right. And
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:24.560]  it's also thanks recently to the meticulous research of Dr. Jennifer Luke from the University
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:30.400]  of Surrey in England that states that the pineal gland is attacked the most by the fluoride. And
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:33.760]  you ever get that feeling, you're thinking of somebody and bang, they call. You know, that's
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:41.280]  your psychic sense that's responsible for this signal of that person who is thinking of you
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:46.000]  and bang, they call it. And this is what they're attacking. They basically want to change the
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.880]  psychic awareness of the human nature. Well, I know this. You make great points. I know this.
[1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:56.960]  Most of the studies show a 20 point IQ reduction. Some studies show higher, some show lower, but
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:01.040]  there's literally 1000 studies on fluoride on average. The IQ studies, just Google it,
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:06.320]  just type IQ reduction fluoride. You'll be reading mainline government stuff. Now, listen,
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:11.040]  in the fifties, we had widespread fluoridization by about 6% of the country. Now it's about 70.
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:17.120]  And they found very quickly on horse farms and cattle farms to not give them fluoridated water
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:20.960]  because it was killing them. And I've got a bunch of news articles about that now. I mean,
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:29.680]  it kills the horses and cows, folks. So incredible. Thank you so much for the call, sir. I appreciate
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:32.720]  it. I'm cutting all these great callers off, so I have a chance to get to everybody.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:34.800]  Bobby in California, you're on the air, Bobby.
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:43.120]  Hi, Bruce. I'll tell everyone that I now refer to my cell phone as a cancer phone.
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:47.840]  Like, pass me my cancer phone, or can I use your cancer phone? And I think once you do,
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:52.960]  that's just like cigarettes or cancers, people call them cancer sticks. And statistically,
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:57.360]  people are better off smoking two packs of cigarettes and putting their cell phone up to
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:01.120]  their head. That was a huge British study by the government. It came out about a month ago.
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:06.640]  Yeah, they found that regular cell phone use, I forget how many hours it set a month,
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:09.680]  but it was moderate, is more dangerous than a heavy smoker.
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:14.480]  And people are crazy that they should only use speaker phones. Don't put that thing up to your
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:19.680]  head. Well, the scientists, the brain surgeons and people, even have names now for the specific
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:24.720]  cell phone tumor you get. And it's always on the side of the head you tend to use the phone on.
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:28.800]  Yeah, and I had an idea for the future, like maybe in the prison,
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:34.720]  planet forum, maybe you could, someone could post all the propositions and, you know, throughout
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:39.520]  all the states, and maybe your listeners could go through and vote whether they think is anti-New
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:44.960]  World Order or pro-New World Order, just in the future. But another thing, I had a problem with
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:51.200]  Webster Tarkley. I think he kind of oversimplifies everything. And like he says that Barack Obama
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:56.640]  was the chosen one, and Hillary Clinton was the chosen one. She's the one that was meeting with
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:03.360]  Rupert Murdoch every day. You're certainly right that a lot of big support for her from the system.
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:09.040]  But I mean, Barack Obama is raising money almost two to one against McCain. Again, three times the
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:14.720]  Wall Street money that McCain got. And I'm not saying go vote for McCain, folks. The point is,
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:20.720]  the establishment's going to put in who they want coming up Tuesday. And regardless, I mean,
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:25.760]  here's what's scary about Barack Obama. He's calling for this million man spy force of
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:30.960]  high schoolers to spy on their parents. And we played the clip the first hour. He's running 30
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:35.760]  minute infomercials where he's called the chosen one and the savior of the world. They're writing
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:41.440]  editorials calling him the Messiah. And I mean, anytime I see people being called the Messiah,
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:48.400]  I get really upset and I get really worried. So I just feel sorry for black folks because a lot
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:51.760]  of them are very proud and very happy and thinking, man, this will bring a bunch of equality. It's
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:57.360]  not. He's an evil globalist, so it's going to be blamed on black folks when it has nothing to do
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:03.920]  with color. And he's going to get so much through of the New World Order agenda. The left is sick
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:07.760]  of George Bush for eight years. Now the globalists give us a leftist. Then we'll get sick of him.
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:13.120]  They'll give us a right winger. They're not left wing or right wing in their actual actions.
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:17.600]  I'm Alex Jones. 30 more minutes of hard hitting information right after this quick
[1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:24.080]  news break for stations out there. Stay with me. The websites, again, areinfowars.com and

[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:34.800]  will be right back. Lead from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings,
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:40.480]  vaccines, arsenic in the water. These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:45.360]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health. Many health problems
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:49.520]  have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss,
[1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:54.480]  high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases,
[1:29:54.480 --> 1:29:59.120]  chronic fatigue, and more. Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:03.840]  the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins. That's why there's puricleer
[1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:09.280]  from Ripple Creek. Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients, including a cilantro extract

[1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:59.040]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over. They are called Illuminati, elite,
[1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:04.320]  proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth. They are of
[1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:09.440]  the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago. Everything they have built over the centuries,
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:14.080]  the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:18.880]  the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now
[1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:28.480]  been delegated to us. Visit our website at unveilingthem.com. That's-u-n-v-e-i-l-i-n-g-them.com.

[1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:38.560]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:42.880]  The reflection blinded our camera. We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and

[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:58.480]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:04.880]  But first I want to play the audio from this video.
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:20.160]  So, out of California last week, and this goes to the issue of a spectator population,
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:26.800]  a cowardly population, a population that has literally lived their lives in front of a television set
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:32.960]  sitting on their hind ends, living through other people. You got a schizophrenic, a nut,
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:37.280]  who thought that the two-year-old baby was demon-possessed, so he's beating it to death,
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:40.080]  can pull up more detailed press reports and we're about to play. But reportedly,
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:45.200]  this went on for more than 30 minutes, stomping the child until it was unrecognizable
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:52.000]  on a major interstate highway. Hundreds of cars passing, 911 called over and over again.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:59.120]  If I see somebody stomping on a baby, I am going to pull over and I am going to attack them.
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:04.400]  I am going to stop them. And that is weird. That is seen as radical today,
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:07.440]  when that was normal a long time ago. And again, I'm not saying I'm a tough guy,
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:12.560]  not saying, I mean, that's what's bizarre about it is that I guess I am a tough guy,
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:16.960]  that I would do this when this is just normal. I mean, I haven't been castrated, basically.
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:22.320]  And I told the story in the first hour about five years ago, I'm with my wife and my son.
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  He was a little baby then, and I'm at a LeMatte Line restaurant in North Austin,
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.200]  and I go to the bathroom, or I would have been out there quicker, and I hear all this noise
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:34.960]  when I come out, and this lady is choking with about 20 people around her. It was a busy night,
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:40.720]  like seven o'clock at night, and they were all screaming 911, 911, 911, call 911.
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:45.520]  And they were all arguing over who was going to call 911. And so this goes on about 30 more
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:49.600]  seconds. I start saying, do the Heimlich, and they would scream at me, you call 911. That's
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.760]  what we do. We call, you know, it was all this yelling. So I had to start shoving through people.
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:57.760]  Some guy kind of shoved me. I had to shove him over. Then there was yelling, but I just ignored
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:02.000]  him. I went in. I had to push her family away from her because they were just waving their arms.
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:08.400]  And again, I had been on swim team. Well, the time I guess was about seven years old, but
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:12.480]  that part doesn't matter. The point is when I was in junior high, they offered, you know,
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:18.560]  stay late and take a, you know, two day course. So I knew the Heimlich maneuver.
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:24.160]  And so I got in there and I got under and I got the piece of bread out with two heaves. And then I got
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:29.840]  out of there. And some people were mad at me. Others were like, looking at me like, I can't
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:34.560]  believe how great you are. You're a hero. Stay. Oh my God. And I was like, man, these are like
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:40.640]  cult members. They are so pathetic. But I've seen the reports. We interviewed, I don't know, three
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:46.640]  or four years ago, the police spokesman, I think it was out of Toronto. And this woman had been
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:51.360]  beaten and raped with a lead pipe. She'd been beaten to have a lead pipe and raped. She was
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:57.760]  naked in the street on a major throw affair and a major telecom company had the boss on a fourth
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:01.840]  floor laughing at her in the street saying, no, don't call 911. We'll have to file a report.
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:06.960]  It was the dehumanization. They didn't even see her as a person. And a lot of things go into this,
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:12.000]  seeing millions of simulated murders and violence on TV. He sensitizes us. All these horror films,
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  he's sensitizing us that death isn't real or isn't a big deal. Everybody else sees it. Oh,
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:21.280]  that's a job for the government to do. But there's so many cases. It was a case, what, five,
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:29.920]  six years ago, up off of William Cannon at 35 by that gas station up there. And I lived over near
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:34.000]  there at the time, but also saw it on the news. But I talked to folks that had actually seen it
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:39.680]  after they got there. An Austin cop had been hit by a car and he was there. I want to say almost
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:43.920]  half an hour. You can go pull the article up if you want. And he was bleeding to death in the
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:49.280]  street. And everybody just drove past. They just drove past. They just drove past. And it's gotten
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:55.520]  so bad that Texas and other states have had to pass failure to render aid laws, where if you see
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:59.040]  a car flipping, people get hurt and you see it happen, you've got to stop and render aid.
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.320]  Now, I mean, this is pathetic. This is pathetic, but this is the cancer
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:07.040]  destroying us. Go ahead and play this horrible clip. People need to hear it.
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:13.280]  On a rural road south of Modesto, California, drivers stopped when they saw a horrific sight.
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:19.280]  A man was severely kicking, beating and stomping a toddler to death. Several drivers stopped and
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.600]  called 911. The San Francisco County Sheriff's Department began responding to this call,
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:28.640]  but the ground units were quite a few minutes away from arriving at the scene.
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:33.040]  Modesto authorities say a police helicopter happened to be in the area at the time of the attack.
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:40.080]  Saw the assault from the air and they both made the decision to land the helicopter in a cow pasture
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.800]  just to the side of the road. Very risky landing. The officer approached the man and
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:49.360]  authorities say he was forced to fire. The man died at the scene. The child was taken to the
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:54.240]  hospital, but later died. One witness says the suspect had been making comments about the child
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:58.960]  having demons during the incident. Authorities say the toddler's injuries were so severe,
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:03.680]  he'll be identified through blood or DNA tests. Investigators are still trying to figure out
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.640]  whether the man was related to that child. Diane Kepley, Associated Press. All right,
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:12.560]  so there's the AP report on you go pull up more detailed reports. The point is, is the guy was
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:18.720]  a schizophrenic. He went crazy. He was killing this child and people pulled down the road.
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:23.040]  They stopped. They drove by and they cowardly sat there and watched it. I mean, it's not even
[1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:28.080]  the thing of being tough or having courage. My instinct is, I see somebody stomping on a baby's
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:35.600]  head. I am going to tear him to pieces. I'm going to tear him to pieces. And I mean,
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:41.760]  it was, that's just, isn't that normal? Isn't that just what you're supposed to do?
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:48.160]  But no, these people were so domesticated, so enslaved. They waited for the police, you know,
[1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:53.280]  Chicago has five, six, seven, depending on the year. This year, it's all time records,
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:57.680]  highest crime rate in the country, higher than the other part of the country, New York City.
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:01.280]  These are the places where the public's disarmed. They have five, six, seven, eight locks on their
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:07.280]  doors. They cower in fear. The criminals run everything. The police are basically thugs in
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:11.840]  these cities and I've experienced it. New York police just got caught and then lying about it,
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.480]  then police blew the whistle inside. We're sodomizing some guy for running from him. I mean,
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.600]  you know, it's just evil spreading. And thank God, I'm still in a place where people aren't
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:27.040]  completely domesticated, you know, like Texas, but a lot of places in the country, you shoot somebody
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:31.280]  that enters your own house. You go to jail in England. If you defend yourself in any way, they
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:36.240]  throw the book at you. They want the message that you are to be a jellyfish slave. They want
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:44.560]  little chicken slaves. And I want to say something else about 9-Eleven Truth. You know, I just tell
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:48.240]  it like it is. When I found out Bill Clinton's people had been involved bomb in Oklahoma City,
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:52.480]  I exposed it. And that made a film about it and there's so much evidence of what time to get into
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:57.360]  it. And there's over 200 examples that are declassified. This is where it's admitted. Do you hear me?
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:02.880]  Where criminal elements of our government staged terror attacks to blame it on foreign governments,
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:06.880]  enemies, or domestic groups as a pretext to crack down on them or enslave them.
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.880]  And so when 9-Eleven happened, we looked at the evidence. It's clearly an inside job.
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:16.960]  The other side tries to lie about us or put out this info or whatever. Look,
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:23.360]  it's upsetting that criminals in our government staged the attacks.
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:32.160]  It's upsetting that it's in several official Army field manuals that we posted up at infowars.com
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:38.320]  that are on WikiLeaks that the media has covered where Army captains are taught in special forces
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:43.040]  how to stage terror attacks. I mean, that's like a canteen in an M16. It's just part of what they
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:48.880]  do. It's part of their basic training. I mean, I'm not going to live in denial. I'm not going to,
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:52.480]  because I don't want to believe that and that's scary, lie to myself and then say it doesn't
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:59.040]  exist. We're a nation living in denial. People denied the small minority that was for the
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:03.360]  bank or takeover and said, oh, Alex, they're going to use this to prop up bad mortgages.
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:07.200]  And of course, they have it now and they're keeping the money. I was right about that because I read
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:12.960]  the documents. I address things according to what the facts are. I go, I look at the information,
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:19.520]  and no matter how horrible it is, I cover it and I deal with it. And it's just that simple.
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:27.280]  So I'm begging everybody out there listening to me tonight around the world to start taking
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:32.160]  action to stop being so cowardly. A lot of people I talk to know the government's criminal, know
[1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:35.440]  it's corrupt, but they're afraid to speak out and get involved and they say, Alex,
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:39.440]  we're just so glad you're there. We're so glad you're doing the job for us. Folks,
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:43.520]  me just putting out the information isn't going to save us. It's all of you taking action. And by
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:48.880]  the way, you shouldn't be in the mindset of just believing me. You should go check out what I'm
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:52.960]  saying and that goes for people that disagree with me. If you agree with me, you should go check
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:57.360]  out what I'm saying so you have the documents and the facts for yourself. But if you disagree with
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:03.360]  me, you should go and prove me wrong. Prove that I'm a liar. Prove that I'm not telling the truth.
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:06.640]  You know what you're going to find out? You're going to find out I'm telling you the truth.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:16.240]  Okay? Bottom line, folks, look at history. Look at how tyrannical and abusive governments get.
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:20.240]  Look at how the bad things they do when people lay down and live in denial.
[1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:26.320]  Night is falling, tyranny is upon us, but we can take liberty back. We can defend our children
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:30.720]  and our future if we get involved. Final segment, we'll go straight to your phone calls out of the
[1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:36.160]  gate. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol

[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:48.880]  All right, final segment. Look, I'm not tooting my horn. Remember about two weeks ago?
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:56.400]  It was on a Friday. A lady in Texas claimed that an ATM she was attacked by a black guy who carved
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:03.680]  a Barack Obama bee on her face and sexually assaulted her. I read the article. Right after it
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:07.280]  came out, it went on air on the weekday show and said, this is going to end up being staged.
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:12.720]  I'm sure of it. Look, the bee is backwards. She carved it in a mirror. That eye in the swollen.
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:16.800]  That's makeup. She didn't want a medical report. It's fake. Two days later, it was a minute it
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:22.320]  was fake. Look, I'm not that smart, folks. I understand baloney. I'm a real investigator,
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:26.080]  and I'm telling you I've been investigating the government, and they're a pack of criminals.
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:30.000]  Now, what did that woman do? This isn't about that puppet Barack Obama. The point is,
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.600]  she ran a false flag attack. Now, that's right out of the Army Field Manual. They ought to go
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.200]  put her in special forces. That's what they do. The Russians do it. All these governments do it.
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:47.280]  And I'm sick of people living in denial. Government-sponsored terror is real. It's happening.
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:51.360]  And I had to take the heat day one going on there on 9-11, seven years ago and say it was an inside
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:57.200]  job. And we've exposed it to such an extent they may not stage more terror in the future. And I salute
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:01.680]  all of you who are in 9-11 Truth and All You Go Through. And all these national TV programs attacking
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:06.400]  me, I don't care, because the truth is what matters. And I'm willing to sacrifice myself and my name
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:12.400]  to get the truth out. But in the end, as Mark Twain said, patriots end up winning. What he said
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:16.160]  in the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned. But in time,
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:20.080]  when his cause succeeds, the time had joined him, because then it cost nothing to be a patriot.
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:23.440]  Let's rampage through your calls. Chris, in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:32.320]  Speaking of the pineal gland, pineal comes from pine, or pine cone, and end on a pine cone. Looks
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:38.880]  like a lovis, or the thousand-pedal lovis, which is spoken of in yoga. And Paramahansa Yogananda,
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:45.280]  who brought yoga to America in the 20s, wrote in his book Autobiography of a Yogi that's focused
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:52.080]  on the third eyes. Essentially, I'm paraphrasing, is a way to make your life a meditation. And I
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:59.040]  took that to heart, and I very much can speak from experience that it's a way that the New World
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:08.000]  Order, the pyrons are using to bring down our awareness of the pineal gland.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:14.560]  Well, look, bottom line, scientifically. Fluoride drunk for more than just a few years. You can
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:22.000]  go read the studies. It gives you a 20-point IQ reduction. So, there you go. Go ahead, sir.
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:30.640]  Let him go. No, I appreciate your call. Let's go ahead now and talk to Charles in
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:35.760]  California. You're on the air. Actually, I went to the wrong caller. I got so many here.
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:37.840]  Charles in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.960]  Hey, Alex. Keep planting those seeds, man. I listen to you every day. I'm only 21 years old.
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:46.640]  I could be doing a lot of other things, but this is the most important thing.
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:51.760]  I called you on Friday. Just want to finish up that point about the Obama gun thing.
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:56.880]  My thought was that they're going to use that event, and to get everybody to go along with
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:00.560]  the gun banning that he's going to do, because we know he's going to ban all guns, handgun,
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:05.040]  shotgun. We know he said he wants to ban a lot of them. I mean, just, oh, but you don't like
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:08.880]  black people. It has nothing to do with that. He's a gun grabbing, but so is McCain.
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:15.600]  Okay. Also, another thing is you mentioned Aspartame, which is an excitotoxin. The other
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:19.920]  excitotoxin, which is just destroying this whole country. I'm sure you know about it,
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:27.520]  monosodium glutamate, MSG, which is basically an everything hidden in 70 plus ingredients,
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:32.640]  and everybody needs to keep an eye on whoever's listening and believes this stuff. And everyone
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:37.200]  should listen to Alex Jones, trust everything he says. It's all, you know, he doesn't trust,
[1:51:37.200 --> 1:51:41.440]  like he says, research it all. It's all out there, and I just want to thank you again,
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:45.520]  and I appreciate all your guests. Hey, we appreciate you, my friend. Maggie in Texas,
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:54.000]  you're on the air. Hello, Alex. Hi. I just wanted to let you know that a serious campaign to
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:52:02.080]  challenge foradation in Austin, to get rid of it, i.e., is... Well, I mean, even the EPA and FDA
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:06.560]  have had to admit that it's forced medication. It's illegal. They've removed it in Europe.
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:10.240]  It's admittedly deadly poison, and it's up to the people to get out there and do it.
[1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:14.640]  I mean, look, your children are being assaulted. You're being assaulted, and we sit here
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:20.000]  nationwide, like the people that sat there for 30 minutes calling 911, while this guy beat this
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:25.440]  baby to death in the street. I mean, it's that attitude of laying down. It's got to stop. I
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:31.920]  can't do it all. Exactly. Well, a bunch of us are very mad and very upset, and we are getting on this,
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:37.280]  and our campaign, which is fundamentally an education campaign to begin with,
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:41.040]  will begin to move very... How do folks get involved? Do you have a website like
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:46.080]  Austin's Against Floor Out or something? You know what? I've purchased the domain name.
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:54.080]  It's not up yet, though, but you can... People who are interested can email to this address
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:53:05.200]  fluoride.info. That is f-o-l-u-o-r-i-d-e dot i-n-f-o at yahoo.com.
[1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:08.880]  Okay, great. But people usually just take action, period, on all these issues.
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:14.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Oklahoma. James, you're on the air.
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:20.560]  Hi, Alex. This is James in Oklahoma. I just wanted to concur with all that you said about
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:25.840]  the mind control with the mass media and this and that. The nation of people under hypnosis
[1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:30.000]  from television? That's a scientific fact. Who are jellyfish? That's why they can't do anything.
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:36.720]  What I wanted to bring up was last night's episode of the new Knight Rider series.
[1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:42.800]  They were going to go bust these terrorists that were going to take this thermonuclear-looking
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:48.320]  bomb in the back of a 5-ton military truck and blow up a dam. And when they were kind of leading
[1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:52.800]  into it telling him what his mission was and this and that, they openly referred to the terrorist
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:58.640]  as constitutionalists. And anybody that has t-vote that or wants to go back and check it can do it.
[1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.560]  But they referred to people that are constitutionalists. They compared it with terrorists.
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:06.480]  And then cops watch that. I have the police handbooks. It's in my film, Road to Terrany,
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:10.240]  where FEMA teaches police. The founding fathers are bad. Anybody that talks about the Bill of
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:14.960]  Rights or Constitution is bad. And they're brainwashing them in all these TV shows and movies.
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:20.160]  They demonize gun owners and constitutionalists. I mean, how stupid do they think we are? And
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:24.960]  the feds have been caught, I don't know about this case, paying money to the studios to put this in
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:30.320]  TV and movies, to put these types of so-so. The constitutionalists, the ones that want freedom,
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:36.160]  they're going to nuke you. Yeah. And you can tell just by watching like this new Knight Rider series,
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:40.160]  it's kind of like the old one. You can obviously tell that it's geared towards children, younger
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:44.720]  people. It's all the children. Oh my gosh, the people that care about the Constitution,
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:50.080]  they're going to, they're going to nuke us. And by the way, folks, we're kicking their hind end
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:52.720]  exposing the New World War. Right now, that's why they're moving to try to regulate and shut
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:56.720]  down the web. That's all happening right now. We've got stories up on infowars.com and
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:03.440]  prisonplanet.com about that. Jim in Austin, Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:09.280]  Hello. Thanks for taking my call. Anyway, I've got a little information. I have a friend that's
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:18.160]  a cop and he just picked up a fully automatic AK-74U in preparation for martial law. This was
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:23.840]  a couple of weeks ago. And yesterday, I'm sitting in the barbershop, and the guy's got a, what is it,
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:29.920]  the new Army training manual or the actual Army handbook sitting there. Yeah, they give all,
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:34.240]  every one of the Army now gets riot control training. Right, right. Is that what it said?
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:43.520]  One of the, one of the little stories in there was that in Florida, they're going to set up a
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:52.880]  faction of infantry brigade, you know, evidently from this article. Yeah, I know. North comms
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:56.480]  announced that regular Army brigades will patrol America. And I don't know if they're going to
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:01.280]  institute martial law. Congress was already told, pass the bill, you're under martial law. So we're
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:05.600]  already under North comm control. Will we have hot martial law? I don't know. But if they bring in
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:10.880]  the depression, it'll cause rioting, which they'll stage, then we'll beg for the martial law.
[1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:19.280]  Well, right after I heard about the certain Congressman, or yeah, you know, being told that.
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.720]  We interviewed him. Yeah, I tell him, well, this is, this is before that. This is the Friday of
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:29.840]  the bailout when they passed the bailout. I'd call Lloyd Doggett's office because I was watching
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:35.920]  very closely. And this guy denied it. I mean, well, let me go back. Well, it was on C-span.
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:39.760]  We interviewed the two different congressmen on it. Specifically, your friend is a cop says,
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  we've been told we're getting ready for martial law. Well, yeah, but not only that,
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:49.600]  but last summer, and it wasn't up on the APD website or anything like that. I overheard,
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:55.280]  I was in an Army surplus store and saw a guy turning in like a, you know, essentially a bunch
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:01.280]  of camping gear for tactical equipment. And I shoot and go to rifle ranges and stuff like that.
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:05.840]  So I know what I'm looking at. Web gear. Yeah. Well, anyway, you know, everything,
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:12.160]  simply everything short of a ghillie suit. Well, anyway, he's telling the guy behind the counter
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:17.840]  how they're about to go ahead and start training. Lloyd did this covertly.
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:24.560]  Well, wait, we will, I sent Trey and Weldon out to, they were given just masses of the police
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.120]  SWAT training. So listen, listen, it's simple. The bankers, it happened in Rome and happened
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:33.840]  in Europe. It happens all the time. It's happening in third world countries right now. They take
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:39.040]  over. That's tyranny. The military and the police are used so the bankers can take over
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:44.080]  the entire society, but they won't be able to get away with it. If you're aware of what they're
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:48.640]  doing and the police and military, a lot of them I talked to, they don't like it. They don't want
[1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:52.640]  to be part of it. But again, the TV shows are telling you, and I know I didn't see this one,
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:58.000]  but I've seen others, evil constitutionalists, people that talk about freedom. They've got nukes.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:03.200]  They're going to nuke you. I mean, how obvious does it have to get? Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:07.360]  they're going to devalue your dollar down to nothing. They are going to bring you into total
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:14.080]  slavery unless you get up and you say no. We'll see you on the web at infowars.com for the weekday
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:18.880]  show and of course back next Sunday. Get out there and stand up for liberty. Get off the bench,
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:23.280]  get in the game, defend the republic. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Did you miss your favorite shows on
