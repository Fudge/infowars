[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.120]  ladies and gentlemen we have three guests popping in on the broadcast today it is
[00:33.120 --> 00:41.120]  friday april 16th 2010 we're gonna have wide open phones for your reports from
[00:41.120 --> 00:47.600]  the tea parties across the united states we're gonna break down to the agent
[00:47.600 --> 00:53.840]  revocateurs and what they tried to do in cities across this land trying to
[00:53.840 --> 01:00.680]  demonize the tea parties as racist and hateful that of course is now starting
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.320]  to backfire on them and we're gonna go over all of the important news in fact
[01:06.320 --> 01:15.160]  here's just one story out of the new mexico independent.com news site and
[01:15.160 --> 01:23.080]  they have the photos there and video of the democrats that showed up at this
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.000]  particular event in front of the news acting like they were with the tea
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.840]  parties saying Nazi youth for lower taxes with swastika see if you don't
[01:34.840 --> 01:40.520]  believe in man-made global warming you're gonna be called a Nazi if you
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.800]  don't want the government going bankrupt and selling us out to foreign
[01:45.800 --> 01:50.840]  banks you're a Nazi if you don't want to sign our sovereignty away or get rid of
[01:50.840 --> 01:55.680]  our borders you're a Nazi and this is all they've got and because they've tried
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.560]  for months to find somebody real saying the n-word or with a swastika sign
[01:59.560 --> 02:03.440]  they're now going out and doing it themselves now they've always done
[02:03.440 --> 02:07.600]  this that's why the feds run almost every major white supremacist group in
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.000]  england Germany the United States and Canada and Australia over and over and
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.520]  over again Paul Watson's book covers it published 2003 order out of chaos elite
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.600]  sponsored terror in the new world order road to tyranny covers it my earlier
[02:25.600 --> 02:34.160]  films cover Texas Monthly the London Guardian Le Figaro out of France
[02:34.160 --> 02:40.040]  der spiegel out of Germany not with the government's infiltrating white
[02:40.040 --> 02:47.840]  supremacists no no no no no no no no founding them running them so that they
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.040]  can then try to merge them with mainline groups to demonize them that is why you
[02:53.040 --> 03:01.160]  will notice that all the major white supremacists sites 24 7 24 7 attack
[03:01.160 --> 03:07.440]  yours truly with a wall of lies it is a heavily funded government operation
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.600]  caught red-handed just like the black congressional congress was caught a
[03:10.600 --> 03:18.320]  month ago red-handed just like these youths in Oregon and DC and in areas in
[03:18.320 --> 03:24.560]  New Mexico and Texas they're all being caught red-handed and that is good news
[03:24.560 --> 03:29.760]  because people are now discovering false flag political terror and that's what
[03:29.760 --> 03:32.920]  this is and there's many other flavors of it the police dressing up like
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.520]  anarchists turning over trash cans setting fire to trash cans attacking
[03:36.520 --> 03:40.800]  police caught over and over again from Canada to Greece from the United States
[03:40.800 --> 03:48.080]  to England from Australia to Italy over and over again mainstream news
[03:48.080 --> 03:55.960]  admitting that I mean they're being caught absolutely 100% 100% so we'll be
[03:55.960 --> 04:03.800]  discussing some of that today in other news homegrown solo terrorist as bad as
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.380]  al-qaeda FBI chief says so they're announcing openly that homeland
[04:08.380 --> 04:14.160]  securities for the American people we will continue a hundred thousand

[04:18.720 --> 04:24.320]  lockdown at 7 a.m. why don't they send the EPA over to arrest the volcano why
[04:24.320 --> 04:29.440]  don't we pay some extra tax money to Al Gore he'll uh he'll wave a wand and stop
[04:29.440 --> 04:33.400]  it this could cause global warming or cooling but ban it ban the volcano we've
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.240]  got to have stable climate you can't have seasons it's a conspiracy theory to
[04:37.240 --> 04:41.000]  say that we have regular seasons and that the only thing constant about the
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.760]  climate is that it's constantly changing no no no we've got to somehow plug up
[04:46.760 --> 04:52.280]  that volcano we'll be breaking that down there's so much news it's all coming up

[08:34.240 --> 08:39.600]  months of the making invisible empire a new world order defined now at prison
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.560]  planet dot TV and shipping out on DVD at info wars dot com also yesterday I
[08:46.560 --> 08:52.800]  hosted a video up on YouTube it's now on the front page of YouTube it's the top
[08:52.800 --> 08:58.760]  video story in the news and politics section on the front page of YouTube
[08:58.760 --> 09:04.960]  the articles are up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com where you
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.640]  can also watch the video iPad tortured to death in mass social experiment
[09:10.640 --> 09:16.720]  obviously it wasn't really tortured to death it's not alive but I'll talk more
[09:16.720 --> 09:22.560]  about that coming up and why I did this what you call a stunt a stunt to wake
[09:22.560 --> 09:29.080]  people up and what my aim was and certainly it's been successful and I
[09:29.080 --> 09:35.800]  got the response I thought I would get from doing this we've gotten people to
[09:35.800 --> 09:41.400]  think think about how we devalued human life I'll explain that more coming up
[09:41.400 --> 09:48.160]  later in the broadcast there's the case of Richard Fine that is in mainstream
[09:48.160 --> 09:53.280]  news but really in the back of the paper a handful of mainstream news articles
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.480]  about it and the Supreme Court is going to be hearing it either today or Monday
[09:58.480 --> 10:05.280]  on whether they're going to have a full case and he has found lawsuits he's a
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.920]  former federal antitrust lawyer and he has exposed a lot of corruption in
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.560]  Los Angeles and in the county and so without charges they say he's going to
[10:15.560 --> 10:21.040]  stay in jail for a year on contempt of court the judges are saying he's not
[10:21.040 --> 10:25.000]  allowed to have a lawsuit in America I mean you talk about secret police you
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.200]  talk about the end of habeas corpus in due process you talk about banana
[10:28.200 --> 10:35.960]  republic or North Korea or Stalinistic Russia this is it and we see more and
[10:35.960 --> 10:44.280]  more cases like this so we'll be talking to Leslie Dutton who's the only person
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.480]  who's gotten into interview mr. Fine and we've got our video posted up on
[10:48.480 --> 10:51.640]  info wars.com and prison planet.com she's going to be popping in for 30
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.480]  minutes in the next hour the last half hour the second hour and then we may
[10:57.480 --> 11:01.280]  even attempt to get Richard Fine on but we're just going to leave it at that
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.320]  for now and of course Bob Chapman with his once a week visit with us every
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.000]  Friday he's not going to be in the next two weeks after that he's going to be on
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.680]  vacation so our last interview of April with Bob Chapman of the
[11:14.680 --> 11:24.040]  international forecaster coming up today in the third hour now that said I'm
[11:24.040 --> 11:30.560]  going to get into the Icelandic volcano still spewing huge ash plume shutting
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.040]  down most of the air traffic in England and Europe and they say that if it
[11:34.040 --> 11:43.040]  continues to erupt like it is this could go on for six months and again we've
[11:43.040 --> 11:47.640]  gone over the statistics a major volcanic eruption like the one that's
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.000]  been going on the last month in Iceland that's intensifying it's like Mount
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.680]  St. Helens but it's just going and going and going and going Mount St. Helens
[11:55.680 --> 12:00.640]  just exploded and did most of its erupting in just a few hours though
[12:00.640 --> 12:05.240]  no this thing is just winding up and now covering much of the Atlantic and
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.320]  Europe in ash and it only appears according to volcanologists to be
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.640]  intensifying now the question is can't we have a global government that could
[12:14.640 --> 12:22.240]  stop volcanoes and can't we have a tax to save us from this ash that may heat
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.920]  the earth or may cool the earth volcanoes can do both I mean we've got to
[12:26.920 --> 12:32.200]  have a constant room temperature globally it's a conspiracy theory to say
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.720]  that we ever had winter or spring or summer or fall I mean that that's a
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.320]  conspiracy theory the UN says the Sun has no effect and I'm being serious now
[12:41.320 --> 12:45.880]  on climate which is asinine it's the main driver according to all the major
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.120]  scientific studies and research and volcanoes are one of the other big
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.280]  contributors to that along with the moon and the tidal forces that it
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.000]  expresses upon the planet so let me just go ahead and get into that now
[12:59.000 --> 13:08.720]  travel chaos as cloud of ash drifts over Europe volcanic ash sifted down over
[13:08.720 --> 13:13.440]  parts of northern Europe on Friday as thousands of planes stayed on the tar
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.040]  Mac to avoid the hazardous cloud travel chaos in Gulf major European cities and
[13:18.040 --> 13:23.840]  the UN warned of possible health risk from falling ash ah the UN's always
[13:23.840 --> 13:28.560]  there in the news is our big mommy to tell us obvious things and to act like
[13:28.560 --> 13:31.520]  they care about us when really their official policy is to reduce world
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.360]  population by at least 80 percent that's the whole point of the world
[13:35.360 --> 13:41.400]  government it's a killing stockade a a gurney they strap you down to and give
[13:41.400 --> 13:48.440]  you the lethal injection euro control euro control our wellion is that the
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.960]  European air traffic agencies of the travel disruptions that reverberated
[13:52.960 --> 13:58.120]  throughout the world Thursday were even worse on Friday with about 11,000
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.280]  flights expected to operate in Europe instead of the usual 28,000 it said the
[14:02.280 --> 14:06.560]  lays will continue well into Saturday as the massive yet invisible ash cloud
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.840]  moves slowly south and east and another report I've got they said this could
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.280]  potentially go on off and on for the next six months that's what the
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.080]  volcanologist are saying there will be significant disruption of air traffic
[14:19.080 --> 14:23.360]  tomorrow they went on to say Polish officials fretted at the ash cloud
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.800]  could threaten the arrival of world leaders for Sunday State funeral of
[14:27.800 --> 14:33.120]  President Kaczynski and his wife Maria in the southern city of Krakow his
[14:33.120 --> 14:40.760]  family insisted Friday they wanted the funeral to go forward as plan hmm so far
[14:40.760 --> 14:44.600]  President Barack Obama Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and German
[14:44.600 --> 14:50.320]  Chancellor Merkel are among those coming and no one has cancelled so they
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.520]  always put world leaders in the middle of the news like only they count and
[14:54.520 --> 14:58.240]  everything they do is so important when they're nothing but puppets that run
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.240]  absolutely nothing the banks run everything so there's always propaganda
[15:02.240 --> 15:06.640]  just interwoven into everything it's just a tissue of lies and deception
[15:06.640 --> 15:11.080]  here's another one 100,000 Britain stranded in Europe by volcanic ash
[15:11.080 --> 15:20.720]  cloud as air traffic chiefs extend lockdown to 7 a.m. and we also have a
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.080]  Reuters story along that same line here's a Wall Street Journal report
[15:25.080 --> 15:30.800]  airlines are grounded as ash cloud spread across Europe
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.720]  here's another story out of the New York Daily News volcanic ash from Iceland's
[15:36.720 --> 15:42.560]  strands Norway Prime Minister in New York City Airport so he governs via iPad
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.120]  yes the obsession with the iPad hence our video up on info wars.com and
[15:48.120 --> 15:54.720]  prisonplanet.com here's an AP article volcanic cloud cast long shadow over US
[15:54.720 --> 16:00.600]  travel a volcanic ash cloud that shut down airports and tied up air traffic
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.240]  control across Europe could turn into a long costly headache for business and
[16:05.240 --> 16:13.520]  airlines and tourists in the United States and it continues for those that
[16:13.520 --> 16:21.080]  don't know the Sun then the moon and this is all debated which one comes first
[16:21.080 --> 16:26.720]  but it's pretty much agree the Sun is first but then different types of
[16:26.720 --> 16:35.720]  micro media rights different types of particles coming in out of deep space not
[16:35.720 --> 16:38.960]  just the heat from the Sun but all of the particles it's firing in our
[16:38.960 --> 16:42.760]  atmosphere that's one of the big main drivers and you've got the moon and the
[16:42.760 --> 16:48.520]  tidal forces as I said earlier and and then it's volcanoes in fact I've seen
[16:48.520 --> 16:54.400]  the statistics on you can pull them up but roughly the amount of ash and and
[16:54.400 --> 17:00.040]  greenhouse gas emissions and particulate that was put into the air by
[17:00.040 --> 17:07.160]  Mount St. Helens in 1980 was more than all of the soot and all of the pollutants
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.880]  put out by man in the previous hundred years does that give you an idea that was
[17:13.880 --> 17:18.600]  going to conservative estimate and this one if it continues could be bigger
[17:18.600 --> 17:28.280]  in the aggregate than Mount St. Helens the point is man is like a speck on the
[17:28.280 --> 17:34.800]  back of a flea and the flea is sitting on the back of an elephant and the
[17:34.800 --> 17:42.480]  elephant is sitting in the middle of the state of Texas and man is that speck on
[17:42.480 --> 17:48.160]  the back of a flea and we just have almost no effect unless there's a
[17:48.160 --> 17:54.400]  nuclear weapons exchange or nanotech gets out of control or all these cross
[17:54.400 --> 17:58.520]  species genetic engineering experiments that have gone on with viruses and
[17:58.520 --> 18:04.120]  bacteria and plant and animal and insect life and fungus all mixed together all
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.000]  of the top scientists that studied this are on record saying this could create a
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.200]  calamity that well an accurate description of it is something like the
[18:13.200 --> 18:19.160]  Andromeda strain that moving back in the 1970s that's actually based on some of
[18:19.160 --> 18:25.920]  the fears of a microbiologist about life forms that could be delivered here
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.160]  via comets or asteroids and that could really shake up life on this planet or
[18:32.160 --> 18:38.320]  something created in a laboratory and that's the type of thing I'm worried
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.800]  about but the UN and the globalist the Club of Rome they didn't pick some real
[18:42.800 --> 18:50.800]  threat to have their excuse to set up a tyranny because they're all in mad races
[18:50.800 --> 18:55.240]  to against each other to come up with the super weapons and the life extension
[18:55.240 --> 19:00.560]  and the genetic engineering none of that is even being watched or dealt with no
[19:00.560 --> 19:05.600]  and that could be done a country by country basis just by education and of
[19:05.600 --> 19:13.800]  the elites want to inform the public no no no transparency in the in the mad rush
[19:13.800 --> 19:19.400]  for Godhood I'm not saying the elites will ever become God or Godlike but
[19:19.400 --> 19:24.200]  that's what they say they want control over the weather omnipresent control
[19:24.200 --> 19:29.600]  over information control over our health care over our reproduction over our
[19:29.600 --> 19:36.120]  finances tracking everything we do so the elite are actually horrible stewards
[19:36.120 --> 19:39.760]  and they're not really in control oh they're in control over the money they're
[19:39.760 --> 19:45.320]  in control over most the systems but they're not even governing themselves
[19:45.320 --> 19:51.960]  here's a big headline SCC charges Goldman Sachs with fraud CNN this is huge

[21:30.360 --> 21:34.640]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe
[21:34.640 --> 21:38.520]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[21:38.520 --> 21:42.680]  global financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so
[21:42.680 --> 21:47.000]  it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[22:20.160 --> 22:24.160]  private business creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country
[22:24.160 --> 22:28.640]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[22:28.640 --> 22:31.800]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the
[22:31.800 --> 22:35.920]  dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign governments

[24:07.680 --> 24:13.680]  four months ago we had Greg Gordon who did a five-part series from a clutchy
[24:13.680 --> 24:21.160]  newspapers on the show he's a top financial investigative reporter he's
[24:21.160 --> 24:28.040]  rated as one of the top in the country and via lawsuits he was able to get
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.880]  internal Goldman Sachs emails now of course there's separate Goldman Sachs
[24:33.880 --> 24:39.400]  emails from Geithner's deputy under orders from Geithner when he was New
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.160]  York Fed head just even more power than more powerful than the head of the
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.600]  Department of Treasury which he now sits in he was working with his counterpart
[24:49.600 --> 24:57.080]  his former Goldman Sachs boss Henry Paulson to cover up the trillions not
[24:57.080 --> 25:05.520]  the 780 whatever it was billion that the media keeps talking about that was only
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.840]  one of three revolving lines of credit and they've gone back to that 700 plus
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.320]  billion window over and over again that's only one of the three ways again we
[25:14.320 --> 25:17.680]  haven't gotten new numbers in over three months from Bloomberg Bloomberg's the one
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.920]  filing most these suits it was 23.7 trillion in November of last year in
[25:23.920 --> 25:29.560]  January of this year it was 28 trillion and counting so we don't know at
[25:29.560 --> 25:36.000]  current growth growth rates it's probably 33 34 35 trillion we don't know
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.600]  okay that's the level of the heist going on by the Goldman Sachs crew they're the
[25:41.600 --> 25:45.280]  main management firm because in a criminal operation you've got to keep it
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.640]  small so the big central banks JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo City Bank and
[25:50.640 --> 25:55.000]  others they're all getting the money as well they're all sharing it but their
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  management group is Goldman Sachs because they've got their people in every
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.360]  level of government not just here in the US but in every country they're robbing
[26:01.360 --> 26:12.640]  chili Greenland Greece Iceland New Zealand Poland I mean it's just every
[26:12.640 --> 26:16.680]  country the finance minister or the Treasury Secretary is Goldman Sachs but
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.600]  I'm all over the map here is just to try to even talk about this huge breaking
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.440]  news that was just put into my hand 10 minutes ago it's only the tip of the
[26:27.440 --> 26:33.600]  iceberg as they say and Geithner is on record remember there were there was talk
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.280]  three four months ago of criminal indictments of Geithner or his underlings
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.760]  from the New York branch of the Fed that's the main corporate office that's
[26:41.760 --> 26:46.880]  the Fed that has all the power the private holding company for the private
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.400]  banks which they've never allowed an audit of and then Ron Paul's bill would
[26:51.400 --> 26:58.000]  audit it's past the House in the Senate and so this is a big deal that Greg
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.640]  Gordon and others were able to get these emails just in one little criminal area
[27:02.640 --> 27:07.720]  where Goldman Sachs two years before the housing bubble imploded we were on
[27:07.720 --> 27:11.440]  air warning you with all our financial experts it was obvious that they were
[27:11.440 --> 27:16.600]  betting against the housing market and helped imploded so they could then have
[27:16.600 --> 27:23.040]  this big bailout and destroy their competition and that's in the emails so
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.360]  while they were setting up the implosion running the Federal Reserve and the
[27:27.360 --> 27:35.040]  Treasury Department the alumni the former CEOs and their deputies of Goldman
[27:35.040 --> 27:41.600]  Sachs filling every major regulatory position they were setting up this inside job
[27:41.600 --> 27:46.720]  this is only one area of it but they were caught red-handed in their emails
[27:46.720 --> 27:53.200]  that came out via lawsuits telling investors and and not just private
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.120]  investors not just citizens of different countries but governments cities
[27:58.120 --> 28:07.880]  counties police unions retirement funds for city workers police fire teachers
[28:07.880 --> 28:14.640]  unions university pension funds government pension funds private pension
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.200]  funds trillions and trillions of dollars they're saying invest in this and they
[28:19.200 --> 28:25.240]  had another insurance company AIG certified as triple-a gold a hundred
[28:25.240 --> 28:32.920]  percent when they knew it was absolute trash absolute garbage absolute burning
[28:32.920 --> 28:43.120]  made-off eclipsing fraud that'd be like if I was selling copper coins plated in
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.960]  gold and I was telling you that they were solid gold I mean that is fraud if I
[28:47.960 --> 28:51.720]  was doing that if you were doing that you would go to jail well this is
[28:51.720 --> 28:57.120]  selling investments to governments to pension funds to private individuals and
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.880]  institutions as if it was pure triple-a rated the best investment you could have
[29:03.880 --> 29:07.720]  and here's their own emails and documents they knew it was total trash and
[29:07.720 --> 29:12.600]  it was being done by design to screw up the markets so they could vertically
[29:12.600 --> 29:15.520]  integrate and consolidate the markets because they had their people in
[29:15.520 --> 29:21.240]  control of every major government on earth not just the United States and it
[29:21.240 --> 29:26.280]  goes further they were telling people to invest in it while they were doing this
[29:26.280 --> 29:32.320]  and I'm boy I tell you I don't know how this is happening because Obama is run
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.320]  by Goldman Sachs he got five times the money from Goldman Sachs that McCain
[29:36.320 --> 29:42.040]  did four times overall from Wall Street to McCain God and I don't they may use
[29:42.040 --> 29:47.000]  the investigation as a cover-up as a way to suck up all the info and classify it
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.520]  we'll talk about more of this when we come back stay with us we're on the March
[29:51.520 --> 29:59.360]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.600]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[30:03.600 --> 30:07.320]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[30:07.320 --> 30:10.880]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[30:10.880 --> 30:14.640]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[30:14.640 --> 30:18.520]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[30:18.520 --> 30:22.960]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[30:22.960 --> 30:28.000]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.720]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[30:31.720 --> 30:35.520]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.560]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank comm

[31:28.920 --> 31:33.160]  have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[31:33.160 --> 31:37.360]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[31:37.360 --> 31:40.920]  for the global financial system global governance with the establishment of a
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.720]  G-20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got

[33:19.080 --> 33:22.320]  I'd like to hear from folks that routed tea parties across the country who ran
[33:22.320 --> 33:30.880]  into provocateurs I've got a whole bunch of news articles and the news generally
[33:30.880 --> 33:37.120]  leaves it vague the New Mexico independent calm didn't they pointed out
[33:37.120 --> 33:41.560]  these were anti-tea party people with signs that said Nazi youth for lower
[33:41.560 --> 33:49.360]  taxes with big swastikas that's the type of low-down evil that we're talking
[33:49.360 --> 33:56.160]  about I mean false flag frame-ups are so common now that the Democratic Party
[33:56.160 --> 34:01.920]  has giant armies of ne'er-do-wells to go out and engage in this type of
[34:01.920 --> 34:07.560]  defamation so I'm going to be getting into that I want to get your take on it
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.200]  also newt Gennrich I didn't know this newt Gennrich was the main tea party
[34:12.200 --> 34:18.360]  spokesperson at the Texas State Capitol yesterday I there were a whole bunch of
[34:18.360 --> 34:24.360]  different tea party events down there of the news reports every few hours a new
[34:24.360 --> 34:31.640]  group but the but one of the main groups the Houston Chronicle reports wanted to
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.360]  be clear that they are not for Texas's secession and they are not extremist and
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.360]  they like newt Gennrich who's going to be running for president for the 2012
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.720]  elections and and here is newt Gennrich a guy who believes in global warming once
[34:43.720 --> 34:47.360]  a global carbon tax once a world government has written books about it
[34:47.360 --> 34:54.200]  and he's praised by Limbaugh and others and we're told how good he is and he's
[34:54.200 --> 34:59.680]  basically another eugenicist and a few days ago I heard the state of Texas that
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.160]  the Republicans are pushing a contract with Texas and it's got all these vague
[35:04.160 --> 35:09.280]  things they pledge I pledge to be conservative I I pledge to promote
[35:09.280 --> 35:14.840]  controlling our borders they need to be specific it's another vague contract on
[35:14.840 --> 35:18.160]  America and I said I smell newt Gennrich in this but I didn't have time to
[35:18.160 --> 35:21.960]  research it then I found out in two different news articles in Texas this
[35:21.960 --> 35:26.680]  morning that newt Gennrich is touring Texas and other states and creating a
[35:26.680 --> 35:30.520]  contract with America at the federal level and a contract with America the
[35:30.520 --> 35:35.840]  state level newt Gennrich went in in 1994 he led the Republicans as a fake
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.080]  conservative and let him over the edge of a cliff it's like Obama is there to
[35:40.080 --> 35:44.040]  give left cover and expand war and torture and warrantless wiretapping the
[35:44.040 --> 35:47.800]  feds are in court today by the way pushing for unlimited warrantless
[35:47.800 --> 35:51.560]  scanning of all your emails they're already reading them all but they want
[35:51.560 --> 35:54.640]  to be able to use them in court they want to have it out in the open that
[35:54.640 --> 35:58.160]  everything you do is being tracked everywhere you go via your cell phone is
[35:58.160 --> 36:08.400]  being watched and I've got another story that dovetails in with that it turns
[36:08.400 --> 36:17.440]  out that in pencilvania and several other areas in fact I'm looking I'm looking
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.200]  for my article about the laptops laptops took thousands of pictures well you
[36:22.200 --> 36:29.720]  guys print that for me again because I had that here in my stack and I and I
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.200]  suddenly suddenly can't find it you know you'll have this stuff right in
[36:35.200 --> 36:43.320]  front of you and then you won't but the point is that public schools all over
[36:43.320 --> 36:52.760]  the country all over the nation are watching students at home and one
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.400]  newspaper published photos the family got via lawsuits of their son in bed and
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.960]  it's got quotes by the teachers saying oh I just love this soap opera watching
[37:02.960 --> 37:08.080]  these people in their homes and the laptops have got audio and video it's
[37:08.080 --> 37:16.800]  just that the school officials they're they're not servants they're officials
[37:16.800 --> 37:23.720]  school officials just sit there and take screenshots of the video so we'll be
[37:23.720 --> 37:31.960]  showing that when we're live at prisonplanet.tv and so that's just
[37:31.960 --> 37:34.720]  some of what's coming up I meant to get to this yesterday this is the type of
[37:34.720 --> 37:38.280]  bizarre news that's out there that actually threatens our society this is
[37:38.280 --> 37:43.200]  out of the sun three parent kids UK scientists created designer embryos
[37:43.200 --> 37:48.120]  containing DNA from a man and two women the breakthrough gives hope of healthy
[37:48.120 --> 37:54.160]  children to couples with genetic disorders in their families it also
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.360]  offers the prospect of eradicating fatal genetic diseases and see that's
[37:58.360 --> 38:02.560]  what the eugenicists really want is they're gonna go in and decide who can
[38:02.560 --> 38:06.320]  have babies they're there they're taking your blood at birth in every
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.280]  industrialized nation for 37 years under a secret UN agreement that's now
[38:10.280 --> 38:17.960]  public they're now introducing it to you in the news that well yes we have been
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.000]  taking your blood and then a month later yet goes to the Pentagon in the UN and
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.600]  yeah it's been going on for decades 37 years to be exact and yeah we're
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.840]  studying your DNA and I've got CBS news reporting that the last 20 years big
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.320]  genome companies have bought your blood samples they go in and patent your DNA
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.080]  and proteins and different things that are unique to individuals and then
[38:45.080 --> 38:48.800]  you're going in to get genetic treatment that might have been 10 $15,000 and
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.360]  they say sorry we have patented your genes you and people say well where did
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.080]  you get the patent and that's one reason this finally broke mainstream news the
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.480]  last few years in the San Francisco Chronicles the first place I saw it we
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.800]  had the documents 14 years ago they were sent to me by a nurse but I'll just
[39:07.800 --> 39:13.640]  leave it at that the point is that they go well where did you get my blood how
[39:13.640 --> 39:18.800]  do you own my blood and they say oh we got it from these databases people say
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.600]  where where did you get that I never agreed to that and then federal courts
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.720]  have ruled yes they own your blood and we're gonna take your blood and now the
[39:26.720 --> 39:30.920]  police all over the world are being trained to take blood at checkpoints and
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.600]  they're breaking the ice with oh it's for drunk driving and like oh the
[39:35.600 --> 39:39.960]  Marines are in Tennessee oh they're in California oh they're in Michigan oh
[39:39.960 --> 39:43.320]  they're in Florida running checkpoints well that violates positive
[39:43.320 --> 39:45.960]  commentators oh but it's for drunk drivers and they also search your
[39:45.960 --> 39:52.080]  vehicles see they follow a PR script well you're against drunk driving aren't
[39:52.080 --> 39:58.560]  you will be got to have the Marines out here regular Marines so this is how it
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.920]  works they're going to go in and and I've seen government documents where they
[40:03.920 --> 40:08.800]  talk about this and say oh your DNA doesn't just say that you have a
[40:08.800 --> 40:16.600]  propensity to pass on certain types of cancers or your DNA shows that you know
[40:16.600 --> 40:22.040]  there's a 30% chance your child's gonna have a cleft palate because this is a
[40:22.040 --> 40:27.000]  science is so foggy government can lie and claim that you have evidence of
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.440]  possible disorders or diseases genetic traits that you can pass on they can
[40:33.440 --> 40:38.640]  just lie and more importantly they're already discussing saying oh you have
[40:38.640 --> 40:45.920]  aggression genes you have anger genes you have genes that show a propensity for
[40:45.920 --> 40:53.680]  drug abuse you have genes that show that you're inclined to be depressed that's
[40:53.680 --> 40:59.880]  why in road to tyranny we cover some of this but then in the 2007 film end game
[40:59.880 --> 41:04.520]  I show mainstream British news where it says two-year-olds are on probation in
[41:04.520 --> 41:10.000]  England now why are tens of thousands of two-year-olds on probation in England
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.920]  I'm not joking folks you can go look it up because their parents have a criminal
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.240]  record or have been in a psychiatric system somehow oh they you know they
[41:22.240 --> 41:25.720]  tell you must be depressed let me send you to a government psychologist it's
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.880]  all paid for honey you know you're 17 years old you're depressed your boyfriend
[41:29.880 --> 41:33.520]  broke up with you let us send you to a doctor and they give you some Prozac and
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.520]  then five years later you have a child and they come to you and they say your
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.960]  child is now in a database and at age two must have monthly meetings with a
[41:41.960 --> 41:46.800]  social worker to ask them questions and put them in a database of potential
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.600]  criminals so you want to know how this medical
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.600]  tyranny is going to work this is it and it's not a joke what four years ago we
[41:55.600 --> 42:01.160]  got the new freedom initiative documents it was actually in major newspapers
[42:01.160 --> 42:08.240]  because one of the board members in what was it in that case Pennsylvania knows
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.880]  Ohio just for the state board of the new freedom initiative he was given the
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.320]  documents and it said this is all to make money we've got 20% of the kids
[42:17.320 --> 42:23.640]  roughly on drugs right now psychotropic sir Redlyn different classes and our
[42:23.640 --> 42:34.760]  goal is by 2015 to have 50% our goal is in 10 years that was 2005 our goal is to
[42:34.760 --> 42:45.080]  have 50% of children on drugs and then by 2025 we want 100% on drugs 100% you're
[42:45.080 --> 42:52.640]  gonna be forced to medicated now that's in the plan I mean how can you say
[42:52.640 --> 42:59.120]  that's a good thing well look at the national average of foster children on
[42:59.120 --> 43:04.760]  psychotropic drugs pull it up yourself just national average search engine this
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.960]  term back get this for me guys just to show people I'm not making the stuff up
[43:08.960 --> 43:15.920]  two-thirds of foster children on drugs psychotropic drugs say the Texas is
[43:15.920 --> 43:22.240]  even higher I think it's 69% the national average is about 65 that and that was a
[43:22.240 --> 43:25.160]  few years ago last time I checked we're gonna find out right now it's always
[43:25.160 --> 43:31.400]  growing so see when the government has you in its custody 60 plus percent of
[43:31.400 --> 43:35.680]  the time or two-thirds of the time
[43:38.320 --> 43:43.360]  yeah there's the headline W.O.A.I. television two out of three foster
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.000]  children in Texas on psychotropic medication but that's only Texas that
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.880]  mirrors the national average pull me up the national average of I believe it's
[43:51.880 --> 43:58.120]  gonna be 65 66 67 I've seen different numbers so again there you go when they
[43:58.120 --> 44:13.520]  are in control close to 70% are on these brain damaging life-destroying drugs this
[44:13.520 --> 44:18.760]  is about control and they want 100% you this is how eugenics is gonna be carried
[44:18.760 --> 44:26.040]  down you're not going to be allowed to have children and if you do get pregnant
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.320]  you're going to have to hide the baby if they have their way if they get away
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.440]  with this and after a nuke attack and some more wars in a police state they
[44:34.440 --> 44:37.440]  already got you going in naked body scanners cops taking blood at checkpoints
[44:37.440 --> 44:40.720]  without warrants they're already taking your baby's blood at birth to give it to
[44:40.720 --> 44:51.160]  the Pentagon and the Cold Springs Harbor eugenics lab with IBM they say that
[44:51.160 --> 44:57.200]  they are going to come and get you and forcibly abort your child
[44:57.200 --> 45:12.920]  this is the tyranny I mean I have seen it in report after report after report
[45:12.920 --> 45:17.240]  this is what they're going to do in fact in the extras for in game Dr. Michael
[45:17.240 --> 45:24.040]  Kaufman reads from a major US University study in the early 60s funded by the
[45:24.040 --> 45:31.760]  federal government where they said by 2000 people will be obsessed with luxury
[45:31.760 --> 45:36.960]  and little electronic games they're going to have most the public is going
[45:36.960 --> 45:43.280]  to be on government-issued drugs and we are going to anesthetize people and
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.400]  drug them and put them into a form of television mind control and then we're
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.840]  going to phase in one-child policies and taking people's children I forget the
[45:53.840 --> 45:57.960]  study but it's in the film he reads from it it's in the extras it's actually an
[45:57.960 --> 46:06.720]  in-game 1.5 the extras for prison planet TV members expanded extras all right I
[46:06.720 --> 46:19.080]  said I'd go to your phone calls and I I want to go to your phone calls but here's
[46:19.080 --> 46:22.800]  that article I mentioned out of Philadelphia and I've seen these reports
[46:22.800 --> 46:29.520]  in Tennessee California everywhere I mean I saw these reports eight nine years
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.040]  ago where in Sacramento it said the police were watching the girls in the
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.760]  showers and that was okay and Tennessee was doing it and they were sharing the
[46:37.760 --> 46:45.200]  videos everywhere and it's quite normal lawyer laptops took thousands of
[46:45.200 --> 46:55.760]  images this is out of Philly.com Philadelphia Enquirer not the National
[46:55.760 --> 47:02.680]  Enquirer the system that lower Marion school officials used a track lost stolen
[47:02.680 --> 47:05.880]  laptops and it's on most school-issued laptops nationwide the feds part of
[47:05.880 --> 47:09.840]  their grant demand you have this so they've got it all figured out they come
[47:09.840 --> 47:13.280]  in and show them how to use it and the system that lower Marion school
[47:13.280 --> 47:17.160]  officials use a track loss of stolen laptops oh it's always a stop crime
[47:17.160 --> 47:22.640]  isn't it wound up secretly capturing thousands of images including
[47:22.640 --> 47:27.960]  photographs of students in their homes websites they visited an excerpts of
[47:27.960 --> 47:33.760]  their online chats says a new motion filed in a suit against the district more
[47:33.760 --> 47:38.480]  than once the motion asserts and they've released the photos the camera on
[47:38.480 --> 47:48.320]  Robbins school issued laptop took photos of Robbins as he slept in his bed each
[47:48.320 --> 47:55.200]  time it fired the images off to a network servers at the school district
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.560]  back at the school offices the Robbins motion says employees with access to the
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.400]  images marveled at the tracking software it was like a window into a quote
[48:07.400 --> 48:12.600]  little LMSD soap opera I don't watch soap opera so I don't know what that means
[48:12.600 --> 48:19.320]  LMSD soap opera a staffer is quoted as saying in an email to Carol Kaffarow
[48:19.320 --> 48:24.720]  the administrator running the program I know I love it she is quoted as having
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.520]  replied well we've got a frontline special of another school where they're
[48:28.520 --> 48:31.920]  sitting there in on national television showing them how they're watching the
[48:31.920 --> 48:38.040]  kids it was the school bragging about this is the reason we know well why is
[48:38.040 --> 48:44.800]  this saying it's alleged I know I love it she's quoted as having replied those
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.200]  details is closed in a motion filed late Thursday in federal court by Robbins
[48:49.200 --> 48:55.160]  attorney offer a wide glimpse into the now disabled program that spawned Robbins
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.400]  lawsuit and has shined at international spotlight on the district see but
[48:59.400 --> 49:02.360]  there's really no articles in the news about well wait a minute this is on
[49:02.360 --> 49:07.040]  frontline a year and a half ago wait on wait a minute there's hundreds of
[49:07.040 --> 49:10.160]  articles where this has come out elsewhere we weren't they talking about
[49:10.160 --> 49:18.480]  cameras in the school showers watching the naked children I mean any real
[49:18.480 --> 49:22.800]  journalist or even just an average person could go search engine hundreds of
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.400]  articles about this that I know I've seen I could sit her off my memory right
[49:26.400 --> 49:31.120]  now and just snap off headlines and have the guys pull it up maybe I should do
[49:31.120 --> 49:34.040]  that later when we're live on prison planet TV show everybody the articles
[49:34.040 --> 49:37.840]  that's one thing to me I mean here's an example when I'm shifting gears out of
[49:37.840 --> 49:41.400]  this for a moment to get back into it after calls and the whole Goldman Sachs
[49:41.400 --> 49:49.000]  situation this is huge being indicted I went on Russia today yesterday that a
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.520]  little five and a half minute piece it's on in the US Europe worldwide Watson over
[49:53.520 --> 49:58.680]  in Sheffield can watch it on broadcast TV reaches millions and it's a great
[49:58.680 --> 50:03.240]  outlet and I go on there and criticize our government Russia whatever they just
[50:03.240 --> 50:06.840]  let me it's it they let me tell the truth it's amazing and I went on there
[50:06.840 --> 50:11.200]  and because this army report saying that within two to five years we could
[50:11.200 --> 50:16.720]  have $150 a barrel oil and that gas could be $6 $7 a gallon that we're gonna
[50:16.720 --> 50:20.600]  have this big oil shortage because there's not enough refineries and enough
[50:20.600 --> 50:27.680]  oil and I went on there and I said well the AP reported in 2000 and 2006 that
[50:27.680 --> 50:33.400]  the they had sued and gotten the oil company documents where a cartel met in
[50:33.400 --> 50:37.120]  95 and 96 and said we're gonna shut down refineries and not build new ones
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.560]  because there's too much oil we're gonna create an artificial bottleneck and then
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.480]  I saw the comments on the video clearly paid for saying Jones doesn't know about
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.480]  the oil business he's a liar this isn't true oh really I'm having Watson post the
[50:49.480 --> 50:55.000]  Russia today with the links to the AP okay we don't make anything up you got
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.280]  that we don't make any of it up you understand me we don't make anything up

[54:59.640 --> 55:03.720]  for calling what's on your mind hey well yesterday me and some friends went to
[55:03.720 --> 55:07.680]  the Alamo draft house in San Antonio and sure enough they had invisible Empire
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.520]  playing there on the big screen and Jason Burma's made a wonderful appearance
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.520]  for us it was a great time a lot of people showed up and it was just all
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.680]  inspiring watching that movie and I'm told it almost filled up the theater with
[55:20.680 --> 55:23.800]  almost no promotion I never even promoted it because I really didn't
[55:23.800 --> 55:28.280]  even know they were having that premiere I've been told about it once and it
[55:28.280 --> 55:31.520]  kind of forgotten about it but yeah that's very exciting and Burma shot
[55:31.520 --> 55:35.080]  some video of his speech and some of the folks he talked to so that'll be up on
[55:35.080 --> 55:39.200]  the web in the next few days yeah it was incredible and I just wanted to let you
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.000]  know let your listeners know that you on the big screen is a very
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.280]  awe-inspiring and so what did you think of the two-hour plus film invisible Empire
[55:48.280 --> 55:51.200]  that premiered yesterday at prisonblana.tv
[55:51.200 --> 55:56.320]  oh it was great I mean it was the same you put your little part in there but
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.760]  other than that it was a great great movie and I thought when I got home I
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.040]  got to show my wife what was on the internet version of it but seeing it
[56:04.040 --> 56:08.200]  that the premiere was was great more than anything else so what do you mean
[56:08.200 --> 56:12.320]  what do you mean it put my little part in it you got a little part there the
[56:12.320 --> 56:17.840]  in the in the in the movie online on prisonblana.tv invisible Empire oh
[56:17.840 --> 56:21.440]  absolutely in the middle of it I stopped a moment and asked people to purchase the
[56:21.440 --> 56:28.000]  DVD sure that part yeah that was great it wasn't in the theatrical part of it
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.760]  but we thought but it was it was you know having your input in there was a
[56:32.760 --> 56:37.160]  great you know it was the internet version the internet version has a
[56:37.160 --> 56:41.080]  little call to action in the middle of it yes different from what is on the DVD
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.520]  I left out George Bush they had the extended version of George HW Bush's
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.280]  take on the new world order stuff that you know most people haven't really seen
[56:49.280 --> 56:53.320]  on the internet well a lot of that archive footage Burmese went to a lot of
[56:53.320 --> 56:56.960]  trouble to get has never been on the web before a lot of the new world order
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.320]  quotes have never been seen before a lot of the statements for global government
[57:00.320 --> 57:08.080]  have never been seen they were seen on television at the time but that was
[57:08.080 --> 57:14.240]  pre-internet so it had never popularly been known exactly and then they had the
[57:14.240 --> 57:17.840]  skull and bones rituals they caught on tape and though those are that was
[57:17.840 --> 57:21.640]  outstanding to see that and how awe-inspiring it was to see that being
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.040]  exposed it was just great well listen I appreciate your call Fred good to hear

[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.640]  coming up later in this hour we're going to look at a massive miscarriage of
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.080]  justice a very scary police state development here inside the united
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.280]  states now headed to the supreme court but going back to Charlie I'm hoping the
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:53.800]  phone's up to talk about provocateurs and I have quite a few mainstream news articles here
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:00.920]  from all over the country showing anti-t-party people with Nazi signs as they promise to do
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:08.040]  showing up claiming they were the tea party just despicable despicable type activity going on
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.160]  on that front but charlie is in north carolina he was i was asking if he saw any provocateurs
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:20.360]  go ahead uh... yeah can you hear me yes i can okay uh... so as i was saying i i didn't attend
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.240]  the uh... the tea party but i live close by and i was out on my back porch working
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:34.840]  and uh... for u.s. marine corps warthog uh... fighter planes flew in formation at approximately
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:42.600]  the height of your average uh... news chopper would fly uh... flying pretty slow and did a
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.920]  pass over downtown and i was looking out and as i caught you know as i caught him on the horizon
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.680]  they all for information made a sharp bank to the left uh... flew off into the distance and then
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.920]  about a minute or two later again they came swoosh and by and we're right back over the tea party
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.840]  now they might have been doing that they might have been doing that because they're fans of the
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.920]  tea party most of the military are good people and our fans the constitution bill arrives they've
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.280]  sworn an oath to and they might have been saluting it i was wondering about that i wanted your take
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.800]  on it but i can tell you that it's uh... it reminds me of back in in leo nine man there were a
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:27.000]  ten f-16s or ten ten f-something flew over riley real low real slow information and it was scary
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.960]  man i thought i was gonna appreciate your call charlie during in leo nine for those that don't
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:38.200]  know you just search into the term in le national level exercise on nine in the top link at least
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.800]  the last time i checked was femum and you can read about all the troops from different nations
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.760]  training to take on the american people and this is from fema dot gov this is not this is not our
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.840]  opinion uh... that they are training for an after that's to go up against the american people
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.200]  that's just one little data point there's literally hundreds of mainstream news articles about foreign
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.520]  troops trying to take on the american people have been to many urban warfare drills over the last
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.720]  twelve years where they've been training for it uh... let's talk to a bill in chicago bill you're on
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:15.880]  the air hey alex uh... i did attend uh... a local naperville tea party here and first off i want
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:24.120]  to verify that susan carlson for cbs uh... on the eleven a m news did uh... try to divert people
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.000]  by saying that the tea party started at one instead of that new time
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.080]  i went there at noon uh... as soon as i walked up i was uh... yelled at because i was
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:43.240]  you know voicing my expression and when i informed the crowd that i was in the tea party or
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.920]  they said well what are you doing here then and i said i'm here to wake you folks up uh...
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:56.040]  there were probably about twenty to thirty freedom of speech signs and when the speaker told a lie
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.680]  and i acted like you counteracted you know countering with the truth they would all
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:09.720]  tell me to shut up they turned around told me to shut up i actually caught the police following
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:16.280]  me around uh... and i came back with my friend and pointed him out and he said yes that's the
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:24.040]  person that was following you around and uh... he told me that he even heard that uh... over the
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:30.120]  police radio that the police were told to keep an eye on me but again you weren't a democrat
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.360]  showing up with swastika signs you were a patriot trying to wake up the tea party
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:40.120]  that's being taken over by republicans correct that is absolutely correct but here's the real
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:48.680]  catch alex one of the speakers said we need to turn off state-run tv turn off cbs turn off nbc
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:56.680]  turn off abc we want fox news and the whole crowd cured now they're certainly trying to control the
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:03.240]  revolution by making it a republican fox news production one major world crisis away from having
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.280]  a totalitarian type of system the main event is the the wholesale destruction of the world

[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:28.120]  texas alex jones there isn't one faction there's not two factions there's not three factions there's
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:36.600]  not four there are hundreds of different factions some are dominant others are tiny in the tea parties
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:43.560]  but the mainstream media makes it look like there's republicans and fox news on one side
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.040]  and democrats and george soros and barack obama on the other against the tea parties
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:58.120]  it's not only democrats and government funded so-called anarchist and police groups infiltrating
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:05.000]  the tea parties they're infiltrating militias pro gun groups property rights organizations
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.560]  organizations that want to protect the border that's come out in the news that they send provocateurs
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.520]  out to set people up and then lie about them to police to get them to arrested that's happened
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.720]  with the men and men and others this is basically dirty tricks campaigns you've got all these
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.760]  different factions running dirty tricks against each other the republicans haven't been doing it
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:32.120]  as much as the democrats because they've got the high ground they're playing the part of the anti
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.160]  establishment right now they're out of power and so they can we're don't want the new world order
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:44.920]  we don't want the taxes we don't want the health care but they lie and say the health care is
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:51.240]  socialism and a ripoff and you can't give poor people something free and that would be bad enough
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:10:01.160]  i mean that that's partially true but you heard uh lord mongton yesterday quite a mind you've
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.360]  heard ron paul uh you've heard many many others who have accurately identified as i've been doing
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.440]  from day one and as jenice cosinich and howard dean did before they got bought off that this makes
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.960]  30 plus million people by health care and it lowers the standard of care and the insurance
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.800]  companies wrote this this is fascism this is corporatism if you want to give it a name ron paul
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.800]  is right and if we get that message out then they can't play the left and right off against each other
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:34.920]  then the left's going to figure out it's a ripoff to the big corporations the right's going to start
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.400]  learning that big corporations are not perfect and run the new world order and are bigger than most
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:46.440]  governments all i hear big right wing talk show house doing is defending the insurance companies
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:54.040]  and blaming it all on the democrats when this is a systemic corruption across the board
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:02.200]  and of course there's another big faction real patriots who founded the tea party
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:08.280]  conservatively in 2007 you got the democrats you got the republicans in the fox news group
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.600]  you've got the other little factions that are hired by government and provocateur by government
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.480]  you have the government operatives out there who put up websites and have a call to action and
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.200]  then get useful idiots to show up and bolster their numbers but you've got the original tea
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:29.320]  partiers from 2007 who are libertarians constitutionalist anti-war folks populist and
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.000]  they're the people going out and protesting everywhere they're the people hitting the streets
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.560]  they're the people getting angry and so a year ago fox news comes in advertises giant tea parties
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:46.440]  gives it huge attention on talk radio and tv gets their big speakers out then the left side of the
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.560]  fake media in that paradigm continuing the illusion they come in and cover it as if it
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:57.080]  is a republican event that then brings more republicans in who see the channels they hate
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.680]  msnbc and in promoting it as a republican event they attack it as a republican event and so
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:09.560]  republicans come out in force and take over the tea party that was there and now here we are a year
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.440]  and a few months later 14 15 months later since the republicans started taking over the tea party
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:21.080]  and national polls show they have now done it and whereas six months ago you could show up to a big
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.360]  republican run tea party and hand out road to tyranny in game terror storm loose change final
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:32.200]  cut and you would be welcomed by many and only hissed at by a few now you show up they beat
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.680]  you up remember the phoenix video a few weeks ago the guy got up and said look sarah pale and
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.240]  you're for global warming republicans triple the size of government what are you doing john
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.880]  mccain's bad we need to vote for jd hayworth he's not perfect but he's got a much more
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:52.120]  conservative libertarian voting record they beat him up the tea partyers beat him up the cops came
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:58.920]  in and helped him beat him up and drag him off so we started the tea parties we were the first to
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:05.000]  recognize as conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists that bush was bad then obama
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.320]  comes along and we're still there saying he's bad and republicans show up and say you know what we're
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.240]  going to beat the hell out of you we're going to drag you out of here we're going to shout you down
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:20.280]  so the republicans aren't provocaturing much or staging events the democrats are doing that
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.920]  because they're in power right now what the republicans are doing is strong arming just like
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.840]  democratic union thugs remember all that footage in the last year the republicans are doing the
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:37.400]  same thing and it's shameful and and you sickening republicans that are at these big tea parties
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.440]  who hiss and yell at real patriots and who go along with this hey you're going to get your
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.680]  pension fund taken the republicans led by newt genrich are going to have a new contract with
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.760]  america and they're going to sell you out and you're going to love it you they're in a con you
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:58.200]  don't love they're in a scam you don't buy into you are just as stupid and mindless and and wanting
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.200]  and weak as these foolish democrat supporters you make me want to throw up you make me sick
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.320]  you aren't real constitutionalist you don't really care about the republic you love the
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:18.040]  patriot act and secret arrest and torture and illegal wars under bush you love bush with
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:23.320]  his amnesty plan why don't you love obama and i'll tell you bush supporter something you should
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:29.880]  love obama you should get on your knees and love him because he is taking everything bush did and
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:39.240]  expanding it it's shameful it's shameful the only thing more shameful are these democratic party
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.280]  operatives attacking their own offices the black congressional congress invoking the race card
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:51.000]  lying about the n word and being spit on and i've got news reports all over the country saying
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.760]  there were people at the tea party with nazi signs reporting it like it was real but i found a
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:05.400]  bunch of other alternative news reports that have video and photos like this new mexico independent
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:11.720]  dot com they're pretty middle of the road but they tell the truth santa fe tea party event draws
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:19.240]  its own protesters and remember the ap on monday reporting what we talked about weeks ago the big
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.480]  anarchist groups and others and democratic party operatives going out saying show up with races
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:32.600]  signs and other things well here it is in this article from new mexico independent dot com it's
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:38.280]  up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com santa fe tea party event draws its own protesters
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.080]  and it's got photos and video of signs that say nazi youth for lower taxes
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:54.360]  nazi youth for lower taxes and you've got these guys that look like they're no more than 17 years
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.640]  old they don't have two brain cells between the two of them they're dumber in the box of rocks
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.080]  they've been provocateur out there by the democratic party operatives online to act like complete jackasses
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:13.800]  just morons and see because the country's in trouble you're going to have a lot of people
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.960]  who've never been politically involved who aren't savvy being sucked in by all different angles
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.360]  fox news and glenn becker setting things up for beck to run for president later setting
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.920]  him up as a messianic leader where everybody basically pledges allegiance to him and he
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.080]  says a lot of things that are true but then mixes in lies i mean folks this is sophisticated
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:39.400]  and people need to get sophisticated fast this is how the globalists have taken over hundreds
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.840]  of other countries they know what they're doing they know how to play us off against each other
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.360]  let's talk to james in new york you're on the air go ahead james
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:57.000]  james and new go ahead okay um okay my family and i are staying in a homeless shelter in new
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.600]  york and they recently came out with this program for charging the people in the homeless shelters
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:08.760]  for rent now i don't disagree with it but i disagree with the sliding scale if somebody
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:14.520]  makes ten thousand dollars a year they are charged thirty six dollars a month to stay in the shelter
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:21.560]  however if somebody makes twenty five thousand dollars a year they are charged nine hundred
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.920]  and forty six dollars a month to stay in the shelter now the first one ten thousand thirty
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:33.400]  six thousand a month that's only four point eight percent after taxes of the income but
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:40.600]  twenty five thousand after taxes it's actually fifty point four five percent of the income
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.880]  yeah well that's meant to get people out of there and folks are saying thirty thousand dollars that
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:54.040]  you can live decent on that yeah in mississippi or or in east texas in in in new york folks a
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.800]  bottle of water is three four bucks you can't get a rat infested apartment with cockroaches the size
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:06.120]  of chihuahuas and be able to buy food and even clothing or anything with thirty thousand dollars
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.640]  and so what's happening is and look this is how they've done in other countries they don't just
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:14.440]  say we're throwing in death camps they destroy the economy by design you've got tens of millions of
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:19.480]  homeless a lot of them that were formerly middle class they push you into these facilities and they
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.760]  say you know what we're having to pay for you you've got to work so the next thing is they're
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.600]  going to start ratcheting it up to fifty percent of the money if you're making a thousand dollars a
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.960]  year i mean it's not going to matter and they're going to lawfully under fake laws california
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.600]  is already doing this so is hawaii make you go to the shelter so you'll be locked up at night
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.280]  it's the british model of the poor houses it's all been done before nothing to do under the sun
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.320]  and then you're just basically going to be prisoners as sharecroppers uh whether it's
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.920]  making license plates or furniture or doing telemarketing whatever it is in these quasi
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:58.040]  private government uh facilities so just like they started the income tax at one percent now
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.960]  it's upwards of 40 for some under obama's changes uh you know that you know they're starting off at
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.520]  this and they're saying hey get a job and you know the answer is uh go west young man have
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:16.200]  it you've been told california is full of whiskey women and gold uh well you want to go california
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:25.320]  it's full of parasites and the state's collapsing but come to texas okay uh you come here uh or go
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.800]  to mississippi or go somewhere where it's cheap to live okay i mean get out of new york come on
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:37.800]  true but the thing is i i could see if it was a flat rate of maybe ten percent but this sliding
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.720]  scale of this is a total another joke now i'm going for something that's about 35 to 40 thousand
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.040]  dollars a year so i got a real big question for these people how much are they going to charge
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:54.600]  my butt absolutely i mean what do you got to make 40 50 grand a year to basically even live in new

[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:30.520]  doing it again i mean it's it's it's it's just he is a high-level cfr globalist operative at the same
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:39.240]  level as obama he's intimately involved with peanut and the neocons at 911 he is a monster a monster
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.600]  and you know here are the republicans just praising him and pledging that they're not
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.680]  going to be too radical for states rights that was in the houston chronicle just
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.640]  flagulating themselves with with bullwebs you know apologizing for themselves and
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.640]  basically urinating down their own legs and you know they're all wearing big diapers
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:03.320]  i mean it's just it's just disgusting it is it really is and the sad part is there are people
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:09.640]  in that crowd who are in the know and when these public speakers come on who are using the bible
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:14.760]  to support neoconservatives ideas they're not preaching it they're using it which is sad
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:19.480]  it's kind of like you just see their heads go down and just staying in utter shame about it
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.040]  and it's something that you know i can't stand because it's i don't know it's gotten to the
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:30.840]  point where you just say you know bush's policies let us in here brocco obama just ran with it
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.800]  he's doing nothing but push you know bush's policies and it's kind of like no one's acknowledging
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:41.720]  that they're like yeah give us the old guy back you know it's annoying and and the second thing
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.000]  i called about was i was driving into work from nakanish and there was a narco point
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:54.680]  i kid you not right before the car mail exit it was crazy all right my friend i appreciate your
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:00.280]  call and i said flagellate that's a different definition i meant flagellation or flogging
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:06.200]  in the act of methodically beating or whipping see what flagellate means i think that means
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:12.680]  something bad i got a big vocabulary but sometimes no it's flagellates are organisms with one or more
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:21.560]  whip like uh cells so it's i guess it's a type of coral or something or green algae okay there we go
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:29.400]  i love words i'm obsessed with words and uh you know my point is you've got the republicans
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.880]  beating themselves over the head promising to not be too extreme while the establishment
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:40.280]  since they're in attempts to make everybody just be very tame and and and go into the control of
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.880]  the republican party and keep our mouths shut and they'll save us sure they will build in south
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:52.840]  carolina you're on the air go ahead yeah greetings and citations alex from the holy city thank you sir
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:28:01.480]  yeah um we have ourselves a very uh eventful uh tea party gathering night here on the steps
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:08.280]  to the customs house right off from the shores of uh the little island of fort sumpter where the
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:16.600]  first shots of the civil war were fired and uh it's considered a real patriotic meeting and that is
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:24.440]  that uh there were a lot of folks here that were uh independents i didn't see anybody flashing
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.280]  no nazi signs or uh any of that stuff all these people were independents republicans
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.680]  fortunately hadn't come down and taken over the meeting because everybody for the most part was
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:42.040]  talking simple fact that that we are being taxed enough and we had people from the uh fair tax
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.560]  people come out and talk we had uh people everywhere you know flashing their their bill
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:53.480]  billboards signs and uh we had a black man a conservative black man get up in front of everybody
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.800]  and talk and then you know how fox news and everybody's saying well nobody was showing up at
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.600]  these things well yeah we have black folks down here in charleston well that's what the media does
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.520]  the media for the last year and a half saying it's racist that's meant to scare black people from
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:13.160]  coming to the event so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy they want us at each other's throats
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:18.840]  again that's why this race pimping is so evil they are the racist the media is is dividing
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:24.680]  and conquering and invoking this to keep us divided as an american people oh yeah because
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:29.720]  if we stay divided we'll never get together and find out who the real enemy is and throw him out
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:35.000]  that's why it's so outrageous bill to watch the media say that every one of the tea parties are
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.320]  basically racist and then dispatch their own democratic party operatives with inword and
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:47.400]  swastika signs uh it's illegal it's criminal it's a frame up it's racketeering we'll be right back

[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:16.200]  and was an antitrust attorney with the department of justice in washington dc he is sounding the
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:22.520]  clarion call from his cell in the los angeles county central men's jail where he is being held
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:30.120]  without trial without mail without an attorney and with every appeal denied oh there's absolutely no
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:35.240]  question that i'm a political prisoner i mean none whatsoever because the political circumstance
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:43.240]  that has created this situation is that you have a straight out and out abuse of power that is taking
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:51.720]  place here okay we got bob shabman coming up your phone calls in the next hour a bunch of important
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:58.520]  news i want to get to homegrown solo terrorist as bad as al-qaeda fbi chief says so they're really
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:02.840]  getting ready to use homeland security against the american people that's what it was originally set up
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:09.480]  for that's what section 802 of the usa patriot act states all misdemeanors uh are basically acts of
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:14.840]  terrorism and all of your rights are stripped so there's no doubt we're going deep into tyranny
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.080]  right now they have the belligerent the belligerent act where citizens can be secretly arrested by
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:25.240]  the military you have an enhanced interrogation i.e. torture but this case is going before the
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:32.280]  supreme court in their conference committee next friday and they're looking at uh actually hearing
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:40.280]  the full case so this is now gone to the supreme court uh so it's gone directly from a lower court
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:48.120]  in california all the way to the supreme court not going through the other courts in between
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:55.720]  because the judge has not recused himself and is holding uh this gentleman as a political
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:01.160]  prisoner richard fine and you can read the story at info wars dot com prison planet dot com daily
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:07.560]  news has the headline supreme court to hear fine case here's another one out of the current dot com
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.800]  the u.s supreme court will consider the case of a 70 year old taxpayer advocate richard fine
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.640]  who was languished in jail for more than a year and they're talking about holding him
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:25.320]  uh even uh longer and uh we have a great advocate for justice and freedom uh leslie
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.760]  dotton is a civic activist and former account executive and vice president of a national public
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.320]  government affairs firms represents diverse clients relating to the media the u.s congress

[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:54.280]  disclosure network she has received 2001 me for public affairs programming from the academy of
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:01.000]  television and arts and sciences and we're very honored uh to have her with us uh i mean this
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.640]  case is like something out of kafka or 1984 but it's happening in america and we see this more
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:15.560]  and more this is not the only case like this i've seen uh but uh she joins us now to break down and
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.040]  it looks like we're going to have mr fine on for 30 minutes or so in the last hour so this will be
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.680]  a bifurcated or divided interview in this hour and then and then coming up the next hour we're
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.880]  going to try to talk from his jail cell uh if he can get to the uh get through on the phone uh
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:35.080]  from his jail cell uh but uh leslie dotton thank you so much for coming on with us you're welcome
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.360]  allen okay a lot of people aren't aware of this case recap the basics of what's going on
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.560]  and how outrageous this is and where this is going well it's outrageous because we don't
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:52.360]  hear about cases like this very often uh the media keeps us in the dark uh but mr fine's case is
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:59.240]  unusual in the sense that he has drawn the line he refused to pay a jet obey a judge's illegal
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:06.520]  order a judge who had should have recused himself because they accept illegal payments from a party
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:13.240]  in the case before him that party was the la county and the county has been paying the judges here
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:21.560]  in in the county for 20 for 25 years illegally and there was a court case called surgeon versus
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.760]  the county of la that the appellate court held that those payments were illegal because the judges
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:33.800]  worked for the state and the county's one of the biggest litigants in the county so it is very uh
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:40.760]  hard to it isn't hard to understand when mr fine just tells us that by their own admission the county
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:48.120]  has never lost the case except for three um so the county's looking at this like risk management
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.720]  paying off the judges according to mr fine but what he did was rather than obey the judge's
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:38:01.480]  illegal order to and the judge ordered him to pay $47,000 which he didn't have to the county
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:08.360]  to cover the cost of an illegal uh of an eir report that's an environmental impact report on a
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:14.200]  development but mr fine is sitting in jail because he refuses to cave into the corruption
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:20.280]  and i have to tell you the full disclosure network has been covering this since the day before he
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:26.600]  was arrested when we interviewed him he knew what he was getting into but he didn't realize
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.600]  how bad the situation was and what he's done in all the court that he has filed from his jail
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:39.000]  cell is appealed his rid of any of corpus his motions and so forth is that he has documented
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:45.800]  everything that is happening if they do a court when they responded they violated every rule
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:52.680]  they ignored his rights and due process and they covered for each other and we're going to talk
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:59.480]  about that we're going to talk about that in a moment uh full disclosure uh dot net uh is the
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.080]  website we want to find out more full disclosure uh dot net but again you're a high caliber person
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:09.560]  i mean you're civically involved at the highest levels of the community and government yeah you're
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:17.240]  an Emmy award winner uh so i mean you've checked into this yourself and mr fine is no slouch him's
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:24.440]  either no he has a phd in international law he was an antitrust prosecutor for the department
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:31.720]  of justice in washington um but it was when he his career became so successful as a consumer
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:38.440]  and taxpayers advocate that he ran into trouble and he had great success outside of la county
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:45.320]  but in la county uh he found as he described that the corruption was so bad that he couldn't
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:50.120]  there wasn't a fair shake in the court and that the people are not getting a fair shake
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:56.520]  and he had had it he just decided it was time to draw the line and clean up the corruption in the court
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.320]  well we've seen the case uh in pennsylvania there's been other cases where it's admitted
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:10.120]  and judges have now been indicted forgetting what uh two judges 2.6 million to take innocent kids
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.640]  and put them in a private juvenile lockup and the company that ran that was secretly paying the
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:22.680]  judges to put innocent people in jail so we know that mr fine's case in this case in pennsylvania
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.200]  and others are just the tip of the iceberg well you really put it very well because since the full
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:34.120]  disclosure started covering this we had no idea how bad it was but it appears that the courts are
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:40.440]  the beneficiaries of many fees and they gain money by the manner in which they handle the cases
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  whether it be child custody cases whether it be uh uh environmental impact but there is a
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:55.560]  monetary incentive for judges who benefit from the decisions they make and there's no oversight
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:01.640]  and although the presiding judges should be uh checking there should be a checks and balances
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:06.360]  but it's certainly not working here and since we started doing this people have been coming
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:12.760]  out of the woodwork to share other horror stories and mr fine has dug his heels in and said it's
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:19.240]  time to clean it up okay i want to show people a document cam shot who are watching in prison
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.760]  planet dot tv if you're a radio listener you'll want to search the term two judges plead guilty
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:32.040]  and sending kids to lock up pair accused of taking 2.6 million in payoffs to put away young offenders
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:37.160]  two pennsylvania judges charged with taking millions of dollars in kit backs to send youth
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:42.200]  offenders to privately run detention centers pled guilty to fraud thursday in one of the most
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:49.000]  stunning cases of judicial corruption on record now the inside scoop i've got from former and current
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.480]  fbi federal marshals uh especially here in texas most of these small towns in fact i've seen
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.880]  it on cnn where they get the local judge on to admit yeah i'm getting part of the money
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:05.800]  from what we take and they just pull families over take their wallets uh so so people hearing this
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:14.760]  are saying you mean on record in la county the judges are getting money and and specifically
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:20.520]  in this case how was this discovered and how much money because i mean this isn't legal obviously
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.360]  and then somebody soothes over it and they get locked up by the very judge who's in trouble
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:34.680]  well the the judges were at the courts were warned before they started giving the money illegally
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:40.360]  the attorney general wrote an opinion and sent it to the superior court court of the court
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:45.800]  and advised them that they should not do that mr fine in the interview that we did with him
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:51.880]  in the min central jail uh told us the documentation let me stop you again let me stop you again this
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:56.840]  is like philadelphia again where the schools are given federally paid for laptops they're
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.160]  watching the kids at home and the schools are the one that told the public they were watching kids
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:07.480]  in their bedroom let's pull that photo up and my point is tying this in is that in one state you
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.360]  go to prison for this and the attorney general in california says this is illegal and they just
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.600]  say we don't care i mean this is a new level of brazen corruption well without a doubt that's what
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:25.720]  it is and here's the real kicker when it became public that those payments were illegal after
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:31.240]  the judicial watch organization won their lawsuit challenging the payment and the appellate court
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.880]  found them illegal the judicial council went to the feral steinberg the leader of the uh state
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:44.520]  legislature and and put through very quietly during the height of the budget crisis last year
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:52.440]  a provision of bill senate bill sdx 211 that gave the judges and the government officials involved
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:59.000]  in the illegal payment scheme retroactive criminal and civil immunity from prosecution
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:07.240]  and to this day no mainstream media in this state has reported that well you know why because i'm
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:12.840]  guarantee it's going on in every major city in many small towns and they know this can bring their whole
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:19.240]  corrupt system down so well why doesn't pennsylvania just pass a law saying judges can be given 2.6
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.080]  million under the table i mean this is incredible and as you said there's almost a complete mainstream
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:32.440]  media blackout on this that's true but you know what alec not to despair there is hope because
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:38.200]  our judges are elected officials and they have to stand for confirmation once they're appointed
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:43.800]  they have to stand for confirmation every six years and they can be voted out and it's time
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:49.960]  that the people wake up and realize that the arrogance that demonstrated here that they can
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:55.640]  that they have the power to control the legislator the governor they have the power well look what
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:02.360]  happened with us we wanted we tried for a year to get into the jail to interview mr fine to see
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:08.520]  how he was doing his health because he is 70 years old and did they the sheriff repeatedly
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:15.480]  denied us but they let uh they let the la times come in and interview them and of course the la
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:23.240]  times report was a very very scant in detail so we had to file a lawsuit to get access to
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:31.080]  get to speak with him and to for you to see him in on your website and and and hear his words
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:36.920]  we have the judicial watch organization filed a lawsuit on our behalf and 30 days later the
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:43.320]  sheriff came in and i have to tell you we really feel very grateful that we got that opportunity
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:50.040]  worry is not for that i i really worry what would be happening to mr fine right now and how many
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:56.680]  others there are in jail similar to what's happening to him well let me be clear judicial
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:01.640]  watch you judge a tree by its fruits and they just continue to do a great job on so many fronts
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.560]  it was judicial watch three years ago that sued and got the four year documents
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.720]  that the government wouldn't release on the north american union spp meeting that i put in my film
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:15.240]  endgame show folks really need to support judicial watch i just continue over the years to see them
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:20.280]  do such important work but i mean that's a whole nother issue not only is this corruption now just
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:26.440]  out on the open and being left alone and there's a media blockade on it but he's been in jail for
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:33.560]  more than a year on contempt potentially i guess if this precedent is set judicially uh then you
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:39.480]  can have local judges putting people behind bars for their entire life without ever even having
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:45.800]  a trial but what's really interesting is the fact that it's what they're doing is in violation of the
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:53.560]  supreme court precedent set in 1974 when the reporter william bar of the los angeles time
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:47:00.360]  was held in contempt and he was held for 47 days and he finally got to the supreme court with his
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:08.600]  appeal and the court held that since the penal code that if you hold someone more than five days
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:15.080]  in coercive confinement it becomes penal for the first civil contempt and that they cannot do that
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:22.840]  in this in mr fine's case every single court from all the way up to california through the
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:29.320]  u.s district court to the newt ninth circuit court of appeal has ignored the supreme court
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:36.600]  precedent including justice kennedy uh mr fine made a personal application to justice kennedy
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:42.920]  asking him for a day of execution which is a kind of ironic because he's never been convicted or
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:49.640]  tried or even charged with a crime uh but kennedy just summarily denied it without comment and
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:54.680]  without signature well that's because they're creating this this extra judicial precedent
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:48:00.200]  under the military commissions act and the rest of it and now they've got the belligerent act
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:09.400]  uh in the senate introduced uh by mccain and by lindsey graham and it says right there that that
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:15.000]  the president or his designates for any reason including intelligence gathering can arrest and
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.920]  interrogate and hold indefinitely u.s citizens and that only an act of congress can have them
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:28.520]  be released i mean so they're moving towards abolishing the writ of habeas corpus and it
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:34.440]  would appear that way but they're doing this is what they're doing now law or not this is actual
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:41.560]  practice just like they spied on us for decades without warrants then they got caught they retroactively
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:49.480]  go have congress pass a law my god well again why was the judge so brazen uh uh i mean they had
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:55.400]  defeated his suit because of their corruption and then now they wanted to punish him with 47
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.240]  thousand dollars this is not the british system where in most cases you don't have to pay the uh
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.240]  the the uh the attorney's fees unless it's found to be frivolous this clearly isn't and the judge
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:11.000]  just says that's it go to the dot you know go to the dungeon yes well this is revenge uh he has
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:17.400]  embarrassed the judges he's exposed them and they need to be exposed really because we have a right
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:23.640]  to know how the system works so it doesn't work but but they don't like that and they have the power
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.760]  to do it and the other judges are apparently backing them up all the way to the supreme court
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:35.480]  however there is a glimmer of hope the fact that uh justice ginsberg has scheduled this for the
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:41.400]  consent hearing on the 23rd is a good sign it doesn't mean necessarily it's going to be heard
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:48.360]  they will decide and vote as to whether or not they're going to take it up and some experts
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.640]  believe that there's a good chance that they will decide to do this because of the supreme court
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:50:01.160]  precedent in the far case and the underlying issue which is corruption and bribes being taken by the
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:09.960]  judges and a quietly passed law giving him immunity from bribery that has yet to be completely
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:16.680]  resolved and let me tell you once again judicial watch is doing a yeoman's job they are still fighting
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:24.360]  off continuing challenges from the superior court uh trying to nullify the uh the victory that they
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:31.160]  got uh declaring those payments illegal uh they're back in another uh appellate court hearing
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:37.960]  probably this july and at that time it is possible that the issue of the illegality of
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:43.720]  a retroactive law to bestow a criminal immunity on the judges could be thrown out
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:50.680]  okay leslie dutton amazing information stay there let's talk about how we get justice here because
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:56.440]  we all hang together or we hang separate the foundation of our republic is habeas corpus

[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:31.800]  free richard fine movement and one is going to be in front of the superior court is los angeles
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.280]  at eight o'clock in the morning the other one's going to be held in front of the steps of the
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:45.640]  u.s supreme court and uh grassroots citizens are at urge to turn out bring a sign and and the one
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:55.880]  in there in the uh before the supreme court will start at 11 a.m to 1 p.m uh on the 20th and bring
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:01.720]  a sign and come down there and let's show the supreme court that you want richard fine to be
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:09.160]  free and that we want to reveal what is going on with our justice system and reform it and the rally
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:16.440]  at the uh los angeles superior court will be in full view of uh judge david jaffe the judge that
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:22.360]  jailed mr fine and all the others as they come to work that morning they'll have to pass through
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:28.120]  all the people there for the rally and let's show support from the citizens that we want our justice
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:35.560]  system back and we want clean and honest government and we want fairness in the court well this is
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.920]  so fundamental i don't even have words to properly describe how important this is i've studied the
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:47.960]  founding of our nation in the 15 years of tumult that led up to 1775 1776 and the media always says
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:53.640]  it was about taxation and the stamp act was part of it the t act that was part of it but the main
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:58.840]  reason you read this the declaration of independence is mr fine said was that they created these kings
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:04.680]  courts outside of the courts that englishmen in england had access to well we no longer had access
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:12.280]  to it here in the uh colonies and uh it was the same thing judges would take your property they
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.920]  they would take bribes they would anybody that stood up against them they would order them arrested
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:23.160]  with no trial they would transport them to other colonies or to england for kangaroo trials special
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:29.000]  courts the king set up uh that uh that that englishmen had fought in the magna card and the
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  parliament act or and so it's the same thing repeating itself this is what went on in soviet
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:41.560]  russia and communist china and that el castros cuba we know tyranny and this is just another
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:48.200]  serious red flag the biggest i've seen uh and it shows how evil our mainstream media is pretty
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:54.440]  much blacking this out and we're going to try to talk to mr fine uh coming up for about 30 minutes
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:58:02.280]  in the last hour today uh but uh leslie dutton's website is full disclosure dot net thank you so
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:08.120]  much and i want to thank one of our writers out in california uh chrisandra anderson who first
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:13.320]  alerted this uh to this and wrote that article four info wars dot com uh that you helped put
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:19.320]  together uh leslie dutton but i salute you spending your time and energy to defend uh justice well
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:26.280]  let me ask a favor of you when you talk with mr fine be sure and ask him what impact the judicial

[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:39.080]  goldman sacks with fraud here's usa today us accuses goldman sacks um fraud msnbc us charges
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:45.240]  goldman sacks with civil fraud uh should be criminal fraud and of course bob has been saying this for
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:49.560]  for i don't know how long we've been interviewing bob it's got to be 10 years or 12 years or
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:56.440]  something now and uh we had the mclatchy news reporter on who who broke this three months ago
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:02.760]  greg gordon who got through lawsuits these internal documents that are now uh causing all
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.320]  of this to unfolds we're going to come back to bob chatman have him comment on the dollar going down
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:15.000]  gold skyrocketing uh right now uh where he sees the economy uh going and what this means uh with
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.560]  goldman sacks as we know the sec is famously corrupt and much of the government's run by
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:26.680]  goldman sacks alumni in this revolving door so how could this now be happening this is what
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:32.120]  should happen but not just civil criminal and this opens goldman sacks up even more lawsuits
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.440]  of flotella have been launched the last year and a half uh but this needs to be criminal but this
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:41.720]  does begin to open the door towards criminal and justice be done may the heavens fall i'm just
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:46.280]  amazed this is even happening uh but maybe they're using the investigation as a way to sweep up all
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.680]  the evidence then cover it up that's one of their favorite tricks i don't know bob's opinion on this
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:54.920]  but i know i'm going to respect it i respect his opinion we'll get his take on on the other side

[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:38.440]  fridays because i take off the international forecaster worked in military intelligence then
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:43.880]  was uh one of the biggest private silver and gold brokers in the world had the most popular
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:47.960]  newsletter until he retired then he came back in the last decade and has the international
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:54.120]  forecaster dot com and he's always targeted the sec is a particularly criminal group of regulators
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:59.880]  he's always targeted via brokerage and and investment banks as goldman sacks as being the
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:07.880]  tip top of the pyramid of corruption you look at you look at uh chili you look at new zealand you
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.680]  look at greece you look at germany you look at england you look at almost every country i look at
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:17.640]  its goldman sacks runs the treasury goldman sacks is the president or the prime minister former
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:23.160]  goldman sacks you've got the new york fed for former goldman sacks uh now the treasury secretary
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:28.280]  former goldman sacks the last treasury secretary former goldman sacks sec full of goldman sacks
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:33.320]  five times the money in fact the biggest contributor to obama was goldman sacks five times the money
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:38.680]  they gave to mccain overall four times with the wall street totals we're not saying mccain was
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.680]  good folks the point is he was the guy and so how is this happening sec charges goldman sacks
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:51.400]  with fraud that's cnn uh money us accuses goldman sacks of fraud that's uh new york times and
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:56.040]  remember about three and a half months ago we had a big financial investigative journalist
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:02.360]  on from a clatchy newspapers who got the internal emails from lawsuits where and this is just one
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:08.360]  of their crimes and it's out in the open it's it's open and shut uh that they were betting against
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:14.040]  the housing market while certifying and going to aig and paying for insurance to say it was pure
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:22.040]  gold triple a rated and then selling it uh to investment funds corporations individuals pension
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:27.720]  funds for fire police teachers that's some of the biggest knowing that they were going to bring it
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.720]  down and then make even more money and destroy their competition that's in the emails then you
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:36.920]  separately have geithner with goldman sacks and aig remember this came out three months ago as well
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:47.080]  in emails through his board at the new york fed telling goldman sacks aig jp morgan chase bank of
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:53.000]  america and others do not tell the public where the money is going and that is illegal as well so
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.120]  it's just open and shut but but the other issue here is on bob to really walk through all the facets
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.880]  bob i'm gonna try to shut up and let you roll with us for this the rest of this segment we're
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:08.600]  going to some other issues but why is the sec doing this i mean this is is this to sweep up
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:11.800]  that's what my instincts tell me because they've never done anything good to sweep up all the
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:17.240]  evidence and investigation and then whitewash it uh before state grand juries and diet which
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:23.400]  we know there's movements towards what you're right about the states uh the ag in connecticut
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:30.680]  uh moved on them in a similar manner a civil manner and i wrote about that i guess it was
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:39.080]  three weeks ago and i said uh to the subscribers especially you you who live in connecticut
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:45.880]  go to the ag and ask him why he hasn't filed criminal charges and then i saw a little bit later
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:52.120]  that the ag is wants to run for the governor or something like that so you know that he wants to
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:57.880]  do something but he doesn't want to get it to get too much in the end in a line of fire so to speak
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:09.000]  i've been going after the sec for years uh i started uh back in the early 80s telling them
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:16.200]  of different scams of going down uh eventually they went after one of them that was 10 years later
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.640]  and remember for 10 years the that other fellow i forget his name gave them complete dossiers
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:29.720]  on the made-off scam and they did nothing that's right and the reason they don't is the people in
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:35.560]  in the sec first of all answer to the government and the government is controlled from behind the
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:43.960]  scenes by the large brokerage firms in particular and these people who work for the sec they work
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:52.040]  there five or seven eight years there's some exceptions but not many and then they'll contact
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:58.600]  the people who they've been overseeing from the agency and they'll say gee i i think i'd like to
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:06.280]  go to work for you and of course they've done nothing detrimental to these firms and the
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:13.640]  firm say well sure and uh the the man's probably making 70 000 a year with the sec and he start
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:23.720]  making it starts making 700 000 a year and so and this is sort of a a conveyor belt uh from the sec
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:34.600]  to uh the large firms and that's it's a payoff uh to the sec employees for uh looking the other way
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:41.640]  and you just cited uh the gentleman who uh has since wrote a book about how he went out to the sec
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:50.360]  for 10 years and he would listen to him well the reason why is this man was connected and they may
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:57.400]  have well known that it was the cia massage operation i'm sure they did and if you notice with the
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:07.320]  uh that affair of of madoff uh the trial was closed and the only people there were uh the
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:13.800]  courts of the court and the attorneys and the judge uh and no evidence ever came out because
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:20.440]  there were hundreds of people involved in that thing and so this guy stole from 60 to 110
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:28.600]  billion all by himself and no one else knew well it's just like uh the lone killer theory you know
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:40.440]  and uh but the the sec uh it it operates at the behest of the government and with the large firms
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.640]  and that's why they don't get touched and even if they do even if the evidence is so blatant
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:52.600]  they give them a fine and the shareholders pay the fine not them and they go back doing the same
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:15:00.680]  thing the next day uh they neither admit nor deny is the term and i know i spent 28 years in the
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:08.200]  brokerage for business i own my own firm and so what's happening here is the evidence is all
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:15.640]  there as you pointed out through the freedom of information act the clatchy the reporter uh we
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:23.240]  have been writing about this we'll call it an episode for three years and we didn't get very
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:30.680]  far but uh evidently the attorneys for others who had bought this toxic waste that they were selling
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:39.000]  uh they're going after them and so the sec was forced to act and this is very important
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:49.000]  they only act when they have to so the overwhelming evidence is let's see as you said alex if we can
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:56.200]  do as much whitewashing as we can and we'll find them uh probably maybe a billion dollars or something
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:01.640]  and they'll go right on doing what they did before now there's something going on here
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.400]  to the rest of wall street that's really disturbing because they're not all crooks
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:14.600]  the people of golem and sacks and and and jp morgan chafe and city group are crooks
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:23.880]  not all of them but most of them at the upper end and i think the other people who were working on
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:31.160]  the street as it's called they're sick and tired of this relationship between golem and sacks and
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:39.000]  the treasury department and the government in general and the firm of jp morgan chafe
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.080]  in their relationship with the federal reserve and both golem and morgan are owners of the federal
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:52.360]  reserve two of the largest owners along with city group and so what's going to happen here
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:58.600]  is they're going to try to smooth it over as much as possible because it's a bomb waiting to happen
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:07.160]  now most people don't know it i'm going to kind of go off to the side here jp morgan had a lot of
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:15.960]  records pulled by the fbi about a week ago most people don't know about it uh one of my people
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:22.920]  in new york bring you know write stuff and the reports to me and uh he told me about it he was
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:31.800]  the one and incidentally i announced the made-off taper two weeks before they came down on him i knew
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:39.560]  about it and i knew what was going to happen through this source that i have and this source told me
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:47.560]  about the fbi going into taking these records the records from morgan jp morgan chafe that they took
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:55.000]  were in regard to enron and what they and cibc and golem and a number of other
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:18:01.720]  bankers had done was set up offshore accounts for enron where they would show profit profits that
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:10.200]  didn't exist and that's what kept the scam going and so now they're investigating that now i don't
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:15.000]  think it'll go much of any way you'll see it in the papers and they'll find them nobody ever goes to
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:22.360]  jail none of the illuminati goes to jail so it's a slap on the wrist to make the angry public
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:27.880]  think something has been done ahead of the new banking takeover where they want carbon taxes
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:33.160]  value added taxes i'm seeing it all overseeing in fox they're pushing that we've got to have this
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:40.600]  to save america you know pay all our taxes to the bankers but specifically they're in trouble for
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:46.040]  telling people to buy these derivatives when they knew they were planning to tank them uh so you know
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.680]  at least this will educate people further about the fact that this is criminal but as you said
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:58.520]  they're civilly going after them not criminally well there's one more step in this and it's a matter
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:07.640]  of public record that all of these bankers and brokerage houses all work very closely with the
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:20.760]  rating agencies moody's s&p and fish but mostly s&p and moody's and they together let's say bank a and
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:31.640]  s&p decided that this tranche of syndicated mortgages bonds known as collateralized debt obligations
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:41.880]  was triple a now it wasn't triple a it was triple b and then the insurance companies like ai g
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:48.040]  certified it so another layer of fraud exactly and then and then they they dropped from a dollar

[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:20.040]  part of the establishment you've got ron paul supporters that founded the two parties three
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:24.920]  years ago being beat up at republican events in phoenix thrown out of they even ask questions the
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:30.520]  police help the tea partiers beat them up we've got the democrats finally in the associated press
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:38.360]  in major news showing up with nazi signs posing as tea partiers they're attacking that angle the
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:43.800]  media has advertised the only way to protest this takeover is the tea parties and then they destroy
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:51.400]  that system and now on the heels of that homegrown solo terrorist are as bad as al qaeda fbi chief
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:56.280]  warns al qaeda still aims to strike inside the united states but homegrown or unaffiliated extremists
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:03.640]  now pose an equally serious threat fbi chief roger robert meuller warned us lawmakers yesterday
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:09.160]  evening al qaeda and its affiliates are still committed to striking united states meuller told
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:14.840]  us in appropriations grippy said homegrown and lone wolf extremists pose an equally serious
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:20.200]  threat so now we're seeing the shift they build homeland security claiming it's for foreigners
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:25.400]  we have their documents going back over the years it's totally fake rigid meets that it's for the
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:30.920]  american people and now they're going to infiltrate and set up a few militias to create this perception
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:34.920]  that anybody who doesn't like big governments a terrorist and i believe they're going to stage
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:38.840]  terror attacks sooner rather than later to blame it on us and really have the big crack down what
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:47.400]  does bob Chapman say four prong attack number one to take over the tea parties number two uh to
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:54.680]  vilify them as uh uh the kind of things that are around american number three uh the police
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:01.960]  verifying that uh there are nutcases running around america who uh are going to be worse than
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:07.960]  al qaeda and number four things that we discussed before uh the fourth target and maybe the most
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:19.400]  important is trying to neutralize alex jones and bob Chapman and so that we cannot uh function
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:24.600]  and let the people know the truth well the last one they've been very unsuccessful at in fact
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:30.520]  we're reaching more and more people every day but that's the fourth pronged attack now you know i
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:37.400]  was with ronald reagan on his speaker's bureau in los angeles in the mid sixties when ronnie first
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:45.400]  ran for governor and i traveled a lot with him and the minute uh in one of my speeches
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:52.920]  lynn nossing who represented the rockefeller interest uh uh from uh the east coast uh who was
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:27:00.920]  running uh the the uh the program for uh reagan for governor uh the minute he found out i was very
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:10.200]  conservative uh you know he had me thrown out and it's this sort of thing the infiltration
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:19.800]  and and it's like that and and we're seeing it now with the republican hierarchy moving in on
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:28.280]  the tea tea party people and uh they're probably going to neutralize it from what you've just said
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:34.520]  and the events that are going on and of course you've got the crazies from the democratic uh
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:40.920]  liberal side who are running around as imposters saying that they're tea party people and being
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:48.360]  dressed up as radicals such as nazis and so uh they get this thing unfully on the way and we're
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:55.480]  going to see lots of it uh through the summer and uh they're doing everything they can to try to
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:05.240]  keep these representatives and senators in the senate and in congress in order to continue to
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.680]  do the work of the people from behind the scenes the alumnus because they got them all paid off
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:15.720]  exactly let me throw this in let me throw this in you got rand paul and all the major polls at
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:21.000]  least 10 points ahead of the democrat and republican challenger so the republican party's coming in
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:26.920]  and they're running somebody against him uh who is the head of elections the secretary of state
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.640]  that's completely illegal and ron paul's been on the show and agrees i mean it's just it's never
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:37.080]  before been done i was reading in texas state house elections there's all these real tea party
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:44.280]  people who are beating old line republicans and so now the republicans are coming in going after
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:50.280]  real tea party people so everywhere they're trying to target good patriots that have a chance of
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:54.440]  taking us back at the state and federal level which again just shows us i mean newt genrich
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:29:00.680]  is running around a total globalist pushing carbon taxes and he was being praised in austin
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:06.600]  by the moron tea party group that was there yesterday well you're gonna find that because
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:11.800]  they don't know what we know and they're not listening to us they they they think in terms
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:17.080]  of political agenda and it really doesn't work that way and that's why so many people on radio
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:22.600]  and television and especially newsletter writers they can never get to the bottom of what's going
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:27.960]  on because they just don't understand look in california i was on a modesto the other day
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:33.000]  on a program that i do a couple of times a month stay there stay there let's talk about that

[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:25.320]  most dvd players as an activist tool to get these out to everyone i'm asking you to take action look
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.400]  when we get up here and we say we've had a massive effect because of you being activist
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.640]  the proof is in the pudding there's a huge awakening world government is now admitted
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:41.640]  the people are starting to wake up every day i can google my name and see mainstream news articles
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:47.640]  in george soros publications and the government lying about me demonizing me saying i'm dangerous
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:53.880]  they're not doing that uh because we're weak they're doing it because we're strong we have the
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:59.560]  truth we know their game plan and they're scared listen gondy said before they brought the british
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:06.200]  down peacefully uh back in the 1930s they brought them down in the 50s that first they ignore you
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:12.760]  then they laugh at you then they attack you then you win and i have been ignored
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:19.560]  then i've been laughed at now we're being attacked what does that mean i mean bob Chapman when i get
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:26.760]  up here and say films are the equivalent of common sense you know in 1774 1775 this is how
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.240]  people get their news and information and these films have been seen by hundreds of millions of
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:36.280]  people it's having a massive effect to the point of the republican leadership is taking on our
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:40.520]  political coloration to try to fool people i mean this is the greatest compliment we could get bob
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:46.440]  well you're right about that and uh they're terrified and it goes down all the way down
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:51.960]  into the party ranks of both parties because they know what you represent you're you're the
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:57.800]  a threat to the scam that they're running whatever that scam is and all of these people have a scam
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:05.160]  believe me uh it's all the way from wall wall street down to the uh the appointees and bureaucrats
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:15.080]  and administrations but uh you know the the power of what you've been putting out is immeasurable
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:22.120]  totally immeasurable i get letters from all over the world uh via email of course and they all talk
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:27.720]  about you saying well uh i see what he's doing and i've heard you on there and this is wonderful
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:33.880]  and i want to be a subscriber and i'll never miss a friday and uh and that sort of thing so
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:41.720]  we are penetrating and the enemy is terrified and they should be and we're going to win just like
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:47.640]  gandhi said through that process well they've committed such outrageous crimes out in the
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:51.800]  open and we're just here saying don't destroy our freedom don't destroy our country don't destroy
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:57.560]  our way of life and calling us unpatriotic isn't going to work the media is so discredited
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:01.800]  i don't think they realize that when they attack us that just makes more people come see what we
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:11.000]  have to say it certainly does believe me it certainly does bob i want to go ahead no no
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:16.840]  that's okay superfluous i want to go to calls but first uh this again i want this to hit people
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:22.120]  want people to really sit back and let this soak in and meditate on it for a moment think about it
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:30.600]  in california in michigan and tennessee and texas in florida uh in pennsylvania in ohio in new
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:37.320]  york in new jersey in new mexico in arizona in nevada i mean we can pull these articles up we have
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:44.680]  of where the they put cameras in the showers and then a visiting team in one case about eight years
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.160]  ago in tennessee the girls basketball team was taking a shower after the game and saw the cameras
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.480]  they ran out screaming the parents got mad and the school said well our school knows this we
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:57.640]  we openly announced this year we watch the girls and the boys naked and we videotape them
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:02.360]  because there could be crime in the showers this is in a nice school and that was a psychological
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.480]  warfare test to just see if they can come out and say we're watching you in the showers
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:11.800]  and i've seen case after case of this cameras in the bathrooms cameras in the stalls cameras in
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:17.400]  the stalls at roadway stops everywhere and then it comes out because the school announces it a
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:22.760]  month ago oh we're watching the kids at home and we're watching their parents and and throw the
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:29.640]  photos up that have now been released by the court of kids asleep in their beds and the school
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:34.520]  with the issued laptops is in google announced four years ago they're watching people at home
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:42.920]  now uh i mean it's so amazing and here's uh philly dot com uh the philadelphia inquire
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:48.280]  lawyers laptops took thousands of images and they've got emails from the school saying
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:53.000]  this is the best soap opera ever a staffer is quoted as saying an email uh to the administrator
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.080]  running the program i know i love it she has quoted as having replied in fact i forgot to
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:03.560]  give you the clip watson posted that front line before this ever came out a year and a half ago
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:10.120]  front line showed teachers watching kids over the laptops i want to play that video because
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:14.760]  you know the issue is the media is acting like this is an isolated case bob this is not isolated
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:21.720]  but the magnitude of how out of control government is that they come out and announce we're watching
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:30.280]  you at home i mean this is more than orwellian bob chavin it's um strictly perversion
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:38.280]  of one form another that's really the basis to it i mean children don't do anything when they're
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:45.960]  sleeping uh and people don't fondle people in in showers and bathrooms at school i mean i never
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:51.400]  saw it and you know that's not even the issue you're guilty until proven innocent and the school
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:57.960]  is perving the is openly watching people i mean the police can't put a camera in your house without
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:06.360]  a warrant but the school just does it it's illegal that's right but it's they're watching not because
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:13.800]  they're concerned about anybody they're watching to see what these people are like and they're perverts
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:21.720]  i'm going to play a video clip from a year and a half ago long before this even broke of another
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:29.240]  school district on front line with them playing this like it's no big deal uh let's go ahead and play
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:36.040]  that video clip now so i click and there's an observed button and it brings up their screen
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:42.200]  the school's assistant principal spends part of each day remotely monitoring what the kids are
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:48.280]  doing on their laptops we have a photo booth he can see them but they can't see him these kids are
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:54.840]  goofing off taking pictures of themselves in class so wait do all the kids have the cameras on six and
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:42:00.920]  seven three have cameras a lot of kids are just on it to check their hair do their makeup they just
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:05.480]  use it like it's a mirror i always like to mess with them and take a picture
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:12.360]  nine times that is how they duck out of the way and then they shut down and they get right back to
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:18.680]  work so i can see he's got a few things going on here he's got the photo booth program open
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:23.160]  he's got this is social studies project open school email open
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:29.160]  you know i think the kids know what is expected of them but they also
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:34.440]  want to do all their other things that's what i see a lot of this the multitasking but i was doing
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:39.720]  my work too most of the adults at the school actually seemed pretty sanguine about the kids
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:47.080]  being so easily distracted you learn something new every day i think that okay so out in plain view
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:53.560]  they train the children to be watched everything they do being photographed in the school now it's
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:59.080]  outside of the school these are laboratories they thumb scan to get school lunches they're
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:05.800]  biometrically controlled they're frisk they're searched this is prison training this is the
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:15.160]  destruction of our free republic bob it certainly is and uh it's the um the practice of continually
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:22.840]  watching people and people become hardened to it and they expect it as normal and it's not normal
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:29.160]  and so in the social experiment the government's been watching you at school now they say we're
[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:34.200]  watching you at home the parents get upset they haven't been conditioned enough to accept it
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:40.360]  they file lawsuits again it's all part of incrementalism do you agree absolutely and
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:47.720]  dialectic incrementalism let's take some calls let's talk to brad in california you're on the
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:53.480]  air with bob chatman of the international forecaster dot com go ahead brad sweet hey thanks uh alexen
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:59.320]  thanks bob uh this kind of uh is a little off topic but i i'll try to hide into economics a
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:05.800]  little bit um i want to talk about soft kills eugenics and uh vegetarianism veganism and low
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:11.880]  fat diets uh you can see how they're promoting that the environmentalists are promoting uh
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:16.760]  veganism vegetarianism they're trying to admit they're going to put taxes on all meat that's
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:21.560]  already started in europe and it's also shown that the brain doesn't develop as well without the
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:27.560]  fatty acids and things that are in me absolutely and they people become sterilized by veganism
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:32.600]  and vegetarianism definitely and so uh they're trying to sterilize well that's actually true
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:37.160]  women that are on vegan diets most of them have trouble having children and their doctor won't
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:40.840]  even tell them why they can't have children uh because if you're not getting enough protein
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:45.400]  the body shuts down and won't let you be reproductive absolutely and it makes people
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:49.640]  more docile if you look at ancient tribes like what's in a price visit at all these tribes throughout
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:56.600]  the world uh people who try to aid a traditional diet a high in fat high in animal meats and blood
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:01.400]  and things like that organ they were strong territorial they held their ground and people
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:07.960]  who ate more of a vegetarian style diet were docile and easily conquered uh no i mean i mean
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.640]  that anthropology's been well pointed out and that's another reason they they drug the water
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:19.160]  they push drugs on us legal and illegal bob chat any comments on that uh i i just think it's amazing
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:25.480]  that some of the things that uh some of the listeners come up with and uh the intelligent uh
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:32.680]  uh uh coverage that they they get out of it i mean i didn't know what this gentleman's talking
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:38.040]  about i'm you know i had never read about it and i thank you for calling in because i just learned
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:44.760]  something and then the system infects the meat with poisons and antibiotics and garbage and then
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:51.000]  moves in to shut it down it's incredible brad i appreciate your call tracy in uh new mexico you're
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:58.040]  on the air hey how you doing alex doing okay okay thanks for the call hey uh i was at the tea party
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:03.000]  yesterday in albuquerque yes for those that don't know let me pull the article out guys let's put
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:09.800]  the swastika photos on screen from the newspaper there democratic operatives running around with
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:16.440]  signs that said nazi youth for lower taxes and we know a groups nationally this is in the ap monday
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:21.080]  push to do this and this is similar to what the congressional black caucus got caught a month ago
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:25.560]  doing lying about the n word and being spent on uh go ahead you were there what did you see
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:32.120]  well i i don't they must have been on the other side of the street or something i i didn't see
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:39.880]  anything like that um everybody i saw had decent signs well this was in san afei where were you
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:45.400]  oh i was in albuquerque okay different city okay go ahead well there were thousands of people out
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:53.240]  there i got there about a about 330 and it was from four until seven i left about six and uh i
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.920]  almost couldn't get out there were i never saw so many people in one place i ended out about 120
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:04.600]  of your tapes and some of them two people with the large church groups that swore that they were
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:10.280]  gonna play them for their churches and a couple of biker groups one had a hundred in it another
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:17.560]  had 120 i gave them five uh of your dvds and uh they guaranteed me his whole roots going to watch
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:22.920]  him some of the guys have been talking about getting on making copies and passing them out too so
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:30.040]  here's a great opportunity um yeah they're scared to death that the patriots are going to take the
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:35.640]  tea parties back and use them as meeting groups to educate mainline republicans that's why all
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:40.360]  these republican leaders have been demonizing us and others uh and and and saying they've got to
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:46.120]  keep us out of the tea parties but but wonderful wonderful job that you did i just uh i just
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:51.640]  saturated them with your tapes and let me ask you can you make a copy out of one of your copies
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:57.640]  yes okay well that's what i told them to do and they said they would of course and they were tickled
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:01.960]  to death to get them the ones that got them from me there was only one lady that was a little
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:06.600]  smarter than everyone else and said she thought she had all the information she needed about what
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:12.840]  was going on and i checked her sign it was okay she seemed okay she was just a smarty and uh
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:19.000]  so i went on everybody else was shaking my hand thanking me they were appreciative of it did you
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:24.040]  tell them that this will give them the full picture yes i did i told them that you you
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:31.480]  you'll know you know why you're here if you watch these these dvds you will know exactly why
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:36.520]  you're here it will give you all the missing pieces that you don't have and i know you don't
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:44.200]  have them all no one does but these dvds will get you started on the right track yes sir make copies
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:50.040]  if you can pass them out let your friends see them have some friends over tracy it's what you're
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:54.840]  saying right now is what scares the globalist to death because you go wake people up they wake other
[02:48:54.840 --> 02:49:00.280]  people up the truth's only got to be applied once lies have to be applied over and over again
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:08.200]  and we're having a devastating effect on these people bob shatman i agree and uh it's too bad that
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:15.000]  he wasn't in the right city unfortunately he would have saw the the antics of the democratic
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.520]  operatives and you know that's really foolish because when you do things like that you always get
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:27.000]  discouraged uh and you know not discouraged you always get discovered and you know to do that
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  is just really dumb absolutely well tracy great job anything else well yeah i just wanted to say
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:40.840]  that i you know i hope it works i hope they do what they say they were going to this one biker
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:46.600]  uh he saw me with my bag on the ground shifting through you know i had them all separated out
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:53.720]  in different baggies and he said hey man get that up off the ground set it on my my saddle bag here
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:59.000]  on this big harley and uh had me lean my cane up there and he said you whenever you're around here
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:04.680]  you put that up here and work out of here don't you they've been over stand up so everybody was
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:10.840]  very nice very appreciative of getting these these dvds and they were chomping at the bit to get
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:16.200]  home and see them awesome tracy and again i keep going back to this we're not hyping this it's the

[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:25.160]  being held in violation of habeas corpus for exposing payoffs to judges and this is even
[02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:29.720]  starting to get into the mainstream news it dovetails for those that can't believe this is
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:36.040]  going on two judges plead guilty to sending kids to lock up per accused of taking 2.6 million
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:43.560]  in payoffs to put away innocent young offenders you know the way dr frederick whitehurst former
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:48.680]  head of the fbi crime lab put it a few weeks ago here on the show bob Chapman was he thinks in a way
[02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:52.840]  things are getting better he agrees with us it's just because of the internet and people not being
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:59.080]  as naive we're now finding out just how evil uh many levels of state local and federal and
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:03.640]  international government are and that things are actually getting better we're just discovering
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:11.800]  how bad things are well you're right you know that situation in la uh i lived here for 36 years
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:18.680]  and um a very good friend of mine was one of the top people and the district attorney's office
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:24.920]  and um in fact he was a very good friends with johnny conquering who's now deceased
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:33.960]  who represented ol j simpson in his trial uh the murder trial and um uh i knew that this
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:40.520]  was going on for years and everybody would just turn their head and one of the things that i found
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:49.560]  that really disturbed me were a lot of these judges federal and superior court judges um people of
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:56:00.600]  stature were alcoholics drug addicts and perverts i mean i was really shocked and that entered into
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:07.480]  their you know payoffs and things that they're doing within that la county system and so i'm
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:13.880]  known for years how rotten it is let's talk to robin florida you're on the air rob go ahead
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:20.680]  alex thank you very much for taking my call my name is rob talk i am uh giving a report a little
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:25.400]  bit on the t party movement here yesterday and call your county florida we had a phenomenal
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:30.840]  turnout i am a candidate for the constitution party running for call your county commissioner
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:36.680]  district two we have five different districts so five different commissioners and uh a phenomenal
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:43.640]  turnout yesterday i was able to speak publicly to the crowd that was gathered and uh i had one
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:48.680]  individual a local businessman who just entered the gubernatorial race for florida only just a
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:54.280]  couple of days ago i myself only joined the race for call your county commission a week and a half
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:57:00.120]  ago whether you win or lose you win because you get the issues out there just like ron paul did
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:06.920]  and lost but now his message is a thousand times bigger exactly and i was able to speak to the
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:10.920]  crowd that was gathered for about two to three minutes and i pointed out the fact that both
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:16.120]  democrats and republicans have been sold down the road and disenfranchised both both are parties
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:21.160]  by pointing out that bush doubled the size of government in his term and that obama doubled
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:26.760]  at least doubled the size of government was tripled year at first year of office and i said it is
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:32.360]  time for people to in the local government to go back to using the constitution as our guiding
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:38.840]  principle on what legislation we enact in which we refuse and when i spoke this even though that
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:44.280]  the one of my opponents spoke and uh the candidate for the gubernatorial race spoke
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:52.840]  the crowd erupted in incredible applause when i said that it is time for a new party
[02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:58.200]  that will actually represent the american people absolutely and the republicans are staking their
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:03.560]  fortune on the tea party taking it over and we're going to end up the same place we are now or worse
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:08.360]  once they get back in we have to fundamentally discredit this entire criminal system i appreciate
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:13.800]  your call rob that's a great report let's throw that comment by the texas ranger back there up on
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:21.720]  screens this makes me think of ron paul and his 30 plus years of perseverance uh against tyranny
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:26.520]  you know that famous quote about a man on the wrong can't stand up against a man on the right
[02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:34.440]  who keeps on uh coming uh because it's so important and that was said by uh the texas ranger captain

[03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:33.560]  for rulings i mean this is incredible and it dovetails again with two judges plead guilty
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:39.480]  and sending kids to lock up uh the pair admit they took 2.6 million in payoff to put away innocent
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:45.240]  young offenders they were paid off by the private prison facility we'll see if he's able to get

[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:58.360]  even gotten into yet but right now let's go back to your phone calls erwin in canada you're on the
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:05.480]  air thanks for holding yes congratulations alex i'm listening as much as i can every day and i see
[03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:10.280]  you're making progress we're making progress together sir god bless you what's on your mind
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:16.600]  uh i have a suggestion and i think this is absolutely most important considering biblical
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:24.520]  principles because biblical principle for healing is forgiveness and i want to tell you a little
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:30.840]  story i come from germany i was 18 years old when they came to canada and i was told here i was a
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:38.200]  nazi i didn't even know what that really was my parents were never involved in the national
[03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:44.360]  socialistic party with hitler they opposed hitler to the point where they were afraid to be jailed
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:51.800]  if we wouldn't have been nine children at home my dad would have been jailed so you can see
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:56.520]  where i come let me say this it's going to be the same thing americans now go to other countries
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:00.840]  and are hated because of the torture even though as americans we've been speaking out against it
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:06.280]  and fighting against it we still get the blame for it and america is now known as an engine of evil
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:11.880]  worldwide more more we are and uh when we're brought to justice we're all going to be blamed for it
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:17.000]  yes and this is my suggestion and i think it's most important it is a biblical principle
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:28.200]  and that is you have the credibility to on behalf of the american people publicly to apologize to
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:34.760]  the german people for having vilified and identified the german people with hitler
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:42.520]  even though hitler by hook hook and crook was voted in to the chancellery by only 32 percent
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:48.760]  of the public vote well i'll say this i mean i i mean i've exposed that and i've talked about
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:54.200]  that i wasn't alive then and and and so i don't think it would be proper you know for me to sit
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:00.600]  there and and apologize i think it's all part of information i mean i i can't i mean i i have
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:05.080]  apologized for the torture of children and for the fact that we're under mind control in this
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:09.800]  country and so many people support it and i see them in the youtube comments on our ipod video
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:17.800]  people just praising the death of children it's it's totally sick uh but um again that's stereotypes
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:22.200]  it's like imagine how the arabs feel or people with brown skin for the middle east i mean the
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:29.480]  middle east on average is over 20 christian and you know christians uh take seeks from india
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.880]  they have nothing to do with muslims and i'm not bashing muslims or either another you with muslims
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:40.760]  and last time i saw it was over 30 plus in the last six seven years eight years since 9 11 that
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:46.680]  people walk into gas stations or liquor stores or hotels and shoot seeks because they're wearing
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:52.120]  turbans on their head part of their religion to have long hair and and and you know not cut their
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:58.520]  hair uh and but you know i mean do i apologize to the seeks for for government propaganda that
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:04.360]  makes crazy people go shoot them i mean uh i think i would just again have people
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:12.680]  really study geopolitical systems and cultural systems before they make judgments because i'm
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:17.800]  seeing the comments right now in info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and on this uh
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:23.400]  youtube video the psychological experiment i did yesterday ipad tortured to death and mass

[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:16.440]  okay um the guests we were gonna have on we're we're able to take collect calls here at our
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:21.240]  office he rang through twice and then it said we're unable to accept collect calls so strange
[03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:27.960]  things happening with the phone system but we are working on getting richard fine on held for over
[03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:34.920]  a year in la county jail but regardless we'll get him on next week we're unable to today we have to
[03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:42.760]  get him a calling card but earlier in the hour before last we had one of the award-winning
[03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:49.240]  activist on who has sued with judicial watch to be able to get into even inner view him
[03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:58.600]  uh leslie dotton who is a me award-winning filmmaker so uh this case is just incredible
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:03.320]  and it mirrors two judges plead guilty and sending kids to lock up they're accused of
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:08.520]  taking 2.6 million in payoff to put away innocent young offenders and they pled guilty to this
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:13.640]  and i see similar cases popping up around the country but in la county know when you expose it
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:19.160]  you go to jail no jury no nothing the judge who's being accused and the evidence is there it's
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:25.320]  admitted they did this they send you to jail and that's the essence of a tyranny the essence of
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:30.760]  oppression is when there's no charges no nothing you just go to jail and then you never get out
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:37.080]  because they don't like you uh let's talk to debbie in california debbie you're on the air welcome
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:41.560]  hi i wanted to ask bob about silver but since he's gone i'm going to report
[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:47.720]  about the napa california tea party i basically got a death threat from someone because i was
[03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:53.560]  saying i was not into killing people in war so he said um i'd like to kill you that was a bummer
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:59.480]  um we have these war lovers these war lovers think that all the iraqis are dehumanized and
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:04.360]  they love the elite they don't understand the elite see them as just as worthless as the iraqis
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:09.240]  i know it's it's just unbelievable um the fds students for democratic society were there there
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:15.960]  was about 10 of them uh they were you know anti-war which was good but they were saying tax the rich
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:23.560]  tax the rich um there was a guy there with a bullhorn saying pay your taxes pay your taxes he was
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:28.760]  telling the fds group to get a job oh we've got videos from across the country of him chanting
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:34.840]  your taxes have been cut no the health care bill raises taxes uh there are all these new
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:39.960]  tax increases involved the government spending too much obama spent more than all presidents
[03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:45.400]  before him combined none of this is debatable and these democrats run around lying saying that
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:50.520]  that's not happening and and if your boss gets a tax increase they just pass it on to you you
[03:10:50.520 --> 03:10:56.600]  don't get bonuses and you get your pay cut and and and now obama wants a value added tax that
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:02.440]  will hit everybody in america um and they want carbon taxes that'll hit everybody in america
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:06.200]  and but i watch these democrats at these events in fact i sent you a video this morning and one
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:11.720]  just chanting it does there is no tax their taxes are too low they're ridiculously low
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:16.120]  he and i mean they're just mindless go ahead okay so the 911 truth i started asking people
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:22.360]  how many buildings went down i got seven five ten no one knew how many buildings went down i started
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:27.000]  talking to people dialoguing they all shouted me down they told me to get away we don't want
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  conspiracy theorists here go away i said free speech free speech uh most of them were neocon
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:38.360]  republicans at this napa tax party so it was unfortunate but i did have signs that said
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:46.040]  bush obama wall street puppets i had a sign indict the banksters uh jail not bail out
[03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:51.000]  now those people did apply those signs but all in all i thought it was kind of a neocon thing and
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:55.480]  i look the same military industrial complex that will give you mit romney and patrice or
[03:11:55.480 --> 03:12:02.840]  newt genrich and mit romney or newt genrich and sarah palin or or governor perry rick perry and
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:09.080]  palin they're going to give you exactly what you've been getting and again that's why we may lose
[03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:14.760]  this country because you got idiot obama supporters you got idiot mainline republicans who just won't
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:19.880]  grow up and admit the world government is here they all thought that sarah palin had started
[03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:24.760]  the tea party movement well because the media keeps lying it was it was ron paul's supporters
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:30.200]  and that's on record no one believes me but anyways i did my part thanks alex god bless you i

[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:38.360]  the left and right uh there are just so many examples of this and it's a joke to these people
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:45.160]  let's play the next clip now let's face it we're polar opposites we couldn't be further apart i'm
[03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:51.400]  on the left and i'm usually right and we strongly disagree except on one issue tell them what it
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:57.560]  is reverend pat that would be our planet taking care of it is extremely important we all need to
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:04.360]  work together liberals and conservatives so get involved it's the right thing to do now there you
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:11.640]  go again join us together we can solve the climate crisis go to we can solve it dot org i mean you've
[03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:16.280]  got the nfl you've had the republican leadership you've had the democratic leadership you've had
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:23.800]  the fortune 500 all lined up the car makers everybody exxon mobile uh the big oil companies
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:31.880]  founded the carbon tax and they've got a new bill introduced this is out of alternat today
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:39.720]  us senate climate bill to be unveiled april 26 they're back with another one with a gas tax
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:45.880]  a federal gas tax and they've got value added taxes and taxes on all the factories and businesses
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:51.800]  and if you read the last bill that passed the house and is in the senate home inspections i mean
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:58.280]  you can't even imagine this is global corporations with selective enforcement to shut down their
[03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:04.520]  competition and put taxes on everything you do and they're back and they're saying the republicans
[03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:10.280]  and linsey graham are gonna pass it remember bush was for amnesty and i get emails saying he was
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:14.840]  not for amnesty i get emails saying he wasn't for the assault weapons ban yes he was stop it
[03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:20.040]  but see democrats don't like republicans so if republicans attack democrats
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:24.200]  democrats will support what the democrats are doing no matter how bad it is and if democrats
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:32.200]  attack republicans then republicans will support them it's it's all moronic level mind control
[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:39.400]  let's go ahead and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to george in connecticut george
[03:16:39.400 --> 03:16:45.320]  you're on the year alex i want to just keep one thing in mind i had something i was going to add
[03:16:45.320 --> 03:16:50.600]  to this this just came up as you were talking they have to win on every front to really make this
[03:16:50.600 --> 03:16:54.920]  work and that means not just in our country in the world and that's why they're going after the
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:16:59.320]  internet that's why they're going after fossil fuel that's why they're trying to go after farming
[03:16:59.320 --> 03:17:04.440]  they're shutting everything off to make us dependent go ahead the chinese are not going to go along
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:09.400]  with they'll play along i look i lived in asia long enough and i live in japan long enough
[03:17:09.400 --> 03:17:14.040]  they're playing us for suckers because they'll play along for this game and if they play this game
[03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:17.240]  and think they're gonna win they're gonna lose because they're gonna let let their let their own
[03:17:17.240 --> 03:17:23.080]  trap fall in on them they're gonna pick up the pieces i mean this is a this is a losers game
[03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:28.600]  for these idiots but the real issue is i'm thinking of why don't we make up pamphleteers like they
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:33.400]  won the revolution and stick it in call them truth pamphlets that with bulletins whether it's from
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:37.800]  you or from other sources that tell the people the truth and stick them in in the the the free
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:43.480]  newspapers and the regular newspapers so these and say the real and say the real tea party that's
[03:17:43.480 --> 03:17:48.040]  why obama created the coffee party because we had the idea to do it to try to confuse everybody
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:53.160]  is it's just amazing yes all of us have to get aggressive there's more of us than there are
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:57.880]  republicans and democrats and most people call themselves libertarians or independents we
[03:17:57.880 --> 03:18:03.720]  have to just never shut up and engage them on every front and i think i think i don't know
[03:18:03.720 --> 03:18:08.280]  how much you're you're getting overseas in other languages but if there are people out there that
[03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:13.000]  that really are into this and can speak other language can write another line get this out to
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:18.200]  all the parties and and then uh... absolutely my films and and and clips of the tv show and
[03:18:18.200 --> 03:18:26.360]  radio show are being translated into portuguese spanish chinese german russian polish japanese
[03:18:26.360 --> 03:18:31.480]  there's all sorts of translations out there and we need more we need more people to do that
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:37.160]  great and new york times had an article i think you may be wanted to look at quickly it's just in
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:43.000]  today's times on the eight sixteen uh... that bastard clinton basically is trying to tear down
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:47.800]  all the internet and saying that it's encouraging violence against the government and things like
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:52.840]  that oh yeah no no no they're there they're in every day i see masses of articles where they're
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:56.680]  saying they're going to shut the web down as we know it and have a controlled internet with a
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:02.040]  few thousand channels it's all being announced that we're all in the echo chamber trying to and
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:06.040]  with basically what he's trying to say we're like we're in at some sort of paid it padded cell and that
[03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:10.920]  that uh... we're we're we're creating our own violent tendencies that they don't seem to get it
[03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:15.320]  if we're the ones who they know people are upset about losing their standard of living
[03:19:15.320 --> 03:19:20.360]  and their basic freedoms and so they're going you people are crazy you don't love your government
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:26.120]  we're going to shut down your ways to communicate you understand us but we have to understand how
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:30.760]  late it is we're kicking their butt we're starting to turn the tide and so they're going to turn

[03:24:19.800 --> 03:24:24.200]  and uh this is a very important case of richard fine here's the headline the u.s supreme court
[03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:29.640]  will consider the case of a 70 year old taxpayer advocate richard fine who has languished in jail
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:35.960]  for more than a year this is an amazing story he's a former federal antitrust lawyer phd
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:41.800]  and it is admitted that judges in l.a county are being paid money under the table
[03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:47.480]  similar to the case msnbc reports on two judges plead guilty in sending kids to lock up
[03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:53.080]  pair admit they got 2.6 million in payoffs to put away young people in a private facility
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:59.000]  so this is going on everywhere but no no jury no charges over a year in jail because he's been
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:04.680]  exposing the very judge that put him in jail now this is the essence of tyranny what we see in the
[03:25:04.680 --> 03:25:09.000]  declaration of independence what we were fighting against richard fine you've got the floor tell people
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:16.680]  what's happened to you okay well what has happened to me the very simply is that i exposed the scheme
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:25.160]  under which l.a county supervisors have paid over 300 million dollars your call may be monitored
[03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:34.040]  or recorded in the last 23 years to the l.a county superior court judges now the interesting thing
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:42.440]  about this is that the superior court judges are state erected judges they have absolutely no
[03:25:42.440 --> 03:25:50.120]  relationship to l.a county these judges are erected in state elections they're state officials
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:57.800]  and they're state employees and what happened approximately 23 years ago in the rate 19 days
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:08.360]  the l.a county supervisors decided that they were going to pay sitting judges money to attract and
[03:26:08.360 --> 03:26:17.560]  retain qualified judges to sit in l.a county now this is totally ridiculous because of the fact
[03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:25.240]  that you can't attract a sitting judge to to become a judge and you can't retain a sitting judge
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:30.280]  to become a judge because the judges are erected so you can't give them money to attract them to
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:36.040]  have a job that they already have and courts courts to retain a job or a job for which they're
[03:26:36.040 --> 03:26:42.200]  erected and and and precedent shows this is basically illegal but they're doing it in plain
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:47.400]  view right out in the open and you have a conflict of interest now where in all these years the
[03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:52.920]  county's only lost three lawsuits because they pay the judges that's right now interestingly enough
[03:26:52.920 --> 03:26:58.840]  alex it wasn't out in the open what the way that they did it is they did it through the budget
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:06.600]  process and in the budget there was a an item called trial court funding and they just put it
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:12.840]  into trial court funding and there really was no way that the public really saw that this was
[03:27:12.840 --> 03:27:18.760]  money going to the judges the only way you could find it is that you could find maybe a footnote
[03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:23.720]  that would say it's just part of trial court funding that the money was okay so but i mean now
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:28.440]  it's out in the open uh but but the media you know he isn't giving it a lot of attention now
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:34.680]  300 million dollars uh i mean how much are these judges getting a piece a year each time the judges
[03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:40.040]  who are getting you're nineteen two thousand or seven or two thousand and eight they were getting
[03:27:40.040 --> 03:27:50.760]  46366 dollars per judge per year and there are 430 judges in LA county on top of the other on top
[03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:58.200]  of their state paycheck yeah their state paycheck was 178 thousand dollars a year plus 30 thousand
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:04.760]  dollars in benefits so the judges are basically taking home about 250 thousand dollars a year
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:11.640]  that is more than the chief justice of the united states supreme court who only takes home 218 thousand
[03:28:11.640 --> 03:28:20.360]  dollars a year now this is across the board by the way throughout california 55 out of the 58 counties
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:27.160]  in california is paying extra money to the u.s. home maybe monitored or recorded not all of them
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:31.800]  are paying as much money as LA county however some of them are only paying the two thousand dollars
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:39.560]  and back in our latest report that came out this year i think it's 33 million dollars
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:46.040]  is being paid to judges throughout california 23 million of it is being paid in LA county
[03:28:47.080 --> 03:28:52.280]  unbelievable and so you start exposing this you start challenging cases where there's a
[03:28:52.280 --> 03:28:57.480]  major conflict of interest and they throw you in jail and they're not charging you and you've
[03:28:57.480 --> 03:29:02.520]  been there for a year i mean is are they saying you'll you'll be there forever well they want to
[03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:10.760]  keep they want to keep me here until i tell them what my assets are so that they can grab my assets
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:17.720]  based upon a ruling that this judge he happy made that i should pay money to LA county because what
[03:29:17.720 --> 03:29:22.600]  happened in this particular case is and this is also very interesting because this shows you
[03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:29.320]  how deep the corruption is what happened in this case in the case is called arena strand colony
[03:29:29.320 --> 03:29:33.640]  two or more measured measured we got a break that we got a break for the network of satellites
[03:29:33.640 --> 03:29:39.800]  we're back in three minutes stay there we hope they don't cut you off um and i've seen cases on
[03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:45.240]  cnn where the judges come out in texas and admit they're getting the money from people's cars they
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:50.520]  take and wallets they take with no drugs or anything it's just lawlessness it's going on everywhere
[03:29:50.520 --> 03:29:58.360]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.320 --> 03:30:06.760]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road

[03:33:09.960 --> 03:33:19.000]  uh formerly with uh the justice department antitrust uh have a lot of other great people
[03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:25.320]  that are working with him um Emmy award-winning researcher uh Leslie Dutton filmmaker
[03:33:27.080 --> 03:33:32.360]  the the details are online at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and some of the other
[03:33:32.360 --> 03:33:37.240]  great sites uh that are out there of the disclosure a full disclosure.net as well full
[03:33:37.240 --> 03:33:44.200]  disclosure.net but the supreme court out of 10 000 cases a year has decided to start hearing this case
[03:33:44.200 --> 03:33:52.120]  at the preliminary level next um friday and so there's no courts in between really here it's
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:56.760]  just going right to the supreme court which is amazing so Richard go ahead what happened
[03:33:56.760 --> 03:34:02.760]  Alex what happened Alex is that we went through we went through all the courts we went through the um
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:10.120]  from these from the California Superior Court you know we went through the California Court
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:15.480]  of Appeals the California Supreme Court you know I didn't I didn't know that I guess there's several
[03:34:15.480 --> 03:34:21.480]  cases several cases involved then but I mean to be clear give us the name of the case the name of
[03:34:21.480 --> 03:34:26.920]  the case the the name of the case that you're called not monitored or recorded the name of the
[03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:33.880]  case that the supreme court is going to be hearing is Richard I find versus the sheriff of Los Angeles
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:41.240]  County and that's the case that I'm that I'm being held on the under the underlying case is
[03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:47.960]  the case of Marina Strand Colony two homeowners association versus the county of Los Angeles
[03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:53.960]  and that's the case that we started talking about right before the break you know the interesting
[03:34:53.960 --> 03:34:59.800]  thing about that case is that shows even more corruption because what happened in that case
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:07.000]  is you had a developer and the developer's uh company name was Delray Shores Joint Venture
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:13.320]  and Delray Shores Joint Venture North but it was owned by but the managing partner is a guy by the
[03:35:13.320 --> 03:35:23.000]  name of Jerry B. Epstein Epstein and his perp chief of staff Robert David or Levine it is they
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:33.720]  gave money to campaign contributions down familiar to the two supervisors Michael and Michael Antonovich
[03:35:33.720 --> 03:35:41.480]  and Don Kenobi and they gave this money to Kenobi and and Antonovich in April of 2007
[03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:47.240]  I'll remember that date because here's how the story comes down the line these people wanted to
[03:35:47.240 --> 03:35:53.480]  re-deserve the department complex in Marina Del Ray California and they wanted to expand it to
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:36:01.320]  250 some units 500 and some users in order to do that they needed an environmental impact report
[03:36:02.120 --> 03:36:06.680]  and as part of the environmental impact report they show how it's going to affect the environment
[03:36:06.680 --> 03:36:12.200]  and one of the other things you have to show that it'll have a positive financial impact
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:20.440]  in LA County now the interesting thing here is that Marina Del Ray is the largest small craft
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:27.080]  yacht harbor in the United States it started out with six thousand six thousand boats now down to
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:35.080]  about four thousand the county owns the land and what the county does is the county leases out the
[03:36:35.080 --> 03:36:41.560]  land these developers who put apartment complexes on the land and then they end up paying the county
[03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:47.240]  for the use of the ramp I've done a back rest right here to show you how bad this is these
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:55.960]  developers are making they're taking in about 350 million dollars a year in rent from these
[03:36:55.960 --> 03:37:02.760]  apartments they pay the county approximately 35 billion dollars a year for the ramp they
[03:37:02.760 --> 03:37:07.800]  should be paying the county approximately a hundred million dollars a year for the ramp
[03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:13.960]  so the people the taxpayers in LA County are losing 70 million dollars a year in land rent
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:19.880]  from the developers in the last 10 years while the taxpayers in Los Angeles County have lost
[03:37:19.880 --> 03:37:26.920]  approximately a billion dollars in rent oh you're gonna be monitored or recorded how does this come
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:33.720]  about it comes about because of the fact that the developers give campaign contributions to the
[03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:40.120]  supervisors the supervisors end up with sweetheart contracts the developers the developers pay this
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:47.240]  real amount of rent and that's what happens here that's let's be clear let's be clear because I
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:51.880]  notice that all the time in awesome where I live I've got to pay all these property taxes business
[03:37:51.880 --> 03:37:57.080]  taxes but big corporations come in they make political contributions and the city says we
[03:37:57.080 --> 03:38:02.760]  waive your property tax for 10 years we waive your environmental fees we waive everything
[03:38:02.760 --> 03:38:08.280]  because they've made political contributions but separately to me here the big case regardless
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:12.760]  is that I've I'm no lawyer but I know the Supreme Court is held over and over again
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:19.480]  the police can't hold you for more than five days uh without you know basically charging you so
[03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:25.000]  they're violating habeas corpus here are they not that's right that's the case that's up before
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:29.960]  the supreme court but let me get through the back bar to show you how we get to that case
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:38.840]  so what happened is that these supervisors voted on the eir but the law in california
[03:38:38.840 --> 03:38:45.880]  case called break zone billiards versus the city's court says that if a supervisor gets paid
[03:38:45.880 --> 03:38:51.400]  greater than five hundred dollars in a campaign classification within 12 months of a vote you
[03:38:51.400 --> 03:38:57.720]  can either advocate for these developers nor can he vote on the particular price he must recuse
[03:38:57.720 --> 03:39:07.160]  he must recuse exactly well canabe and antonovitch both advocated and voted on the project now there
[03:39:07.160 --> 03:39:13.960]  were four votes so two of them were illegal which meant that the eir the vote on the eir was illegal
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:23.080]  i came in and i sued to stop that eir in the court and became in front of judge yafi now what
[03:39:23.080 --> 03:39:29.320]  happened is that judge yafi is getting this 46 000 dollars from the county they're the price
[03:39:30.040 --> 03:39:33.720]  so you know what happens just yeah it turns out that judge yafi
[03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:40.600]  allows the thing to go through now during the course of this case we have another thing that
[03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:46.760]  happened we have the state bar making me inactive and the side part of that is that the judges
[03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:53.080]  had gone to the state bar to try and get me disbarred and be inactive because i had brought the same
[03:39:53.080 --> 03:39:59.720]  type of case against the judges back in 2002 saying that these payments violated the california
[03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:06.440]  constitution and the due process clause for the u.s constitution so the judges went to the state
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:12.920]  bar and did you win that that previous case did you win that previous case so i it was dismissed
[03:40:12.920 --> 03:40:21.080]  on jurisdictional grounds in the federal court however in 2008 the california part of appeals
[03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:26.520]  held that these payments were illegal and you're told me you're monitored start over start over
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:31.240]  because again our friend is a political prisoner uh in jail richard fine right now so they keep
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:36.600]  popping in with the call maybe monitored uh now now now now go back so you had the california
[03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:42.120]  court of appeals rule in favor of you court of appeals because you were citing because you
[03:40:42.120 --> 03:40:50.120]  were citing another ruling please continue the california court of appeals held in 2008 in a
[03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:55.960]  case called sturgeon versus the county of los angeles that the payments by l.a. power to the
[03:40:55.960 --> 03:41:02.840]  judges violated article six section 19 of the california constitution and that was the exact
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:11.080]  thing that i claimed in my 2002 case so what the state bar was doing to me was violating
[03:41:11.080 --> 03:41:15.880]  what the california court of appeals was holding to be true let me stop you again i mean that's
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:21.080]  that's cities are chartered under the state constitution through the counties the power
[03:41:21.080 --> 03:41:26.360]  comes from the state and the elected legislature this is asked backwards as they say where the
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:32.920]  where l.a. county is trying to absorb and take the judges literally under its control but sacramento
[03:41:32.920 --> 03:41:37.640]  is not concerned about that the court of appeals was and ruled for you because then didn't they
[03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:44.520]  quietly pass a law if i read this right giving immunity to these judges absolutely right what
[03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:51.640]  happened is that after the sturgeon decision came down what the state did is that the state
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:59.800]  legislature passed a law saying that they gave retroactive immunity to the supervisors and the
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:09.640]  judges from criminal prosecution civil liability and ministry and disciplinary action so they
[03:42:09.640 --> 03:42:13.880]  because they know what they that these people had done wrong and the criminal part of it was
[03:42:13.880 --> 03:42:18.440]  misappropriation of funds okay we're running out of time so finish up with what happened to you
[03:42:19.080 --> 03:42:24.040]  we're running out of time mr fine finish up with what happened to you and then now your year plus
[03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:28.600]  incarceration and and they won't even tell the media why you're there they just say that's where he
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:39.880]  stays down so what happened is that i i left the case in 2007 in 2008 judge yafi ordered me to pay
[03:42:40.520 --> 03:42:46.840]  money to the county and without any notice to me i was gone from the state in october 2007
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:54.200]  in january 2008 judge yafi orders me to pay money to the county because i filed a paper one day late
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:43:01.640]  the county had filed their papers 60 days late because nothing to the county and he orders me
[03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:07.560]  to pay money to the county without any notice to me without any precedent to hearing and
[03:43:08.120 --> 03:43:13.080]  but i came in and i said judge you can't do that because number one you're violating the constitution
[03:43:13.080 --> 03:43:21.960]  but number two you're the um you're you're getting payments from the county and now yafi
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:28.120]  had not disclosed that this point your phone may be monitored or recorded yafi had not disclosed
[03:43:28.120 --> 03:43:33.000]  that he was getting payments from the county and the county had not disclosed that they knew that
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:39.560]  the eir was illegal and nor had etstein disclosed that he knew that it was illegal i then got yafi
[03:43:39.560 --> 03:43:46.200]  to admit on the record at a court hearing that he was getting these payments and then i disqualified
[03:43:46.200 --> 03:43:54.360]  yafi and yafi refused to leave the case and then yafi ordered me to uh to make the payment to
[03:43:54.360 --> 03:44:03.240]  disclose my assets so to have that order enforced and i refused to do that then yafi had a contempt
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:09.720]  hearing at which point then we in the contempt hearing i got yafi to testify as the first witness
[03:44:10.280 --> 03:44:15.560]  i got him to testify that he was receiving the payments that he was not disclosing the payments
[03:44:15.560 --> 03:44:20.920]  i mean he should instantly hold on he should instantly recuse himself federal state law
[03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:28.040]  i mean all of the president says he must recuse himself he's a witness in the courtroom when he's
[03:44:28.040 --> 03:44:34.200]  the judge i mean this is insanity is that truly it's not a fully insanity it violates every
[03:44:34.200 --> 03:44:40.280]  supreme court president and you have a supreme court president of inray merchantson that says
[03:44:40.280 --> 03:44:47.000]  that judge can't judge his own action you have a the president of often versus the united states
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:52.280]  that says that a judge can't take a bribe and reviving well that's like the secretary of
[03:44:52.280 --> 03:44:57.880]  state in kentucky with the state ethics board ruling he can run his own election against
[03:44:57.880 --> 03:45:03.480]  ran paul for senate in kentucky never before done and so he runs his own election
[03:45:03.480 --> 03:45:13.560]  i mean it is total insanity i mean this judge is ending up taking a bribe and then he's judging
[03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:19.880]  his own actions of taking a bribe because every u.s. supreme court president is against that so
[03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:27.160]  anyway so the end result of it is that yafi holds me in contempt for not answering saying that i have
[03:45:27.160 --> 03:45:37.080]  to open the chapter chose me in jail under coercive confinement saying that i have to stay in jail
[03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:46.200]  until i tell what my assets are so that they can enforce this false judgment against me to do
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:53.480]  everything so now via a civil judgment uh no jury no nothing you're in jail more than a year this
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:45:57.960]  is a dangerous precedent if it's allowed to stand and we know the supreme court earlier in the year
[03:45:57.960 --> 03:46:02.360]  you've had some of the other justices refuse it but now ginsburg is accepting it
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:07.240]  i saw you got blocked i just said the supreme court earlier in the year
[03:46:07.960 --> 03:46:11.160]  well i mean i've i mean i've read over the case but makes i mean tell me if i'm right
[03:46:11.160 --> 03:46:18.200]  uh wasn't it just as stevens or uh which one is it they're early just as kennedy earlier in the
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:23.800]  year denied my application and then i went to justice ginsburg and justice ginsburg was the one
[03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:29.480]  you were calling maybe monitored or recorded uh so there tell us what's gonna go into the
[03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:33.480]  conference sure sure so we're running out of time so tell us mr fang the show's almost over here
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:39.720]  and we appreciate you joining us from prison from your political dungeon uh so so what's happened in
[03:46:39.720 --> 03:46:45.720]  jail i mean if the supreme court says no i guess you'll live out the rest of the 10 15 20 years
[03:46:45.720 --> 03:46:51.080]  there and the taxpayers will pay for it and a new president said judges can say put alex in jail
[03:46:51.080 --> 03:46:57.480]  just put put bob in jail put put carol in jail just just just put put the pope in jail put anybody
[03:46:57.480 --> 03:47:04.360]  in jail just did dungeons just goodbye i mean do we do whatever we want that could be the case so
[03:47:04.360 --> 03:47:11.080]  it's really up to the supreme court uh to follow their confidence and uh and basically set me free
[03:47:11.080 --> 03:47:15.880]  that's what we're sitting at now one of the things i do want to mention before we close out is that
[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:23.800]  there's going to be a rally for me on uh tuesday the 20th of april at the l.a county courthouse
[03:47:24.360 --> 03:47:30.840]  which is at running london north coast street in rafandos and it's going to start at 7 30 in
[03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:37.560]  the morning when the judges come in to park their cars and it's going to be continually until 12 30
[03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:42.360]  and you're going to and don't be speeches and things about 11 o'clock in the morning and there's
[03:47:42.360 --> 03:47:48.040]  also one coming up at the supreme court and we we went over that two hours ago when we had uh
[03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:53.800]  leslie dotton on and people can find out all the details at full disclosure dot net but sir in the
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:48:00.360]  video interview i've seen uh i mean go back over this is why we went to war against the british
[03:48:00.360 --> 03:48:08.360]  in 1775 76 it's in the declaration of independence as the list of abuses the exact same stuff that's
[03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:13.640]  being done to you talk about how i mean as a lawyer as a former you know federal investigator
[03:48:13.640 --> 03:48:16.440]  what this is like for people that don't understand the law
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:27.400]  well you talked about the parallels between this and the declaration of independence and
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:36.840]  how big a deal this is because when you go to the last part of the declaration of independence
[03:48:36.840 --> 03:48:44.280]  and you read that last part that talks about the fact that the king controlled our judges in the
[03:48:44.280 --> 03:48:52.440]  court and therefore there was absolutely no way that anyone in the colonies had any opportunity
[03:48:52.440 --> 03:48:58.360]  to get any fairness in the judicial system in england and that was one of the reasons
[03:48:58.360 --> 03:49:05.000]  why we went to war that that is why we had a revolution and this right now is our new
[03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:11.400]  revolution except for we don't have to use guns at this point in time we are using the
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:18.440]  democratic process and by using the democratic process we are coming through and we are going
[03:49:18.440 --> 03:49:24.840]  to go in and as i'm doing i am using the court system because i have a big you're calling maybe
[03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:31.000]  monitored or recorded i have a basic belief that the united states supreme court is going to
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:36.520]  reform out of the precedent the new precedent that a judge can judge his own action go out of
[03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:43.800]  the way back to the 16th century started out in common law so this is so so what are you expecting
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:50.840]  to do with baka the the share of these judges if the supreme court tells them to let you out of jail
[03:49:50.840 --> 03:49:54.840]  are they going to go in there and claim that you've committed suicide or something you're not planning
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:50:02.360]  to commit suicide are you no i don't think so i think i've survived actually i survived 10 years
[03:50:02.360 --> 03:50:08.040]  of this abuse these judges started this whole thing out way back in 1999 trying to economically
[03:50:08.040 --> 03:50:13.800]  break me but as a friend of mine said if they had the ability to shoot me they probably would have but
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:18.840]  they don't roughly they don't think in those terms the uh they probably think in those terms
[03:50:18.840 --> 03:50:25.400]  they probably don't have the guts to execute it the uh thank god for me the but basically what
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:32.200]  my plan is a very simple thing i call it the three aids it's awareness attachment and action and
[03:50:32.200 --> 03:50:38.920]  it means it's doing people like yourself people become aware of what is happening and then they
[03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:44.680]  attach to what is happening by picking up with that awareness and the third thing becomes action
[03:50:44.680 --> 03:50:51.480]  and as i said in my video you vote for bums out because what takes place is that we are the ones
[03:50:51.480 --> 03:50:58.200]  that actually have the ability to do things ritchard fine ritchard fine we gotta break final
