[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  I tried to make your clusters of information as they moved through the computer, but it
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.000]  didn't look like it.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  Ready?
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Change.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  Motorcycles.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.000]  Where the circuits lock free lives.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  I kept dreaming of you.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  I thought I'd never see you.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  And then, one day, one day, I got it.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  I got it.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  I got it.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  I got it.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  I got it.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  I got it.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  I got it.
[00:43.000 --> 00:44.000]  I got it.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  I got it.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  I got it.
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  I got it.
[00:47.000 --> 01:01.000]  It's Friday, December 31, 2021.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  And already, on the other side of the planet, we are in the year, 2022.
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.100]  Well, Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the most articulate heart surgeons, and also he's
[01:12.100 --> 01:19.680]  run FDA trial operations, is going to be joining us in studio, coming up later in the hour,
[01:19.680 --> 01:25.000]  for at least two hours, to do a PowerPoint presentation I've got right in front of me
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.320]  that is two large stacks of studies and documentation.
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.320]  You want the truth.
[01:30.320 --> 01:31.320]  You want the facts.
[01:31.320 --> 01:33.760]  You want reality, and not disinformation.
[01:33.760 --> 01:37.240]  You want to get down to brass tacks.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.440]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40.440 --> 01:43.440]  And it's coming up today with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:43.440 --> 01:50.360]  Also, we interviewed Dr. Robert Malone today, here in studio, Christy Lee did, but we're
[01:50.360 --> 01:54.400]  not going to release it until Joe Rogan releases his big interview.
[01:54.400 --> 02:01.000]  They went for like four hours, I'm told, yesterday, here in South Austin, with the literal synergy
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.320]  going on here is amazing.
[02:03.320 --> 02:08.160]  And got Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, everybody else is moving right here.
[02:08.160 --> 02:09.160]  It's crazy.
[02:09.160 --> 02:11.320]  But that's how things attract.
[02:11.320 --> 02:13.760]  And so he may put it out today, he may put it out on Monday.
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.040]  I think they're going to decide the next hour or so.
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.400]  So we'll put it out this afternoon if Joe releases it today.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.960]  If not, we're going to release an hour and a half commercial-free, over-the-top, powerful
[02:24.960 --> 02:30.040]  Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology banned on Twitter yesterday for his free speech
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.200]  activities.
[02:31.200 --> 02:38.440]  He is going to, again, be part of that huge Joe Rogan interview that's already taped,
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.760]  and the huge Christy Lee interview that will come out after Joe's does.
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.840]  I mean, Joe doesn't really care, but I'm not going to try to scoop him or cock block him
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.760]  and do that.
[02:48.760 --> 02:54.000]  So as soon as his comes out, ours will come out as well.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.920]  It's crazy to have the inventor of this major technology that could literally cure cancer
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.040]  in things that's done right here saying this is a total fraud the way it's deployed.
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.320]  It's killing people en masse.
[03:03.320 --> 03:04.320]  This is depopulation.
[03:04.320 --> 03:11.920]  This is the crime of human history going on, and he's right here in our studios, and it's
[03:11.920 --> 03:14.480]  actually happening.
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.200]  That said, yesterday, I told you that I was unable to sleep the night before, had about
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.200]  two hours sleep, and I was just very emotional yesterday and talked about quitting and not
[03:25.200 --> 03:34.040]  doing the show, and I'm not seriously contemplating quitting, but also wasn't being dramatic.
[03:34.040 --> 03:38.360]  It doesn't feel right to just come on air and talk about all this carnage and horrible
[03:38.360 --> 03:41.760]  stuff like you're calling a football game or a baseball game.
[03:41.760 --> 03:47.200]  This is really emotional for me, and I've had some things privately happen in the last
[03:47.200 --> 03:54.680]  year that nobody knows about that have just been devastating, absolutely devastating,
[03:54.680 --> 03:56.840]  and I've come to the decision.
[03:56.840 --> 04:00.600]  I almost did it yesterday, but I've come to the decision that I'm going to share it
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.600]  on air.
[04:01.600 --> 04:04.480]  I don't know if it's going to be this year or next year, but it'll be in the next week.
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.560]  I don't know if it's going to be the last day of 2021 or whether it's going to be next
[04:09.560 --> 04:12.840]  week, but I think people need to know about this.
[04:12.840 --> 04:15.320]  Well, there's a lot of stuff you need to know about.
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.000]  I mean, if you want to know how criminal the government and the Democratic Party is, wait
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.880]  till you hear this, because there's two big things, two big things that are just, I don't
[04:26.880 --> 04:29.160]  feel like a victim when this is happening and going on.
[04:29.160 --> 04:30.640]  I just can't believe it.
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.840]  I mean, these people can do whatever they want.
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.560]  You understand that, including literally kidnapped your children.
[04:37.560 --> 04:39.200]  So I got a good sleep last night.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  I went to bed about 10.
[04:40.200 --> 04:41.200]  I slept till seven.
[04:41.200 --> 04:50.240]  I never do that, and I am recharged and ready for war, but let me tell you, man, we are
[04:50.240 --> 05:00.920]  toe-to-toe with the N.W.O., but we're right back at infowars.com tomorrow, isn't it today?
[05:00.920 --> 05:03.120]  Christmas 2021 is gone.

[06:18.760 --> 06:25.160]  of the Alex Jones show, but one hell of a transmission because of the content we are
[06:25.160 --> 06:32.120]  live Friday, December 31, 2021, Dr. Peter McCullough is going to be in the studio with
[06:32.120 --> 06:33.880]  us for at least two hours.
[06:33.880 --> 06:37.480]  He is ready and about to bust out of the gate.
[06:37.480 --> 06:42.760]  He's going to do a big PowerPoint presentation for you on the science and the facts and just
[06:42.760 --> 06:47.680]  how dangerous this vaccine is and how it's literally causing unbelievable amounts of
[06:47.680 --> 06:49.480]  deaths and illnesses.
[06:49.480 --> 06:57.400]  This is just absolutely game-changing information that is coming up at the bottom of the hour
[06:57.400 --> 07:07.400]  in just about 20-something minutes, and we've got incredible mainline science coming out
[07:07.400 --> 07:15.040]  and top researchers, top pathologists confirming the mass death that's taking place and so
[07:15.040 --> 07:16.040]  much more.
[07:16.040 --> 07:22.440]  And then we've got the public in total hysteria and fear, this is a real photo on a U.S. flight
[07:22.440 --> 07:29.280]  of a woman with a spacesuit bubble over her head that she's retrofitted with a seal with
[07:29.280 --> 07:34.960]  a mask inside of it, of course, really hurting themselves with carbon dioxide poisoning,
[07:34.960 --> 07:40.960]  but this is the level of mind control and what they've done to our people.
[07:40.960 --> 07:45.280]  But first, here is the most important report ever at Band-Aught Video, irrefutable evidence
[07:45.280 --> 07:54.080]  that COVID-19 vaccines are killing people.
[07:54.080 --> 08:00.600]  Internationally recognized leading pathologist Dr. Arne Burkhart, a renowned expert in the
[08:00.600 --> 08:08.120]  fields of microbiology and infectious diseases, Dr. Sukherit Bhakti, recently published irrefutable
[08:08.120 --> 08:14.720]  evidence that the mRNA shots are killing at least 40% of recipients.
[08:14.720 --> 08:20.880]  And they explain why the experimental agents cannot protect against a viral infection,
[08:20.880 --> 08:26.480]  which we already know to be true by the overwhelming evidence and admissions that the more waxed
[08:26.480 --> 08:30.440]  up a person is, the more likely they are to get COVID.
[08:30.440 --> 08:36.880]  Doctors Burkhart and Bhakti explain that this is due to the fact that the so-called vaccines
[08:36.880 --> 08:43.120]  sway the body into producing antibodies in the blood, but not within the mucus membranes
[08:43.120 --> 08:46.360]  that normally protect our respiratory tract.
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.280]  This is why the vaccinated are suffering what they call breakthrough infections.
[08:51.280 --> 08:57.000]  The COVID vaccines are turning off lymphocyte production where they need it the most, while
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.160]  amping it up in the bloodstream, which is where it gets much worse.
[09:02.160 --> 09:08.860]  For those without the vaccine, a natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 will in most cases remain
[09:08.860 --> 09:11.960]  localized to the respiratory tract.
[09:11.960 --> 09:18.120]  And for those who have been vaccinated, unrelated cells deep inside the body react to the respiratory
[09:18.120 --> 09:24.160]  infection by creating a new spike protein, which then causes the cell that created it
[09:24.160 --> 09:27.280]  to be attacked by the immune system.
[09:27.280 --> 09:33.640]  Experts warned us of this last year, and now it is clearly seen in the evidence.
[09:33.640 --> 09:39.600]  Doctors Burkhart and Bhakti found this autoimmune disease present in most organs, but mostly
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.040]  in the heart, which helps explain why we are seeing so many cases of myocarditis and cardiac
[09:46.040 --> 09:47.440]  arrest.
[09:47.440 --> 09:50.960]  The vaccines trigger self-destruction.
[09:50.960 --> 09:57.600]  Analysis has now been performed on the organs of over 70 people who died after vaccination
[09:57.600 --> 10:02.640]  and who died for reasons officially unrelated to the vaccines.
[10:02.640 --> 10:07.720]  In most cases, rhythmogenic heart failure was postulated as the cause of death.
[10:07.720 --> 10:10.960]  A mystery which has now been solved.
[10:10.960 --> 10:17.360]  What they found was inflammatory events in small blood vessels characterized by an overabundance
[10:17.360 --> 10:23.520]  of T lymphocytes and dead cells, usually accompanied by tissue destruction.
[10:23.520 --> 10:27.520]  In other words, immunological self-attack.
[10:27.520 --> 10:35.360]  The evidence clearly shows that both mRNA and vector-based vaccines from all four manufacturers
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.760]  are inducing autoimmune disease in multiple organs.
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.800]  Mostly the heart, followed by the lung, liver, thyroid, and brain.
[10:44.800 --> 10:52.960]  These data are so damning that you don't have to start looking for other data to know that
[10:52.960 --> 11:00.360]  these vaccines are killing the young and the old, so the children are set up against the
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.080]  wall and they shoot.
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.320]  These damn people are shooting and they're killing our children.
[11:08.320 --> 11:10.240]  I can't stand it.
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.120]  We have a four-year-old son and we're going to flee this damn country because we are not
[11:16.120 --> 11:19.280]  going to let himself be shot.
[11:19.280 --> 11:38.800]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[11:38.800 --> 11:41.000]  This is for new listeners tuning in.
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.440]  They're going to collapse the world.
[11:42.440 --> 11:44.760]  They're going to star billions of people to death.
[11:44.760 --> 11:46.240]  They're going to bring in a new dark age.
[11:46.240 --> 11:47.240]  Here's their plan.
[11:47.240 --> 11:48.240]  Here's their admissions.
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.240]  They're all by design.
[11:49.240 --> 11:51.200]  We're all in great danger.
[11:51.200 --> 11:53.560]  They're not just blocking therapeutics for normal viruses.
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.960]  They're not just giving people treatment for pneumonia and the flu and letting them die
[11:56.960 --> 11:58.160]  and calling it COVID.
[11:58.160 --> 11:59.320]  They're bringing in eugenics.
[11:59.320 --> 12:01.040]  They're bringing in bioethics.
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.480]  They are bringing in the end of civilization and then they're going to pose as the saviors
[12:05.480 --> 12:07.040]  while it all collapses.
[12:07.040 --> 12:13.520]  We do not know how well those indigent tests perform at day five in detecting transmissibility.
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.520]  It is for that reason that we would say even if you had a negative test, we would want
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.280]  you to mask and even if you had a positive test, we would also want you to mask.
[12:23.280 --> 12:29.320]  If your plans ought to go to a 40 to 50 person New Year's Eve party with all the bells and
[12:29.320 --> 12:34.560]  whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I
[12:34.560 --> 12:38.400]  would strongly recommend that this year we do not do that.
[12:38.400 --> 12:45.600]  Dr. Robert W. Malone has been banned by Twitter, the inventor of mRNA technology, got more
[12:45.600 --> 12:46.600]  and more hardcore.
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.920]  He came out last week with an emergency message to parents saying this is not a vaccine.
[12:50.920 --> 12:53.600]  It is linked to major heart problems and death.
[12:53.600 --> 12:56.280]  You should not give it to your children or you should release research.
[12:56.280 --> 13:02.200]  When you talk about war crimes, the people at Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, man,
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.200]  you people are evil.
[13:03.200 --> 13:08.800]  The US data is deeply contaminated, it is compromised at multiple levels.
[13:08.800 --> 13:14.240]  It's compromised by the CDC's official position is that there have been no vaccine related
[13:14.240 --> 13:15.240]  deaths.
[13:15.240 --> 13:19.680]  That is completely untenable.
[13:19.680 --> 13:22.440]  There are a large number of deaths in bears.
[13:22.440 --> 13:29.040]  They continue to accumulate in the post-vaccinated, not just in the US database, but in the British
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.600]  database, the Scottish database, the German database, the Icelandic database, the Norwegian
[13:34.600 --> 13:35.600]  database.
[13:35.600 --> 13:36.600]  It goes on and on and on.
[13:36.600 --> 13:37.600]  Israeli database.
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.040]  But the CDC still insists as an official policy position.
[13:42.040 --> 13:44.760]  There have been no vaccine related deaths.
[13:44.760 --> 13:48.040]  The CDC is willfully ignorant.
[13:48.040 --> 13:54.160]  The one thing they had in common is that they were vaccinated six months or earlier before
[13:54.160 --> 14:01.240]  they were given to these scientists to do a very thorough autopsy and they spent six
[14:01.240 --> 14:02.720]  months to do the autopsy.
[14:02.720 --> 14:11.200]  What they found was that in 14 out of the 15 cases, in other words, 93%, that the vaccine
[14:11.200 --> 14:18.160]  was actually causing the T cells to attack your own organs.
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.760]  In 14 out of the 15 cases, it attacked the heart.
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.200]  Depending on which organ they looked at, they would have fewer cases.
[14:27.200 --> 14:34.400]  But the organ that was most often attacked in all the cases where they saw damage was
[14:34.400 --> 14:35.400]  the heart.
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.800]  And of course, this is consistent with what we've seen in bears in terms of the elevated
[14:40.800 --> 14:46.360]  cardiac risk, sometimes up thousands of times elevated.
[14:46.360 --> 14:52.480]  Before they were given these bodies, the coroners determined that in all 15 cases that the vaccine
[14:52.480 --> 14:54.640]  was not implicated.
[14:54.640 --> 15:00.040]  And when they actually examined the bodies correctly using the right tests with the right
[15:00.040 --> 15:10.000]  experience and knowing what to look for, they found that in 93% of the cases, we have this,
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.800]  we can implicate that the vaccine was implicated in the death.
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.400]  The justification for the inoculations was to reduce illness and hospitalization.
[15:20.400 --> 15:26.040]  And here we see that the inoculation arm showed an increase in adverse events in almost every
[15:26.040 --> 15:27.040]  category.
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.600]  For example, if you look at related adverse events, which are adverse events that the
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.640]  investigators determined to be caused by the investigational product, there were over
[15:34.640 --> 15:39.520]  5,000 in the experimental arm and just over 1,000 in the placebo group.
[15:39.520 --> 15:43.120]  So that was a 300% increase for people who'd taken the inoculation.
[15:43.120 --> 15:44.440]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[15:44.440 --> 15:47.160]  I love you and you need to get ready.
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.760]  I mean, we are in the middle of the New World Order.
[15:49.760 --> 15:51.760]  We're in the middle of the Mark of the Beast takeover.
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.760]  We are in the middle of the foretold great nightmare.
[15:56.760 --> 15:59.680]  Stay with us.

[16:59.960 --> 17:03.520]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[17:03.520 --> 17:08.840]  Everything I promote is about standing up against a new world order by empowering humanity.
[17:08.840 --> 17:11.320]  Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.

[17:17.200 --> 17:24.320]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[17:24.320 --> 17:26.520]  and American jobs.
[17:26.520 --> 17:28.800]  It is the true digital economy.
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.000]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.600]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[17:39.600 --> 17:42.000]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.200]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, resetwars is the most important, and

[18:42.600 --> 18:46.360]  or take a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced, and I keep one in my car.
[18:46.360 --> 18:49.640]  I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[18:49.640 --> 18:50.640]  don't work.
[18:50.640 --> 18:51.640]  They work.
[18:51.640 --> 18:59.440]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[18:59.440 --> 19:03.880]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[19:03.880 --> 19:05.240]  I like going to concerts.
[19:05.240 --> 19:06.560]  I like going to play golf.
[19:06.560 --> 19:07.960]  I like going out to dinner.
[19:07.960 --> 19:10.000]  I like the metropolitan life.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.480]  I like everything that comes with this.
[19:12.480 --> 19:18.560]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[19:18.560 --> 19:23.160]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.400]  all crashing down.
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.080]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.800]  the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[19:31.800 --> 19:32.800]  land?
[19:32.800 --> 19:33.800]  That's the survival instinct.
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.560]  See the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no.
[19:38.560 --> 19:39.560]  Stay in the city.
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.760]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you
[19:42.760 --> 19:44.560]  need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[19:44.560 --> 19:50.080]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.080]  as well.
[19:51.080 --> 19:55.760]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so
[19:55.760 --> 20:02.160]  we have the best ones at infowarsstore.com.
[20:02.160 --> 20:13.600]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:13.600 --> 20:33.800]  Alex Jones, last broadcast of 2021, Dr. Peter McCullough live in studio and much, much more.
[20:33.800 --> 20:38.800]  This is a do or die broadcast.
[20:38.800 --> 20:46.160]  Irrefutable evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are killing people in mass.
[20:46.160 --> 20:51.720]  Alex Jones will also lay out why he's been forced to turn against Trump.
[20:51.720 --> 20:55.800]  Please share this link.
[20:55.800 --> 21:01.040]  All right.
[21:01.040 --> 21:03.440]  Let me talk about Trump because this is really important.
[21:03.440 --> 21:06.800]  I don't want to get this out of the way before Dr. Peter McCullough joins us next segment
[21:06.800 --> 21:13.120]  with the biggest news yet from the CDC and the FDA's own documents.
[21:13.120 --> 21:14.120]  Major studies.
[21:14.120 --> 21:20.920]  This is not debatable and this is some really important information, most important information
[21:20.920 --> 21:27.880]  we've ever covered concerning COVID-19 and the rollout of it and everything that's unfolding
[21:27.880 --> 21:28.880]  right now.
[21:28.880 --> 21:33.560]  So he's joining us coming up here in just like 12, 13 minutes from now, 14 minutes
[21:33.560 --> 21:35.200]  from now in studio.
[21:35.200 --> 21:39.880]  But let me just get this out of the way with Trump.
[21:39.880 --> 21:46.560]  I go with my research and my gut and my spirit and then I make decisions off of what my gut
[21:46.560 --> 21:48.560]  tells me.
[21:48.560 --> 21:52.280]  That doesn't mean I don't have thousands of points of data conservatively and don't
[21:52.280 --> 21:58.000]  have a lot of reasons, but then I finally just assess at a discernment level what I'm
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  going to do.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.960]  And if you look at Trump like scales, he was doing a lot of good things, standing up at
[22:03.960 --> 22:11.800]  China, declaring we're not globalists, trying to secure the border, shutting off the fentanyl,
[22:11.800 --> 22:16.080]  rebuilding American confidence, and the deep state was really coming after him in a big
[22:16.080 --> 22:19.440]  way and lying about him and lying about us and persecuting his supporters and then they
[22:19.440 --> 22:23.600]  stole an election from him and that made us really try to stand up to that because even
[22:23.600 --> 22:27.520]  if he's not perfect, which he's not, them stealing the election from us is a crime and
[22:27.520 --> 22:28.520]  is a big deal.
[22:28.520 --> 22:31.600]  But it's like getting a dog to play tug of war with you.
[22:31.600 --> 22:35.640]  You can take the dog toy, give it to the dog, pull it, the dog plays the game.
[22:35.640 --> 22:41.840]  I don't think Trump's in on playing the game, but those controlling him, those manipulating
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.760]  him certainly are.
[22:44.760 --> 22:50.040]  And so I tried to make excuses and understand why he was pushing warp speed and the experimental
[22:50.040 --> 22:55.760]  garbage 20 months ago, 18 months ago, but then I'm like, no, I'm totally against this
[22:55.760 --> 22:57.920]  and why is Trump doing this?
[22:57.920 --> 23:00.480]  And I hope he wakes up.
[23:00.480 --> 23:04.080]  And now that it's out in the open, that it's killing a bunch of people and then it doesn't
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.200]  work and it doesn't protect you.
[23:06.200 --> 23:09.840]  I mean, one thing about horrible side effects, but protect you from COVID, it actually, you're
[23:09.840 --> 23:16.000]  more than doubly and I've got new studies out today liable to have COVID or catch COVID.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.640]  Actually three times more likely with Omicron.
[23:19.640 --> 23:23.880]  If you've had the vaccine, they admit that that's even the New York Times.
[23:23.880 --> 23:26.280]  I mean, this is a fraudulent product.
[23:26.280 --> 23:30.960]  This is a scam.
[23:30.960 --> 23:37.480]  And so I've already been extremely critical for a year or more, but when he went on Candice
[23:37.480 --> 23:43.220]  Owens show from Mar-Lago and said, no, nobody's gotten sick from the vaccine and you're totally
[23:43.220 --> 23:47.320]  protected if you take it, that puts him in the Rachel Maddow category.
[23:47.320 --> 23:52.200]  I'm going to play a clip of Maddow coming in next segment ahead of Dr. Peter McCullough
[23:52.200 --> 23:53.200]  coming in.
[23:53.200 --> 23:54.200]  So look for that next segment.
[23:54.200 --> 23:59.840]  I mean, listen, I don't like Maddow, I know she's a lying criminal, paid off by Pfizer.
[23:59.840 --> 24:03.160]  Trump and again, about a year ago, I'm like, Trump, you better come out against the booster
[24:03.160 --> 24:04.160]  shots.
[24:04.160 --> 24:05.160]  You better come out against this.
[24:05.160 --> 24:06.160]  You better say something.
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.200]  And he's like, yeah, you shouldn't do boosters.
[24:08.200 --> 24:11.800]  That's a scam for Pfizer and Pfizer is kind of taking the government over, which we now
[24:11.800 --> 24:17.760]  know they signed a secret agreement Trump did.
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.880]  And so once I figured all that out, and then the media is saying, we're going to have an
[24:22.880 --> 24:25.960]  insurrection for Trump to reinstall him in 2024.
[24:25.960 --> 24:30.720]  And, you know, we're all secretly agents of Trump and getting orders from him.
[24:30.720 --> 24:34.600]  I know for a fact that he had bad people around him in the White House, but he had some good
[24:34.600 --> 24:38.240]  people like Stephen Miller, like Steve Bannon.
[24:38.240 --> 24:42.480]  You can say Steve might be a bad guy according to Roger Stone, but policies, great ideas.
[24:42.480 --> 24:43.480]  Really smart guy.
[24:43.480 --> 24:46.200]  I'm not going to debate it in the middle of the two.
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.320]  But I mean, Steve Bannon is extremely smart.
[24:48.320 --> 24:49.320]  Nobody's going to deny that.
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.760]  He's a patriot in my view, his policies are 100% awesome.
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.400]  And they're not there anymore.
[24:55.400 --> 25:01.320]  And I'm told by a lot of insiders that it is a swirling hot mess at Mar-a-Lago and Trump
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.360]  is surrounded by worse people than ever.
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.800]  And I'm hearing this for about a year.
[25:06.800 --> 25:14.440]  And now I see him putting out the establishment line word for word, the Pfizer PR script.
[25:14.440 --> 25:18.480]  And I'm done.
[25:18.480 --> 25:19.760]  I don't hate Trump.
[25:19.760 --> 25:22.280]  I'm not saying he's our big enemy, any of that.
[25:22.280 --> 25:29.280]  But I mean, when he is repeating what Joe Biden and Brian Stelter and all the rest of
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.480]  them are saying word for word, then I have to just say we have been completely betrayed
[25:34.480 --> 25:36.960]  because I would be a liar if I said that.
[25:36.960 --> 25:40.840]  Was I a little slow to fully hammer Trump?
[25:40.840 --> 25:42.080]  Yeah.
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.640]  And I'll admit that because I hate the globalists and I wanted Trump to be a champion and I
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.720]  wanted him to stand up to him and they knew his potential was real.
[25:49.720 --> 25:52.320]  And he still gets a lot of good Republicans elected and I don't think we should throw
[25:52.320 --> 25:54.040]  the baby out of the bathwater.
[25:54.040 --> 25:56.000]  I'm not part of the Democrat cult of hating Trump.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.360]  They're all celebrating, oh, Jones has turned on Trump, Jones is, you know, January 6th
[26:01.360 --> 26:03.160]  is why Jones is doing this.
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.280]  If you knew anything about our enemies that are wolves, me going after Trump right now
[26:08.280 --> 26:11.000]  might convince them I'm doing it because I'm scared of them.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.880]  100%, there's nothing to cover up with January 6th.
[26:13.880 --> 26:16.520]  It wasn't premeditated from everything I know.
[26:16.520 --> 26:17.920]  This has nothing to do with January 6th.
[26:17.920 --> 26:19.680]  This is completely separate, okay?
[26:19.680 --> 26:25.480]  In fact, the Democrats being so evil and out of control has made me subconsciously not
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.240]  turn on Trump earlier because I didn't want to give them what they wanted.
[26:29.240 --> 26:33.720]  But Trump has given them what they wanted by pushing this poison shot, this death shot,
[26:33.720 --> 26:35.880]  so I can't help it.
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.920]  See, I love watching all the pundits everywhere analyzed.
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.240]  Why did Alex Jones do this?
[26:41.240 --> 26:43.160]  Why did Alex Jones do that?
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.440]  And they tell you a lot about themselves when they weigh all the reasons and what's best
[26:47.440 --> 26:49.240]  for them and what they would do.
[26:49.240 --> 26:51.320]  I don't go off what's best for me.
[26:51.320 --> 26:53.000]  That's why I'm a Texan.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  I'm an American.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.800]  I'm like my grandfathers and grandmothers who are the best damn people ever.
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.200]  I didn't realize how great my family is growing up.
[26:59.200 --> 27:06.680]  Good people, real people, real Christians, really strong, tell the truth, fight hard,
[27:06.680 --> 27:07.680]  work hard.
[27:07.680 --> 27:10.520]  I didn't realize that everybody else didn't get to have something like this.
[27:10.520 --> 27:11.840]  I do what's right.
[27:11.840 --> 27:14.960]  I don't sit there and make a bunch of calculations.
[27:14.960 --> 27:18.120]  The calculations are I feel ashamed supporting Trump.
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.360]  I've got to go after him now, but I'll be honest with you, Rand Pauls knows more about
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.600]  medicine than Trump does and he's just as bad or worse.
[27:27.600 --> 27:33.960]  So separately, we can't stay on air if you don't support us and we're breaking news and
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.760]  we are the tip of the spear blasting through the enemy defenses and getting stuff out there
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.560]  nobody else does and you have really scored a major royal flush against the new old order,
[27:42.560 --> 27:47.200]  a grand slam, whatever you want to call it in your support of this broadcast and I thank
[27:47.200 --> 27:48.360]  you for all you've done.
[27:48.360 --> 27:52.400]  We are one family together in this and I need to tell you, your support is so critical
[27:52.400 --> 27:53.400]  going into 2022.
[27:53.400 --> 27:56.520]  Plus, you've got great products you really need.
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.920]  If you haven't had deep earth crystal iodine, the best atomic out there that absolutely
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.760]  your cells are just worshiping and wanting that electrochemically opens up your DNA.
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.240]  It's why they hit you with the bad halogen, the opposite, the fluoride and the chlorine
[28:10.240 --> 28:11.240]  and the bromide.
[28:11.240 --> 28:12.240]  This is the opposite of that.
[28:12.240 --> 28:15.400]  Those block your cells electrochemical transmissions.
[28:15.400 --> 28:17.440]  This clears them up.

[28:43.400 --> 28:45.600]  old folks, especially people with brown skin.
[28:45.600 --> 28:47.440]  You don't get as much vitamin D from the sun.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.880]  You need vitamin refusion.
[28:48.880 --> 28:53.920]  It's 50% off at infowarstore.com and you keep the broadcast on air.
[28:53.920 --> 29:00.160]  Dr. Peter McCullough, straight ahead, first to clip from Jimmy Dore.
[29:00.160 --> 29:05.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.960]  the globalists are doing right now.
[29:06.960 --> 29:08.680]  This is their big offensive.
[29:08.680 --> 29:10.120]  This is their takeover.
[29:10.120 --> 29:14.080]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.120]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[29:18.120 --> 29:19.120]  in the open.
[29:19.120 --> 29:23.640]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate power and
[29:23.640 --> 29:27.880]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[29:27.880 --> 29:31.200]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[29:31.200 --> 29:35.880]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[29:35.880 --> 29:36.880]  you keep us on air.
[29:36.880 --> 29:40.680]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[29:40.680 --> 29:44.160]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[29:44.160 --> 29:46.160]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers.
[29:46.160 --> 29:50.000]  They are so good for your body and if there's two things you do for your body, it's these
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  two products.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.560]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on the air.
[29:55.560 --> 29:59.720]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[29:59.720 --> 30:03.640]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[30:03.640 --> 30:08.720]  world government whose end game, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the
[30:08.720 --> 30:09.720]  planet.
[30:09.720 --> 30:14.560]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you
[30:14.560 --> 30:18.720]  out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and
[30:18.720 --> 30:20.080]  your family are in.
[30:20.080 --> 30:22.200]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[30:22.200 --> 30:29.560]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[30:29.560 --> 30:31.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear.
[30:31.920 --> 30:35.400]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[30:35.400 --> 30:39.520]  for us has been incredible, but I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.480]  Info Wars, but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[30:42.480 --> 30:47.200]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today and infowarstore.com
[30:47.200 --> 30:50.840]  is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip
[30:50.840 --> 30:51.840]  of the spear.
[30:51.840 --> 30:52.840]  You will go down with the ship.
[30:52.840 --> 30:53.840]  I'm not going to back down.
[30:53.840 --> 30:57.320]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[30:57.320 --> 30:58.320]  you support us.
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.640]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[30:59.640 --> 31:04.240]  Not just across the United States, but across the world, you see it on the sides of barns
[31:04.240 --> 31:08.880]  and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones
[31:08.880 --> 31:09.880]  was right.
[31:09.880 --> 31:14.560]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud
[31:14.560 --> 31:18.080]  of the new world order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the great
[31:18.080 --> 31:19.080]  reset.
[31:19.080 --> 31:23.560]  So now, infowar's credibility is stronger than it's ever been, and the globalists are
[31:23.560 --> 31:27.560]  now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them
[31:27.560 --> 31:28.560]  do that.
[31:28.560 --> 31:30.960]  So, you've invested infowar over the years.
[31:30.960 --> 31:35.400]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture, or everything
[31:35.400 --> 31:38.280]  you've done in the past is for nothing.
[31:38.280 --> 31:43.280]  You have invested in justice and the truth, and hardcore populace, you have done incredible
[31:43.280 --> 31:44.280]  things.
[31:44.280 --> 31:50.160]  And I'm telling you now, going in 2022, infowar has major underages to run an operation, and
[31:50.160 --> 31:51.640]  we need more funds in.
[31:51.640 --> 31:52.880]  So, it's a 360 win.
[31:52.880 --> 31:56.040]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so
[31:56.040 --> 31:57.040]  much more.
[31:57.040 --> 31:58.040]  So, please go to infowarstore.com.
[31:58.040 --> 32:03.800]  Get our great bag of it here.
[32:03.800 --> 32:08.000]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.440]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.800]  organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from
[32:16.800 --> 32:19.800]  the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really, they're just
[32:19.800 --> 32:20.800]  a commune.
[32:20.800 --> 32:24.120]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it, and the farmers
[32:24.120 --> 32:25.600]  don't let the Mexican government take over.
[32:25.600 --> 32:29.040]  So, I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[32:29.040 --> 32:30.160]  and the price has never gone up.
[32:30.160 --> 32:34.880]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just
[32:34.880 --> 32:37.040]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[32:37.040 --> 32:40.440]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[32:40.440 --> 32:47.880]  Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, um, we had, like, the, I'm not sure
[32:47.880 --> 32:48.880]  if you want to believe it.
[32:48.880 --> 32:53.600]  Anyway, so, it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[32:53.600 --> 32:57.640]  fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[32:57.640 --> 33:22.280]  We'll talk to you in a minute.
[33:22.280 --> 33:36.520]  Remember when I said that, if you get vaccinated, you can't get infected, and that was also
[33:36.520 --> 33:37.520]  a lie.
[33:37.520 --> 33:41.440]  Remember when I said it, that you can't be a host and you can't transmit it to someone
[33:41.440 --> 33:42.600]  else if you're a vaccine.
[33:42.600 --> 33:44.600]  That's also a lie.
[33:44.600 --> 33:46.640]  You think she's ever gonna say that?
[33:46.640 --> 33:47.640]  Never.
[33:47.640 --> 33:52.440]  Rachel Maddow has less integrity than Alex Jones at this point.
[33:52.440 --> 34:08.080]  Alex Jones has been more right about this stuff than her, that's for sure.
[34:08.080 --> 34:13.080]  So now, what I've said here is that if you're getting your information about COVID and the
[34:13.080 --> 34:17.880]  vaccine from the establishment news, you're being lied to, and you're being lied to at
[34:17.880 --> 34:23.820]  the top of their lungs, constantly 24-7, with very earnest looking people who you would
[34:23.820 --> 34:28.000]  never think would lie to you, like how about Rachel Maddow?
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.680]  Come on, she wouldn't lie, she's a nerd.
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.640]  Well, watch her lie, nonstop about COVID.
[34:35.640 --> 34:39.880]  Means that instead of the vaccine being able, excuse me, it means instead of the virus being
[34:39.880 --> 34:44.280]  able to hop from person to person to person to person, spreading and spreading, sickening
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.040]  some of them, but not all of them, and the ones that it doesn't sicken don't know they
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.000]  have it, and then they give it to even more people, because they didn't recognize they
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.800]  were, right?
[34:51.800 --> 34:57.160]  Instead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person, potentially mutating
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.600]  and becoming more virulent and drug resistant along the way, now we know that the vaccines
[35:01.600 --> 35:07.840]  work well enough, that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[35:07.840 --> 35:09.840]  That's not true.
[35:09.840 --> 35:12.040]  That was never true.
[35:12.040 --> 35:13.040]  That's not true.
[35:13.040 --> 35:14.040]  That was never true.
[35:14.040 --> 35:21.280]  This is from the end of March, almost April of this year, 2021, she's saying this.
[35:21.280 --> 35:23.800]  That's a lie.
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.720]  That's medical misinformation, and if this video of her saying this is up on YouTube,
[35:27.720 --> 35:35.320]  which it might be, they'll never take it down, but this is straight up 100% medical misinformation.
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.640]  This is why people hate the unvaccinated, because they listen to a lying propagandist
[35:39.640 --> 35:44.840]  like Rachel Maddow, tell them the people who aren't vaccinated are the ones not stopping
[35:44.840 --> 35:47.640]  COVID.
[35:47.640 --> 35:50.080]  This is all garbage.
[35:50.080 --> 35:55.520]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.440]  The virus does not infect them.
[35:57.440 --> 36:02.320]  The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else.
[36:02.320 --> 36:04.760]  That is a lie.
[36:04.760 --> 36:06.800]  That is false.
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.640]  That is medical misinformation brought to you by Pfizer.
[36:12.640 --> 36:20.120]  She gets $30,000 a day to lie for Pfizer and the military industrial complex, and she's
[36:20.120 --> 36:22.280]  doing it.
[36:22.280 --> 36:25.920]  She's lying to you right now.
[36:25.920 --> 36:32.080]  I cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people.
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.400]  Not true.
[36:33.400 --> 36:40.440]  That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this.
[36:40.440 --> 36:44.440]  That is not what that means.
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.600]  Why isn't I knew that in my garage?
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.640]  But you don't know it with your $30,000 a day and your tens of millions of dollars in
[36:53.640 --> 36:58.000]  help, in staff?
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.400]  How many producers do you think she has, 20?
[37:00.400 --> 37:02.680]  How many interns that work there, 50?
[37:02.680 --> 37:07.840]  How many people work at that show, 100?
[37:07.840 --> 37:09.240]  She doesn't know this is a lie?
[37:09.240 --> 37:10.640]  I know it's a lie.
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.280]  I knew it was a lie.
[37:14.280 --> 37:18.520]  You can't vaccinate your way out of this pandemic.
[37:18.520 --> 37:19.680]  You can't do it.
[37:19.680 --> 37:20.680]  Will she ever correct it?
[37:20.680 --> 37:21.680]  No.
[37:21.680 --> 37:22.680]  You know what else she'll never correct?
[37:22.680 --> 37:28.720]  The lie she told about the hospital in Oklahoma being overrun with people taking horse ivermectin
[37:28.720 --> 37:31.680]  instead of human ivermectin.
[37:31.680 --> 37:33.400]  She lied about that on Twitter.
[37:33.400 --> 37:34.560]  It's still up.
[37:34.560 --> 37:36.440]  You know who got taken down from Twitter?
[37:36.440 --> 37:41.640]  Dr. Robert Malone, the guy who invented the vaccine technology because he's telling the
[37:41.640 --> 37:42.640]  truth about it.
[37:42.640 --> 37:43.640]  You know who's leaked?
[37:43.640 --> 37:51.960]  They leave up her because she's lying at the behest of Big Pharma, which owns the media.
[37:51.960 --> 37:53.120]  There's no other way to put that.
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.960]  She's lying and she'll never correct it.
[37:59.960 --> 38:04.320]  She'll never go, hey, remember when I said that the vaccine will end the pandemic if
[38:04.320 --> 38:05.600]  you just get vaccinated?
[38:05.600 --> 38:07.320]  That was 100% lie.
[38:07.320 --> 38:08.480]  That wasn't true at all.
[38:08.480 --> 38:15.120]  Remember when I said that if you get vaccinated, you can't get infected and that was also a
[38:15.120 --> 38:16.120]  lie.
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.080]  Remember when I said that you can't be a host and you can't transmit it to someone else
[38:20.080 --> 38:21.080]  if you're a vaccine?
[38:21.080 --> 38:23.080]  That's also a lie.
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.120]  You think she's ever going to say that?
[38:25.120 --> 38:26.120]  Never.
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.960]  Rachel Maddow has less integrity than Alex Jones at this point.
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.120]  Alex Jones has been more right about this stuff than her, that's for sure.
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.020]  That's how bad they are.
[38:38.020 --> 38:42.960]  If somebody gave me $30,000 and put it in my pocket and you could see it hanging out
[38:42.960 --> 38:47.320]  and I came on there, somebody from Big Pharma and I started telling you all this stuff,
[38:47.320 --> 38:50.040]  would you believe me?
[38:50.040 --> 38:56.920]  If I got a $30,000 check sticking out of my pocket before I sat down, every day they gave
[38:56.920 --> 38:57.920]  me one.
[38:57.920 --> 38:59.840]  Would you believe what I said?
[38:59.840 --> 39:06.400]  I wouldn't, but people believe her and that's what she looks like when she's lying for $30,000
[39:06.400 --> 39:10.880]  a day at the behest of the establishment.
[39:10.880 --> 39:15.680]  Good old Jimmy Dore and all of it's true, they're paying hundreds of thousands of people
[39:15.680 --> 39:22.000]  money around the world to spew BS and then try to censor and block top scientists, medical
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.760]  doctors, a who's who of top people.
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.360]  One of them is here with us, a good friend of mine now, Dr. Peter McCullough, a special
[39:30.360 --> 39:31.360]  guest.
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.200]  He's a board certified internal medicine, cardiovascular disease and clinical lipidology.
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.800]  He cares for advanced patients with common medical problems including heart and kidney
[39:40.800 --> 39:42.920]  disease, lipid disorders and diabetes.
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.080]  He's become an expert on COVID-19 illnesses and welcomes recovered patients into his
[39:48.080 --> 39:49.080]  practice.
[39:49.080 --> 39:53.640]  He also hosts a syndicated show and there's been a lot of huge interviews and he's got
[39:53.640 --> 40:00.600]  a bunch of huge breaking news from the National Institutes of Health on these autopsies and
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.280]  what's happening both from people that have had COVID-19 and those that are taking these
[40:04.280 --> 40:05.280]  so-called vaccines.
[40:05.280 --> 40:07.080]  So, doc, great to have you here.
[40:07.080 --> 40:10.440]  Next hour you're going to do your big PowerPoint and walk everybody through this incredible
[40:10.440 --> 40:14.360]  information but just in this short segment, the next segment coming up, just a big picture
[40:14.360 --> 40:16.680]  of what's happening in the world.
[40:16.680 --> 40:22.360]  Well, we are now in the most intense phase of the pandemic, the Omicron outbreak.
[40:22.360 --> 40:27.520]  We have more cases now, Alex, than we've ever had since the onset of the pandemic.
[40:27.520 --> 40:29.560]  It was clear Jimmy Dore was right.
[40:29.560 --> 40:34.360]  We couldn't vaccinate our way out of the pandemic and now we have this bombshell report
[40:34.360 --> 40:40.720]  from the National Institutes of Health land on December 20th regarding autopsies of patients
[40:40.720 --> 40:46.400]  who had SARS-CoV-2 infection and they died in the hospital and then underwent a detailed
[40:46.400 --> 40:49.200]  autopsy of basically every tissue in the body.
[40:49.200 --> 40:50.200]  Wow.
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.640]  I mean, this is just huge news and it's, as I said, a who's who of scientists are saying
[40:55.640 --> 40:56.640]  the same thing.
[40:56.640 --> 40:59.160]  How does the system cover this up?
[40:59.160 --> 41:03.960]  Well, you know, the National Institutes of Health published this on the Research Gate,
[41:03.960 --> 41:09.080]  a preprint server, which is considered valid fair game in academic medicine as we wait
[41:09.080 --> 41:10.920]  for papers to go through peer review.
[41:10.920 --> 41:14.680]  They summarized 44 cases that died of COVID-19.
[41:14.680 --> 41:17.320]  Now here's the backdrop.
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.560]  They were sick at home for nine days on average before they came into the hospital.
[41:21.560 --> 41:23.900]  No mention of early treatment, none.
[41:23.900 --> 41:25.320]  They come in the hospital.
[41:25.320 --> 41:33.200]  They get an array of treatment, remdesivir, dexamethasone, tozalizumab, some anticoagulants.
[41:33.200 --> 41:35.920]  They ultimately also come of COVID-19.
[41:35.920 --> 41:41.480]  The shocking finding is that the virus was found in virtually every tissue in the body,
[41:41.480 --> 41:47.320]  the brain, the heart, deeply in the lungs, the subcutaneous tissue, the lymph nodes, and
[41:47.320 --> 41:48.680]  it was alive.
[41:48.680 --> 41:50.000]  The virus was alive.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.800]  It was replicating and it was astonishing the findings.
[41:54.800 --> 42:01.920]  One individual now, he was immunocompromised, Alex, but he had it in his tissues and it
[42:01.920 --> 42:05.400]  was located there and the science behind this paper is very strong.
[42:05.400 --> 42:11.880]  It's also our National Institutes of Health for 230 days after the onset of the infection.
[42:11.880 --> 42:14.920]  So this is an unprecedented virus?
[42:14.920 --> 42:15.920]  It's unprecedented.
[42:15.920 --> 42:18.680]  We had no idea it lasted in the human body this long.
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.240]  So the implications are no wonder people have long COVID syndrome.
[42:22.240 --> 42:26.280]  It's not just the spike protein, but in fact it's the entire virus.
[42:26.280 --> 42:29.040]  No wonder people test intermittently positive.
[42:29.040 --> 42:32.880]  Remember the PCR test relies on primers.
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.840]  Typically the RNA-dependent polymerase, the envelope protein, the spike protein or the
[42:37.840 --> 42:40.000]  nucleocapsid, those are the four main primers.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.080]  We're also going to look at the vaccine and what it's doing and the huge developments
[42:44.080 --> 42:45.080]  there.
[42:45.080 --> 42:47.160]  Dr. Peter McCullough is in studio with us on Alex Jones.
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.240]  His big PowerPoint presentation is coming up in about 20 minutes.
[42:51.240 --> 42:54.320]  Bring us in the second hour until everybody you know tune in now.
[42:54.320 --> 43:00.360]  This is life-saving information.
[43:00.360 --> 43:05.240]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[43:05.240 --> 43:07.240]  the globalists are doing right now.
[43:07.240 --> 43:08.960]  This is their big offensive.
[43:08.960 --> 43:10.400]  This is their takeover.
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.360]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[43:14.360 --> 43:18.400]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[43:18.400 --> 43:19.400]  in the open.
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.920]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[43:23.920 --> 43:28.200]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[43:28.200 --> 43:31.600]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.080]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.080]  you keep us on air.
[43:37.080 --> 43:40.920]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.440]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.040]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body and if there's
[43:48.040 --> 43:51.200]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.840]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on the air.
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.320]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[44:00.320 --> 44:06.280]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[44:06.280 --> 44:09.200]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.360]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God,
[44:13.360 --> 44:16.360]  the Creator and we are powerful.
[44:16.360 --> 44:19.600]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.440]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[44:23.440 --> 44:27.240]  with the boy, is it true?
[44:27.240 --> 44:33.080]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[44:33.080 --> 44:36.880]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[44:36.880 --> 44:43.560]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[44:43.560 --> 44:45.560]  of this world who is a loser.
[44:45.560 --> 44:49.560]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever.
[44:49.560 --> 44:53.680]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.480]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[44:58.480 --> 44:59.480]  just announced.
[44:59.480 --> 45:05.200]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[45:05.200 --> 45:10.440]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[45:10.440 --> 45:17.400]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[45:17.400 --> 45:23.360]  In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:23.360 --> 45:26.720]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.720 --> 45:31.720]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[45:31.720 --> 45:38.160]  of this research a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[45:38.160 --> 45:43.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact current research
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.280]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme
[45:48.280 --> 45:52.080]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:52.080 --> 45:57.640]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of
[45:57.640 --> 45:59.800]  our pollen block chewable tablets.
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.480]  Not just across the United States but across the world, you see it on the sides of barns
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.120]  and on bumper stickers, on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones
[46:09.120 --> 46:10.120]  was right.
[46:10.120 --> 46:14.800]  That has become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.320]  of the new world order, that they are saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and the Great
[46:18.320 --> 46:23.680]  Reset and so now infowars credibility is stronger than it has ever been and the globalists
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.600]  are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let
[46:27.600 --> 46:28.600]  them do that.
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.040]  So you have invested infowars over the years, I am asking you to redouble those efforts
[46:33.040 --> 46:38.480]  now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[46:38.480 --> 46:43.480]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace, you have done incredible
[46:43.480 --> 46:50.240]  things and I'm telling you now going in 2022, info wars has major underages to run an operation
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.520]  and we need more funds in so it's a 360 win, get great products that are great for you
[46:54.520 --> 47:01.520]  and your family, your immune system and so much more so please go to infowarswar.com.
[47:01.520 --> 47:08.520]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:08.520 --> 47:18.520]  Dr. Peter McCullough is in studio with us on the last broadcast of the year, fresh off
[47:18.520 --> 47:23.520]  one of Joe Rogan's biggest interviews ever with more than 48 million viewers, the system
[47:23.520 --> 47:24.520]  is definitely scared.
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.520]  I'm Alex Jones your host, thank you so much for joining us on the last transmission of
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.520]  the Alex Jones show of 2021.
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.280]  All right doc, during the little break you are just laying it all out saying quote, it's
[47:35.280 --> 47:38.920]  much worse than we thought and then getting into the vaccine and going oh what's Trump
[47:38.920 --> 47:39.920]  doing?
[47:39.920 --> 47:44.720]  I want you to get all technical and scientific next hour to your power point but just as
[47:44.720 --> 47:50.560]  a citizen, as an American, as a patriot, as a husband, big picture what are we facing,
[47:50.560 --> 47:51.560]  what's really going on here?
[47:51.560 --> 47:56.960]  The big picture is we're facing a virus that had been manipulated in a lab in Wuhan, China,
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.680]  it stays alive in the human body far longer than we ever thought no wonder the PCRs are
[48:01.680 --> 48:04.400]  intermittently positive, it's clearly mutated now.
[48:04.400 --> 48:11.720]  The Omicron variant has violated a golden rule of COVID-19, before Omicron it was one
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.000]  and done, the immunity was robust, complete and durable, no more.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  And that's the update from my Rogan podcast, everybody's email me, Dr. McCullough you said
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.960]  you can't get it twice, I said things have changed, we learned December 10th, our CDC
[48:24.960 --> 48:29.440]  told us Omicrons in the United States, it is the most highly mutated form of the virus,
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.800]  it cannot invade the body like the prior versions, thank goodness maybe we won't have
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.160]  terrible autopsy results like we had from the prior versions, it can't invade as well
[48:38.160 --> 48:44.520]  but it replicates 70 times more rapidly than Delta and in 8, that was from Hong Kong University
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.400]  who pointed that out to us in a report and then a report from the South African Research
[48:48.400 --> 48:53.920]  Institute showed that one when somebody gets Omicron you shut the door on Delta because
[48:53.920 --> 49:00.400]  there is immunity basically closing off that door for Delta to basically invade the body.
[49:00.400 --> 49:05.760]  Omicron is in a battle against Delta and Omicron won because it's faster and it closes the
[49:05.760 --> 49:09.160]  door on Delta.
[49:09.160 --> 49:12.720]  I want to get into all the technicals but let's talk about Trump and I'm not fetishizing
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.960]  attacking Trump, I don't like to attack Trump, I like Trump overall but he is trying to play
[49:16.960 --> 49:21.920]  doctor and saying oh the vaccines work 100% and nobody's gotten sick from the vaccine,
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.200]  I mean that's like Pfizer talking points and I know you were all fair, we're not trying
[49:27.200 --> 49:29.200]  to attack Trump but what's your view on that?
[49:29.200 --> 49:33.920]  My view is that we should have a far more fair balance mention of any of the vaccines
[49:33.920 --> 49:40.000]  by any official in any person of authority including myself, everything has risks and
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.200]  benefits Alex, there's no doubt about it, with the vaccines there has been a benefit,
[49:45.200 --> 49:52.160]  there has been a modest reduction in mortality as shown in papers by Cone from the VA and
[49:52.160 --> 49:57.680]  by 1040 in the IV network, there is a small reduction in mortality for hospitalized patients,
[49:57.680 --> 50:02.240]  there is a relatively large differential in hospitalization risk I think driven by differential
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.560]  testing not so much a vaccine effect but importantly there are serious safety concerns, thousands
[50:07.560 --> 50:12.280]  of Americans have died after the vaccine shortly afterwards and then hundreds of thousands
[50:12.280 --> 50:15.560]  have been injured and been hospitalized.
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.440]  And expanding on that though from the literature I've seen and again I'm just putting out
[50:19.440 --> 50:23.920]  of gestalt everything I've seen but it works up front but then it damages the immune system
[50:23.920 --> 50:27.920]  or lowers the immunity and I've seen reports out of England and other places of what triple
[50:27.920 --> 50:30.560]  the chance of getting Omicron if you've been vaccinated.
[50:30.560 --> 50:36.000]  No I'm not so sure about that right now Alex, the way I view the data is Omicron is an equal
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.360]  opportunity player, it's equally infecting the previously immune, the vaccinated and the
[50:42.360 --> 50:46.560]  unvaccinated, the difference is the previously immune and the vaccinated are having milder
[50:46.560 --> 50:51.920]  syndromes, it's brief and it's mild typically without pulmonary involvement, the unvaccinated
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.440]  still can get a bit more of a severe syndrome but it's far milder than we've ever seen,
[50:56.440 --> 51:01.960]  by the way we had to shift our monoclonals, GlaxoSmithKline now is our lead monoclonal,
[51:01.960 --> 51:07.000]  the Sotirivimab, it actually is still good in covering Omicron against a part of the
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.200]  spike protein that doesn't mutate, that means our workhorse Regeneron and then the resurgent
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.560]  lily product now have to be set aside.
[51:14.560 --> 51:19.960]  Joel Lodappos, Surgeon General in Florida is on a war path right now to get these valuable
[51:19.960 --> 51:24.800]  monoclonals into the state of Florida for our seniors.
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.000]  What's the reality of the monoclonals, I mean is Biden really blocking those because I saw
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.220]  the Minnesota government say, yes if you're white we can deny it to you, I mean I couldn't
[51:33.220 --> 51:35.480]  believe it, it actually says that.
[51:35.480 --> 51:42.160]  I don't know but we had GlaxoSmithKline fully EUA approved in May of 2021, we've had seven
[51:42.160 --> 51:47.240]  months to get ready for this, this product is specifically designed to handle resistant
[51:47.240 --> 51:52.360]  mutant strains, the GlaxoSmithKline product is in a sense what we needed in our toolbox
[51:52.360 --> 51:56.520]  to face something like Omicron and now sadly all the centers including we got an email
[51:56.520 --> 52:03.880]  in my health system in Dallas this morning saying listen we're out, we're out of ammo.
[52:03.880 --> 52:08.760]  Big picture of getting back to Trump and Rachel Maddow they both said the same thing, quote
[52:08.760 --> 52:12.640]  if you have a shot you can't get sick just like Biden's been saying and no one's been
[52:12.640 --> 52:15.600]  hurt by the vaccine, Dr. McCullough are those true statements?
[52:15.600 --> 52:17.800]  Neither one of them are true.
[52:17.800 --> 52:22.280]  So why the hell are Maddow and Trump still saying it over and over again?
[52:22.280 --> 52:25.880]  It's either they know or they should have known, I mean but neither one of those two
[52:25.880 --> 52:26.880]  are good.
[52:26.880 --> 52:30.720]  You know in the court of law you'd be asking a question, did you know, either you should
[52:30.720 --> 52:37.000]  have known or you know and it's clear there are scores of Americans, we've had what are
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.400]  going to have 500,000 new cases today, we're having, we have 70% of the population's been
[52:42.400 --> 52:48.160]  vaccinated, you know we have data from UK, Denmark and South Africa that 70% of Omicron
[52:48.160 --> 52:53.560]  patients were fully vaccinated, we had a report out of Germany yesterday, 94% of patients
[52:53.560 --> 52:57.840]  with Omicron are fully vaccinated, it should be clear to the former president of the United
[52:57.840 --> 53:03.760]  States and to all the news anchors that the vaccine doesn't stop SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19,
[53:03.760 --> 53:06.520]  particularly the Omicron variant.
[53:06.520 --> 53:10.760]  So what does that do to the credibility of the CDC and Trump and just everybody that
[53:10.760 --> 53:14.400]  keeps pushing that BS to Biden?
[53:14.400 --> 53:19.240]  The doubling down, tripling, quadrupling down on the vaccines is something that I think
[53:19.240 --> 53:21.160]  everybody is going to regret.
[53:21.160 --> 53:25.600]  It's clear the vaccines have worked keyed against the original Wilhelm spike protein,
[53:25.600 --> 53:31.160]  that has been long gone now for probably well over nine months, the virus has sufficiently
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.720]  out mutated the vaccines, it's out mutated natural immunity, how can we possibly expect
[53:36.720 --> 53:40.040]  boosters to do anything outside of Cosmore harm?
[53:40.040 --> 53:44.320]  But Doc, isn't that the trick, I mean all the scientists, the virologists have always
[53:44.320 --> 53:48.440]  known you can't create something for the flu because it always mutates a different way,
[53:48.440 --> 53:52.520]  you can't do it for the cold, finally they've created a war where we're obsessed with cold
[53:52.520 --> 53:57.840]  viruses and all the rest of it, and then it never works, so we're always chasing the
[53:57.840 --> 54:01.960]  rabbit here basically, and now it's just a medical takeover.
[54:01.960 --> 54:06.520]  It's a medical takeover, America has the cold, the whole country has the cold, they announced
[54:06.520 --> 54:11.320]  in Dallas this morning our testing centers hit 25% positivity rates, I mean that means
[54:11.320 --> 54:15.520]  that one out of four people in line are turning positive on these tests, at this point in
[54:15.520 --> 54:19.400]  time, I think people ought to assume they have it, so many people can't get tested,
[54:19.400 --> 54:22.080]  the lines are too long, they ought to assume they have it.
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.360]  And isn't that the way viruses always work, pretty much always, even if they're lab made,
[54:26.360 --> 54:30.880]  is they're super deadly but hard to get and then as they mutate, because they're learning
[54:30.880 --> 54:36.160]  how to spread, it's survival of the fittest, but they become less lethal but more contagious.
[54:36.160 --> 54:40.120]  That's absolutely true, and that's Mueller's ratchet, that's exactly what was achieved
[54:40.120 --> 54:45.320]  by Omicron, replicating 70 times faster than Delta, even though its transmissibility index
[54:45.320 --> 54:49.600]  was less than Delta, it just out replicated it and then it shut the door immunologically
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.520]  on allowing any more propagation of Delta, so we're going to see a sharp drop off of
[54:54.520 --> 54:58.320]  Delta as the Omicron peaks guy rockets.
[54:58.320 --> 55:02.720]  What are viruses and they argue, are they alive, are they not, doctor, what are they?
[55:02.720 --> 55:07.480]  Viruses are organisms that have protein and nucleic acids and they have learned how to
[55:07.480 --> 55:15.000]  hijack mammalian cells and other cells from other organisms in order to in a sense feed
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.720]  on them and then propagate.
[55:17.720 --> 55:22.440]  So they have components able to replicate themselves, different than a prion, which would be just
[55:22.440 --> 55:23.440]  a protein.
[55:23.440 --> 55:25.480]  So they're tiny predators.
[55:25.480 --> 55:32.040]  They are tiny predators and they feed on us and they seek to stay alive and Mueller's
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.400]  ratchet would say, listen, they've got to keep the host alive in order to propagate.
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.240]  We're almost at the point, Alex, this is the common cold, now a new version of it.
[55:40.240 --> 55:44.720]  Oh, so the early version that kills you, you've never been around, but once it colonizes
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.160]  you, that's why they always go to that point is them finding equilibrium.
[55:48.160 --> 55:49.160]  That's right.
[55:49.160 --> 55:50.160]  Wow.
[55:50.160 --> 55:51.160]  Okay.
[55:51.160 --> 55:54.640]  You talk fast, even faster than I do because you're a smart guy and I get it, you got a
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.680]  lot of data, but just, we're going to go to break in two minutes, but before we went
[55:58.680 --> 56:01.640]  live and after you show me these documents, you're going to cover next hour, you're saying,
[56:01.640 --> 56:05.600]  listen, the virus itself in the body is way worse than we thought, it's colonizing the
[56:05.600 --> 56:09.560]  body, it's lasting longer than the virus, you seem really concerned.
[56:09.560 --> 56:11.600]  Just spend a minute or so explaining what that means.
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.480]  The fatal cases are clear.
[56:13.480 --> 56:20.160]  There is a prolonged time of infectivity in the human body.
[56:20.160 --> 56:24.680]  Now they may not be contagious, these individuals, but the virus was alive far longer than what
[56:24.680 --> 56:25.680]  we thought.
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.720]  The primers for the PCR test are basically there, the components that would trigger it.
[56:29.720 --> 56:34.480]  No wonder people test intermittently positive after serious cases of SARS-CoV-2.
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.200]  If we've learned anything from the NIH autopsy study is early treatment is the key.
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.600]  These individuals died, not a single one was there a mention of early treatment.
[56:42.600 --> 56:46.960]  The late treatments probably have no impact whatsoever, three quarters at the time the
[56:46.960 --> 56:47.960]  brain was involved.
[56:47.960 --> 56:50.880]  No wonder people have brain fog after long COVID.
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.200]  Alex, long COVID syndrome is real, it's related to the virus.
[56:55.200 --> 56:58.040]  The virus is replicating slowly in the body.
[56:58.040 --> 57:01.640]  Maybe this is a therapeutic opportunity, maybe things that reduce replication like the new
[57:01.640 --> 57:07.000]  Pfizer or Merck pills for instance, maybe much better than just a five-day course.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.040]  You're just being completely honest off the real data you've got and they attack and try
[57:10.040 --> 57:11.040]  to silence you.
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.440]  I've never been directly attacked, no one's actually had a direct-direct eye-to-eye conversation.
[57:16.440 --> 57:18.880]  They're sniping from the side, but the data are clear.
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.360]  I'm citing National Institutes of Health data, one can look at it and corroborate every
[57:23.360 --> 57:24.360]  single point.
[57:24.360 --> 57:30.160]  I know you don't want to get into it, but technically they've come after your job.
[57:30.160 --> 57:36.440]  There have been a variety of twists and turns in 2021 for myself, for people like you.
[57:36.440 --> 57:41.360]  Anybody who's trying to bring scientific truth to the public right now is under heavy fire.
[57:41.360 --> 57:46.120]  Dr. Peter McCullough, we're back in two minutes with hour number two and the PowerPoint presentation.
[57:46.120 --> 57:49.840]  Stay with us.
[57:49.840 --> 57:52.040]  Christmas 2021 is gone.

[59:39.640 --> 59:45.360]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[59:45.360 --> 59:52.360]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[59:52.360 --> 1:00:04.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:08.040]  If you're a TV viewer, you see a photo that the news has picked up that confirmed that's
[1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:14.720]  a real woman on a plane wearing a space bubble over her head in a mask inside huffing carbon
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:19.200]  dioxide and now they're trying to order here in Austin a violation of the state law for
[1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:21.240]  children to wear two masks.
[1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:23.200]  Dr. Peter McCullough is here with us.
[1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:27.280]  He's going to give us PowerPoint, incredible analysis next segment.
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:32.480]  But I wanted to just talk about the fear and we're confirming these other reports of people
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:36.160]  euthanizing their dog because they, quote, had Omnicron and now people are testing their
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:41.600]  animals and then I've got South Africa, this has been happening for weeks, says it has
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:46.600]  passed its fourth wave of cases and counts, few deaths added.
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:50.680]  So there's almost no deaths, but there's just total hysteria.
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:57.600]  US smashes global COVID infection record again with 647,000 plus new cases recorded Thursday,
[1:00:57.600 --> 1:00:59.440]  but daily deaths have fallen.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.360]  So this is hysteria.
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:04.080]  It's basically the common cold now.
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:09.840]  In my house, I had a chance to observe ages five to 98 Omicron as it came into my house
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:10.840]  for Christmas.
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:14.240]  My kids had it for a few hours, took a little Tylenol for fever.
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.720]  The older individuals needed some assistive medications and I'm talking pretty easy now.
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.080]  I've been treating COVID-19 for two years and I can tell you Delta was long and hard.
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:28.200]  Omicron is brief, it is mild and easily treatable.
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.040]  Well, I remember eight, nine months ago, I saw real hospitals full, really people sick
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:35.040]  with Delta.
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:38.200]  I told listeners, no, no, last year they exaggerated and hyped it up.
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:40.560]  This is very real that my dad got it almost killed him.
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:41.560]  My mom's never been that sick.
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:42.560]  I got it.
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:43.560]  Didn't really make a big deal about it.
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:46.920]  I feel like a gorilla was on my chest for two weeks, sickest I've ever been, but I just
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:50.760]  powered through it and then people like, oh, Jones, you're making it up, then it finally
[1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:51.760]  hit their town.
[1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:52.760]  They're like, oh, yeah, this is serious.
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:54.760]  So this is a real virus.
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:56.440]  People will try to say, oh, that's totally made up.
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:57.440]  No, it's real.
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:01:58.440]  It's real.
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:01:59.440]  I've had calls from the Northeast.
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:01.560]  I had a call yesterday from Chicago.
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:05.200]  The Northern US has a blend of Delta and Omicron right now.
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:09.680]  So the hardest thing for our doctor to figure out in this initial phase is, is it Delta?
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:11.920]  Is it going to be 30 days of a heart illness?
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:12.920]  Or is it going to be Omicron?
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:15.120]  It's going to be a couple of days needing no treatment.
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  Very, very difficult.
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:20.480]  We don't have the ability with the PCR test to tell us which is which, and we desperately
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:21.480]  need it.
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:22.480]  And I forget.
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.360]  Did you have the original or did you have the Delta?
[1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:25.360]  I had Alpha.
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:26.360]  Yeah.
[1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:27.920]  How was Alpha different than Delta?
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:30.880]  I think Alpha was far milder than Delta.
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:33.760]  I've lost patients in their 30s to Delta.
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:35.920]  I mean, it was very, very hard.
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:38.960]  Delta was far more invasive than the other strains.
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:41.000]  It lasted far longer.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.800]  And honestly, I'm glad Omicron is here in a sense to shut the door on Delta.
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:50.200]  Many are saying Omicron is mother nature's now booster.
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:51.200]  That's what South Africa signed.
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:52.200]  It said two weeks ago.
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:53.200]  It looks like they're right.
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:55.640]  Marty McRae from Johns Hopkins was on Hannity this week.
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:59.720]  I was on Fox with Sean Duffy basically saying the same thing.
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:04.000]  When patients get this, by the way, they feel like it's a booster.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.440]  It feels like a booster shot.
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.200]  Omicron feels a little febrile, a little sick for a day or two, and then it gets better,
[1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:13.200]  particularly those who are COVID-recovered and those who have been previously vaccinated.
[1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:17.400]  Because let's not forget, all science is doing is copying the way God sets stuff up.
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:19.440]  And of course, nature has got the real booster.
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:20.440]  It's amazing.
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:24.240]  If we look at the receptor bonding domain, where this virus used to invade the body, it
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:26.200]  has been peppered with mutations.
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:29.360]  It simply can't invade like it used to.
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:31.680]  We're about to do your big PowerPoint presentation.
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:33.280]  A lot of big developments.
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:36.520]  We focused on Omicron and the real virus, but what about the vaccine?
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:38.120]  I also want to hit some of that.
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:40.280]  When will we get into that in the next couple of hours?
[1:03:40.280 --> 1:03:41.280]  We will.
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:45.200]  The biggest breaking news, again, on the same server, ResearchGate, the same server that
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:52.960]  the NIH puts out their data, a paper by Pentezatos from Columbia published on this server data
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:04:00.560]  using census deaths and the vaccine administration data and now has an estimate on the U.S. loss
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:04.760]  of life with the vaccines, and you'll be stunned with this, the number could be as high as
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:08.760]  178,000 Americans that have died after the vaccine.
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:09.760]  Wow.
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:13.080]  So I don't want to interrupt the flow of this in the next hour and a half.
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:15.960]  When are you going to cover that, because that's what I really want to know about.
[1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:20.120]  Well, I'll cover that in the next hour, but that analysis gives the biggest number we're
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:21.120]  aware of.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.720]  Remember, VAERS, half domestic, half ex-U.S., has about 10,000 American lives lost currently.
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:30.960]  The U.S. whistleblower lawsuit, Tom Rents and the CMS whistleblower this summer had
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:37.680]  the number at 45,000, now Columbia has the vaccine mortality number at the upper bound
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:39.680]  is 178,000.
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:40.680]  Columbia University, very respected.
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:41.680]  All right.
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:44.320]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest.
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:47.560]  We're going to come back in 60 seconds and plunge right into this.
[1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:51.240]  Please tell your friends and family to tune in on local radio stations, TV stations,
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:52.760]  and the feeds at infowars.com.
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:59.560]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:05.520]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:10.160]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making

[1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:40.640]  the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:44.160]  activity in the body, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:49.520]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:55.800]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com,
[1:05:55.800 --> 1:05:58.320]  50% off for a limited time.
[1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:10.800]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:14.400]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:15.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:21.200]  Well, we already had Dr. Robert Malone this morning in studio here taping an interview
[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:26.760]  we're not going to put out until his Joe Rogan interview drops either today or Joe may wait.
[1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:31.800]  They're now saying until Monday, huge interview and vendor of mRNA technology saying, hey,
[1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:33.040]  vaccines are very, very dangerous.
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:36.880]  These are not really vaccines, and they're not really protecting you long term.
[1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:40.320]  That huge information is now breaking.
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:42.640]  And Dr. Peter McCullough has been a trailblazer.
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:43.640]  He's a heart surgeon.
[1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:46.560]  He's been involved in major FDA studies.
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:52.680]  He's become a leading voice out there going over the real scientific data and reports.
[1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:58.000]  And he has put together, I asked him to do this a couple of weeks ago, two huge sections
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:04.520]  for a PowerPoint on vaccine efficacy, what's really happening, the virus and the real science.
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:05.720]  So you want it.
[1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:06.720]  This isn't hype.
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:09.080]  This isn't Pfizer propaganda.
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:11.760]  This isn't pure anti-vax information.
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:14.400]  This is the real science coming out.
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:16.480]  Dr. Peter McCullough, thank you so much.
[1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:17.480]  Please launch into it.
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:18.480]  Thank you.
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:19.760]  Now, just to clarify, I'm a medical doctor.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:24.360]  I work with great surgeons, but I'm a medical doctor at a major medical center, an intern
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:29.120]  as cardiologist and epidemiologist, but I've finished two years of essentially what has
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:32.880]  been a COVID-19 infectious disease fellowship.
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:34.800]  Let's go ahead and bring up the first slide.
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:41.160]  We are giving public programs, doctors MI circles independently with grassroots organizations,
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:46.360]  public seminars for doctors, for lawmakers, and then big public programs all over the
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:47.360]  country.
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:49.360]  Alex, 500 to 5,000 individuals.
[1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:56.840]  I have a headlining one with a former Trump administration, cabinet member Ben Carson
[1:07:56.840 --> 1:08:04.480]  in Phoenix, September, January 7th, 8th and 9th, we've got 48,000 people going to be attending
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:05.480]  that.
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:06.480]  So this is big.
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:07.480]  Let's bring up the first slide.
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:09.360]  This will be, I'm just going to show you a few of the slides.
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.880]  If you attend one of these public programs, you will see it.
[1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:19.640]  We're going to cover vaccine safety and efficacy, and let's move forward to the slide, which
[1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:21.560]  is on the Hill.
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:22.880]  You'll be able to see this.
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:29.720]  I express concerns as an academic doctor, and you can see the date of this publication
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:38.880]  in the Hill where this was on August 17th of 2020, Alex, and the title of this paper
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:43.920]  is the Great Gamble of the COVID-19 Vaccine Development Program.
[1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:45.400]  Why was it a gamble?
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:49.880]  Because as Dr. Robert Malone indicated, they're not traditional vaccines.
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:53.800]  They are genetic transfer technology programs.
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:58.360]  The virus has a dangerous component to it, and that is the spike protein.
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:08:59.800]  That's what I'm showing you here.
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:06.160]  This is the spine on the ball of the virus, 1200 amino acids, about a dozen glycosylation
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:09.040]  side chains, and Alex, this thing is a loaded weapon.
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:15.680]  The spike protein has been devised in a lab in Wuhan, China to be far more infectious,
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:18.320]  invasive, and lethal to human beings.
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:19.960]  Now enter the vaccines.
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  The vaccines are either messenger RNA as shown on the right-hand side of the slide.
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:25.960]  That's Pfizer-Moderna.
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:32.840]  They have nucleoside analog caps, and importantly, these analog caps, as I've published with
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:38.680]  Tony Karagopoulos in Greece, they are not broken down by our normal enzymatic mechanism.
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:42.920]  So the messenger RNA itself, Alex, stays in the body a long period of time.
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:48.840]  It tricks the body's own machinery, the ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, to produce
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:51.480]  the dangerous spike protein, those red buds.
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:56.560]  So we're actually hijacking the body's cells to produce the very deadly spike protein that's
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:58.880]  loaded on the virus itself.
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:03.120]  You can see on the left-hand side of the slide, that's Johnson and Johnson or AstraZeneca,
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:05.560]  and importantly, that uses a different technology.
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:09.920]  That's adenoviral technology, where the DNA actually goes into our nucleus of our cells,
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:15.320]  is resident there, and then we produce the RNA for the spike protein, and again, we produce
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:17.160]  more of that spike protein.
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:24.160]  We now know the spike protein lasts in the human body at least a month circulatory with
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.480]  a paper by Ogata and colleagues.
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:32.000]  And now this paper that just broke from Sandia Banzel, as you can see here, the title of
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:39.600]  the paper is Circulating Exosomes with COVID Spike Protein Induced by the Pfizer vaccine,
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:44.440]  and you can see it right now, that the spike protein is in the human body, Alex, after
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:46.800]  vaccination for a long period of time.
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:52.640]  In fact, it's enveloped in its own particle of phospholipid bilayer.
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:57.360]  So the spike protein, in a sense, is loaded into our body, and then it begins to travel
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:00.920]  in our body in these circulatory exosomes.
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:07.920]  It lasts in the body, as Bruce Patterson has shown, at least months after vaccination.
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:09.680]  Right now, he was on the McCullough Report.
[1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:15.120]  Bruce Patterson, by the way, a world-class scientist, he'd be great to bring on the show.
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:17.560]  He's at Northwestern in Stanford.
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:19.000]  He started his own company in Seldiax.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.120]  He's the leading person on identifying the spike protein in the body.
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  By the way, please get him on.
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:26.600]  You got Steve Kershaw, of course, I knew, from watching, but he's amazing.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.560]  So anybody you recommend, please, Doc.
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:29.560]  Absolutely terrific.
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:34.120]  Bruce Patterson said, listen, you take the vaccine, that spike protein in your body,
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:36.520]  at least for a year, maybe a year and a half.
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:39.840]  Each shot, the body has to recover from this.
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:40.840]  The body has to clean this stuff up.
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:47.640]  So in layman's terms, the so-called vaccine causes a similar effect as the actual virus?
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:49.240]  It causes a similar effect.
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:53.840]  In fact, in many ways it's worse because the body has a chance to fight off the virus in
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:54.840]  the nose and mouth.
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:57.760]  Remember, in the nose and mouth, we've got lymphoid tissue.
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:58.920]  We have what's called pyrus patches.
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:03.040]  We have the ability to try to fight off the virus.
[1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:08.040]  But when you take an injection of adenoviral or messenger RNA in the body, that's a main
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:09.040]  line.
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:13.840]  You skip all the defense systems, and now you hijack the body to produce this dangerous
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.520]  pathogenic protein.
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:21.120]  That was what I was trying to tell America back in August before we launched the vaccines.
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  Warning, warning.
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:25.160]  That's the reason why Dr. Malone has come out and said, listen, I worked on this, and
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.080]  it turns out to be a bad idea.
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:28.080]  That's what he's telling you.
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:33.320]  Scientifically, it's a bad idea to use genetic technology to trick the body into making a
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:35.240]  dangerous spike protein.
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:38.640]  With this idea, that's going to create immunity, which has obviously failed.
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:44.020]  And now we realize this is a long-term installation of genetic material, and then subsequently
[1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:47.640]  the continued production of spike protein for a long period of time.
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:48.640]  Wow.
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:52.720]  The foreign installation of outside genetic material and a hijacking of the cells.
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:53.720]  Absolutely.
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:57.600]  And each injection, Alex, is probably a different mosaic of cells.
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:01.200]  So the genetic information can't get into all the cells.
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:06.280]  So where are the lipid nanoparticles going to go, and then dump their payload?
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:11.840]  What we now know in a paper from Japan, for instance, that we know that the lipid nanoparticles
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:14.960]  do hyperconcentrate in the ovaries in the reproductive organs.
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:16.520]  They clearly go elsewhere.
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.160]  This is not a big surprise.
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:20.400]  No wonder Bill Gates is pushing it.
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:26.600]  We know from autopsy studies from Vienna, as well as from Germany, that the vaccines
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:28.720]  go everywhere, just like the virus.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:33.400]  I told you the NIH autopsy studies showed the virus in the brain, the heart, the bone marrow,
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:34.760]  the lymphatic system.
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:35.920]  The same thing with the vaccine.
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:40.000]  This is the first vaccine that we've ever had where the brain gets loaded with it.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.400]  The heart gets loaded with it.
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:46.800]  And in this paper that I'm pointing out from Evolio and colleagues, wonderful preclinical
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:51.440]  paper showing that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, remember that's what I was telling
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:52.440]  you.
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:54.160]  The spike protein is where all the action is.
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:58.240]  In this paper, the spike protein is shown as these blue buds.
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:01.240]  It would be the same as the red buds in the prior PowerPoints.
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:04.080]  They actually damage the perisites.
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:05.080]  The perisites.
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:07.780]  Perisites are support cells in the heart.
[1:14:07.780 --> 1:14:09.440]  They support the capillaries.
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:11.480]  They support the cardiomyocytes.
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:19.240]  And can you imagine a vaccine-induced attack on heart cells with the dangerous spike protein?
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:24.200]  No surprise that it causes myocarditis or heart inflammation.
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:29.120]  This shouldn't be of no scientific surprise whatsoever.
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:31.080]  It is now well understood.
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:33.040]  Our FDA agrees.
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:39.600]  Our FDA warns Americans not to take the vaccines because they cause myocarditis.
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:40.600]  Isn't it crazy?
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:43.360]  They put the advisory on now, I guess, for what, six months.
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.920]  But then Trump and Matt Owl and the Democrats and Biden say, no, there's no problems.
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:51.760]  When they put the advisory out, they had 200 cases they reviewed.
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:53.800]  They had a universe of 600 cases.
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:15:00.320]  These kids were sick, 90% hospitalized, sky-high troponins, dramatic EKG changes, chest pains,
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:02.680]  signs and symptoms of heart failure.
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:07.120]  They remained in the hospital for days that some of them needed heart failure or medications.
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:08.120]  Alex, this is not a joke.
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:10.040]  They needed three to six months of rest.
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:11.640]  What happened over the summer?
[1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:18.080]  We have had a montage of athletes that we have seen all over the world drop dead on
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:19.600]  the field.
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:23.320]  Nobody knows if they've been vaccinated or not, although we know most of these countries
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:27.720]  and these teams, in fact, had very aggressive vaccination strategies.
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:31.520]  If there is subclinical myocarditis, or in fact, if there is some subtle symptoms and
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:34.720]  the players say, listen, I'm going to play through this because I've got a big contract.
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:38.840]  They know if they actually knuckle under and are diagnosed with myocarditis, that means
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:42.640]  their season is over with because they must go under strict rest from everybody to the
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:43.640]  next.
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:44.920]  I think it used to this happen once a year, every five years.
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:47.360]  Now it's every day, four-dodges last week.
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:49.880]  Dr. Peter McCullough is on fire.
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:52.240]  We'll be right back on the other side of this PowerPoint.
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:53.880]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:58.640]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:04.520]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:09.160]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making
[1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:13.920]  yourself healthier, wealthier, and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:18.760]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:19.760]  in stock.

[1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:39.560]  the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[1:16:39.560 --> 1:16:43.160]  activity in the body, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:48.520]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:54.280]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com,
[1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:57.320]  50% off for a limited time.
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:16:59.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.520]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:07.800]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:10.320]  Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:16.200]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:23.280]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:25.520]  and American jobs.
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:27.760]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:32.800]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:38.560]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:41.000]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.240]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, resetwars is the most important, and
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:51.800]  it is now available now the month of December 2021 is here at resetwars.com.
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:55.680]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com.
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:58.600]  The globalist fear this information.
[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:02.560]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:07.640]  world government whose end game, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:08.640]  planet.
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:13.360]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:17.480]  you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you
[1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:19.000]  and your family are in.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.120]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:28.480]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:30.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:34.320]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:38.440]  for us has been incredible, but I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:41.400]  info wars with the entire country and the world of tyranny.
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:46.120]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today and infowarstore.com
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:49.760]  is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:50.760]  of the spear.
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:51.760]  You will go down with the ship.
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:52.760]  I'm not going to back down.
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:56.280]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:57.280]  you support us.
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:58.440]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:01.240]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:06.400]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:09.880]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:15.600]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:20.840]  facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:25.360]  come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:29.000]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.360]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:38.280]  compliant meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:27.840]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:54.520]  Alex, I'm going to show you a paper now, I have it up on the screen that you're not
[1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:58.640]  going to be able to see if you go on the internet because it's been censored.
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:03.120]  This is a paper that was fully accepted, went through the peer review process, the first
[1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:08.240]  author is Jessica Rose, I'm the second author, this was published in the Current Problems
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:15.800]  of Cardiology and it's simply describing myocarditis in the VAERS system, the CDC Vaccine Inverse
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:21.680]  Event Reporting System and this was made it through the entire process, it was invited
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:27.400]  by the editors, it went through the peer review process, Gally Proofs contracted, I paid the
[1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:32.520]  fees Alex, they didn't return them, this was fully published in the National Library of
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:37.040]  Medicine and available, people were using this five days before the pediatric meeting
[1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:42.600]  for the FDA, Elsevier pulled the paper out and said the reason for pulling it out is
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:46.360]  not that it was scientifically invalid, not that there was any typeset problems, they
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:51.240]  pulled it out because they said they didn't think the journal invited it to begin with,
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:54.360]  which clearly they did, now they're under threat of lawsuit.
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:59.560]  Believe it or not, as a scientific doctor, I have to sue Elsevier, the largest publisher
[1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:06.200]  for basically breach of contract and tortuous interference in my business of publishing
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:08.000]  data as an academic physician.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.800]  So you're not just covering this powerpoint with all this research, you're in it and just
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:17.480]  let me throw this out as a brief aside, I've seen hundreds of articles of academics and
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:22.920]  heads of research institutes in Canada, in Germany, in the U.K., in the U.S., in Australia
[1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:28.000]  saying, yeah we're seeing massive increase of heart attacks and deaths and blood clots,
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.680]  but we've been told not to say it or publish it or we'll get all our funding pulled.
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:38.280]  Well I tell you what, I am relentless and this will see the light of day, take a look
[1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:44.160]  at the data, I want everyone to see this, these are real people in the vaccine aversive
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:49.120]  event reporting system, the darker blue are the men.
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:54.860]  So notice that men, 90% of people developing myocarditis are men, they develop it shortly
[1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:58.640]  after administration of the vaccines which are shown in the two black lines, but look
[1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:03.480]  at the tail, Alex, the tail of the distribution goes all the way out to age 50.
[1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:08.720]  I am telling you as a doctor, myocarditis is not just a problem of children, it is
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:16.040]  a problem of men extending well into male adulthood and the Koreans are worried, let's
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:22.240]  move forward to this next tab, this paper by Choi and colleagues, very important, this
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:27.400]  condition is fatal and it's proven to be fatal in some unfortunate individuals.
[1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:31.920]  Choi and colleagues published a man, he's 22 years old, this is someone where COVID
[1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:37.680]  would have been like a mild cold, he takes the vaccine, in this case the Pfizer vaccine,
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:42.440]  he has five days of chest pain, comes to the hospital and he dies seven hours later and
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:47.440]  look at the histologic findings there, the heart is loaded with inflammation, this is
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:53.560]  beyond doubt that the vaccine caused this death, it's irrefutable, we can't have the
[1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:58.120]  president of the United States saying no one's died of the vaccine, the data are abundantly
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:23:59.120]  clear.
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:02.040]  Wow, I'm speechless, please continue.
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:07.560]  When we move forward and look at the other key pieces of information that are coming
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:15.520]  in on COVID-19, what we find is what's called regulatory malfeasance and this is a screen
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:22.600]  shot of CNN correspondent Sanjay Gupta and an assistant CNN correspondent on Sesame
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:29.840]  Street and Alex, they're on Sesame Street as CNN correspondents attempting to seduce
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:37.600]  children into taking the vaccine and I can tell you, they did not give fair balance,
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:43.080]  they did not say the vaccine could cause fatal myocarditis, they didn't do the normal drug
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:47.400]  company provides those they put at the end, right, listen, are they even authorized to
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:52.200]  target children, newborns and three year olds weren't even approved yet, they aren't authorized
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:57.840]  at all, they are media people, they are not authorized at all to do this, the US Drug and
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:04.640]  Cosmetics Act, the Truth and Advertising Act and the Lamin Act all apply to any presentation
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:05.640]  of data.
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:09.760]  What I'm doing today, Alex, is I'm giving fair balance, that's in a person in position
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:14.360]  of authority, it's my responsibility to give fair balance, fair balance was not given to
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:16.040]  these children and these parents.
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:21.840]  They were given a big Pfizer script given to puppeteers and then regurgitated on children.
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:26.840]  And when I presented this, a helpless audience, when I presented this to Joe Rogan, Joe's
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:32.880]  eyes were as big as saucers, he had just had Sanjay Gupta on actually regarding a different
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:37.080]  issue regarding Ivar Mekton and Joe had-
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:41.240]  Joe, again, Sanjay Gupta was the narrator, so if somebody comes and tries to sell your
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:46.320]  child drugs at the school yard, you know that's evil, they're not supposed to have contact
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:47.320]  with your child.
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:52.600]  This is through the TV, through PBS, Big Pharma literally preying on children saying you're
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:56.440]  going to get sick and get hurt and die unless you have this thing and most of them watching
[1:25:56.440 --> 1:25:58.720]  haven't even been approved yet to have it.
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:03.640]  That's correct and Joe Rogan asked me, do you think Sanjay Gupta and the CNN Correspondents,
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.880]  do they know the regulatory laws?
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:11.560]  And I told Joe Rogan, I said either they knew or they should have known, which one is it?
[1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:13.040]  It's not good for either one.
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:17.480]  Yeah, what it is is damn evil.
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:22.240]  Let's move on, this next paper I think was the one that really it hit in the last two
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:30.920]  months and this could be the largest estimate we have seen regarding vaccine deaths so far
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:31.920]  in the literature.
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:37.160]  Now this ends up being published on ResearchGate, this is the same preprint server that the
[1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:39.720]  National Institutes of Health uses for their autopsies.
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:40.720]  So I can tell you-
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:42.760]  And is this connected to the Columbia number you were talking about?
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:43.760]  This is the Columbia number.
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:51.920]  This paper was published by Spiro Pantazatos and Herve Seligman from Columbia University
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:53.600]  in New York, New York.
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:59.320]  They use census data as well as vaccine administration data and looked at the time of death.
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:02.240]  Now we know the time of death when it comes within a narrow window.
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:06.720]  For instance, regulatory wise, any death that occurs within 30 days of a product, whether
[1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.400]  the product causes it or not, we don't care.
[1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:09.400]  You gotta look at it.
[1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:10.400]  You gotta look at it.
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:11.400]  You have to.
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:21.880]  The number they come up with, Alex, the range is 146 to 187,000 Americans may have died
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:23.880]  after the vaccine.
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:24.880]  Wow.
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:31.000]  Now, if we're at 800,000 people who died of the respiratory illness, and our CDC tells
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.840]  us that 90% of them have other conditions that were also fatal, the Italians, by the
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:41.680]  way, say now they'll be coding their data, that 97% of Italians had other fatal illnesses.
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:42.840]  Let me put this in context.
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:44.440]  Colin Powell, people know Colin Powell.
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:49.480]  He had terminal multiple myeloma, he took the vaccine and he died with COVID.
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:55.560]  But all experts agree that the terminal multiple myeloma was the overriding problem, right?
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:00.800]  So we know that 90% of COVID deaths like this, the average age of death of COVID in the United
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:02.440]  States is 83 years old.
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:04.840]  These are people who live beyond life expectancy.
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:11.360]  So what I'm telling you is we probably have 60,000 Americans, people our age, who truly
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:14.080]  died of COVID, 60,000.
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:19.600]  And what Pantosatos and Salagran are saying is that we may have had 187 taken out with
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:20.600]  the vaccine.
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:24.920]  The vaccine is far worse than the respiratory illness.
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:25.920]  Wow.
[1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:26.920]  All right.
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:27.920]  Going to break again.
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:28.920]  Longer segments coming up.
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:33.240]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest and we'll come back, we'll tell you where you can find.
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:34.240]  Is this PowerPoint out?
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:35.240]  You have people to see?
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:37.840]  PowerPoint's available on multiple servers.
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:40.840]  Go to American Association of Physician Insurgents, aapsonline.com.
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:44.320]  All right, we'll come back and tell people about that again.
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:48.520]  This is life-saving information because now they're not coming for our children.
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:52.440]  They already came for them and now Fauci says in a month they're going to start injecting
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:53.440]  newborns.
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:54.440]  Stay with us.
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:55.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:59.040]  How much more time?
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.920]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:05.880]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:07.600]  This is their big offensive.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:09.040]  This is their takeover.
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:12.960]  This is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:17.000]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  in the open.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.480]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate power and
[1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:26.760]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:30.040]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:34.720]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:35.720]  you keep us on air.

[1:30:58.680 --> 1:31:02.280]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee, welcome.
[1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:03.280]  Hello, Alex.
[1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:04.280]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:07.760]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the
[1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:08.760]  line.
[1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:12.960]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:15.680]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[1:31:15.680 --> 1:31:18.400]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:20.280]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:26.440]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:31.360]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well that just aren't
[1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:32.360]  as strong.
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:36.200]  This is like a very fine wine, in fact, each batch is different.
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:38.120]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:41.680]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:44.240]  That's just how it is, it's how it works.
[1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:48.000]  So it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:58.680]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:03.440]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:04.440]  enslavement.
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:09.680]  And in that documentary, I predicted the globalists would establish world government by releasing
[1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:15.160]  a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:17.080]  our industrial society.
[1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:18.080]  And now they've done it.
[1:32:18.080 --> 1:32:20.120]  How did I know they would do it?
[1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:24.560]  Because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:25.560]  meetings were leaked.
[1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:30.760]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab
[1:32:30.760 --> 1:32:35.120]  and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch
[1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:36.120]  this great reset.
[1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:37.960]  Well, we're now living in it.
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:42.520]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world done its ass as a tyrannical
[1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:48.440]  corporate world government, the total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family,
[1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:53.760]  and then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines
[1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.760]  to poison us in the populace.
[1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.200]  This is what Info Wars is fighting.
[1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:00.200]  We're fighting for the future.
[1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:18.000]  Dating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones, waging
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:26.200]  war, waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:36.680]  Well, this is in changing information, Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest and he is going
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:42.800]  through a PowerPoint presentation with the latest information that he is going to be
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:48.240]  presenting in front of crowds across the United States, tens of thousands and before
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:54.440]  you drill back into these huge developments, just as a citizen, not as his doctor, not
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:58.320]  as a researcher, I don't see the power structure getting out of this.
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:01.880]  I mean, they have really screwed up, then I see Pfizer and others demanding all these
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:05.120]  secret agreements for liability protection.
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:08.400]  I don't see how they were so stupid when all the experts told them this would cause
[1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:12.560]  all sorts of autoimmune problems and blood clots and myocarditis, I mean, that was in
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:16.080]  the slide, as you know, from October last year before it even started.
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:20.920]  So I know you don't like to speculate, but this is a citizen, what do you think the
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:25.880]  big plan is here or do they really just crazily do this and now they've destroyed themselves
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:29.280]  and now they're going to keep paying media to lie and say nothing's happening.
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.960]  The fact pattern is checked, there's no doubt about it.
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:38.920]  Lead attorney Aaron Seary has basically sued Pfizer and the FDA for full release of the
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:39.920]  Pfizer dossier.
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.240]  Now, why Pfizer?
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:42.240]  Because they're the lead product.
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:47.640]  In fact, most people have taken Pfizer, FDA now is actually de-emphasizing Johnson and
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:52.680]  Johnson, so it's pretty much Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer 30 micrograms of messenger RNA per
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:53.680]  shot.
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:57.520]  And why and why Johnson and Johnson says, oh, they say the FDA says, oh, you might not
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:34:59.480]  want to take this to make you have a myocarditis.
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:03.840]  Well, you know, Johnson and Johnson, the official risks are actually Guillain Bray syndrome
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:04.840]  and thrombosis.
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:09.040]  The myocarditis is with Pfizer and Moderna, but getting back to the series lawsuit basically
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:13.880]  said, listen, just transfer, you're asking Americans to take this, release your dossier
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.720]  and let 30 experts review the data independently.
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:20.360]  I am one of the 30 experts.
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:25.080]  In fact, I've been named lead of this public health review council for the Pfizer data.
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:31.280]  We were stunned, Alex, when the FDA asked the federal judge to delay the release until
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:38.120]  2076, 50, over 50 years from now, I can't hear a record skip at that point.
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:40.200]  Say that again, because the people thought this was a joke.
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:41.200]  This is real.
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:45.680]  Now confirmed, they have asked the federal court to wait 55 years, 55 years.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:52.040]  In fact, they've even extended it to 70 years to actually see what's going on with the vaccines.
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:53.600]  You can't make this up.
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:59.480]  The fact pattern is established that basically Pfizer and the FDA have told Americans there
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.760]  is no transparency here.
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:07.640]  Remember, transparency is a tenant of regulatory science.
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:14.360]  Now there's no transparency on a biologic product that we've just reviewed for America
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:15.360]  on safety.
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:17.440]  Remember, we're just as medical grand rounds, Alex.
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:21.160]  We review safety before efficacy.
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:24.880]  Explain what that means for people that don't have a medical degree.
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:28.680]  Our general principle is above all, do no harm.
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:31.240]  I don't care how good a product is.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:34.040]  If it's not safe, it doesn't move forward.
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:36.000]  I don't care how much you like your new car, Alex.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.040]  If it's not safe, it doesn't get driven off the lot.
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:40.200]  It's very important.
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:43.960]  Safety comes first for all consumer products.
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:49.080]  So importantly with drugs and vaccines, we do a medical grand rounds.
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:52.840]  What our government actually should be doing for America every month, we should have a
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:55.680]  review every month on safety and efficacy.
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:58.080]  We're now a year into the vaccine program.
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:36:59.320]  There's been no review.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:03.400]  So you can imagine when I go out and give a public program, there are thousands of people
[1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:08.000]  coming and I am just giving Americans the straight data on the vaccines.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.800]  And again, that was pre-designed, where they set it up, where there wouldn't be the reviews
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:12.800]  and all this.
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:16.360]  I mean, I think it's overwhelming evidence that this is a depopulation weapon.
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:21.560]  That's what Dr. Michael Yeadon, the former head chief scientist, Pfizer saying that's
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:23.280]  what a lot of other folks are saying.
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:27.120]  If you just extrapolate out, why are they doing this and it's attacking the ovaries
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:31.440]  and it's attacking young people and everybody and old people, I mean, what is the motive
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:32.940]  here?
[1:37:32.940 --> 1:37:37.840]  Well what knows, clearly the books are out there that are starting to again establish
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:38.840]  the fact pattern.
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:43.880]  This is probably one of the absolutely the biggest things in human history an investigative
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:45.880]  reporter could hotly pursue.
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:49.840]  As a doctor, I am simply just trying to grapple with the science.
[1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:51.320]  What you said is important.
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.920]  This is probably the biggest event in history so far in human activity.
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:38:00.240]  When all the dust settles and you're just going with the science, you're letting others
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.360]  politically look at what's happening, but the fact pattern and the consensus across
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:10.440]  the board now of intelligence agency heads and top scientist and virologist and is this
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:12.280]  is deliberate depopulation.
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:17.040]  When you look at it all and now they're still covering it up and pushing it more, it's pretty
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:18.040]  clear.
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.440]  Well, I tell you, it seems relatively clear that the best way to stay healthy is to stay
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:23.520]  free of any of these injections.
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:25.760]  Let's see what happens in terms of efficacy.
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:29.480]  People have asked me, Dr. McCullough, I took the vaccines.
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:31.080]  I was told I should do this.
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:32.440]  I knew it was patriotic.
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:35.280]  My doctors told me to take the vaccines.
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:38.960]  The presidents, well, we've had two presidents to say take the vaccines.
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:41.080]  Is there any benefit to the vaccines?
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:45.120]  Let's move to the 1040 paper from the IV Network.
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:47.480]  Look at the number of authors on this paper.
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:52.480]  This is the US National Institutes of Health and the best and the brightest academics who
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:55.840]  work in clinical trials on vaccines telling you the data.
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:01.200]  The title of the paper is the association between messenger RNA vaccination and COVID-19
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:03.360]  hospitalization and disease severity.
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:07.760]  Let me tell you that in this paper, they had 45% of the cases had Delta.
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:09.600]  It means 55% were pre-Delta.
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:12.640]  So these data always run in arrears.
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:20.760]  And the vaccines of those who took the vaccines, it was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization.
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:25.640]  Now because of differential testing, that means when someone comes in the hospital and
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:29.360]  they're vaccinated, they actually don't get a COVID test unless they suspect COVID.
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:33.000]  But if you're unvaccinated, they're get a test for no matter what medical condition
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.080]  I have.
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:39.000]  Differential testing exaggerates the effect size for hospitalization risk reduction.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.160]  It's clear.
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:44.760]  But having said that, I will tell you as a scientist that the vaccines were associated
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:46.760]  with some reduction in hospitalization.
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:51.440]  But people say, listen, I didn't take the vaccine and I'm willing to be hospitalized provided
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:52.440]  I survived.
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:55.680]  So let's look at the data as shown here.
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:03.160]  In figure three, one can see that in this figure, those patients in this table in fact
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:06.640]  had COVID-19 and they are being monitored for progression.
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.960]  And you can see here that the adjusted hazard ratio for progression of disease was 0.41.
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:19.080]  That's interpreted as a 59% reduction in the progression of severe COVID-19 in favor of
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:20.080]  the vaccine.
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.880]  The vaccines, in fact, did provide some protection.
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.840]  But I highlighted the bottom line, Alex.
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:30.800]  The bottom line is, do you survive or do you die and is there any impact to the vaccine?
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:32.000]  Here are the data.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:38.360]  Death occurred in nine of 142 fully vaccinated people who are hospitalized with COVID.
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:40.880]  And that percentage is 6.3%.
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:48.720]  And that's compared to 91 deaths out of 1055 unvaccinated for a percentage of 8.6%.
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:54.160]  And the p-value was 0.36, meaning it's not statistically significant.
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:58.840]  There is numerically a reduction in mortality with the vaccines.
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.400]  It was not statistically significant.
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:06.520]  But people have, you listen to Rachel Maddow, you listen to others, like the vaccine is
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:07.520]  a shield.
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:10.480]  You know, President Biden basically says, take the vaccine, otherwise it's going to
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:12.000]  be a long, dark winter.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:17.280]  Well, I'm telling you, these people took the vaccine and they had a mortality rate of 6.3%
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:18.280]  in the hospital.
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:23.040]  And I mean, Doc, what about all the studies I see, because again, I'm just doing a bull
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:29.080]  down in my own mind, where within three to six months, though, it's somehow turning off
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:30.520]  your immune system or reducing it.
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:36.280]  So it works a little bit up front like a therapeutic, but then it actually has a negative hangover.
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:40.200]  Remember, the vaccines are giving our immune system a lot of work to do.
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:44.760]  We now know this is an install of spike protein for over a year.
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:48.960]  You could imagine how the immune system is changing, trying to clear out this foreign
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:53.600]  protein from the human body from critical organs such as the brain, the heart, the
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:54.600]  bone marrow.
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:57.240]  Does that overseen some studies of increase of cancers after, because your immune system
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:01.280]  is basically exhausted, it's run a marathon, and then now it doesn't tackle the cancer,
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:02.600]  it doesn't tackle the next virus?
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:03.760]  No, I think it's too soon.
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:07.440]  I mean, two shots, I don't think it's going to be enough, a quantity or two.
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.240]  You said that six months ago, you said look out for the third, and now so many people
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:15.600]  have in the heart attacks and dying, young people, old people, you name it, it's the
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.120]  third shot or the booster.
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:20.640]  Well, the booster is where all the great concern is, because shot one, shot two, if you go
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:23.680]  a year, maybe you can clear out some of the spike protein.
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:29.040]  Shot three, now Israel and elsewhere, shot four and more, we know there is-
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:31.080]  Oh, the European country wants six?
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:32.080]  It'll be impossible.
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:37.640]  Alex, it's impossible to get rid of the Wuhan Chinese spike protein out of the body with
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:39.840]  injections that are more frequently than a year.
[1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:41.240]  Let's move on to the next paper.
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:42.240]  This is the big one.
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:44.040]  People have said, listen, show us-
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:45.040]  Oh my God, I'm going to break.
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:46.040]  Doc, stay there.
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:47.040]  The big one.
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:50.960]  When we come back with Dr. Peter McCullough straight ahead, this is life-saving, game-changing,
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:51.960]  real science.
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:52.960]  Again, have you just tuned in?
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:59.560]  Tell everyone you know, share this video.
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:03.080]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:08.360]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:10.840]  Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:16.760]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:23.840]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:26.080]  and American jobs.
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:28.320]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:32.400]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:38.280]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:41.520]  God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:45.720]  But I've got to tell you, out of everything I've done, resetwars is the most important,
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:52.320]  and it is now available now for the month of December, 2021, is here at resetwars.com.

[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:09.000]  The COVID-19 Face Diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:13.400]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:14.400]  in place.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:20.000]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:25.360]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:28.680]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:35.720]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:40.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:44.000]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.760]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:50.560]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:52.760]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:56.120]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:58.400]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:03.080]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:07.800]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:12.520]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.320]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:20.240]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:23.800]  the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:26.920]  Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:29.480]  been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:33.920]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, for a pound and I
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:36.320]  just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:40.120]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:47.440]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, we don't like that, you wouldn't believe
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:48.440]  it.
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:52.840]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:47:00.240]  fund us and don't want to share that's fine.
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:17.600]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:32.320]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest, I'm your host, Alex Jones, we were just talking about
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.840]  Israel on their 4th or 5th, what about the Netherlands, now planned six jabs for COVID.
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:40.000]  How did I know this 20 plus months ago?
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.520]  Bill Gates went on TV shows and said, oh, you'll need boosters forever and now they
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:47.960]  of course have announced that and Dr. McCullough, you said something during the break, I know
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:52.920]  you just want to go over the research science and just not get political, but you as a private
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:57.000]  citizen said, listen, and I'm just a layperson researching, that's what I've noticed.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:02.120]  All these countries, whether it's India or China or they all develop their own shots,
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:07.800]  not even mRNA, but are other forms of vaccines that do the same thing with spike protein
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:12.280]  when there's so many other ways to actually attack a virus, it's really like an evil
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:16.840]  intelligence behind this, when I say alien, I'm not saying flying saucers, I'm saying
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:19.960]  there's an anti-human force here you can't ignore.
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:27.640]  It cannot be healthy for the human body to take on spike protein and viral particles
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:33.880]  over and over again through injection, Alex, it cannot.
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:37.840]  Elaborate on that, you hit the break, you said the biggest part of your entire power
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  point is this.
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.480]  If you're on efficacy, let's move on to the cone paper.
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:48.000]  The title of this paper is SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection and death among U.S. veterans through
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:49.160]  2021.
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:56.520]  The sample size in this paper, Alex, 780,225 veterans represents 2.7% of the United States
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:58.400]  population.
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:06.480]  Overall vaccine efficacy over the course of the year started at 87.9%, it fell to 48.1%.
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:12.240]  So the vaccines did have some reported efficacy against mortality.
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:17.720]  Let's look at the figure starting at the right, and you can see here age over 65, there is
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:22.400]  a non-COVID mortality benefit for taking the vaccine, meaning selection bias.
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:26.320]  Those who take the vaccine are more likely to survive of any condition because they are
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.920]  more activated by the health, but look at the COVID curves, these are survival curves.
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:34.000]  There is a 12% benefit.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:39.080]  There is a 12% absolute risk reduction in survival a few months after the vaccines for
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:43.080]  those who have COVID attributable to the vaccine program.
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:47.240]  So I am telling you, as a fair balance review, you win the battle, but you lose the war.
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.840]  Well, there is a fair balance review.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:51.760]  There is a mortality benefit over age 65.
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:55.040]  When this first came along, people asked me a year ago, Dr. McCullough, who would the
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:56.240]  vaccines be best for?
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:00.800]  I said it would be our seniors if they were safe and effective, nursing home residents
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:02.040]  and there's nursing home workers.
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:04.880]  But now look under age 65 in the middle panel, Alex.
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:06.480]  Look at the difference between the two curves.
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:10.920]  The y-axis changes, you have to be a sharp scientist to get this.
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:11.920]  Look at the difference.
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.160]  There is a 1% mortality benefit.
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:17.520]  I showed this to Joe Rogan.
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:19.040]  He kind of squinted his eyes.
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:20.440]  He goes, that's not very much.
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:26.600]  I said, Joe, that's what this is all about, this huge push of the claim that the vaccines
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:28.560]  will save you from COVID.
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:30.480]  They'll save your life.
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:36.680]  If President Biden is going to be a dark winner of death, this is a 1% difference in the survival
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:37.680]  curve.
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:38.680]  Literally terrorizing people.
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:42.320]  And then what about the lawsuits I've seen filed against Pfizer by some of the lab people
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:46.640]  saying that they actually cooked the numbers and it's worse than what they're even saying.
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:50.000]  And also, is it true that they don't count people the first 14 days that get sick or
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  die after the shots?
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:54.720]  So if you add those numbers back in, now there isn't any efficacy to the shot.
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:59.160]  Well, we mentioned that the lawsuit, Aaron Ciri lawsuit, Pfizer and the FDA, somebody
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:03.120]  inside Pfizer got a little unstable and some of the documents were released.
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:08.120]  Within a few months, Pfizer knew of large numbers of deaths.
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:13.440]  They knew about thousands of individuals who had died shortly after administration of the
[1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:14.760]  Pfizer vaccine.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:17.360]  The back pattern is established.
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:21.760]  The question is, will there be any fairness in the courts and will there be any recognition
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:24.000]  of what's happening to Americans?
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.520]  That was the vaccination in the United States plummeted in April.
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:30.240]  Americans knew their loved ones were dying after the vaccine.
[1:51:30.240 --> 1:51:35.160]  Well, I mean, literally, I know so many people that have gotten deathly ill or died after
[1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:36.160]  they took it.
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:40.480]  And I have a family member very close to me that decided to be rebellious and go out
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:41.480]  and get it.
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:44.800]  And they have lost so much weight and they look like a concentration camp victim now.
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:48.840]  And I tears my guts out and they're sick all the time now.
[1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:50.360]  And they went and took two of the Pfizer shots.
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:52.040]  Well, Alex, what did they get out of it?
[1:51:52.040 --> 1:51:53.520]  What's the social contract?
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:54.520]  You know, a young person...
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:55.880]  This person's 13 years old.
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:51:56.880]  Right.
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:51:59.280]  A young person has no medical benefit from it.
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:02.400]  But so many young people tell me, listen, Dr. McCullough, I want to take the vaccine
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:03.400]  because I want to travel.
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:04.760]  I want to go to drill team.
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:05.960]  I want to be in school.
[1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:07.480]  What's the social contract?
[1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:12.600]  I can just tell you as a medical doctor now, if we go to this slide, it's an overlay on
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:19.920]  top of the Nordstrom paper, 1.6 million people in Sweden, half that took the vaccine, half
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:20.920]  that didn't.
[1:52:20.920 --> 1:52:23.520]  I can tell you this paper and others.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:29.000]  There's 22 studies showing these vaccines basically wane in terms of efficacy.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.400]  They wane in terms of the coverage.
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:32.400]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:35.520]  They wane over three to six months, three to six months.
[1:52:35.520 --> 1:52:41.080]  I came up on the physician's new server Medscape just yesterday that boosters may only last
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:42.080]  10 weeks.
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:43.840]  So listen, this isn't once every six months.
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:48.440]  I anticipate based on these data, it's going to go to every three months injection.
[1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:52.560]  And then it has a horrible spike protein colonization of your body.
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:55.800]  But again, Bill Gates said 20 months ago, I played the clip probably a hundred times
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:57.960]  that, oh, you're going to need boosters every year.
[1:52:57.960 --> 1:52:58.960]  This is going to be a new thing.
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:02.960]  And then I've got different government employees in the UK saying, oh, this will actually get
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:03.960]  rid of your immune system.
[1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:05.640]  You're going to need this all the time now.
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:06.640]  Ha, ha, ha.
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:07.640]  I mean, this is a plan.
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:10.040]  Well, people talk about moving the goalposts.
[1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:12.960]  In this case, the goalposts keep getting moving, moving in.
[1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:16.640]  Remember, it was going to be a vaccine should at least last a year, Alex.
[1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:18.560]  That was the minimum acceptance criteria.
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:19.560]  You said you're protecting 100%.
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:21.440]  That's what the Biden said.
[1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:26.160]  Right now, six months and now three months is very, very possible.
[1:53:26.160 --> 1:53:29.000]  We could end up in a three month duration.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.840]  Can you imagine having people's lives tethered to a vaccine administration every three months?
[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:35.840]  That means travel.
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:36.840]  That means school.
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:37.840]  That means employment.
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:38.840]  It's like, I would be able to go to the shopping center.
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:39.840]  I'm going to take my shot.
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:41.680]  I mean, we're, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:45.960]  So again, we know the big companies actually worried this, they battle planned this.
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:49.520]  I think the $64 trillion question is, what's coming next?
[1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:51.360]  How do they think they're going to get away with this takeover?
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:54.560]  Because we know it's tied to a global vaccine passport.
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.040]  It's tied to a carbon tax.
[1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:57.760]  It's tied to a social credit score.
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:00.040]  They now admit this, the DeBose Group.
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:01.040]  This is their takeover.
[1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:02.960]  And then it's going to destroy confidence in the government.
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:04.920]  It's going to destroy society.
[1:54:04.920 --> 1:54:08.080]  It's going to create the post-industrial world because so many people are going to be sick
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:11.360]  because short-term, we've got massive numbers of sick and dead.
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:14.520]  Imagine what the long-term effects, we have any ideas, Dr. McCullough, on what's going
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:15.520]  to happen there.
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:19.560]  You know, we have no idea, I mentioned, you know, the spike protein cannot be healthy for
[1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:25.720]  the human body, chronic neurologic, cardiac disease, we're talking neurogenesis such as
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:30.960]  various forms of dementia and cognitive decline, myocardial disease, heart failure.
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:35.120]  We know thromboembolic disease, all the people prone to blood cuts, can you imagine loading
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:40.640]  the body with progressive administrations of a thrombogenic protein and people taking
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:46.040]  on progressive risk of blood clots, no wonder the pilots don't want to get in the cockpit
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:48.160]  being in this chronically vaccinated state.
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.280]  They can't move.
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:53.360]  They are a fatal blood clot waiting to happen.
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:54.360]  It's insane.
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:57.680]  And then they order everybody to do it, knowing it's going to make a bunch of people sick,
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:01.760]  then more good people quit, which brings down civilization and no one ever points out that
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:05.280]  that's the real economic weapon, not just killing people, not just making them sick where the
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.280]  family's going to take care of them or burying them, but then you fire all your key people
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:11.000]  and civilization collapses.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:12.240]  And we're not anti-vax.
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:13.240]  Let me tell you what.
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:17.800]  We give meningococcal vaccines to every kid who goes to college each year.
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:20.320]  Perfectly safe, perfectly effective, zero deaths.
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:21.320]  I'm a doctor.
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:23.320]  I take hepatitis B influenza.
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:24.920]  I've taken all my vaccines.
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:26.320]  We're not anti-vaccine.
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:30.200]  Safe and effective vaccines are welcome additions to medicine.
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:31.920]  This one is vastly different.
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:33.920]  It's nowhere close to being safe.
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:35.680]  And I tell you, it's minimally effective.
[1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:36.960]  We went over the data today.
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:37.960]  Well, exactly.
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:42.720]  And if I break my leg, I want Western medicine and I know that vaccines are a real technology.
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:48.800]  The issue is, what can corrupt groups and organizations hijack and basically piggyback
[1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:49.800]  onto that?
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:51.440]  And now we're seeing a great example of this.
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:52.440]  It's everywhere.
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:54.160]  It's not just Pfizer, Moderna, J&J.
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:59.120]  We're talking Sinovac in East Asia, in India.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:02.200]  I was on the Indian news this week.
[1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:05.880]  I've had conference calls with Pakistan all over.
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:11.760]  People are being, basically their lives are being hijacked and put on the end of a hypodermic
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  needle.
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:14.440]  They're basically their survival.
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:19.200]  And I have so many people saying, listen, I have to earn a living, take care of my family.
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:21.400]  I know this vaccine can't possibly help me.
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:24.880]  I know this vaccine can damage me, but I have to take it to survive.
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:26.440]  And these governments are all doing the same thing.
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:29.960]  And I saw a video out of Russia where they're saying, hey, ours is a different shot.
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:30.960]  We're dying too.
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:32.760]  We're having blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:33.760]  Same thing everywhere.
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:34.760]  We're going to go to break.
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:38.720]  Remember, folks, it's your buying products at infowarstore.com, despite all the attacks
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:39.720]  that keep us on air.
[1:56:39.720 --> 1:56:43.000]  Plus, they're great products for yourself, your family, your body, your immune system.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:47.560]  X2, the purest iodine, Deep Earth Crystal Atomic iodine is 50% off.
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.280]  Back in stock, sold out for months.
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:52.960]  And vitamin mineral fusion, all the vitamins, the minerals, the chemino acids, great for
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:59.320]  adults, children, everybody, it is 50% off at infowarstore.com as well, until it sells
[1:56:59.320 --> 1:57:01.240]  out, which is going to sell out very, very quickly.
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:04.400]  But because it's so important, we're going to just sell it until it sells out.
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:08.800]  infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.080]  And doc, before I even did that plug, when you first came on, you saw, I had our iodine
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:13.880]  X2 sitting here.
[1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:16.560]  Coming up later, tell us a little bit about that, but you were saying people are doing
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.560]  amazing things with iodine.
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:20.920]  Idyne kills this bug on the spot.
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:26.560]  We'll talk about what people are doing nasally, but I mean, like even, even hydrogen peroxide
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:28.240]  here diluted is doing good, right?
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:31.600]  Just like hand sanitizer, whole Friday hand sanitizer kills the virus.
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:35.280]  We now know the virus is an infection in the nasal cavity.
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:39.080]  You've got to get something up in the nasal cavity to kill the virus.
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:41.160]  Taking pills doesn't cut that.
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:42.160]  We have to get prepared.
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:44.120]  Well, I'm going to understand this when we come back.
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:48.720]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:50.920]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:56.200]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to
[1:57:56.200 --> 1:57:58.400]  the new year at infowarstore.com.

[1:58:48.440 --> 1:58:52.400]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:58.200]  world government whose endgame once they get control is forced depopulation of the planet.
[1:58:58.200 --> 1:59:03.320]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you
[1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:07.320]  out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:08.840]  and your family are in.
[1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:10.960]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:18.320]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:20.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:24.160]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:25.160]  for us has been incredible.
[1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:29.360]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just info wars, but the entire
[1:59:29.360 --> 1:59:31.240]  country and the world of tyranny.
[1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:34.800]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:39.120]  And infowarstore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and
[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:40.320]  fund the tip of the spear.
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:41.520]  I will go down with the ship.
[1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:42.520]  I'm not going to back down.
[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:46.080]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:47.080]  you support us.
[1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:50.360]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:56.200]  Starting up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:22.920]  This is being done by design.
[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:25.200]  This is a depopulation weapon.
[2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:27.280]  It's a problem you can't ever fix.
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:32.200]  It just takes up all your rights with surveillance and control and then gives you injections
[2:00:32.200 --> 2:00:33.560]  race your immune system.
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:38.000]  The vaccines are now going to help you to get infected.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:42.640]  So the vaccines are doing the exact of what you're told.
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:48.960]  And this is in a Denmark study and it showed that for Omicron in particular, the vaccine
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:55.200]  efficacy turns negative after about 60 days, and negative vaccine efficacy means the vaccine
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:01:01.000]  is actually on the side of the virus, not protecting you from the virus.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:04.600]  As the public begins to get that, and as Laura Ingraham gets that.
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:06.880]  What's happened to your country?
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:10.080]  We have no rights whatsoever.
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:15.200]  What we have right now is some kind of a hybrid between the fascism and communism, medical
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:16.200]  tyranny.
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:22.080]  I didn't get up here and say all the things I said that came exactly true because I am
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:23.400]  Nostradamus.
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:28.840]  It's because it's a laid out enemy plan and they've been very public about it for decades,
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:33.800]  how the use of virus to do it, and they've war-gamed it hundreds of times I know of.
[2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:38.840]  We've covered more than 20 of those drills on air, like lockstep.
[2:01:38.840 --> 2:01:43.080]  Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:46.760]  activities stuck and even intensified.
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:51.440]  Citizens willingly gave up some of their sovereignty and their privacy, more paternalistic states
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:54.480]  in exchange for greater safety and stability.
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:02:00.160]  This heightened oversight took many forms, biometric IDs for all citizens, tighter regulations
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:04.360]  of industries whose stability was deemed vital to national interests.
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:10.160]  What is amazing about lockstep and what really raises eyebrows is on the very first page
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:15.480]  we see a bio leak out of China, why isn't that interesting?
[2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:20.080]  How do they know a bio leak would come out of China?
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:26.440]  Not only that, it says this pandemic that will set off the domino scenario of lockstep
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:28.680]  will first of all disrupt supply chains.
[2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:29.680]  Wow, amazing.
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:33.920]  In other words, they knew that there would be these disruptive shocks as the document
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:35.440]  calls it to supply chains.
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:40.080]  It says then as a result, flights will be shut down.
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:42.520]  China is key to this scenario.
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:45.920]  We see that there's a mandated global face mask.
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:51.080]  There are mandated temperature checks everywhere and all this does is hype up the hypochondria
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:53.120]  and everybody getting scared, right?
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:54.120]  Freaking out.
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:55.440]  This is the whole of 2020.
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:02:58.600]  There's mandates, pandemic mandates.
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:05.040]  As a result of this, biometric IDs will be necessary for all.
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:10.840]  We're not up here giving you our opinions on subjects like this.
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:15.200]  I can give you my opinions on the metaphysical, I can give you my opinions on life after death,
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:19.120]  I can give you my opinions on what my favorite foods are.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:21.680]  Those views all vary person to person.
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:26.000]  But what I'm talking about cut and dry is what's going on.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:29.160]  So agenda 21 was passed into global UN law.
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:32.360]  We didn't ever pass it here in the US, but George Herbert Walker Bush signed us on to
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:39.040]  it to put us under UN UNESCO law by executive fiat in 1992 and Rio de Janeiro.
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:44.800]  And by the year 2021, they were supposed to have launched the deindustrialization plan
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:50.520]  to cut off the carbon, to just bring in hell on earth, to collapse the third world, merge
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:52.120]  it with the first world.
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:57.720]  And by the year 2030 under agenda 2030, which is another public plan, that the world would
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:03.160]  be free of war and famine because the world would be at least 80% depopulated.
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:04.920]  We are eight years out from that.
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:08.920]  And in the past, I would have experts on it, scientists and researchers and people that
[2:04:08.920 --> 2:04:11.840]  worked in the federal government, the highest levels that were briefed on all this.
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:16.640]  And people are like, you know, that's crazy in 2005 or 2010 or 2015.
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:20.280]  Yeah, there'll be a world lockdown, we'll have to wear masks, they'll tell us we can't
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:23.760]  go out and go to ball games, they'll have to have a pass to travel.
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:27.080]  Yeah, Alex, that's not really going to happen.
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.680]  And now you see how quickly it is happening.
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:33.920]  And now you can see how eight years from now they plan to have 80% of people dead.
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:38.120]  This is all just a drill right now to lock us down to make sure we'll behave when they
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:57.960]  release the real bio weapons on us.
[2:04:57.960 --> 2:05:03.840]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:08.480]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making
[2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:13.240]  yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:18.080]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:19.080]  in stock.

[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:55.480]  of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com, 50% off for
[2:05:55.480 --> 2:05:56.480]  a limited time.
[2:05:56.480 --> 2:06:05.640]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[2:06:05.640 --> 2:06:07.760]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:13.240]  Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[2:06:13.240 --> 2:06:19.760]  It's Alex Jones, Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest in studio and I want everybody to take
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:25.800]  some time out to go to America out loud.com where you find all of his postings and a link
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:30.280]  to this PowerPoint presentation that he's been going over so you can show it to your
[2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:34.640]  friends, your family, your neighbors, you're also saying there's a medical association
[2:06:34.640 --> 2:06:40.160]  that's a good place to find it as well, the AAPS, the American Association of American
[2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:41.440]  Physicians and Surgeons.
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:42.440]  Right.
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:49.560]  So the PowerPoint is continuing medical education credits for physicians and it's highlighted,
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:55.080]  I was the closer at the annual scientific session of the meetings in October of this
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:57.200]  year, it's been subsequently updated.
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:00.880]  Many of the PowerPoints that I'm showing you actually are screenshots from America Loud
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:04.480]  Talk Radio, the McCullough report where I give a weekly report to America.
[2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:09.480]  I do what our federal agencies don't do, I show international collaboration, I bring
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:14.440]  people's ideas from all over the world, learning about how to treat this virus, how to defend
[2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:17.800]  ourselves and understanding vaccine safety and efficacy.
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:23.800]  Remember Alex, we have not had a single review from our agencies on how to treat the virus
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:29.080]  with multiple drugs and no review on vaccine safety and efficacy, none.
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:33.240]  And since when do you have a big deadly virus supposedly and they don't do any reviews and
[2:07:33.240 --> 2:07:34.240]  block therapeutics?
[2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:37.680]  I mean this, this is premonitivity evil.
[2:07:37.680 --> 2:07:40.800]  Well let's move on to the PowerPoints, Omicron on the move.
[2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:44.920]  This is America Loud Talk Radio, the McCullough report.
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:51.040]  And again, it's not a transformer, it's a great name, but Omicron is a virus and I want
[2:07:51.040 --> 2:07:54.400]  to move on to the next page, the next slide.
[2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:58.000]  This is an important paper by Venkata Krishnan, you have to follow this guy.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.760]  Venkata Krishnan is at a company called Inference and they're in Boston.
[2:08:02.760 --> 2:08:08.280]  They have over a million of these samples of people with the virus, they've sequenced
[2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:13.200]  it, they know everything about the virus in terms of its genomic sequence.
[2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:17.440]  Look at this beautiful diagram, I have to tell you what, this is art.
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:22.720]  You can see here all the different variants that we've dealt with, we've dealt with the
[2:08:22.720 --> 2:08:23.720]  alpha, beta, gamma.
[2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:25.760]  And is that what the virus looks like right there?
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:28.640]  No, this is the spike protein, this is the spike protein.
[2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:33.120]  Now you can see the Venn diagram of the overlap, there's not that much overlap.
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:36.520]  Look at the lower left, that is Omicron.
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:43.240]  Omicron has 26 unique mutations, unique that they basically weren't in the other strains
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:44.280]  of the virus.
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:46.320]  And then look at the receptor binding domain.
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:49.640]  That's at the top of the structure of the spike protein, the RBD.
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.680]  The receptor binding domain is where it locks into the human ACE2 receptor.
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:57.160]  This is how the virus injects itself into your cells.
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:01.320]  Mother nature has absolutely peppered the receptor binding domain.
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:04.640]  Look at it, it's almost as if it was carpet bombed with mutations.
[2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:10.520]  This is wonderful news for people because this means this virus, mother nature is taking
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:13.280]  the starch out of the spike protein.
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:18.160]  This spike protein was designed to be a killer because it could inject itself into cells
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:19.640]  using the ACE2 receptor.
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:22.680]  And now it's basically being bent, it's being crushed.
[2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:29.520]  Yes, it's actually being, in a sense, pummeled by mother nature's mutations.
[2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:34.160]  So mother nature is actually putting mutations in there so it cannot penetrate the body so
[2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:35.160]  much.
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:36.160]  So it's not so lethal.
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.720]  The great news, it's mutated, it's not as invasive.
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:40.360]  That is huge, let's put that back on screen again.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:44.000]  This is really important, this is important to understand, very important paper.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:50.160]  Again, if our CDC and FDA and NIH were worth their salt, they'd be showing America the
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:51.160]  data.
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:52.840]  You wouldn't have to rely on me, Alex.
[2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:53.840]  This is information.
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:59.200]  Look at that one hysterical one a month ago, the South African said this is like the cold,
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:03.320]  it looks like it's mutated, it looks like this is the answer to Delta, it looks like
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:04.880]  finally mother nature's defeated it.
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:08.360]  They took that spike, run for the hills, lock everything down, you're all dead, take more
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:09.360]  shots.
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:13.800]  I'm a chronic, I'm a chronic, meanwhile they do this.
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:18.720]  Meanwhile, this is actually the structure of the spike protein, far less deadly, but
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:20.880]  you can see there's wildly mutated.
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:24.840]  When I went on Fox News at Laura Ingraham, when this was breaking in, Laura, I said,
[2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:26.360]  Dr. McCullough, what do you think of this?
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:30.320]  I said, you know, it almost looks like an evolutionary mistake.
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:35.920]  That the idea here is that the virus would want to invade the body and have some luxurious
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  replication.
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:41.560]  And in fact, it, from an evolutionary perspective, it took a starch out of the receptor binding
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:42.560]  domain.
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:46.640]  What I didn't know at that time is the virus had learned how to replicate 70 times faster
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:47.640]  than it used to.
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:51.040]  Some people have said that maybe another group or organization wanted to stop this and they
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:52.040]  made this.
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:55.960]  Well, it's because of in the receptor binding domain, there's an insertion, it's like,
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:00.760]  wait a minute, when there's mutations, there can be deletions, that's common, there can
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:05.440]  be substitutions as common, but inserting some new code, how could that happen?
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:08.280]  And in fact, it happened, it's a short insertion.
[2:11:08.280 --> 2:11:16.400]  I think that the most spous theory is that there was a co-resident organism, an RNA virus
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:20.320]  in the human body, and in fact, there was a little mix up between one virus and another.
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:21.320]  But there's an insertion.
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:23.640]  So the virus has got together.
[2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:24.760]  That's one theory.
[2:11:24.760 --> 2:11:29.920]  There's clearly an insertion of some nucleic acids that didn't exist in the receptor binding
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:36.000]  domain, but the point of the kind of Christian paper is that it clearly is a different strain.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:37.200]  Omicron is very different.
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:41.160]  But this could be somebody in the lab trying to stop this.
[2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:42.160]  It's possible.
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:44.480]  I mean, I can't rule out any possibility.
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.760]  You're saying all of the mother nature did it, just knock the tip off this thing?
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:50.600]  Knock the tip off it, knock the tip off the spear.
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:54.840]  The good news, I'm telling you as a doctor, I see an examined patient, I've handled now
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:11:58.600]  dozens and dozens of Omicron patients, it's a milder syndrome.
[2:11:58.600 --> 2:12:01.120]  It is clearly a milder syndrome.
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:07.520]  We don't have this vicious clinical set of features that we used to see with the Delta
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:08.520]  variant.
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:09.520]  There's no doubt about it.
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:10.520]  Wow.
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:15.240]  Now, what I want to show you is let's move on to what Denmark is observing with Omicron.
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:16.400]  This is important.
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:22.960]  This is dated from a December 13th report, status of the SARS-CoV-2 variant in Denmark,
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:24.040]  the Omicron.
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:31.960]  Look at the right-hand column, Alex, 79% of the cases of Omicron is in the fully vaccinated.
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  Wow.
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:34.680]  In the fully vaccinated.
[2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:36.400]  And their data are clean.
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:37.400]  Their data are clean.
[2:12:37.400 --> 2:12:40.240]  Now, the same thing is true in the United States now.
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:42.240]  The same thing is true in South Africa.
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:49.720]  In fact, in Germany now, reported on one of the news sites, 94% of Germans with Omicron
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:50.720]  are fully vaccinated.
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:53.360]  We cannot blame the unvaccinated.
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:57.680]  This idea that it's going to be a dark winter for the vaccinated.
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:02.440]  This idea of a dark, deadly winter for the unvaccinated, wait a minute, I'm not vaccinated.
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:03.880]  I had the Alpha variant.
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:05.560]  Now I've had the Omicron variant.
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:08.760]  Honestly, I feel like I've had a booster.
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:10.360]  I feel like I have a booster.
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:11.920]  It was a very mild syndrome.
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:18.280]  I don't want anybody here who's fully vaccinated or those who are recovered to be fearful of
[2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:19.280]  Omicron.
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:21.760]  Omicron will be like a booster to them.
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:23.280]  Now here are the data.
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:24.880]  Let's bring up the next slide.
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:27.440]  You can see it on the overhead looking down.
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:29.320]  This is from what's called Nowcast.
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:32.160]  I want people to know that the CDC is not all bad.
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:37.000]  The CDC is actually using forecasting data to tell us what's going to happen.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:38.280]  So this is Nowcast.
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:41.560]  This is a forecast of where things were going to be.
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:43.920]  It's a big agency, some good, some bad.
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:47.840]  It's the boards that they're selecting and packing to actually go against the agency
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:50.160]  because, right, it was a CDC and FDA.
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:53.600]  They've been resigning and saying no, no, no, and then they just select and put in their
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:55.640]  own new board that says yes, yes, yes.
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:13:56.640]  You're right.
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:00.600]  Listen, I did my residency at University of Washington in Seattle and the doctors listening
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:04.440]  to this will understand that is the top place in medicine surgery to change.
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:06.280]  Just ahead of Harvard.
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:11.120]  Many of my fellow graduates from University of Washington became CDC officers.
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:13.600]  I went on to University of Michigan and trained in epidemiology.
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:14.600]  We're the same.
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:16.240]  We have the same competencies.
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:18.440]  We have the same scientific skills.
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:21.240]  We have the same sets of commitment.
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:25.120]  But you get overwritten by the political appointees.
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:30.600]  There are clearly forces at work trying to silence any review like we're doing right
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.080]  now for America, Alex.
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:35.840]  But this is from Nowcast predicting where Omicron would be.
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:41.320]  Now the data on sequencing will come through our centers for community health weeks later.
[2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:43.480]  So we actually operate off of forecasts.
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:48.120]  They had forecasted now that we would be at about 73% Omicron.
[2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:52.160]  They've recently just down adjusted that a little bit, but my point is it's not bad.
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:54.160]  It's not a bad prediction.
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:55.840]  In fact, that's what we're seeing in my practice.
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:14:59.640]  My practice right now, I estimate it's about 73% Omicron.
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:04.360]  I am sleeping a lot easier at night because I am not worried about people ending up on
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.200]  the ventilator and being hospitalized.
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:08.480]  I mean, this is a different syndrome.
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:10.000]  We're getting people through this at home.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.800]  The South Africans are telling us that hospitalizations have plummeted.
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.080]  They're saying almost no deaths.
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:17.080]  Absolutely.
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:23.560]  There's absolutely nothing to be concerned of with respect to an average person who we
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:24.560] ...
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.520]  So the good news is Omicron is defeating the previous variants, and it's not as bad.
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:29.520]  It's a lot better.
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:34.120]  And that's, again, God, or whoever engineered this, now that we have God-like powers, to
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:36.520]  basically block the previous more deadly strain.
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:37.520]  And it's true.
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:40.760]  It's blocking it through immunologic mechanisms.
[2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:42.960]  So I can tell you, I didn't have Delta.
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:43.960]  I didn't have it.
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:44.960]  I was in research.
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:45.960]  I knew I had Alpha.
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:47.360]  I knew that I had Omicron.
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:49.520]  I am now back protected against Delta.
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:52.880]  If I get on the plane on the way home and somebody has Delta and they cough at my face,
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:53.880]  I have protection.
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:54.880]  I mean, this is amazing.
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:55.880]  I'm going to run back.
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:15:56.880]  Stay with us.
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:15:57.880]  This is amazing.
[2:15:57.880 --> 2:16:01.360]  Not just across the United States, but across the world, you see it on the sides of barns
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:06.000]  and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  was right.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:11.680]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:15.200]  of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:16.200]  Reset.
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:20.640]  And so now, Info Wars' credibility is stronger than it's ever been, and the globalists are
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:24.640]  now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:25.640]  do that.
[2:16:25.640 --> 2:16:28.080]  So, you've invested in Info Wars over the years.
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:32.480]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture, or everything
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:35.360]  you've done in the past is for nothing.
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:38.880]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:45.120]  You have done incredible things, and I'm telling you now, going into 2022, Info Wars has made
[2:16:45.120 --> 2:16:48.680]  your underages to run an operation, and we need more funds in.
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:49.680]  So, it's a 360-win.
[2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:53.120]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:54.120]  much more.
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:57.120]  So, please go to InfoWars.com.
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:04.040]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:09.080]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:13.280]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:15.040]  It's done by design.
[2:17:15.040 --> 2:17:21.080]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:25.120]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:28.960]  Group, the Trilateral Commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:30.960]  and the Rockefellers.
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:35.360]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't
[2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:36.360]  exist.
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:40.960]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, showing the steering committee,
[2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:45.800]  this Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:50.640]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:54.640]  the fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:17:54.640 --> 2:17:55.640]  We do expose them.
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:17:56.640]  We can beat them easily.
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:00.040]  This is a great sponsor.
[2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:04.280]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:05.280]  satellite phone.

[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:10.320]  you can see the sky.

[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:32.200]  These aren't.
[2:18:32.200 --> 2:18:33.560]  And the calls are free when folks call you.

[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:42.320]  or traced.
[2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:43.320]  And I keep one in my car.
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:46.440]  I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:47.440]  don't work.
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:48.440]  They work.
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:56.560]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-41955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[2:18:56.560 --> 2:18:59.400]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:03.880]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:09.680]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:13.360]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:18.280]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:22.520]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:26.120]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:19:26.120 --> 2:19:29.400]  That's why everybody should visit Infowarsstore.com.

[2:19:50.960 --> 2:20:18.400]  It's amazing.
[2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:29.760]  Our guest is going to be joining us with a little prelude of the interview she did with
[2:20:29.760 --> 2:20:34.360]  Robert Malone here today that's going to air after Joe Rogan airs his interview that taped
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:35.840]  yesterday because we're not trying to scoop him.
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:40.720]  Joe really actually doesn't care, but we're just going to air it after his comes out as
[2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:41.720]  well.
[2:20:41.720 --> 2:20:45.400]  And again, please don't forget we have the Sunday edition of this weekday broadcast 4
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:47.400]  to 6 p.m. Central.
[2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:51.680]  Doc, every time you come on the show, and I appreciate it last year, you don't want to
[2:20:51.680 --> 2:20:52.680]  bring this up.
[2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:55.880]  You don't want to get into specifics, and I understand that.
[2:20:55.880 --> 2:21:02.040]  But you have the largest medical group, or one of the largest in Texas, correct or wrong,
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:07.000]  literally trying to silence you for going around and speaking out and taking action.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:10.040]  So the intimidation and the persecution is just insane.
[2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:11.840]  So I brought this up.
[2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:15.400]  You have some pretty big legal fees like anybody else fighting tyranny, and folks that want
[2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:20.400]  to help you out with that, and I'm told it's going well, that's good news, how do people
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:21.400]  go and make a donation?
[2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:26.200]  You know, it's been a six-month battle, and my motion basically says in the case that
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:32.000]  this is a strategic lawsuit against my public participation in a topic of importance.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:38.400]  What can be more important to America than getting analysis and review on COVID-19?
[2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:43.840]  I'm a frequent contributor to Fox News, Newsmax, and I'm straight with America on the data.
[2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:45.560]  I'm being sued because of it.
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:50.240]  Go to GiveSendGo, and I have a crowdfunding.
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:51.240]  It is validated.
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:53.280]  I'm telling you, when you go to the site, you'll see me.
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:54.780]  I'm on a stage.
[2:21:54.780 --> 2:21:55.960]  That's a legitimate site.
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:21:59.760]  All the other GoFundMe's out there are fake ones, and they are fraudulent.
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:00.760]  This is the real deal.
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:03.320]  GiveSendGo, all right, we've used them, and I'm going to thank the listeners for their
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:04.320]  support.
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:08.280]  It's really, I mean, you're talking to hundreds of thousands of people a month in person, millions
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:09.280]  every day on air.
[2:22:09.280 --> 2:22:10.280]  We've got to keep you on air.
[2:22:10.280 --> 2:22:11.880]  So let's put that GiveSendGo back up.
[2:22:11.880 --> 2:22:17.040]  Go there, type in Dr. Peter McCullough, help Dr. Peter McCullough with legal IT travel
[2:22:17.040 --> 2:22:21.200]  cost, and then when you donate, that is the legitimate spot right there where you see
[2:22:21.200 --> 2:22:22.200]  $102,000 raised.
[2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:26.120]  I can tell you to travel around and do this full time and fight with these lawyers.
[2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:28.120]  I would imagine that's only scratched the surface.
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:29.520]  That's why your goal is up there.
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:31.280]  So thank you all for the support.
[2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:34.480]  Your work is amongst the most important out there, so hope people go donate there right
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:35.480]  now.
[2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:38.600]  Okay, well, this is a shorter segment, long segment coming up.
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:40.960]  Let's plow back into your big PowerPoint.
[2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:43.760]  But again, people need to check out for themselves.
[2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:48.240]  Well we've been in the Omicron outbreak, this part of the presentation, and look at the
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:49.240]  news cycle.
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:51.520]  This just popped up yesterday.
[2:22:51.520 --> 2:22:55.400]  Hundreds of Houston hospital staffers contract COVID.
[2:22:55.400 --> 2:22:59.160]  Those left at the work face burden of shortages.
[2:22:59.160 --> 2:23:01.920]  This is Houston Methodist Hospital.
[2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:07.440]  Houston Methodist Hospital, considered the top ranked hospital in Texas, took the most
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:13.120]  aggressive stance chargers and their employees, mandating, in fact, forcing the vaccines on
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:14.120]  them.
[2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:18.200]  And people who had allergies, people who could not take the vaccines medically, they fired
[2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:19.200]  them.
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:24.640]  And it was a brutal, an unbelievable assault on their careers, destroyed the careers of
[2:23:24.640 --> 2:23:26.920]  very dedicated professionals.
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:31.840]  Some of these were frontliners who in the first waves of the pandemic sacrificed themselves.
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:37.400]  And in fact, they ultimately were fired by Houston Methodist lead attorney Jared Woodfill,
[2:23:37.400 --> 2:23:39.680]  put a lawsuit against Houston Methodist.
[2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:42.880]  It went at one of the lower courts and then appellate court.
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:44.280]  The case went nowhere.
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:46.160]  There's no fairness in the court.
[2:23:46.160 --> 2:23:49.920]  And now look what Houston Methodist gets for this action.
[2:23:49.920 --> 2:23:55.280]  They had a completely vaccinated workforce, Alice, and they have hundreds of employees
[2:23:55.280 --> 2:23:56.720]  now with Omicron.
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:23:58.640]  Who's got egg on their face now?
[2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:04.280]  They fired good employees and now they're loaded with COVID-19 in their fully vaccinated
[2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:05.280]  workforce.
[2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:10.920]  This week, saying that you were three times more likely to get Omicron, Omicron, I always
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:13.400]  say it, if you had had two of the Pfizer's.
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:14.400]  Is that accurate?
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:15.400]  Or do you not know about that study?
[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:20.120]  There are a variety of studies showing a negative vaccine efficacy, meaning the vaccine makes
[2:24:20.120 --> 2:24:22.680]  it worse in terms of getting COVID-19.
[2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:25.200]  I am not so sure that biologically happens.
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:29.480]  I think it has to do with proportionality on who has natural immunity, who doesn't.
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:30.480]  So I'm not willing to go there yet.
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:32.160]  Well, obviously, it also wears down your immune system.
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:36.200]  And I've seen the study for years that the flu shot might actually help sometimes, but
[2:24:36.200 --> 2:24:38.320]  then it lowers your immunity the next year to a regular flu.
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:39.320]  Okay.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:42.840]  The evidence that it, quote, wears down your immune system has to do with reactivation
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:43.840]  diseases.
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:45.560]  And this is fair for Americans to know this.
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:52.240]  There is a real rate of having shingles after the respiratory infection and after vaccination.
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:56.480]  Also having Epstein-Barr virus reactivation disease.
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:03.440]  These are examples of the immune system changing and then allowing expression of a resident
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:06.960]  virus like the Barracella Zoster or Epstein-Barr virus.
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:10.360]  In layman's terms, because I'm not stupid and I barely follow that, explain it to me
[2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:11.760]  like I'm five years old.
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:14.800]  The body carries about 10% of its DNA.
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:15.960]  That's not human.
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:19.360]  That we carry DNA from the stigial viral infections.
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:23.400]  If we get installed with the Herpes families of virus, they're there forever.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:25.760]  The same thing is true with Epstein-Barr virus.
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:28.120]  And so it turns out that we keep these in check.
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:29.840]  We keep these suppressed.
[2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:34.320]  And when the immune system is weakened, then there is the expression, for instance, of
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:35.320]  shingles.
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:36.320]  And that's exactly it.
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:40.120]  If we carry a genetic library so we can defeat it when we run into it again, but when we
[2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:42.920]  get really run down, that stuff can come back out.
[2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:44.400]  That's a fair interpretation.
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:45.400]  Wow.
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:46.400]  We're pretty amazing.
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:47.400]  God made us pretty amazing.
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:51.040]  I tell you, the body is an amazing, amazing gift.
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:57.160]  And I think the body can fight off the vaccine, the installation of a messenger RNA or adenoviral
[2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:00.840]  DNA and the spike protein provided we don't subscribe to boosters.
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:05.360]  I think a lot of this was just was a bad move.
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:06.360]  People took the vaccines.
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:08.480]  They didn't ask what's in them.
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:09.720]  They did it patriotically.
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:11.240]  And there's a lot of remorse out there.
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:13.560]  I don't have too many patients who want boosters.
[2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:17.200]  Back to the genetic memory situation with viral load.
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:21.960]  Is that why Native Americans, they say, had never really been in touch with smallpox?
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:26.360]  And so even people that never had smallpox as Europeans still had some of a genetic memory
[2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:27.360]  to it.
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:28.360]  That's why they were least likely to die.
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:30.120]  You know, I'm not so sure about that.
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:36.960]  There are great questions that arise regarding predilection for various diseases and immunity.
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:40.120]  One of the things that's come out of this, people look back at the Spanish flu and they've
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:44.680]  taken samples out and asked the question, you know, what's the durability of immunity
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:46.120]  on a specific strain?
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:47.680]  And the answer is forever.
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:50.160]  So believe it or not, you took Delta.
[2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:52.040]  You will never get Delta again.
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:54.000]  But it's possible you could get Omicron.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:57.680]  But the immunity on the strain specific immunity is very strong.
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:03.640]  But that makes me think Omicron is made in the lab because it actually helps block the
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:06.360]  other one, helps you genetically be superior.
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:07.360]  It takes over.
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:09.600]  It's a lot less lethal.
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:13.000]  And then it is a new virus because the old immunity isn't working.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:14.760]  And it's replicating 70 times faster.
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:16.200]  I mean, that's the thing.
[2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:18.920]  Now if we have an infection, let's bring up the next slide.
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:21.440]  If we have an infection of Omicron.
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:25.980]  And let's say I have an 80-year-old person who has multiple problems.
[2:27:25.980 --> 2:27:29.040]  One of the tools I need is monoclonal antibodies.
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:32.080]  These are fully emergency use authorized products.
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:33.080]  They work.
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  They're safe.
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:36.920]  I've been relying on these in my practice the entire time.
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:39.480]  We used to use lily or Regeneron.
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:41.560]  Those are two combination products.
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:46.040]  But now suddenly we're out of ammo against Omicron in a serious infection.
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:49.080]  Let's say we do have a patient with pulmonary symptoms.
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:52.560]  I need a monoclonal antibody and look at Joe Ledappo.
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:53.760]  He's on our team.
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:57.280]  He's the Surgeon General now of Florida, brought in by Rhonda Santis.
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:59.400]  He's an academic physician like I am.
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:01.000]  Joe and I have published together.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:02.600]  He is from UCLA.
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:03.720]  He's the real deal.
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:04.760]  And look what he's saying.
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:10.280]  The Florida Surgeon General claims that Feds are preventing COVID-19 antibody treatments.
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:12.000]  Wow.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:17.480]  It's absolutely stunning to think that we've had, since May, we've had the GlaxoSmithKline
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:19.880]  product, which does work against these strains.
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:21.680]  It was designed with an antibody.
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:23.200]  But isn't that the same story doc?
[2:28:23.200 --> 2:28:27.000]  I mean, like they try to block ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and all of this.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.200]  They just, anything that's good, they block it.
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:30.720]  It's a cohesive pattern.
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:32.560]  That's exactly right.
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:37.720]  Blocking through a variety of statements and mechanisms, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin,
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:42.800]  pterompudesanide, colchicine, I had a patient actually yesterday blocking colchicine in
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:45.880]  Dallas, one of the pharmacists blocking colchicine to a patient.
[2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:46.880]  Well, stay there.
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:50.600]  We got to talk about blocking therapeutics and now monoclonial antibodies.
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:57.200]  Dr. Peter McCullough, stay with us.
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:02.080]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:04.040]  the globalists are doing right now.
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:05.760]  This is their big offensive.
[2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:07.200]  This is their takeover.
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:11.200]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[2:29:11.200 --> 2:29:15.240]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:16.240]  in the open.
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:20.720]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:25.000]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:28.280]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:32.960]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,

[2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:24.840]  chagamush or bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, then it's got added magnesium
[2:30:24.840 --> 2:30:30.720]  and potassium for electrolytes, it's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:33.400]  chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:37.480]  It even tastes better than the last formula, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:30:37.480 --> 2:30:43.720]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[2:30:43.720 --> 2:30:44.720]  and dissolvability.
[2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:48.320]  You're going to love this, and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body,

[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:00.880]  First thing I do is about victory for humanity.
[2:31:00.880 --> 2:31:06.120]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[2:31:06.120 --> 2:31:08.680]  Well, that's why resetwar.com is so important.
[2:31:08.680 --> 2:31:14.560]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:21.640]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[2:31:21.640 --> 2:31:23.880]  and American jobs.
[2:31:23.880 --> 2:31:26.120]  It is the true digital economy.
[2:31:26.120 --> 2:31:31.160]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:36.920]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:39.360]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[2:31:39.360 --> 2:31:43.520]  But I've got to tell you, out of everything I've done, resetwar is the most important,
[2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:50.160]  and it is now available, now that the month of December 2021 is here, at resetwar.com.
[2:31:50.160 --> 2:31:54.040]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwar.com.
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:31:56.840]  The globalist fear this information.
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:03.480]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:04.480]  happening in the atmosphere.
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:08.800]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments
[2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:13.360]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:18.320]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:23.640]  So, yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[2:32:23.640 --> 2:32:27.000]  back in the 70s, 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:30.160]  really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate change.
[2:32:30.160 --> 2:32:36.040]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[2:32:36.040 --> 2:32:39.960]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:40.960]  They have.
[2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:43.120]  Weather control trees from 1979.
[2:32:43.120 --> 2:32:46.480]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[2:32:46.480 --> 2:32:51.040]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists wanted a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:53.760]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:32:53.760 --> 2:32:58.440]  So, yes, man-made climate change is real.
[2:32:58.440 --> 2:33:09.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:16.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:33:16.320 --> 2:33:21.320]  the Info War.
[2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:24.680]  Well, there in the break, I just talked to my old friend Joe Rogan, and his Dr. Robert
[2:33:24.680 --> 2:33:28.560]  Malone interview just dropped on Spotify.
[2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:33.560]  That means we're going to release today at man.video, our commercial-free hour-and-a-half
[2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:35.120]  Dr. Robert Malone interview.
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:39.840]  The Christy Lee did right out there in the studio this morning at its bombshell as well,
[2:33:39.840 --> 2:33:45.400]  so that will be out in a few hours at man.video for you to share with the world.
[2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:48.360]  Dr. Peter McCullough is here.
[2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.640]  He was trying to finish up a key point during the break, and then I wanted to just talk
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:54.760]  about some of the censorship issues, some of the things that are happening, but we were
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:34:00.960]  ending off with confirmed, I remember learning this months ago from some of the folks in
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:05.640]  Texas running monoclonial operations that, indeed, they were already starting to ration
[2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:09.080]  it, that they were giving them paperwork saying, don't give it to white people who they're
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:10.080]  not at risk.
[2:34:10.080 --> 2:34:14.000]  Now, in Minnesota, put out a list saying, no, we don't give it to whites, they're not
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  at risk.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:19.880]  They are rationing, but then we learn that confirming with a surgeon general who's very
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:24.720]  respected of Florida, should be our national surgeon general, that, indeed, they are blocking
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:25.720]  this.
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:28.920]  This is a big, big deal, and you were saying during the break that that's dead on what
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:33.760]  we were talking about before break, that it's the same story on everything that is either
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:41.200]  pharmaceutical situation that is a therapeutic or even out of mother nature.
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:45.880]  Yeah, it's clearly cohesive, the monoclonal antibodies are safe and effective.
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:48.840]  We need to look at Sotirivimab, GlaxoSmithKline.
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:54.400]  We need to have it stocked in every major ER and urgent care center, senior home.
[2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:57.840]  Let's move on to who took the vaccines in the United States.
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:34:58.840]  Let's bring this slide up.
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:01.600]  This is CDC from October 25th.
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:05.080]  It's clear Americans did their job as citizens.
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:11.180]  We had 220.5 million people through October 25th took at least one dose of the vaccines.
[2:35:11.180 --> 2:35:13.720]  A million, 330 million people in the United States.
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:16.760]  This cannot be a crisis of the unvaccinated.
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:17.760]  It cannot.
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:20.720]  We have 110 million individuals who did not take the vaccine.
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:25.320]  The CDC tells us 146 million of us have already had COVID-19, like you and me.
[2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:27.680]  The bottom line is America has been covered.
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:30.800]  The vaccine program basically has been exhausted.
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:33.200]  It's failed as a public health measure.
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:36.640]  And then trying to blame unvaccinated is a fraud.
[2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:37.640]  It's fraudulent.
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:38.840]  It's untrue.
[2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:42.120]  It's pejorative and it's divisive at this point in time.
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:43.120]  That's dangerous.
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:45.400]  There's been violence against the unvaccinated now.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:47.520]  And family members have taken this up.
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:53.120]  Do you know family members actually blame other family members for spread of the virus?
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:57.760]  Family members actually prohibit other family members from attending gatherings at Thanksgiving
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:35:58.760]  and Christmas.
[2:35:58.760 --> 2:36:03.960]  What I'm telling Americans is that if people don't have symptoms, it's fine to get together.
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:09.280]  But like any other time, if you have symptoms, that's your cue to stay away.
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:10.640]  Now what do you do if you have symptoms?
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:12.200]  Let's bring up the next slide.
[2:36:12.200 --> 2:36:18.520]  These are the two seminal papers I published leading the world in treating COVID-19.
[2:36:18.520 --> 2:36:20.640]  And they operate on these important principles.
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:23.540]  We basically say, listen, this is a mass casualty event.
[2:36:23.540 --> 2:36:25.640]  We use the precautionary principle.
[2:36:25.640 --> 2:36:32.520]  We look for drugs with signals of benefit and acceptable safety and put them into combinations.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:36.640]  And we've done this from the very beginning, and I want to show you the reason why.
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:40.040]  This is the conceptualization of the virus.
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:45.840]  I told Americans this in the U.S., historic U.S. Senate hearings, November 19th of 2020,
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:53.120]  that the virus has three major phases, viral replication, cytokine storm, and thrombosis.
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:54.960]  No single drug is going to handle this.
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:58.960]  People wanted to put hydroxychloroquine on a pedestal, or ivermectin, or even the monoclonal
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:36:59.960]  antibodies.
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:00.960]  No.
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:02.960]  It's called viral replication.
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:03.960]  Now enter omicron.
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:08.360]  Omicron now is replicating 70 times faster than the other versions.
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:12.600]  It's all about viral replication, and we can get after it early.
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:15.320]  Where is it replicating in the human body?
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:16.480]  Let's get to this.
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:21.960]  It's replicating in the nose, and I want to let you know this analysis by Chopra colleagues
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:25.600]  looked at viral cydel agents in the nose.
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:28.680]  What can we spray up in the nose to kill the virus, Alex?
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:35.120]  And I can tell you, it is extraordinary the findings of these authors and others indicating
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:37.600]  that almost anything will kill the virus.
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:39.240]  So iodine does.
[2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:42.240]  So does hydrogen peroxide.
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:45.800]  So does colloidal silver.
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:47.800]  So does various forms of ozone.
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:49.840]  The virus is killed easily.
[2:37:49.840 --> 2:37:53.120]  The nose and the nasopharynx is a replication factory.
[2:37:53.120 --> 2:37:55.080]  That's where the fever is coming from.
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:37:57.400]  That's where all the cytokines is coming from the nose.
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:00.200]  So that's where it's first getting its beach head.
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:01.200]  It's getting its beach head.
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:06.600]  In fact, with Omicron, that's pretty much its entire campsite as it attacks the body,
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:09.720]  and it can't go anywhere because it's up in the nose.
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:12.200]  And it's very important for people to realize this.
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:13.720]  It's not a hand infection.
[2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:16.520]  We've seen a preoccupation with hand sanitizer.
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:17.520]  I see it in my house.
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:19.840]  I keep telling people, listen, it's not on the hands.
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:20.840]  It's in the air.
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:21.840]  We're breathing it in.
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:24.600]  So let's talk about that because I know, I mean, where do people find or who do they
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:25.600]  talk to to make sure?
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:27.440]  Obviously, you need to dilute iodine.
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:29.280]  You need to dilute hydrogen peroxide.
[2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:32.800]  You want to, I guess, you know, the salts you put in the neti pots that I was reading
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:35.200]  in studies that those are good every day.
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:37.360]  I mean, this is something everybody's been doing anyways.
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:41.840]  When I forget to use a neti pot, I mean, I feel it when I do use it, Austin's got a
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:42.840]  lot of allergies.
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.400]  Then when I forget, I have big problems.
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  Everybody really should be what?
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:48.720]  Neti potting every day.
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:49.720]  I can tell you right now.
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:50.720]  Where's the netilizer?
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:51.720]  What's better?
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:57.280]  Here right now, there are so many different ways to kill the virus in the nose that the
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:01.200]  general principles are, if it stings or hurts, it's too strong, Alex.
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:06.240]  It takes almost anything you can do is going to kill the virus.
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:10.400]  Here is an overlay that I want to give credit to two dentists.
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:14.640]  One is Dr. Bernadine in Dallas and one is Dr. Paul Gossett, who was just hospitalized
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:15.640]  with COVID himself.
[2:39:15.640 --> 2:39:16.640]  Bless his heart.
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:19.240]  In Chicago, Paul texted me this morning, he's getting in the hospital.
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:20.240]  Thank the God.
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:21.440]  He didn't go on the ventilator.
[2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:24.920]  He had a surgery treatment, pulled him through, but the bottom line is this is just one of
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:25.920]  the many recipes.
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:31.760]  You can go on America Loud Talk Radio, McCullough Report, and find this one on association American
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:32.760]  Physician Surgeons.
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:34.120]  There's also other slides.
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:36.440]  I can tell you right now, you can write this down.
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:41.960]  Take Havadone iodine, the typical brown iodine, half a teaspoon, and a shot glass of water,
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:43.080]  and you got it.
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:50.080]  It's basically 1.5 cc of water, and then look at that bulb syringe, that pediatric bulb
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:51.520]  syringe, or spray bottle.
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:56.840]  You got to go over the sink, spray a decent amount of natural, sniff it back, and then
[2:39:56.840 --> 2:39:57.840]  spit it out.
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:01.880]  If you're going to nebulizer or use a nutty pot or a saline wash system, that's fine as
[2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:02.880]  well.
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:05.320]  But it literally has to get up in the nose and back in the throat and spit it out.
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:08.400]  You got to choke a little bit, but that's a sign that you're zapping the virus.
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:11.040]  It's a few drops of iodine and like a shot glass of water.
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:17.840]  It basically, if it's the consistency of like dark tea, that's basically going to do it.
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:19.280]  And then here's the pivotal trial.
[2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:21.040]  This is what I want people to understand.
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:27.600]  This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, and give credit to Choudhury et al.
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:28.600]  in Bangladesh.
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:30.640]  Let's get it up on this screen.
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:36.120]  You know, our federal agencies have been saying, follow the science, follow the science.
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:39.720]  Randomized trials are the gold standard in science.
[2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:45.760]  This is 606 individuals randomized to three different, to two different groups, receiving
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:47.080]  the pavadone iodine.
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:50.640]  It comes in a 10% solution, diluted down to 1%, but it doesn't even matter if it was
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:51.640]  0.5%.
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:53.440]  We don't have to be that specific on the dilution.
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:55.640]  Again, as long as it's not too strong.
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:57.840]  And they did aggressive washes.
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:02.400]  Let's bring up this slide here, the next slide showing just advanced to the next slide, and
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:06.680]  you can see everybody at the start, Alex, is PCR positive.
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:07.680]  Look at this.
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:10.040]  303 people in each group, PCR positive.
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:15.880]  Look after three days of doing the iodine washes in the nose and mouth and gargle.
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:16.880]  Look at that.
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  35 patients who are still PCR positive and knocked the crud out of the virus.
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:23.640]  Look compared to the control group.
[2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:25.200]  Control group was just warm water.
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:31.640]  And then look at how the virus basically persists in most people for seven days.
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:33.760]  This nasal therapy, there's nothing else going on.
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:34.840]  There's no ivermectin.
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:36.180]  There's no hydroxychloroquine.
[2:41:36.180 --> 2:41:37.920]  This is the only thing going on.
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:41.160]  And this is knocking the crud out of the virus in the nose.
[2:41:41.160 --> 2:41:43.200]  Proof positive, prospective randomized trial.
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:47.120]  So if you're going to go to a big busy train station and you're going to go on a big trip,
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.880]  take a netty pot, take a nebulizer and flush your sinuses and throat out once a day.
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:52.880]  Or take a spray bottle.
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:57.760]  You can just simply buy a simple spray bottle, load it up with this dilute solution, sniff
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:00.600]  it up and just, you know, sniff it back and spit it out.
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:04.680]  We tell people, listen, you come out after a day at church, you're traveling on a plane
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:05.680]  to come home.
[2:42:05.680 --> 2:42:06.680]  Plus a little bit of iodine is good for your body.
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:10.160]  I mean, I guess the type we sell is, can you, can you just go ahead and swallow the regular
[2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:11.160]  type?
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:13.160]  No, we don't recommend swallowing it because we can't control it.
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:14.600]  But let's bring up the next slide.
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:16.560]  People say, okay, Dr. McCullough, that's great.
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:18.680]  You can, you can zap the virus in the nose.
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:20.000]  Does it clinically matter?
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  Let's take a look at this.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  Hold on.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  We got to go to break.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.920]  Final segment with Dr. Peter McCullough and then Christy Lee's coming in with exclusive
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:29.760]  excerpts of Dr. Robert Malone this morning, detailed interview.
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:31.200]  The Big Joe Rogue interview drop as well.
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:33.120]  Get tight and share that at Spotify.
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:35.120]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:37.160]  This is life saving information.
[2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:41.360]  All of you watching millions of you are already away if you simply share this video once it's
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:45.000]  archived at Bandai Video this afternoon or take the live feed now and share it and tell
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  them to share it.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:51.120]  It causes the chain reaction and that's what the tyrants fear, the chain reaction.
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:52.840]  You are the resistance.
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:57.200]  We need you to share this.
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:03.360]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:07.760]  of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time, making
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:12.480]  yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:17.320]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:18.320]  in stock.
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:23.320]  Winter Sun, the highest quality, Vitamin D3, taken under the tongue for higher absorption
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:25.200]  is back in stock.
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:28.440]  Despite the effects that have been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:33.240]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2, Deep Earth Crystal
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:38.120]  iodine, the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:41.720]  activity in the body, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:47.080]  So that's the new year special and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:53.000]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com,
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.880]  50% off for a limited time.
[2:43:55.880 --> 2:43:57.400]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:43:57.400 --> 2:44:00.760]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:05.100]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:44:05.100 --> 2:44:09.800]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:14.320]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:19.120]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:24.840]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:30.600]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:37.480]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:42.080]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:47.880]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:50.680]  facts that pertain to reality.
[2:44:50.680 --> 2:45:12.880]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to have.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:27.400]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:30.800]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:31.800]  It's high quality.
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:36.520]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:40.840]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:42.160]  already taking place.
[2:45:42.160 --> 2:45:48.440]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:48.440 --> 2:45:52.320]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:53.320]  control.
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:56.760]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:46:00.720]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:05.960]  world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the
[2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:06.960]  planet.
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:11.360]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:15.280]  of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:17.160]  you and your family are in.
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:19.280]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:26.640]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[2:46:26.640 --> 2:46:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.480]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:36.600]  for us has been incredible, but I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:39.560]  info wars with the entire country and the world of tyranny.
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:44.280]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today and infowarstore.com
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:47.920]  is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip
[2:46:47.920 --> 2:46:48.920]  of the spear.
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:49.920]  I will go down with the ship.
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:50.920]  I'm not going to back down.
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:54.400]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  you support us.
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:58.480]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[2:46:58.480 --> 2:47:17.600]  We're about to close out with Dr. Peter McCullough, who I really appreciate with his amazing crew
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:20.280]  coming in here in the final day of 2021.
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:23.680]  Robert Malone literally walked out this morning.
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:28.200]  We said bye to him and then I turned like like a movie and here's Dr. Peter McCullough.
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:34.280]  So this place is as busy as Central Station, Grand Central Station with great patriots
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:35.520]  telling the truth.
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:40.040]  And some of the top scientists in the world have now officially come out and said pull
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:42.400]  the worldwide vaccine program.
[2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:43.400]  It is a disaster.
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:44.600]  We're going to cover that in a moment.
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:49.520]  Another huge development, but you were getting into iodine dissolved and in the nasal passage
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:50.640]  and what it did.
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:55.600]  Not just making the test show that they didn't have it, but what did it do to the actual
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:47:56.600]  body?
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:48:02.280]  They were pavadone iodine to basically drop the infectivity, zap the virus in the nose.
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:06.240]  We're talking about doing this every four hours when people are coming down with COVID-19.
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:08.960]  Let's bring up the slide showing the clinical results.
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:12.640]  This is the Chowdhury prospective high quality randomized trial.
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:14.080]  Take a look at this, Alex.
[2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:22.200]  You have 303 people, only two people hospitalized without the need for oxygen support, 10 hospitalized
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:25.000]  needing for oxygen and there were two deaths.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:29.720]  Compared to that to the control group, here we've got 14 people hospitalized without the
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:35.880]  need of oxygen, 63% in the hospital, Bangladesh needs oxygen and sadly 17 patients die.
[2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:36.880]  It's night and day.
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:42.600]  I'm telling you, without any other treatment, just zapping the nose with pavadone iodine
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:46.360]  in a nasal spray or nasal wash, you could use other forms of iodine.
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:48.800]  You could use dilute hydrogen peroxide.
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:53.120]  But here's the thing, whenever you or anybody else tries to talk about this on the internet
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:55.840]  on Facebook or Twitter, they take you down.
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:01.200]  Believe it or not, when this broke several months ago and when we featured this in some
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:06.520]  of our educational lectures, there was a physician email that went out through, I believe, Medscape
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:14.960]  that said, anti-vax doctors push iodine and patients will get iodine poisoning and die.
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:15.960]  Which is a total lie.
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:18.840]  You need iodine to live, but I guess just to be safe, you say fine, spit it out.
[2:49:18.840 --> 2:49:19.840]  That's what we said.
[2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:24.440]  AAPS said, to be clear, we're not telling people to swallow it.
[2:49:24.440 --> 2:49:25.440]  This is for topical use.
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:26.440]  Exactly.
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:28.440]  Because they'll have one of their people drink a bottle, go to pose a control, and sue
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:29.440]  you.
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:30.440]  No, we're not saying that.
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:32.840]  Well, believe it or not, the ophthalmologists use eye drops using this.
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:34.440]  I'm telling you, this is very safe.
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:37.000]  Believe me, I know all about that wonderful iodine is for you.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  It's like our main...
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  So Alex has got this.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:44.400]  Let's go ahead and bring up the dramatic announcement from Dr. Gert van der Bosch.
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:50.080]  Now, Gert van der Bosch has basically, for the second time, messaged officially the World
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:52.160]  Health Organization, and he is telling...
[2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:55.800]  So the guy who can put that in, because I know your producer sent it to them, say it's
[2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:57.760]  slow, we'll pull it up, because I just saw the headliner.
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:49:58.760]  Hand me your phone again.
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:00.400]  I'll just show it on TV that way.
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:02.800]  Dr, explain this to me, because this is important.
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:06.800]  I want everybody listening to write this down, to search this, and to get this info, because
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:09.800]  the globalists work around the clock to keep this from getting out.
[2:50:09.800 --> 2:50:11.800]  Overhead shot, please, guys.
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:12.800]  Should be able to bring this.
[2:50:12.800 --> 2:50:13.800]  Second call to WHO.
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:14.800]  Here we go.
[2:50:14.800 --> 2:50:15.800]  There it is.
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:16.800]  Now, tell us who he is, and why this is so important.
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:21.360]  Gert van der Bosch is a preeminent virologist.
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:25.600]  He's actually a trained veterinarian, and he was in the preclinical sciences, but he
[2:50:25.600 --> 2:50:28.960]  has worked for virtually every major vaccine manufacturer.
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:29.960]  Oh, let's see.
[2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:31.160]  I've seen that guy for years on TV.
[2:50:31.160 --> 2:50:33.640]  He has worked for the Gates Foundation.
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:34.640]  This guy...
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:35.640]  Oh, that's where I've seen him.
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:38.200]  He is a vaccine proponent.
[2:50:38.200 --> 2:50:40.480]  He helped develop vaccines.
[2:50:40.480 --> 2:50:46.240]  He, like Dr. Malone, and Dr. Byron Bridal, and Dr. Michael Yadin, as people who know vaccines
[2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:48.440]  has come out with no agenda.
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:50.160]  He has no conflict of interest.
[2:50:50.160 --> 2:50:53.920]  He is telling the World Health Organization, shut it down.
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:50:55.960]  Don't try to vaccinate against Omicron.
[2:50:55.960 --> 2:51:00.320]  The vaccine program has basically walked us into Omicron, which turns out not to be
[2:51:00.320 --> 2:51:01.320]  a bad thing.
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:04.560]  Believe it or not, this could be the happiest byproduct of the vaccine program, but he's
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:09.080]  telling them, as I'm telling America, it's time to shut it down.
[2:51:09.080 --> 2:51:13.480]  And I remember what, six months ago, they yellow-slipped the main regulatory group in
[2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:16.320]  the U.K. that under law they're supposed to listen to, so they just said, we'll change
[2:51:16.320 --> 2:51:17.320]  the law.
[2:51:17.320 --> 2:51:19.240]  They said, time to pull this.
[2:51:19.240 --> 2:51:23.360]  The evidence-based consulting group in the U.K. analyzed the yellow card system, not
[2:51:23.360 --> 2:51:28.440]  the VAIR system, the yellow card system, and they reported to the MHRA in an official report.
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:33.120]  Now, this is the group, this independent consulting group, the lead consultants to the WHO.
[2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:39.240]  They wrote the MHRA in official report saying, shut it down, not safe for human use.
[2:51:39.240 --> 2:51:41.600]  And that's the main group that advises the government?
[2:51:41.600 --> 2:51:46.120]  They advise the WHO, and the U.K. MHRA relies on them.
[2:51:46.120 --> 2:51:50.640]  How are they going to keep stonewalling this, paying Rachel Maddow $30,000 per show to say
[2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:54.400]  you're totally safe if you take it, no one ever got sick, don't listen to anyone, this
[2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:59.160]  is a pandemic, an epidemic, or whatever, of the unvaccinated.
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:01.840]  And then now Trump's saying it, how are they going to get away with this?
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:06.600]  It seems like every expert there is, the more prestigious, the more they're saying, don't
[2:52:06.600 --> 2:52:07.600]  do this.
[2:52:07.600 --> 2:52:12.160]  The will of the people, the backbone of the people, and the discernment of the people
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:13.160]  will break it.
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:18.240]  It's only going to be a mass public stand that will break this cabal.
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:21.960]  Because as you said, I mean, look at this, Netherlands wants six shots now.
[2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:24.520]  Israel's up to four or five, and this is insane.
[2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:31.440]  No one who values their health should ever commit the body to a series of a multi-year
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:33.760]  injections of genetic therapy.
[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:36.200]  It just simply cannot be done.
[2:52:36.200 --> 2:52:38.560]  Let's hold the line and hold it here.
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:41.200]  What needs to happen to, because you brought this up for me when I went live an hour and
[2:52:41.200 --> 2:52:46.200]  a half ago or almost two hours ago, Senator Paul has done a great job exposing the fact
[2:52:46.200 --> 2:52:49.880]  that Fauci and others lied about cooking this stuff up at Wuhan.
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:52.600]  I mean, it's clearly that part of what was man-made.
[2:52:52.600 --> 2:52:53.600]  Where does that need to go now?
[2:52:53.600 --> 2:52:57.280]  Because I feel like if we don't punish the perpetrators, then they're just going to do
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:52:58.280]  this again.
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:03.800]  Crimes against humanity have, you know, basically complaints have been filed in international
[2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:07.600]  courts by lead attorney Reiner Fomach from Germany.
[2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:08.960]  There's no fairness in the courts now.
[2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:13.880]  I think the bottom line is you saw the newswales.
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:19.120]  Australia is walking themselves into concentration camps, basically vaccine concentration camps.
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:22.320]  You saw arrests going on and horrific things going on.
[2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:26.360]  Oh, they're even grabbing political enemies, like senators, and saying, we're just going
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:27.960]  to keep you till you shut up.
[2:53:27.960 --> 2:53:30.120]  We're going to punish you and keep you longer.
[2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:32.960]  They're not even acting like it's to stop a spread.
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:35.480]  They're not even infected with the senator.
[2:53:35.480 --> 2:53:37.960]  No, it's the bottom line.
[2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:39.920]  There is no secrecy here.
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:41.760]  This is a test of wills.
[2:53:41.760 --> 2:53:43.520]  This is a show of strength.
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:45.480]  This is who's bigger and stronger.
[2:53:45.480 --> 2:53:50.280]  And I can tell you, we have the truth, and that's what the other side doesn't have.
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:54.400]  And when we archive this today, I want to put that clip right there up front in this interview
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:55.520]  because you're absolutely right.
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:53:58.320]  This is about a global ID, it's about a medical tyranny.
[2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:03.600]  It's about big corporations running medicine, not doctors and researchers and nurses.
[2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:05.160]  It's about them playing God.
[2:54:05.160 --> 2:54:07.920]  And I'm telling you, they've jumped the shark because there's no way they're going to get
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:08.920]  away with this.
[2:54:08.920 --> 2:54:10.400]  They got greedy.
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:11.400]  They do.
[2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:13.200]  And the bottom line is we're bigger and stronger.
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:17.720]  We can decide, and we will decide, what goes in our body and what doesn't.
[2:54:17.720 --> 2:54:21.680]  And now is the time for strength and backbone worldwide.
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:24.080]  We've got a few minutes left here.
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:27.520]  I really appreciate you, you're speaking all over the country again, where people find
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:32.040]  your great weekly program and everything with Dr. Peter McCulloch.
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:36.080]  You can follow me on Twitter with great expertise now from social media experts.
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:38.000]  I'm up across all the platforms.
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:42.840]  I am strictly within the boundaries that I'm aware of in terms of what I can post.
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:45.480]  You can find me on American Outlaw Talk Radio, the McCulloch Report.
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:47.280]  I do a weekly report.
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:53.560]  This week, I just submitted a wonderful interview with courageous former Trump advisor Paul Alexander,
[2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:59.520]  Iowa, and the smartest and insightful evidence-based medicine scientist in the world, Paul Alexander
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:02.560]  on the McCulloch Report on American Outlaw Talk Radio.
[2:55:02.560 --> 2:55:08.720]  I am the voluntary chief medical advisor for the Truth for Health Foundation, truthforhealth.org.
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:11.720]  People want to know, how can I help my loved one in the hospital?
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:13.640]  How do I get these treatment protocols?
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:17.640]  How do I get any educational videos on vaccine safety and efficacy?
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:19.320]  How do I get any advocacy?
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:25.720]  Go to truthforhealth.org, truthforhealth.org, and see the array of offerings there.
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:30.000]  There's some other wonderful sites, so I have to tell people, for physicians, all the doctors
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:37.160]  out there, Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, aapsonline.org, aapsonline.org.
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:38.920]  And people say, wait a minute, I'm desperate for treatment.
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:40.880]  Where do I go?
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:45.800]  If they are desperate for treatment, can't go home with their doctor, go to myfreedoctor.com,
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:54.800]  led by Dr. Ben Marble, an American patriot, great guy, also very high quality program,
[2:55:54.800 --> 2:56:02.200]  American Frontline Doctors, aflds.com, Richard Amerling now is associate chief medical officer,
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:08.000]  he's the guy, wonderful academician, he's absolutely a stalwart.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:12.320]  And again, listeners, I know most of you know all this, if you don't tell your friends,
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:15.600]  your family, your neighbors, your strangers, your email list, your Twitter list, if you
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:17.640]  don't tell people, they won't know and they'll die if this happens.
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:22.720]  I mean, my dad was going to die till Dr. Bartlett helped us and got people there, and my dad
[2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:26.480]  came back literally from 82% oxygen, he didn't even know who he was.
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:28.480]  And if he'd have gone to the hospital, my dad would be dead right now.
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:30.640]  This is life and death information.
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:33.480]  That's why we're running in full war, that's why you're unstoppable.
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:39.080]  And take the archive of this last two hours and share it, cut it up, share clips, just
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:43.840]  get, our listeners are so good, I get emails, constant, can I show clips, can I show my
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:44.840]  church?

[2:56:49.680 --> 2:56:55.120]  to you, take it, share it, cut it up, dice it, mix it, stand on your head with it, I
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:57:02.120]  don't care, just get this information out from Band-Aid video and freeworldnews.tv and
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:07.400]  keep us on air because we're one of the flagships, ladies and gentlemen, and one of the main

[2:58:50.960 --> 2:58:55.600]  and on bumper stickers, on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones
[2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:56.600]  was right.
[2:58:56.600 --> 2:59:01.280]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud
[2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:04.800]  of the new world order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and the Great
[2:59:04.800 --> 2:59:05.800]  Reset.
[2:59:05.800 --> 2:59:10.280]  And so now infowar's credibility is stronger than it's ever been and the globalists are
[2:59:10.280 --> 2:59:14.240]  now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let them
[2:59:14.240 --> 2:59:15.240]  do that.

[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:22.720]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[3:00:22.720 --> 3:00:23.720]  Alex Jones.
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:24.720]  Scott, Russian, Scott.
[3:00:24.720 --> 3:00:41.680]  If a war comes to mind, reputation's amazing, I will not let down, you will be very, very
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:55.440]  impressed I hope.
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:01:01.320]  Internationally recognized leading pathologist Dr. Arne Burkhart, a renowned expert in the
[3:01:01.320 --> 3:01:08.800]  fields of microbiology and infectious diseases, Dr. Sukherit Bhakti, recently published irrefutable
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:15.400]  evidence that the mRNA shots are killing at least 40% of recipients.
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:21.560]  First they explain why the experimental agents cannot protect against a viral infection,
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:27.200]  which we already know to be true by the overwhelming evidence and admissions that the more waxed
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:31.040]  up a person is, the more likely they are to get COVID.
[3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:37.560]  Drs. Burkhart and Bhakti explain that this is due to the fact that the so-called vaccines
[3:01:37.560 --> 3:01:43.840]  sway the body into producing antibodies in the blood, but not within the mucus membranes
[3:01:43.840 --> 3:01:47.040]  that normally protect our respiratory tract.
[3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:51.960]  This is why the vaccinated are suffering what they call breakthrough infections.
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:57.680]  The COVID vaccines are turning off lymphocyte production where they need it the most, while
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:02.840]  amping it up in the bloodstream, which is where it gets much worse.
[3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:09.560]  For those without the vaccine, a natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 will in most cases remain
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:12.660]  localized to the respiratory tract.
[3:02:12.660 --> 3:02:18.800]  But for those who have been vaccinated, unrelated cells deep inside the body react to the respiratory
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:24.840]  infection by creating a new spike protein, which then causes the cell that created it
[3:02:24.840 --> 3:02:28.000]  to be attacked by the immune system.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:33.600]  Vaccines warned us of this last year, and now it is clearly seen in the evidence.
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:40.320]  Drs. Burkhart and Bhakti found this autoimmune disease present in most organs, but mostly
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:46.800]  in the heart, which helps explain why we are seeing so many cases of myocarditis and cardiac
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:47.800]  arrest.
[3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:51.720]  The vaccines trigger self-destruction.
[3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:58.240]  Analysis has now been performed on the organs of over 70 people who died after vaccination
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:03:03.320]  and who died for reasons officially unrelated to the vaccines.
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:09.560]  In most cases, rhythmogenic heart failure was postulated as the cause of death, a mystery
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:11.640]  which has now been solved.
[3:03:11.640 --> 3:03:18.040]  What they found was inflammatory events in small blood vessels characterized by an overabundance
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:21.400]  of T lymphocytes and dead cells.
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:28.200]  Clearly accompanied by tissue destruction, in other words, immunological self-attack.
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:36.040]  The evidence clearly shows that both mRNA and vector-based vaccines from all four manufacturers
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:42.800]  are inducing autoimmune disease in multiple organs, mostly the heart followed by the lung,
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:45.440]  liver, thyroid, and brain.
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:53.680]  These data are so damning that you don't have to start looking for other data to know that
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:59.200]  these vaccines are killing the young and the old.
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:04.800]  So the children are set up against the wall and they shoot.
[3:04:04.800 --> 3:04:09.080]  These damn people are shooting and they're killing our children.
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:10.960]  I can't stand it.
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:16.840]  We have a four-year-old son and we're going to flee this damn country because we are not
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:20.000]  going to let himself be shot.
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:48.800]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:05:02.480]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:04.560]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:05:04.560 --> 3:05:10.280]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[3:05:10.280 --> 3:05:11.280]  But we failed.
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:12.640]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:05:12.640 --> 3:05:18.520]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:20.920]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[3:05:20.920 --> 3:05:25.200]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:05:25.200 --> 3:05:29.800]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:33.080]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but
[3:05:33.080 --> 3:05:34.800]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:37.600]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storeable food.
[3:05:37.600 --> 3:05:42.640]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:42.640 --> 3:05:46.680]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[3:05:46.680 --> 3:05:52.040]  to ship right now, lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long
[3:05:52.040 --> 3:05:55.480]  lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:05:55.480 --> 3:06:25.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:31.360]  I go with what's right, I go with what is true, I go with what my gut tells me.
[3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:38.760]  And when I follow my spirit, which is using God as its pull star, I am never wrong.
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:42.880]  And I can tell you, 2021 was a torturous year.
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:50.920]  It was the worst year in my life by far, just horrible things upon horrible things.
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:54.640]  And almost everything you think was a persecution is nothing.
[3:06:54.640 --> 3:06:57.920]  The stuff you know about the news was nothing.
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:03.360]  But I got to tell you this, through the persecution of the last 12 months, it's also been the
[3:07:03.360 --> 3:07:04.360]  best year of my life.
[3:07:04.360 --> 3:07:09.440]  And I've gotten so much closer to God and my discernment has gone up five times what
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:10.440]  it was before.
[3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:11.440]  It's incredible.
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:17.600]  But I can tell you at this level, I just come to the presence of God now, I can't even
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:22.760]  talk, I basically start shaking because the power of it is so awesome and just staring
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:25.840]  into the universe in infinity is indescribable.
[3:07:25.840 --> 3:07:31.120]  But let me tell you, God is 100% real, the devil's real as well and we're under attack.
[3:07:31.120 --> 3:07:34.320]  And this is biblical, this is good versus evil.
[3:07:34.320 --> 3:07:38.760]  And everybody that's involved in the fight knows that, understands this is a satanic
[3:07:38.760 --> 3:07:39.760]  attack.
[3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:42.640]  So, I need your prayers if you want me to stand this fight.
[3:07:42.640 --> 3:07:48.480]  I'm not a victim, I'm not complaining, but I'll tell you, I can take a lot.
[3:07:48.480 --> 3:07:54.640]  And the things the devil's done to us have just been nastier than hell and just 100%
[3:07:54.640 --> 3:08:01.160]  not human and have just been unbelievably horrible.
[3:08:01.160 --> 3:08:10.440]  And it's so we know our only savior is God.
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:12.920]  And it's only going to be God that saves us.
[3:08:12.920 --> 3:08:15.920]  It's not going to be our smarts, it's not going to be our looks, it's not going to be
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:16.920]  how tough we are.
[3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:20.000]  It's not going to be God.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:23.920]  But I can tell you, I'm sure wishing for a better year in 2022, but I'm not going to
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:26.080]  lie to you, I don't think you need me to tell you this.
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:28.920]  In fact, you don't even need me to tell you, do you?
[3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:29.920]  No, you don't.
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:31.120]  Because what am I about to say?
[3:08:31.120 --> 3:08:32.560]  You don't need me to tell you.
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:33.960]  You're connected to God as well.
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:37.480]  You can also read the tea leaves.
[3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:42.000]  Next year is going to make 2021 look like a cakewalk.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.480]  I think I'll be blessed if I'm alive in 12 months.
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:48.480]  This could probably, I've told my family and I'm not going to commit suicide and I'm not
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:50.280]  putting glue and doom on myself.
[3:08:50.280 --> 3:08:57.840]  I'm just saying my spirit tells me get ready to be every day like it's your last Jones,
[3:08:57.840 --> 3:09:03.320]  because you asked to be in the arena and you asked to fight evil and you have been built
[3:09:03.320 --> 3:09:04.600]  up for this point.
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:08.920]  So you better get ready to man up, Jack, because you asked for it.
[3:09:08.920 --> 3:09:12.400]  You're going to get it in 2022.
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:16.680]  I'm not getting a little Holy Spirit comfort or stuff, oh, you little sweet thing, because
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:17.680]  I asked for this.
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:18.840]  I asked to be at this level.
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:20.640]  That's not what I get now.
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:22.880]  I get, you ready for the information?
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:23.880]  You ready for this?
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:24.880]  You asked for it.
[3:09:24.880 --> 3:09:25.880]  Here it is.
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:26.880]  Get in there.
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:37.200]  And if you don't, you broke a deal and I tell you, I've seen things and been places and
[3:09:37.200 --> 3:09:38.200]  understood things.
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:40.000]  I don't think a lot of the people get.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:45.640]  The enemy knows that I've been let in on a lot of information by God and it's intensifying
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:46.640]  by the day.
[3:09:46.640 --> 3:09:48.640]  And I am the opposite of arrogant.
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:49.840]  I am the opposite of haughty.
[3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:51.880]  I am the opposite of someone on a power trip.
[3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:57.040]  I am scared and I'm not scared of the devil or the new world order.
[3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:03.680]  I'm scared of God because let me tell you, God is God and God is watching and God is
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:06.160]  in control.
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:09.280]  So everybody better say your prayers.
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:14.440]  Everybody better get on your knees and you better get right with God because I'm telling
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:16.960]  you it's going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:19.280]  I got the news here out of Russia.
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:26.560]  The U.S. is moving its command aircraft and attack systems into Ukraine and into Poland
[3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:35.000]  and surrounding areas and I was talking to a well-known podcaster friend of mine and
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:36.720]  I'm like, yeah, okay, I'm ready to come on.
[3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:41.600]  Yeah, I think you won't, you know, we'll have you on here and I go, I'm not even sure I'll
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:42.600]  be on air by then.
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:47.760]  I'm not even sure any of us are, I mean, I mean, you can see the wall of doom coming
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.320]  at us and I don't tell you all of that to scare you.
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:55.800]  I'm saying you better understand you've got an eternal soul.
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:10:59.840]  You better start realizing they're going to threaten your body to get you to join them.
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:03.240]  You shouldn't be worried about that body.
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:13.640]  But the soul, listen, all these medical doctors I have on that are prestigious and well-spoken,
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:15.080]  they all agree behind the scenes.
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:19.240]  This is deliberate, bioattack, world government depopulation that is going to weigh down society
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:21.560]  and collapse it and they know all about the great reset.
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:24.560]  I mean, you think these guys just know all these studies and all this stuff about the
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:25.560]  body?
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:26.560]  No, they all know about politics.
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:27.560]  They all know, too.
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:28.560]  Malone knows.
[3:11:28.560 --> 3:11:39.320]  McCullough knows, every Yedon knows, Wolfgang Wudarg knows, Dr. Zelinko knows, and Yedon
[3:11:39.320 --> 3:11:45.520]  and Zelinko, they'll tell you, this is depopulation, this is the biggest event in human history.
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:49.160]  You know how many people I know that are personal friends of mine because of whatever reasons,
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:53.320]  oh, I'm tough, I'm taking the shot, Joe, just get over it, that are super sick and screwed
[3:11:53.320 --> 3:11:58.200]  up and their hair falling out and all messed up by this.
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:01.680]  And I see them and I talk to them and I've got all these studies and they get mad at me
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:05.440]  when I show them, hey, here's the New Gregory's report, totally confirming with top scientists
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:09.960]  that almost everybody dying took the shot and I just, you look at them and you realize
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:14.200]  they're under a grand delusion, you're not going to be able to get to them, ladies and
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:15.200]  gentlemen.
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:18.120]  You're not going to get to them.
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:20.560]  They're dead already.
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:28.560]  And so that's why it's hard for me to go see a movie or just do anything anymore.
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:32.920]  I mean, I just sit there with my four-year-old daughter thinking about the world she's in
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:37.520]  and I just start, you know, getting tears in my eyes because, I mean, this is all real,
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:38.520]  folks.
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:39.520]  We're in the middle of giant depopulation.
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:43.400]  There's idiots everywhere injecting their children with all this poison and they're
[3:12:43.400 --> 3:12:47.440]  never going to admit when their kid's dead and dying that it was the shot.
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:51.360]  They're going to blame the unvaccinated even though it has no connection to reality.
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:56.880]  This is a spiritual attack because we lost God and as soon as we need to have God as
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:04.120]  our guiding light, as our radar system, as our roadmap, as our GPS, we're lost.
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:07.080]  I mean, what do you call people that serve Satan?
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:08.480]  They're lost souls.
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:10.200]  They're lost.
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:11.200]  They don't know.
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:12.200]  They don't know.
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:18.040]  People just believe MTV and believe CNN and believe HBO and believe Netflix and believe
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:23.120]  their fake church and they just keep believing and believing the lie and believing a new
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:28.000]  lie and another lie and another lie and another lie as if that's going to protect them and
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:32.200]  it gets worse and worse and instead of saying, gee, they've lied to me a bunch.
[3:13:32.200 --> 3:13:34.160]  What they tell me keeps not happening.
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:39.920]  What Alex tells me keeps happening, but you can't save them.
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:44.360]  You got to save yourself and save those that are willing to be saved and that's why taking
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:48.280]  the interview with Dr. Robert Malone that's going to be up in a few hours at Band-Aid video
[3:13:48.280 --> 3:13:51.960]  that we shot this morning needs to go viral because they just banned him.
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:52.960]  They're censoring him.
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:56.440]  They don't want the inventor of mRNA technology to have a voice that will talk to folks.
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:13:57.640]  We need to get that out.
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:01.560]  You need to get the Joe Rogan interview on Spotify out because as things like that become
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:06.680]  number one, everybody else sees the truth and recognizes it and you need to take the
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:11.040]  Dr. Peter McCullough interview, his last three or four interviews were amazing here.
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:12.720]  His three other ones.
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:17.240]  This one was by far better than all of them combined because now everything's crystal
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:21.160]  clear and it was bombshell after bombshell that will save lives.
[3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:27.280]  So I'm asking again, when it's archived today at Band-Aid video, get it and send it to your
[3:14:27.280 --> 3:14:28.280]  whole email list.
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:29.800]  Send it to your post it on Twitter.
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:30.800]  Take clips out of it.
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:33.280]  Send it on your text messages.
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:36.720]  Go to your church and hand out the URL to it.
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:43.560]  Whatever you do, they're counting on you not carrying the signal.
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:45.840]  You are the ones that are going to change this.
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:47.960]  You are the ones that are going to change the world.
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:48.960]  You are the ones.
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:50.640]  It's not going to be Trump going to save us, folks.
[3:14:50.640 --> 3:14:53.400]  It's going to be the grassroots people doing it.
[3:14:53.400 --> 3:14:56.000]  It's not going to be Rand Paul.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.680]  He'll talk about it being made in the lab, but he still wanted to admit the vaccine's
[3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:01.120]  not working and hurting people.
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:04.440]  So why don't you keep being nice to these folks, you know?
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:08.800]  Our problem in the Democrats, our problem is the Republicans that play footsie and politics
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:13.680]  with this stuff and who are way behind the curve on all this.
[3:15:13.680 --> 3:15:16.160]  I want the children protected.
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:18.280]  I want the truth about these shots out.
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:22.000]  I want Rand Paul to come out and say it's criminal to give these to children.
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:25.240]  Every day, hundreds of thousands around the world are being injected, tens of thousands
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:26.240]  in the U.S.
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:27.360]  Many are dead and dying.
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:29.680]  I will not put up with it.
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:33.360]  I will not stand for it and you will not put up with it.
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:34.680]  You will not stand for it.
[3:15:34.680 --> 3:15:40.800]  We're going to go to break when we come back with an exclusive first look at the doctor
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:44.560]  Robert Malone interview with Christie Lee and Shelby in studio with us and then she's
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:51.320]  going to take over in the final Alex Jones broadcast of 2021 and then Owen Schreuer in

[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:22.360]  as they're lovingly called but taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is
[3:16:22.360 --> 3:16:28.840]  just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking
[3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:33.160]  your other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do because
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:37.280]  I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking it I mean it doesn't
[3:16:37.280 --> 3:16:43.280]  happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing okay you know this
[3:16:43.280 --> 3:16:48.840]  is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put on derma
[3:16:48.840 --> 3:16:54.360]  blend anymore you know so anyway it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared
[3:16:54.360 --> 3:17:00.800]  up my skin not just across the United States but across the world you see it on the sides
[3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:05.760]  of barns and on bumper stickers on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls Alex
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:11.280]  Jones was right that's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:15.080]  the fraud of the new world order that they're saying no to clout swap bill gates and the
[3:17:15.080 --> 3:17:20.640]  great reset and so now info wars credibility is stronger than it's ever been and the globalist
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:24.720]  are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let them

[3:20:17.160 --> 3:20:38.580]  Jones is a great talk show host and news anchor works all over the country but she got censored
[3:20:38.580 --> 3:20:44.060]  so now here she is doing great work with info wars at christie lee tv on twitter christie
[3:20:44.060 --> 3:20:49.320]  lee tv dot com and she's going to be hosting the last 30 minutes is talking about the world
[3:20:49.320 --> 3:20:54.040]  and she was just visiting family in Ohio and how crazy that was and her big dr robert malone
[3:20:54.040 --> 3:20:58.240]  interview just days after twitter banned him we're going to have an excerpt of that coming
[3:20:58.240 --> 3:21:02.280]  up at the start of the next segment when she takes over but I want to spend a whole time
[3:21:02.280 --> 3:21:06.400]  talking to her just about getting robert malone around he interviewed him a lot you know over
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:12.080]  skyper over zoom but now having him here in person right after he was on with joe rogan
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:16.240]  that interview has now dropped hopefully it reaches tens of millions of people but regardless
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:21.120]  what a crazy time to be alive it is very crazy very crazy time to be alive very crazy year
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:25.440]  I was just just saw betty white passed away and I was like well this just seals that it's
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:35.200]  been the worst year ever betty white 99 wow yeah so so robert malone here the dinner
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:41.000]  of mrna censored it's surreal tell folks what that interview was like before they say it
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:45.320]  well it was it was great dr. malone is such a good person I was just talking about what
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:50.200]  great character he has along with dr. peter mccullough they're just good people they're
[3:21:50.200 --> 3:21:55.480]  not doing this for any other reason but caring about other people trying to save lives you
[3:21:55.480 --> 3:22:01.520]  know when you look at conflicts and motivations motivations these guys are just doing it to
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:05.560]  spread the word they've gotten ridiculed they've gotten censored they've gotten suppressed
[3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:10.000]  I mean why else would they want to do this other than for good reasons it's just really
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:14.720]  great people so great to finally meet dr. malone face to face yeah I mean I mean Malone
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.920]  particularly is a very rich man he's got a bunch of top patents and he's out there saying
[3:22:19.920 --> 3:22:24.240]  this is evil this is wrong don't do it he's been a member of the establishment so he particularly
[3:22:24.240 --> 3:22:28.680]  is doing a very christlike thing to stand up well yeah and and that's what's fascinating
[3:22:28.680 --> 3:22:33.320]  about dr. malone is because it's been such an evolutionary process for him to see where
[3:22:33.320 --> 3:22:37.840]  he started and how he thought about things to now just seeing firsthand the attacks
[3:22:37.840 --> 3:22:42.160]  that he came under and it's just blown him away I mean I asked in the interview have
[3:22:42.160 --> 3:22:46.960]  you been red-pilled and he said boy have I been read the more they bully him the more
[3:22:46.960 --> 3:22:52.680]  hardcore he got this is like poking the barrier you're trying you're gonna have this result
[3:22:52.680 --> 3:22:58.160]  with these with these people but he is fascinating person and for me it was it's really unique
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:05.000]  because when you first said I could contribute to band video I remember saying like okay well
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.600]  you know how's this gonna work and you're like I I'm not gonna have time to tell you
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:12.680]  what to do Chris do you see you have to kind of figure it out so I was like okay well that's
[3:23:12.680 --> 3:23:16.440]  that's cool you know but you've been really kicking ass well I mean like I said it's been
[3:23:16.440 --> 3:23:20.760]  it's been a process for me to be given total freedom to pursue what matters and to pursue
[3:23:20.760 --> 3:23:24.760]  who I want to talk to you as opposed to being under corporate control and and having guidelines
[3:23:24.760 --> 3:23:30.640]  of what I can and can't talk about or say and so with Dr. Malone it was actually my very
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:35.520]  first interview as an independent journalist and so I told him that today I'm like you're
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:39.400]  what kicked it off for me and now here we are face-to-face and it's really come full
[3:23:39.400 --> 3:23:44.640]  circle I'm like just coming off Joe Rogan and now here we are again so it's really fascinating
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:48.680]  for me it's it's really special to have that seen that come full circle well it's wonderful
[3:23:48.680 --> 3:23:51.880]  to have you here and it's you know listeners supporting us keeping us on air that allows
[3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:55.880]  us to sponsor other great independent journalists like yourself we've got more than 20 people
[3:23:55.880 --> 3:24:00.000]  we'd like to hire we just don't have the funds to do it even until you know a moderate amount
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:03.640]  of money you're paid you know for the great work you do and that's why info wars is so
[3:24:03.640 --> 3:24:07.840]  important that's why everybody needs to go them for wars and get a book get a film get
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:13.040]  a t-shirt you know get some of the high quality supplements like vitamin real fusion 50% off
[3:24:13.040 --> 3:24:17.320]  right now and of course back at stock survival show x2 the deep earth crystal I'd on the
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:21.200]  highest quality you're gonna find out there that is just amazing that's how we continue
[3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:25.360]  to do this so I'm told I haven't seen interview yet I mean I've seen images of it looks really
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:30.720]  really good shot here in the studio but what are some of the other big things you talked
[3:24:30.720 --> 3:24:34.240]  about because I'm told it's pretty powerful by the crew that was watching well he really
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:39.280]  digs into this whole concept of how they're trying to spark fear with the children and
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:43.440]  how they're trying to use as validation to poke the children and get these children jabbed
[3:24:43.440 --> 3:24:47.680]  and and he is so adamant against it and he said he felt like he really got the worst
[3:24:47.680 --> 3:24:53.200]  targeting and oppression by the mainstream media and other powers that be when he came
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:58.320]  out and he filmed that video saying don't do it as a grandfather as a father don't do
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:03.480]  this to your children I'm trying to save them from things that are unknown and from the
[3:25:03.480 --> 3:25:07.800]  data that we're already seeing that it's really harming our children in the next generation
[3:25:07.800 --> 3:25:12.540]  of people so that's when he really saw that but we also talk about the next rally coming
[3:25:12.540 --> 3:25:18.200]  up and at the Capitol on the 23rd and I hit him hard about that well you know is this
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:22.320]  gonna be another false flag event like should we be concerned and he said that they're working
[3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:26.920]  on hiring the highest of security for that so we're gonna keep an eye on that too well
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:33.200]  I gotta tell you this is historic to see him censored by Twitter and to see them suppressing
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:37.520]  the inventor of this major technology that has a lot of promise that's being deployed
[3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:43.560]  as a weapon against us I mean it's surreal that they're censoring him it's just amazing
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:46.840]  but what's striking about it is they're really shooting themselves in the foot it's like
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:51.520]  these and we talk about this too these these folks are not bright because when you censor
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:57.080]  and suppress you're making these people forbidden fruit you're actually increasing demand you're
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:00.400]  you're making people be like wait why don't they want me to hear from this person what
[3:26:00.400 --> 3:26:06.240]  is this person saying that's so shocking and crazy and so they're just a preeminent scientist
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:10.880]  dead on very grandfatherly very nice very believable and he shows the evidence that's
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:15.560]  why he's dangerous because he's trying to save people exactly but like I said it's also
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:19.880]  been neat to kind of take this journey with him and see him go from very reasonable and
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:25.640]  soft spoken and and and even at times defensive of the vaccine to now he is not not so soft
[3:26:25.640 --> 3:26:30.200]  spoken anymore they've poached the bear he's coming out he's dropping a lot of things well
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:36.640]  how long is the interview oh gosh at least an hour so do we think it's going to come
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:39.680]  out today or when do you want to release it I mean I think it'd be good to put it out
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:43.800]  before the year ends well we wanted to show respect for Joe Rogan's interview and wait
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:47.160]  until that came out but now that we know that that's released we plan on getting it out
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:51.000]  today the full piece on band dot video good and you're going to go to break and come back
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:55.160]  and take over here and in the year on the Alex Jones so with Christy Lee independent
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:59.320]  journalist now I've been taking the world by storm and then you're going to air five
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:03.800]  minute excerpt and then I guess the next few hours Zach is over there getting it all edited
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:09.040]  and ready to put up on band dot video that's fantastic I tell you you're also gonna talk
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:13.160]  some about Ohio you said it was pretty wild the difference between Ohio and Texas well
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:18.200]  yeah I mean there in Ohio you still have more of the mask wearing there I mean not to mention
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:24.040]  it's just colder injury than it is here in Texas but it's crazy you know like we've
[3:27:24.040 --> 3:27:27.400]  been saying it doesn't matter with the GOP it doesn't matter with the Democrats you know
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:33.920]  we have a GOP Mike DeWine and he is all about mandating vaccines and really pushing the
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:38.720]  vaccines and the mask wearing and it's to what end you know so it really isn't an R
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:44.320]  versus D thing anymore well this is going to be a big interview that comes out and then
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:49.640]  Sunday on the Sunday show we will definitely air large excerpts this Sunday not just four
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:55.400]  to six p.m. then we have Sunday live so four to eight p.m. Sundays live broadcast here I
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:00.480]  am not going to be here Sunday I'm gonna come back Sunday I'm gonna go out to my dad's family
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:04.560]  ranch we've had forever long before I was around before he was around I've been out there
[3:28:04.560 --> 3:28:07.760]  in about a year we're gonna go out and do a little bit of deer hunting here right at
[3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:11.120]  the end of the deer season and hang out with my four-year-old daughter she hasn't shot
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:14.720]  any guns yet but she's almost five so that's when you start getting them firing the little
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:20.840]  22 so that's a nice video to trick with all the safety measures folks don't worry but
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:24.200]  we're definitely gonna go out and have some of that fun as well so pray for us on that
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:30.680]  front because it is only you the viewers and listeners that keep us on air and that's why

[3:33:17.680 --> 3:33:22.400]  Welcome back to info wars this is christy lee filling in for the remainder of the show
[3:33:22.400 --> 3:33:27.200]  in the final show of 2021 boy if you would have told me that I would be finishing out
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:34.920]  Alex Jones show on info wars in 2021 last year I would have been like what you're crazy
[3:33:34.920 --> 3:33:41.560]  this is crazy and what a crazy year it has been right insane so this morning had the
[3:33:41.560 --> 3:33:47.080]  pleasure of picking Dr. Robert Malone up from the hotel bringing him back to the info wars
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:54.960]  studio and sitting down with him one-on-one to talk about his big show the major show
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:34:00.640]  with Joe Rogan you know we've seen that Dr. Peter McCullough had the biggest views of
[3:34:00.640 --> 3:34:06.600]  all over 40 million 40 million lasted checked gosh it could be more than that by now and
[3:34:06.600 --> 3:34:11.360]  we're wondering what's gonna happen with the interview with Dr. Robert Malone now I was
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:17.840]  taking him to the airport after we had our sit down interview and he said gosh I don't
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:23.200]  know how it will be received it was a great conversation but I just I hope it doesn't
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:31.160]  get more views than Dr. Peter McCullough because I don't want Peter mad at me but this is the
[3:34:31.160 --> 3:34:35.920]  character of these guys these guys are just so kind hearted and sweet but without further
[3:34:35.920 --> 3:34:41.560]  ado I'll talk more after we show you the clip of our sit down and and see see what else
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:44.800]  I can tell you before the whole thing is released here it is.
[3:34:44.800 --> 3:34:49.640]  What about those that are saying well he's just taking this position because he's bitter
[3:34:49.640 --> 3:34:52.760]  that he didn't get more credit with the vaccines.
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:35:00.800]  You know what's funny about all that is these detractors that are basically trying to delegitimize
[3:35:00.800 --> 3:35:08.800]  me in any way they can they're coming at these little picking at these little things.
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:12.080]  The good news is they haven't been able to find anything of substance in my background
[3:35:12.080 --> 3:35:17.480]  I have no criminal record or any of that kind of stuff I'm still married to the same woman
[3:35:17.480 --> 3:35:23.640]  you know after 42 plus years and and I've got you know I'm kind of an average guy kids
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:35.040]  and and all that and so and and they never are attacking the points made the science
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:43.520]  the question the issues that I'm raising except us this these hired fact checkers and and
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:50.120]  what I found is that it doesn't matter whether you cite the literature and you provide them
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:55.840]  with facts they are not about the facts I mean we now know this from the lawsuit against
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:02.160]  Facebook that where the Facebook lawyers came flat out and said well we call them fact checkers
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:08.520]  but these are really opinions and that's what it is well and it went from a simple true
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:12.880]  or false which is what you would think it would be with facts to now they'll say something
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:20.280]  false and the reason is because misleading and so how do you make that determination
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:26.480]  they're even trying to mark things false that they're trying to put into a gray area which
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:31.800]  makes and I think part of the problem is that they now have developed because this this
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:39.080]  is a new strategy right this whole paid fact checker by Facebook and now Reuters interest
[3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:43.760]  it's important to understand that Thompson Reuters is now integrated into Twitter as
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:49.680]  Twitter's official fact checker and you may or may not remember back in the day when I
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:53.920]  pointed out the first thing that got me kicked off LinkedIn was this post in which I pointed
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:58.960]  out that the chairman of the board of Thompson Reuters also sits on the board of Pfizer and
[3:36:58.960 --> 3:37:03.280]  I just asked the simple question does this look like a conflict of interest I was prompted
[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:09.280]  by a Reuters fact check attacked on me that was you know inappropriate and incorrect and
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:13.680]  I was just kind of a little bit pissed at Thompson Reuters but that's been part of this learning
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:21.880]  curve of of of seeing again and again and again how the game is played but this business
[3:37:21.880 --> 3:37:29.120]  of hiring logically AI these small pop-up firms I mean logically AI is run by a guy
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:35.840]  whose main claim to fame before this was he was an unsuccessful garage band a guitarist
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:42.160]  and that's that's it that's near as I can find in terms of his background but he gets
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:51.720]  these big contracts from Facebook and and it's their their unabashed their guns for hire
[3:37:51.720 --> 3:37:57.400]  they will they will say an attack and do whatever it is that they get paid to do their hired
[3:37:57.400 --> 3:38:04.160]  guns and and it's not about truth and facts and and you know that because the people they
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:08.960]  hire being there basically untrained haven't graduated from college or if they did it was
[3:38:08.960 --> 3:38:13.400]  in something humanities or something like this or the or the head of the trusted news
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:19.560]  initiative is actually a I think has a bachelor's in in humanities has no background in science
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:30.520]  doesn't matter yes so so in terms of this trying to delegitimize me it's I knew that
[3:38:30.520 --> 3:38:38.200]  this was the price that was going to be paid I knew going into this that my life would
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:45.160]  change when when when Steve Kirsch and Brett Weinstein and I sat down in Brett's studio
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:51.160]  in Portland we all knew that that was a turning point and our lives would never be the same
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:56.840]  and that is absolutely the case so there you go much more to that interview one thing that
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:39:04.480]  was interesting was that when Dr. Malone said that he met Joe Rogan Rogan said you know
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:08.760]  people were trying to tell me that you're crazy but you seem quite normal and I was
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:13.600]  like on that note since Rogan was telling you that people were trying to warn you about
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:19.720]  yourself that you're crazy what does that do to other people that you know you were
[3:39:19.720 --> 3:39:25.600]  told were crazy before I don't know like RFK Junior or Alex Jones you know what do you
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:30.000]  think about these people now that you were told one thing and now you're having those
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:34.880]  things said about you what does that do to your perception so his answer is really interesting
[3:39:34.880 --> 3:39:44.880]  when posed with that question and also we I ask him you know I've seen you kind of take
[3:39:44.880 --> 3:39:49.880]  this journey figuring things out especially seeing just how viciously you've been attacked
[3:39:49.880 --> 3:39:55.680]  and I've seen you kind of get a little bit little bit more bold in things and so I have
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:40:01.680]  to ask you have you been red-pilled and his answer is so funny to that so you're going
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:06.720]  to want to see that as well that's all going up on band.video later today I know they're
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:12.520]  working on it right now to get that up and going so keep an eye out for that one other
[3:40:12.520 --> 3:40:18.280]  thing that he talked about in his interview that was really fascinating to me is that
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:25.200]  he said that when he was in fourth or fifth grade is when he read the book 1984 by George
[3:40:25.200 --> 3:40:30.120]  Orwell so fourth or fifth grade he had read that book and he said it really stuck with
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:36.960]  him and it stuck with him up until now and just seeing how things are going on and just
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:44.680]  how Orwellian things are and as I was preparing last minute to finish out Alex's show today
[3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:50.120]  I saw this quote up and it's from George Orwell and it reminded me of that part of the interview
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:56.120]  with Dr. Malone this morning and it's in a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary
[3:40:56.120 --> 3:41:00.960]  act in a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and I think that that's
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:06.960]  what we see that what we see with Dr. Malone and Dr. Peter McCullough is is they're the
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:13.880]  revolutionaries of our time they are telling the truth with so much deceit around them
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:18.520]  and they're doing it with integrity they're doing it in the face of so much attack so
[3:41:18.520 --> 3:41:25.960]  much ridicule and even with threats of taking everything that they've worked so hard for
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:30.040]  but they're they're telling the truth anyways and and actually they only get more bold the
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:37.040]  more that they're attacked you know you poke the bear and watch what happens so he said
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:40.480]  it's like guerrilla warfare and I think that's another thing you'll find interesting in the
[3:41:40.480 --> 3:41:46.080]  interview with the one-on-one with Dr. Malone and I is he he describes this as guerrilla
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:52.240]  warfare and in in a war of information sound familiar it is an info war so we kind of got
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:55.760]  a Dr. Malone to say that but he he said that all in his own we weren't trying to get him
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:42:01.440]  to say that but that's what it is it's a word information it's being prepared with the counter
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:06.360]  claims to when they come when the fact checkers come with their claims it's being prepared
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:10.920]  being prepared to debunk them giving people a place to go and that's that's what they're
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:16.680]  doing is they're finding tactics to to rebut those people that are trying to ridicule and
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:21.320]  downplay and debunk them they're coming prepared they're coming with the information they're
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:25.600]  coming with the documents if you will so they've learned their lesson they've learned how
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:30.920]  to do this so even now he says when he he gets a comment from or an email from Reuters
[3:42:30.920 --> 3:42:35.840]  or others that are asking you know what is your response to these claims that what you
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:40.200]  said weren't true or misleading he said he was just now now he's learned to be short
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:44.840]  terse and give them a website where everything that can be listed so people can go and they
[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:51.080]  can find the truth and and he can't be misquoted so it's all about tactic it's all about warfare
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:59.520]  it's a gorilla warfare it's an info war everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has
[3:42:59.520 --> 3:43:05.600]  only been the build up for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive
[3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:09.320]  this is their takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because
[3:43:09.320 --> 3:43:13.760]  now they've revealed themselves now their world government their permanent martial law their
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:19.760]  medical tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:24.040]  their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling

[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:40.880]  you haven't seen me up at the desk yet and if you haven't I'm a former corporate controlled
[3:47:40.880 --> 3:47:48.840]  media teleprompter reader converted to digging out for the truth and and alex has provided
[3:47:48.840 --> 3:47:54.200]  me a way to have freedom and bringing the news and pursuing the things that matter with
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:48:01.000]  no restriction so that is freedom that is the way that journalism was intended to be
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:06.240]  seeking out all sides making sure we're giving a voice to the voiceless as we have so many
[3:48:06.240 --> 3:48:11.920]  people trying to take away the voice of those that are telling the truth and so truly trying
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:16.360]  to be a voice for the voiceless and amplify amplify those voices that mainstream media
[3:48:16.360 --> 3:48:22.560]  is trying to suppress so got to interview doctor malone this morning it was such a full
[3:48:22.560 --> 3:48:30.960]  circle situation he was my very first interview as an independent journalist and boy when
[3:48:30.960 --> 3:48:37.200]  alex said pursue whatever you want you know what I'm like well wow I'm a local news long
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:42.800]  time local news anchor and now I'm going to have to seek out national subjects I don't
[3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:48.000]  know let me try and get a hold of this this guy who says the MRNA inventor and he is so
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:53.920]  kind doctor malone that here I was a nobody just starting a career or trying to start
[3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:59.000]  a career as an independent news disseminator if you will and he he happily agreed he was
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:05.040]  so kind and gracious was my very first interview and we've kind of journeyed through this whole
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:09.920]  discovery together you know the more that we have learned the more he's learned the
[3:49:09.920 --> 3:49:14.920]  more I've learned since leaving mainstream news it's been interesting to take that journey
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:18.480]  together and so to meet him in person for the first time and sit down with him one on
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:24.320]  one was really neat and we will have the whole interview for you up on band up video by the
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:30.880]  end of the day so check that out along with his appearance on Joe Rogan so I went home
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:36.840]  to Ohio to visit family I just got back and here I am thrown into the mix there's no
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:40.920]  rest for the weary there's no rest for those that are trying to fight tyranny but I'm going
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:45.200]  home to Ohio I was talking with my mother she had to have surgery a couple times and
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:50.880]  she said that she they made her get those tests and she said the first time she got
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:56.080]  the test she made her feel all tingly and she started to feel sick and so when she had
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:49:59.960]  to be tested again she did what they were talking about in the last segment with Dr. Peter
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:06.880]  McCullough and really drained her nasal passages and that she felt loads better so I can attest
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:11.480]  to you attest to that within the family that something you definitely want to do on the
[3:50:11.480 --> 3:50:15.360]  regular and especially if they're going to force you to test all clear whatever gunk
[3:50:15.360 --> 3:50:20.560]  they they got in your nose right out because you just never know anymore so whenever I
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:25.960]  do a show I've committed to sharing a verse that's my thing and again Alex gives me the
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:29.480]  freedom to do my thing and so I'm going to share a verse which I think is appropriate
[3:50:29.480 --> 3:50:36.120]  for the New Year's Eve and for the New Year it is from Isaiah 43 18-19 and it is do not
[3:50:36.120 --> 3:50:41.400]  call to mind the former things or consider things of the past behold I am going to do
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:47.520]  something new and now it will spring forth will you not be aware of it I will even make
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:54.480]  a roadway in the wilderness rivers in the desert and boy does he boy does does our God
[3:50:54.480 --> 3:50:59.600]  and our Savior Jesus he makes a way he always makes a roadway in the wilderness rivers in
[3:50:59.600 --> 3:51:06.440]  the desert gosh just look at just look at me I mean I had spent 20 years in traditional
[3:51:06.440 --> 3:51:09.680]  journalism and I couldn't do it anymore and I didn't know what I was going to do next
[3:51:09.680 --> 3:51:16.960]  I had no idea and behold I will do something new if this isn't new sitting in the chair
[3:51:16.960 --> 3:51:22.040]  at Info Wars after Alex Jones I don't know what's new but boy am I thankful I'm thankful
[3:51:22.040 --> 3:51:28.640]  to be able to tell the truth to seek the truth and share both sides and so so very grateful
[3:51:28.640 --> 3:51:32.040]  about that now one thing that we talked about with Dr. Malone and I'm going to try and get
[3:51:32.040 --> 3:51:35.680]  through this because I'm running out of time talking too long but one of the things we
[3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:40.600]  talked about is this walk back that I've noticed in the past week week and a half or so many
[3:51:40.600 --> 3:51:44.400]  of these things that they were trying to put out there they're kind of walking back on
[3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:49.320]  or changing and and so Dr. Malone and I talk about that but I want to go about about through
[3:51:49.320 --> 3:51:55.480]  that with you so from pushing mandates and saying they would shut down the virus Biden
[3:51:55.480 --> 3:52:00.040]  is Biden now waving a white flag because he's saying there's no solution now and it's up
[3:52:00.040 --> 3:52:03.520]  to the state so let's take that first video of Biden saying he's going to leave it to
[3:52:03.520 --> 3:52:10.680]  the states as you look towards federal solutions that will help alleviate the challenge make
[3:52:10.680 --> 3:52:18.600]  sure that we do not let federal solution stand in the way of state solutions and the the
[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:24.400]  production of 500 million rapid tests that will be distributed by the federal government
[3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:30.920]  is great but obviously that drives up the supply chain for the solutions that we might offer
[3:52:30.920 --> 3:52:37.440]  as governor look there is no federal solution this gets solved at a state level my message
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:43.360]  to the governor is simple if you need something say something and we we're going to have your
[3:52:43.360 --> 3:52:48.320]  back in any way we can we're going to have your back in any way we can he says he says
[3:52:48.320 --> 3:52:53.000]  this is not a federal thing it's a state thing but hey wait what's this you know we we saw
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:56.880]  in many places but particularly I'm going to read from the Daily Wire Florida Surgeon
[3:52:56.880 --> 3:53:02.480]  General Biden admin actively preventing the effective distribution of monoclonal antibody
[3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:08.000]  treatments in the US so here he says we're going to have your back run and give you what
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:12.480]  you need it's up to the states to fix this but wait we're going to take away resources
[3:53:12.480 --> 3:53:17.120]  that you were having success with before like monoclonal antibody treatments we're going
[3:53:17.120 --> 3:53:22.880]  to make it harder for you to get those it's it's such nonsense and then if it is now with
[3:53:22.880 --> 3:53:27.920]  the states is he going to try and and just pull all talk of federal mandates or are
[3:53:27.920 --> 3:53:32.440]  we just going to see how that plays out with the Supreme Court interesting so it is
[3:53:32.440 --> 3:53:37.040]  just is overall interesting though that he would even walk that back so that's not the
[3:53:37.040 --> 3:53:43.640]  only thing that we've we've been seeing so from pushing masks to then we saw Dr. Lena
[3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:49.840]  when finally admitting masks don't work take a look at this video cloth masks are not appropriate
[3:53:49.840 --> 3:53:54.960]  for this pandemic it was it's not appropriate for Omicron it was not appropriate for Delta
[3:53:54.960 --> 3:53:59.360]  Alpha or any of the previous variants either because we're dealing with something that's
[3:53:59.360 --> 3:54:04.200]  airborne oh but wait she just five months ago and I don't know if I'm going to have
[3:54:04.200 --> 3:54:08.640]  time to get through all this but she would just five months ago was was praising masks
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:16.200]  slotting them let's play a little bit of that Dr. Lena video I agree that masks are a very
[3:54:16.200 --> 3:54:21.400]  powerful layer of protection but it's one layer and if we have so many other wait a
[3:54:21.400 --> 3:54:26.840]  minute wait a minute that's all I need to hear so she's just said in the most recent
[3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:31.880]  video they never worked cloth masks aren't this is airborne it's not going to work but
[3:54:31.880 --> 3:54:36.840]  just five months ago she was saying we know masks are so powerful you can always catch
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:41.880]  these people in their lives but it does make you wonder what are they up to what are they
[3:54:41.880 --> 3:54:45.400]  up to that they're walking some of these things back we're appearing to walk some of these
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:50.280]  things back you said you said before masks are so powerful and children should maybe
[3:54:50.280 --> 3:54:56.440]  be double masked when they go to back to school but a couple days ago or a few days ago now
[3:54:56.440 --> 3:55:01.400]  she's saying masks don't work this is an airborne virus well the cloth ones you know the ones
[3:55:01.400 --> 3:55:07.400]  that everybody's wearing the cloth ones that they don't do a thing so interesting and then
[3:55:07.400 --> 3:55:13.640]  the cutting of the quarantine time so the CDC is we see cuts recommended quarantine
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:20.600]  time amid Omicron surge so before it was 10 days now it's five days and when you read
[3:55:20.600 --> 3:55:25.200]  into these articles it talks about well because of the economy we don't want too many people
[3:55:25.200 --> 3:55:31.120]  off at the same time well that's interesting since they put up so much federal dollars
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:35.200]  why are they worried about time off are they worried oh well we don't want to have to figure
[3:55:35.200 --> 3:55:41.840]  out how to pay for people's time off we're now all of a sudden acknowledging that that
[3:55:41.840 --> 3:55:48.960]  all of these mandates and rules affect our economy and I mean it just goes to show you
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:53.320]  is never about health I mean if they can just arbitrarily change it from 10 to 5 because
[3:55:53.320 --> 3:55:57.600]  oh we don't want it to affect the economy or people working too much well then what
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:02.520]  was the science behind the 10 day lots of questions but it's interesting that they
[3:56:02.520 --> 3:56:09.560]  that they walk it back so they've walked that back and then we have the PCR tests don't
[3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:15.120]  work correctly before they were allotting this we've based so much of the money and
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:23.160]  fear on everything on the PCR tests working and then take some of this video of Dr. Willinsky
[3:56:23.160 --> 3:56:26.880]  the CDC director Dr. Rochelle Willinsky joins us right now good morning Rochelle how are
[3:56:26.880 --> 3:56:33.440]  you doing I'm well good morning how are you good now as we just heard some medical experts
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:37.280]  think that there should be a negative test requirement at the end of the five day isolation
[3:56:37.280 --> 3:56:43.600]  period why is that not required yeah really important question so let me sort of go through
[3:56:43.600 --> 3:56:47.760]  the science that we were looking at as we were making these recommendations first is
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:53.600]  watching the virus how does the virus behave and what we do know is about 85 to 90 percent
[3:56:53.600 --> 3:56:58.320]  of viral transmission happens in those first five days which is why we really want people
[3:56:58.320 --> 3:57:03.080]  to stay home during that period of time and then mask for the rest of the time to capture
[3:57:03.080 --> 3:57:08.080]  that last 10 to 15 percent we also know we're expecting it to work number of cases we've
[3:57:08.080 --> 3:57:13.840]  seen that in other countries and many of those cases may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic
[3:57:13.840 --> 3:57:18.720]  so we want to be able to get people back out if they're feeling well but to also have them
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:23.200]  be masked and finally we want to make sure that when people isolate to the extent that
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:27.960]  they can and are able to isolate that they do so during that most infectious period of
[3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:32.560]  time because we are running out of time for the show but basically she just ends up saying
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:37.280]  that the tests don't work which we knew all the time and we would get censored and banned
[3:57:37.280 --> 3:57:40.920]  for saying that but now they're admitting it so why the walk back interesting you got
[3:57:40.920 --> 3:57:47.480]  to pay attention to when they change the tune but thank you for tuning in to info wars
[3:57:47.480 --> 3:57:53.960]  everything I do is about victory for humanity everything I promote is about standing up against

[3:58:25.320 --> 3:58:30.520]  thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing but I got to tell you out of
[3:58:30.520 --> 3:58:35.800]  everything I've done reset wars is the most important and it is now available now the
[3:58:35.800 --> 3:58:42.520]  month of December 2021 is here at reset wars.com start your journey to the next level today
[3:58:42.520 --> 3:58:48.480]  at reset wars.com the globalist fear this information the average person on the face
[3:58:48.480 --> 3:58:53.680]  of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals
[3:58:53.680 --> 3:58:59.360]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create
[3:58:59.360 --> 3:59:03.720]  a post-human world for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the bricks
[3:59:03.720 --> 3:59:08.840]  in the UK nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government
[3:59:08.840 --> 3:59:14.440]  that's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of build
[3:59:14.440 --> 3:59:21.960]  back better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[3:59:21.960 --> 3:59:26.520]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is
[3:59:26.520 --> 3:59:31.880]  the ideology of this world government system could win they released a biological weapon
[3:59:31.880 --> 3:59:37.800]  on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple
[3:59:37.800 --> 3:59:42.240]  they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine
[3:59:42.240 --> 3:59:50.080]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history expose this paradigm and we win if
[3:59:50.080 --> 3:59:57.080]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
