[00:56.600 --> 01:00.920]  in the Congress now we're getting this from other congressmen and women as
[01:00.920 --> 01:06.840]  well another congressperson a congresswoman representative captor

[01:15.160 --> 01:20.920]  announced so that's two separate congresspeople a man and a woman and we

[01:30.720 --> 01:36.360]  making this show pass say no I mean everything we've ever talked about is
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.760]  now unfolding is now coming through and I talked to people on the streets I
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.080]  picked up some Chinese food to take at home last night well to be technical to
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.400]  take it over to my grandmothers we ate over there last night and I was asking
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.680]  people just randomly when I walked in and out front smoking cigarettes and the
[01:56.680 --> 02:00.200]  valet they have valets there but I wasn't valeting I parked up front but I
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.480]  asked them I said you know are you aware what's going on are you aware of any
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.000]  financial problems and they said no nothing about it I just know the cowboys
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.600]  lost and I went and talked to somebody else inside and they said oh look cowboys
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.380]  just lost I don't know anything about the financial situation but even the
[02:20.380 --> 02:25.360]  mainstream media is admitting oh yeah martial law yeah the regular armies
[02:25.360 --> 02:31.400]  coming to the US but it's kind of with a whimper not a bang I am living in the
[02:31.400 --> 02:37.400]  twilight zone ladies and gentlemen I am living in the twilight zone had a nice
[02:37.400 --> 02:44.280]  talk with Governor Ventura at his home in Minnesota this morning and let's just
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.960]  say it's some interesting things to tell me that will not be mentioned as of yet
[02:48.960 --> 02:56.760]  but you'll be hearing some big announcements from Ventura soon but just
[02:56.760 --> 03:01.720]  need to keep my mouth shut but frankly as interesting as that is what I was
[03:01.720 --> 03:10.640]  told is I can't even I can't even focus on fun things like October 26 I'm going
[03:10.640 --> 03:13.680]  to be in an event with Jesse Ventura Willie Nelson Jimmy Vaughn I learned
[03:13.680 --> 03:20.800]  from Willie Nelson is going to be there even though Jimmy was over at my
[03:20.800 --> 03:28.360]  children's birthday party last week visiting there's just so much going on
[03:28.360 --> 03:34.120]  I can't keep track of it anymore it's all complete insane asylum and life
[03:34.120 --> 03:40.960]  itself is like a twilight zone episode I am living in a twilight zone episode
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.920]  there is no doubting that and I'm not the only one living in it we're all
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.600]  living in the twilight zone episode together so I'm going to cover all the
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.120]  financial news when we get back we're lining up the congressman to get him
[03:55.120 --> 04:00.840]  on about how Marshall Laws been declared and how congressmen are thrown out of
[04:00.840 --> 04:09.040]  meetings who disagree this is PDD 51 the Pentagon didn't put up cameras
[04:09.040 --> 04:12.480]  nationwide which after a decade of me telling you that we're Pentagon paid
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.000]  for we had the purchase orders it's now mainstream news that it's a military
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.120]  Northcom surveillance grid of us the enemy we are a declared enemy of the
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.320]  military and they're just now getting around to tell them the grunts that the
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.880]  good news is the grunts are saying they're not going to go along with it so
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.840]  I will compose myself somewhat here and then we will come back after the break
[04:39.840 --> 04:48.600]  and get into congressman Marcy chapter boldly slamming the bailout this past

[08:24.480 --> 08:29.000]  Fort Worth area the neck of the woods that I'm from I want to go ahead and
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.960]  play a clip of what he had to say on c-span over the weekend dealing with
[08:35.960 --> 08:41.000]  debate on the type of intimidation tactics congressmen and women being
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.280]  thrown out of meetings similar things aren't being said by the honorable
[08:46.280 --> 08:54.720]  congresswoman as well representative Burgress let's go ahead and play this
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.040]  clip here it is gentlemen time has expired the gentleman from Texas
[08:59.040 --> 09:02.600]  the speaker has mission to rest address the house for one minute revise and extend
[09:02.600 --> 09:05.960]  my remarks without objection this figure I also come to the floor today to talk
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.720]  about this 700 billion dollar bill it's in front of us I use the term bill
[09:09.720 --> 09:15.000]  advisedly because we have seen no bill we are here debating talking points on
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.600]  perhaps what is one of the most largest the largest fundamental change in our
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.600]  nation's financial system in its history and House Republicans have been cut out
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.200]  of the process not only have we been cut out of the process we've also been
[09:27.200 --> 09:30.680]  derided by the leadership of the Democratic Party and called unpatriotic
[09:30.680 --> 09:34.600]  for not participating Mr. Speaker I have been thrown out of more meetings in
[09:34.600 --> 09:39.440]  this capital in the last 24 hours than I ever thought possible as a duly elected
[09:39.440 --> 09:45.760]  representative of 820,000 citizens of North Texas this speaker politics is a
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.120]  full-contact sport and I understand that but it is a full-contact sport in the
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.760]  light of day in the public arena since we didn't have hearings since we didn't
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.600]  have markups let's at least put this legislation up on the internet for 24
[09:59.600 --> 10:03.840]  hours that's what Thomas was made for let's do that and let the American
[10:03.840 --> 10:07.680]  people see what we have done in the dark of night after all I have not gotten
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.600]  any more mail any more emails on any other subject than this one that is
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.040]  before us today Mr. Speaker I understand we're under martial laws declared by the
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.720]  speaker last night I think it's ironic House Republicans have not been needed
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.760]  for a single thing in this house to assure passage for the last 22 months
[10:25.760 --> 10:30.280]  and today we're going to be asked to vote for a bill for political cover
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.040]  because Democrats are too weak to stand up to the their speaker I yield back
[10:35.040 --> 10:39.560]  gentlemen's time has expired the gentleman from New Jersey okay that's
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.120]  representative Michael Burgress and I really appreciate him coming on on such
[10:44.120 --> 10:47.520]  short notice instead of you having just two minutes sir I'd like to give you
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.520]  more time to flesh out specifically what you're talking about I mean we know
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.240]  they're not letting us see the bill that's a big issue but this talk of a
[10:55.240 --> 11:00.320]  martial law we've seen Army Times report that regular Army brigades are
[11:00.320 --> 11:03.040]  being called back to the United States for martial law I don't know if you're
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.200]  aware of that but can you specifically tell us more details of what you speak
[11:07.200 --> 11:15.160]  well the first off what was during speech I'll vote for that guy martial law
[11:15.160 --> 11:20.760]  and it is a term that's used up here it applies to a specific situation and
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.200]  under that procedure long-standing house rules that require at least one day
[11:25.200 --> 11:29.760]  between the unveiling of significant legislation and the House floor vote on
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.000]  that legislation the members can learn what they're going to vote on those
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.080]  rules are swept away instead under martial law the leadership can file
[11:37.080 --> 11:40.920]  legislation with either 10 pages or a hundred pages of fine print and move
[11:40.920 --> 11:44.400]  immediately to debate and votes on it for members of Congress the media and
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.880]  the public have an opportunity to understand fully what provisions have
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.600]  been altered or inserted into the legislation behind closed doors it's a
[11:52.600 --> 11:55.720]  procedure that the leadership intends to use the muscle through important bills
[11:55.720 --> 11:59.680]  when time is short which is kind of where we found ourselves Saturday night
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.880]  when the the email went out that that the house was going to function under
[12:04.880 --> 12:07.840]  martial law so the rules could go in at any time any hour of the day or night
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.440]  and within an hour's time we could have a bill on the floor and forced to vote on
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.480]  it fortunately that didn't happen we did get the bill at 6 o'clock last night so
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.600]  we've gonna have we're gonna have it for 18 hours before we vote on it so I guess
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.480]  that's a that's an improvement you know honestly for something this big for
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.640]  something this important it should be available for public scrutiny for at
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.480]  least wouldn't you say 24 hours before we we take a vote and I gotta tell you
[12:35.480 --> 12:39.720]  like that but I didn't exaggerate when I said this is the major amount of phone
[12:39.720 --> 12:42.360]  calls I've gotten since I've been in office that is true I'm wearing the
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.880]  thousands with maybe five is in favor and all the rest opposed it is extremely
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.400]  toxic in my well congressman that was the next point I was going to make if
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.440]  this is a representative republic representative democracy as they say
[12:56.440 --> 13:04.080]  and and the polls now it was 28% for then it was 9% for new polls out this
[13:04.080 --> 13:08.640]  morning are showing about 6% for you're saying you took thousands of calls five
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.520]  of them were for it so that looks like hundreds to one plus it's totally
[13:13.520 --> 13:19.000]  unconstitutional socialism and instead we have the party leadership of both
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  parties Democrat and Republican basically circling the wagons engaging
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.840]  the type of financial terrorism for the last 10 days saying if you don't pass
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.920]  this we're going to have a depression and it's no no surprise the markets are in
[13:31.920 --> 13:35.040]  free fall right now and then they're going to blame that on people that call
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.480]  for deliberation when it's their fear mongering that are no doubt driving down
[13:38.480 --> 13:43.200]  the market I think I'm not going to disagree with that statement and you know
[13:43.200 --> 13:45.520]  the other thing is the Senate's not going to vote on this till later in the
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.600]  week so what in the world are we doing having to rush it through today I
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.000]  realized there's some sensitivities to holidays and I realized the end of the
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.480]  month is coming up and I realized there's an election coming up but man this is
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.840]  important and it's important to get it right we came a long way I've got you
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.480]  know hats off to the people on my side who even though I wasn't allowed in the
[14:07.480 --> 14:10.800]  meetings of things got changed that were important changes let's talk about that
[14:10.800 --> 14:14.840]  in fact I'm glad you know that a better made the bill a better product going
[14:14.840 --> 14:18.400]  forward so I'm very grateful to that unfortunately we don't fix the underlying
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.000]  problems with the with the oversight at FDIC and SEC and as a
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.120]  consequence we put a big $700 billion dollar band-aid on a problem that
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.040]  continues to fester and who knows when that band-aid comes off what we're
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.880]  going to face the problem then will be magnified many fold because we're not
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.320]  fixing the underlying problem we're going to continue to undervalue assets
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.200]  we're going to continue to fail banks that we've got no business failing and
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.160]  it's fixable it's fixable right now within you know really literally within
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.000]  a 24-hour time period but we don't seem to have the political will to do that
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.400]  where we're bound to this bill is this product that we've created over the
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.440]  weekend and the speaker I think said yesterday's speaker Pelosi said this is
[14:57.440 --> 15:01.400]  frozen there'll be no more work done on it well that's nuts if it's not right
[15:01.400 --> 15:06.920]  let's work till we get it right well absolutely congressman representative
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.120]  Michael Bargress out of north Texas up by his main district is in Fort
[15:12.120 --> 15:16.680]  Worth in Lewisville I want to go back to the procedures though because we have
[15:16.680 --> 15:20.080]  other congressmen and women saying that they were thrown out of meetings that
[15:20.080 --> 15:24.120]  they shouldn't have been like Congresswoman Marcy captor what's
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.880]  happening well Marcy is Democrat and so I guess she was thrown on the meeting
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.680]  on her side and I was asked to leave meetings on my side I want to throw it
[15:32.680 --> 15:35.320]  there all of them and there were some of the working groups that I was allowed to
[15:35.320 --> 15:41.360]  just sit in but you had to search to find them they were not you know unless
[15:41.360 --> 15:45.880]  you unless you stumbled upon one you wouldn't necessarily
[15:45.880 --> 15:49.600]  but how does that work a congressman representing close to a million people
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.880]  right walks in walks in and is told in the Capitol get out of here
[15:53.880 --> 16:00.160]  correct and and and I mean do house rules let you tell us who threw you out I
[16:00.160 --> 16:04.560]  mean why why would they throw you out are these secret meetings well secret is
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.840]  probably not the right word they were sensitive and people were trying to get
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.360]  there you know everyone's been trying to work under this arbitrary timeline of
[16:14.360 --> 16:17.960]  the fact we were told we had to vote last night so in the markets open this
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.840]  morning they would see that we passed the bill and obviously that didn't happen
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.960]  well yeah people were were functioning under some time constraints and even
[16:26.960 --> 16:30.960]  though our numbers on the Republican side are diminished from what they were
[16:30.960 --> 16:36.320]  two years ago you still have nearly 200 men and women who if given the chance
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.360]  would want to weigh on things I'll just tell you I'm vice-chair of our Republican
[16:40.360 --> 16:48.200]  House policy committee I've had three meetings with former FDIC chairman two
[16:48.200 --> 16:51.760]  yesterday and one this morning and I mean it was standing room only people are
[16:51.760 --> 16:56.720]  hungry for information about what's going on they're hungry for information
[16:56.720 --> 17:01.440]  about what what in addition to what the bill is what might be done to fix the
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.360]  problem if or if the bill will fix the problem and they want to have their
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.840]  questions answered and that's just just shows the level of concern that is out
[17:11.840 --> 17:15.280]  there and I mean I threw these meetings together just kind of an ad hoc
[17:15.280 --> 17:20.160]  procedure because people were so desperate to define something out and
[17:20.160 --> 17:23.880]  we had a conference yesterday in fairness of leadership it was a big
[17:23.880 --> 17:28.600]  conference and they allowed they allowed speakers to come to the microphone
[17:28.600 --> 17:32.880]  congressman congressman rule kind of was you can only ask questions about the
[17:32.880 --> 17:38.680]  bill you weren't allowed to to state a case congressman why are they passing
[17:38.680 --> 17:45.520]  any bill when 95 percent now in polls 94 95 depending on the poll are against it
[17:45.520 --> 17:51.280]  I mean that is a mandate from the people to not bail wall street out and as you
[17:51.280 --> 17:54.820]  said one of the little reported things you're really showing your your
[17:54.820 --> 17:58.040]  congressman's you're quite informed but most people don't understand this is a
[17:58.040 --> 18:02.480]  select coterie of banks using regulators to go after a lot of banks that are
[18:02.480 --> 18:05.840]  being reported is actually being solvent so really this is big banks
[18:05.840 --> 18:08.040]  gobbling things up and getting a bunch of free money
[18:08.040 --> 18:11.200]  Bloomberg's reporting they've got a bunch of experts on the last two days
[18:11.200 --> 18:16.520]  several articles saying that that there isn't as big a liquidity problem as we're
[18:16.520 --> 18:21.480]  hearing and this is really a way to hoard a bunch of taxpayer money well
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.320]  that's a it's a debatable point and I have talked to experts who have said we
[18:26.320 --> 18:30.960]  are just on the precipice of financial Armageddon and I've talked to others
[18:30.960 --> 18:36.720]  who said have told me that yes it's true the financial sector is in turmoil but
[18:36.720 --> 18:43.200]  in an unusual situation the remainder of the economy is relatively stable even
[18:43.200 --> 18:46.840]  even though the financial sector is so troubled and that's unusual at other
[18:46.840 --> 18:51.520]  times when we've had these types of difficult fees the financial sector has
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.080]  also roiled the the underlying economy right now or up till now it really has
[18:56.080 --> 19:00.360]  and so I look upon that as perhaps a little bit of a gift maybe we should
[19:00.360 --> 19:05.000]  take the time to get this right if we are not going to get it right I think we
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.200]  do run the risk of the ultimately the underlying economy will suffer if if we
[19:10.200 --> 19:15.400]  don't fix this and fix it correctly okay so you are saying that we did some type
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.960]  of bill does need to be passed I would be in favor of this bill if we would add
[19:19.960 --> 19:25.560]  to it some of the regulatory changes that are necessary at the FDIC
[19:25.560 --> 19:32.800]  things like changing the fair valuation of assets so that banks have the so-called
[19:32.800 --> 19:37.400]  mark-to-market phenomenon the banks aren't failed just because they're
[19:37.400 --> 19:41.400]  something because if something is not available right now it doesn't mean it's
[19:41.400 --> 19:46.480]  worthless congressman we've got a break do a five-minute segment with us and
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.880]  explain it to us because I'm here looking at pieces of it and you know it's a lot
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.080]  to read over we've seen some previous versions I like to get your expert take
[19:55.080 --> 20:00.120]  on exactly what this bill will do and when will it pass if it's going to be
[20:00.120 --> 20:03.600]  passed stay with us. Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to

[21:04.120 --> 21:09.200]  history a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on
[21:09.200 --> 21:16.120]  September 11th but who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to the
[21:16.120 --> 21:20.640]  Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[21:20.640 --> 21:24.760]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some
[21:24.760 --> 21:28.640]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[21:28.640 --> 21:34.240]  spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.080]  detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the
[21:39.080 --> 21:42.720]  Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war
[21:42.720 --> 21:47.400]  games, the shadow government and much much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at

[22:00.240 --> 22:06.600]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people
[22:06.600 --> 22:10.480]  around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection? You
[22:10.480 --> 22:13.760]  may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of
[22:13.760 --> 22:17.800]  debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never
[22:17.800 --> 22:22.480]  know it. In fact clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all
[22:22.480 --> 22:26.720]  cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis. Now you can fight
[22:26.720 --> 22:30.760]  internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally and

[24:05.120 --> 24:12.040]  Representative Michael Burgess is our gas Republican from the 26th district.
[24:12.040 --> 24:18.920]  Up by Fort Worth here in Texas and we appreciate him coming on on such short
[24:18.920 --> 24:24.240]  notice, sir. To me, and it's been called this by many others, this is economic
[24:24.240 --> 24:27.720]  terrorism. They're not stupid in Congress. They're not stupid at the White
[24:27.720 --> 24:33.920]  House. McCain's not stupid. Barack Obama's not stupid. We see all of these.
[24:33.920 --> 24:39.160]  Secretary Paulson running around saying pass this or there will be a
[24:39.160 --> 24:45.040]  depression. Now talk like that. Anyone knows is what will cause a crash. And so
[24:45.040 --> 24:50.520]  to me, I don't think we can pass this bill because it's economic terrorism. So
[24:50.520 --> 24:56.240]  can you speak to that specifically and then to talk of immunity? Is that the
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.240]  newest bill where Paulson and others and all these company heads are given
[25:00.240 --> 25:05.080]  immunity for anything they do and it can't even be reviewed? Actually, I
[25:05.080 --> 25:10.120]  hadn't seen that provision. It is disturbing. Secretary should be, I
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.840]  think, more circumspect in his discussion. You shouldn't hear a bank
[25:14.840 --> 25:20.320]  examiner talk that way. It only leads to difficulties that otherwise may
[25:20.320 --> 25:27.240]  not be encountered. So that's the first thing. I'll have to tell you I haven't
[25:27.240 --> 25:33.040]  gotten to the point of the bill that has the immunity or protections. Not to my
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.400]  knowledge, but I have not been all the way through it. So that's something
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.200]  I have not yet seen. Things that are missing from the bill that we'd like
[25:42.200 --> 25:50.040]  to see in the 80s, the FDIC here in Texas, for example, could go to a bank
[25:50.040 --> 25:55.480]  that looked to be getting into trouble or very nearly in trouble and provide them
[25:55.480 --> 26:01.920]  with what was called a net worth certificate. This was a paper that was
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.720]  essentially a dementia given to the institutions. They carry on their
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.280]  balance sheet as capital. There were some things they had to do in exchange
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.000]  for this. They had to allow the bank examiners in and practically live at
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.680]  their bank to make certain that they did clean up their balance sheet and that
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.080]  they were careful about processes going forward. But the reality is the former
[26:24.080 --> 26:30.280]  head of the FDIC, William Isaac, who was chairman in the 80s, told us that he was
[26:30.280 --> 26:34.520]  able to fix $100 billion, what was thought to be a $100 billion problem, for
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.400]  under $2 billion using these methods. That's right. It looks like they're
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.640]  asking for, quote, more money than they need if it's just for the subprime
[26:41.640 --> 26:45.960]  mortgage and jumbolon problems. I found it from the version that we saw in the
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.580]  middle of last week, sir. Let me read it to you from section 8. Decisions by the
[26:49.580 --> 26:53.700]  secretary pursuant to the authority of this actor, non-reviewable and committed
[26:53.700 --> 26:56.960]  agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any
[26:56.960 --> 27:02.880]  administrative agency. That's only one part. That's section 8 of the last
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.680]  version that the public was allowed to see. Yes, sir? Okay. I've got the version
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.000]  that we got last night in front of me, but I probably, the interest of time, I'm
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  not going to be able to run through that. I don't have it up before I could do it.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.120]  I understand. No, no, I understand. I'm just wanting you to give us your take on
[27:19.120 --> 27:22.560]  that. What was in there? Does that sound good to you? No, no, well, obviously that
[27:22.560 --> 27:28.360]  sounds like you could cover up a host of problems with that. Now, there
[27:28.360 --> 27:31.760]  were some things that were taken out of the earlier versions that I think were
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.960]  it's great that they were taken out. And again, I applaud my side for doing that.
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.280]  I applaud Senator McCain for standing up at the White House and saying, I'm not
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.960]  going to let the House Republicans be rolled on this. I just wish we'd taken
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.200]  it maybe one or two steps farther than we were. We were able to take it. Let's
[27:47.200 --> 27:50.880]  talk Turkey then in the time we have left, sir. Look about your House website for
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.840]  people to check it out. We appreciate your time. Obviously, if you, if this isn't
[27:55.840 --> 27:59.960]  passed, then if there's a depression, it can be blamed on whoever didn't pass it.
[27:59.960 --> 28:04.040]  But then if it does pass, people can pass the buck and say, well, we at least
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.320]  tried. But bottom line, if 95% of the American people are against it, if
[28:08.320 --> 28:11.000]  they're trying to rush it through and they're fear mongering, there's a
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.400]  responsibility not to pass it. And I think the constituents would support
[28:14.400 --> 28:20.520]  someone that pointed that out. So I, I mean, your take on that statement. Well,
[28:20.520 --> 28:24.160]  I just, I mean, I just couldn't go for it. I couldn't go for it and couldn't
[28:24.160 --> 28:29.440]  consciously allow myself to be reelected. I mean, it, it, it, it violates the
[28:29.440 --> 28:32.840]  principles down to the core. I'm not saying that I would not go against the
[28:32.840 --> 28:36.480]  will of my district if I really thought the country was threatened and I needed
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.400]  to make a tough vote to save the country. I hope I would have the courage to do
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.080]  that. And I didn't run for Congress to win elections. I ran for Congress to do
[28:44.080 --> 28:48.120]  the right thing when the time came, the right thing as I saw it right now. The
[28:48.120 --> 28:53.480]  right thing to me is let's send this bill back and, and, and keep working on it
[28:53.480 --> 28:56.400]  because it's not right yet. I'd say send it back to committee, but it didn't go
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.880]  through the committee. I've heard Democrats complaining that we, Marcy
[28:59.880 --> 29:03.600]  Capter herself, we didn't get to go through committee. It didn't come through
[29:03.600 --> 29:08.360]  financial services, no hearing, no markup. Nobody got any input. It's just up on
[29:08.360 --> 29:13.560]  the, on the website at 6 p.m. on Sunday. And you better vote yes by noon on, on
[29:13.560 --> 29:17.400]  the, on Monday, because we've got a holiday coming up and people have to get
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.360]  home. Well, they shouldn't leave. The Congress should stay in session. We should
[29:20.360 --> 29:23.440]  leave. That's what we did all of August. We shouldn't have left because we hadn't
[29:23.440 --> 29:27.800]  done anything about energy prices and we stayed and it worked. We got something
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.160]  done. Ultimately, that may be undone under a new. Do you think it's going to
[29:31.160 --> 29:34.680]  pass today, Congressman? I have to believe that it probably is because no one
[29:34.680 --> 29:38.880]  leaned on me that hard to vote against it, which means they likely have to vote. Wow.
[29:38.880 --> 29:41.400]  Let me just say bye to you during the break and then we'll be right back for
[29:41.400 --> 29:45.960]  everybody else to stay there. Congressman Burgess.

[33:00.760 --> 33:13.240]  Representative Michael Burgess talked about basically martial law declared the
[33:13.240 --> 33:21.600]  House the normal rule suspended as the establishment those that engineered the
[33:21.600 --> 33:27.080]  current economic crisis want basically even more power and trillions of
[33:27.080 --> 33:32.360]  dollars is what most the financial experts are saying not 700 billion. The
[33:32.360 --> 33:36.480]  congressman held over because he has some key information and some regulatory
[33:36.480 --> 33:43.120]  fixes that are being promoted by a lot of different economic experts that he
[33:43.120 --> 33:47.920]  thinks the public should be made aware of. But what about accountability? What
[33:47.920 --> 33:52.120]  about you know some people being investigated or some people getting in
[33:52.120 --> 33:56.160]  trouble not just on the brokerage and banking side but also regulators because
[33:56.160 --> 34:02.120]  it looks to me like we've got a lot of regulators that weren't enforcing
[34:02.120 --> 34:06.520]  current laws. Can you speak to that? Well I can tell you that in August of
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.600]  2007 when this thing first began to surface subprime problem first began
[34:11.600 --> 34:16.520]  to surface in a big way that was the time to begin looking into some of these
[34:16.520 --> 34:20.200]  things. I don't know what the SEC has been doing over there but it would
[34:20.200 --> 34:23.600]  certainly have been appropriate for the investigatory bodies in the United
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.360]  States Congress to stop chasing Harriet Meyers, Carl Rove, halfway around the
[34:28.360 --> 34:31.760]  planet and bring some of these guys in there and ask them what the dickens they
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.600]  were doing before the horse got out of the barn. There was an opportunity to
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.480]  fix this a year ago and no one seemed to be willing to take the trouble to do it.
[34:40.480 --> 34:46.080]  The other thing is that you know we're constantly criticized for Republican
[34:46.080 --> 34:49.400]  you're a deregulator that's what caused this mess. No there's plenty of
[34:49.400 --> 34:52.940]  regulation. The problem is the regulators weren't regulating the
[34:52.940 --> 34:57.760]  regulations that they were supposed to enforce and no amount of new regulations
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.720]  was going to fix that and I referenced Starbain's Oxley. That terrible bill that
[35:01.720 --> 35:05.240]  was passed the year before I got here people all over my district complained
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.480]  to me about that because small and medium-sized businesses are treated the
[35:08.480 --> 35:11.960]  same as huge businesses but they've and they've got to fill out the same forms
[35:11.960 --> 35:16.480]  and pay the same amount of accounting and legal hours that sometimes can go
[35:16.480 --> 35:19.680]  into the millions of dollars for a small business to comply with Starbain's
[35:19.680 --> 35:25.960]  Oxley. Where was Starbain's Oxley? Where was the Starbain's Oxley requirement
[35:25.960 --> 35:29.160]  that these things be reported in transparent fashion and you're right
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.360]  why hasn't someone been fired why hasn't someone been held accountable and if
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.760]  some of these guys that ran some of these businesses into the ground why are
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.840]  they continue to be paid why aren't they facing charges. I mean it really that's
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.520]  what people are telling me where is the accountability. Okay so from the we have
[35:46.520 --> 35:50.160]  been distracted by every type of political theater up here since the
[35:50.160 --> 35:55.200]  Democrats won and as a consequence we're just not doing our job. Congressman who
[35:55.200 --> 35:58.480]  needs to be prosecuted who needs to be investigated. Well I think the
[35:58.480 --> 36:02.120]  investigations need to be done I mean I'm not a lawyer I don't know the
[36:02.120 --> 36:06.380]  the banking laws that well to say I know who should be prosecuted but if there
[36:06.380 --> 36:13.400]  are people who did things wrong who who shifted data on their books who reported
[36:13.400 --> 36:17.240]  things that weren't accurate that's what Starbain's Oxley is all about. The CEO
[36:17.240 --> 36:23.160]  who signs that paper signs as if they know everything that's in that book
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.680]  that they file and these are the people who should be held accountable. But
[36:28.680 --> 36:32.720]  instead the media which a lot of these big banks own and control is telling us
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.200]  oh no it was all an accident no prosecutions no investigation needed
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.600]  instead we're gonna try to hand at least 700 billion over to these people and
[36:40.600 --> 36:45.760]  you mentioned it earlier clearly you've got a conflict of interest because you
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.920]  got a lot of people involved in in the at the regulatory level who are you
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.840]  know out of the same brokerage and banking structure and now they're
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.320]  going after smaller banks regional chains which a lot of evidence shows
[36:59.320 --> 37:02.920]  aren't in financial trouble and then seizing them so it looks like a big
[37:02.920 --> 37:06.640]  bank consolidation to me. There could be consolidation at almost the way you
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.320]  described it you'd almost call it insider trading wouldn't you? Yes sir let me
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.680]  give out the it is insider trading no doubt that's a good way of putting it.
[37:14.680 --> 37:21.600]  In closing let's give out the website it's house.gov forward slash Burgess
[37:21.600 --> 37:31.160]  B-U-R-R-G or B-U-R-G-E-S-S so again house.gov forward slash B-U-R-G-E-S-S and
[37:31.160 --> 37:36.040]  folks can read about that particularly tell us about this regulatory fix
[37:36.040 --> 37:40.880]  instead of a huge bailout. Well there are four points and again Mr. Isaac
[37:40.880 --> 37:44.600]  former chairman of the FDIC was kind enough to come up here from Florida and
[37:44.600 --> 37:48.600]  spend all afternoon with us and the Democrats he met with both sides and
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.160]  coming out of those conversations distilled four regulatory points and
[37:53.160 --> 37:57.600]  those are up on the website if people want to download those and study them
[37:57.600 --> 38:02.200]  and and become a little bit more conversant. The problem is if we don't
[38:02.200 --> 38:05.640]  fix some of the underlying regulatory problems we can shovel money at this
[38:05.640 --> 38:09.840]  thing from now till doomsday and we're not going to fix it. In fact we'll make
[38:09.840 --> 38:13.360]  the problem worse we may go from a recession to a depression because of
[38:13.360 --> 38:18.000]  our efforts rather than the outside of them. Shifting gears finally remember
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.400]  last year and this year the Homeland Security Committee wanted to see PDD 51
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.240]  by President Bush in its entirety the cover sheet says under continuity of
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.960]  government that the state governors in the Congress are basically not even a
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.040]  rubber stamp if the president chooses to implement that for any emergency
[38:35.040 --> 38:39.040]  including economic or any other emergency. Did you hear about that
[38:39.040 --> 38:43.440]  controversy with Congress not allowed to see that? No I did not. I sit on the
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.360]  committee of energy in commerce we have a little bit different jurisdiction. No I
[38:47.360 --> 38:50.720]  did hear about that. Does that sound good to you that the Congress doesn't sound
[38:50.720 --> 38:57.000]  reasonable? We've fought on a number of fronts to ensure that the continuity of
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.120]  Congress is followed as the as the founders wanted it to. There's several
[39:01.120 --> 39:04.640]  people over the past several years who wanted to change the equation to have
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.440]  members of Congress appointed in the times of national turmoil if many of
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.400]  us are parish all at one fell swoop but the reality is there should be only one
[39:15.400 --> 39:20.520]  way to get to the people's house and that's through the people. And what
[39:20.520 --> 39:23.960]  about Barack Obama? I know I brought this up to you about 20 minutes ago
[39:23.960 --> 39:27.720]  during a break and I don't know if you had a chance to look at it up on Drudge
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.280]  it's also up on info wars.com but when I first saw this Friday I didn't believe
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.160]  it I called Barack Obama's national campaign the Missouri campaign it's also
[39:37.160 --> 39:44.200]  going on in Illinois Governor Blunt put out a press release calling it a police
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.640]  state and I even called the prosecutors it's not a joke this really has
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.600]  happening they're saying anybody that quote lies about Barack Obama in TV
[39:52.600 --> 39:58.440]  radio or print ads and lying they say is saying he's wants to raise taxes or
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.240]  saying he's a Muslim he's voted for it about 90 times but well sir I know I
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.680]  congressman I think I'm in the twilight zone so I'm saying to you I mean what
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.040]  is your response to this because I feel like I'm in the twilight zone well what
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.920]  what what what law do they say is being broke they say that amendment I don't
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.960]  think so they say that it's unethical in fact it'll only take one minute John you
[40:20.960 --> 40:27.800]  have that you have that NBC newscast out of St. Louis don't you yeah well I sent
[40:27.800 --> 40:31.880]  you over the weekend the ecliptic don't really seem to enter into a lot of things
[40:31.880 --> 40:38.240]  these days but it's hard to hard to believe that some some arresting body
[40:38.240 --> 40:42.640]  is picking someone up because they make another ethical statement I don't I'm
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.600]  not they say they say it's like they say it's like I tell you what John I don't
[40:47.600 --> 40:51.000]  want to play the whole newscast just play the last minute of it just cue it up
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.920]  and play it for the congressman so he can hear it okay go ahead and play it we
[40:56.920 --> 41:00.960]  want to keep this campaign focused on issues we don't want people to get
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.760]  distracted the Missourians don't want to be distracted by these devices character
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.560]  attacks so we're here to respond to any character attacks to set the record
[41:09.560 --> 41:13.320]  straight whether it is directly attributable to the campaign or to one
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.000]  of the soft money operations if they're not gonna tell the truth and somebody's
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  got to step up and say wait a minute that's not true this is the truth now
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.520]  the Obama campaign tells news for that others prosecutors and sheriffs are
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.000]  also part of the team including some from the Kansas City area and from rural
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.400]  parts of Missouri we're also told the truth squad is expected to include
[41:35.400 --> 41:40.120]  Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer live in Maplewood John Mills news for
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.960]  and then even play them that's that well I actually I do have to go because we
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.320]  have a vote on here in a minute and that sounds pretty preposterous
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.480]  treat squads are okay because you you do those in a campaign to get out there
[41:53.480 --> 41:56.960]  and mitigate any damaging thing your opponent gets out there about you but
[41:56.960 --> 41:59.960]  you don't involve law enforcement that's not part of the deal well they say it's
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.840]  for intimidation and they say that that I've called them they say no if someone's
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.280]  lying there will be a prosecution and criminal punishment and they claim it's
[42:09.280 --> 42:14.360]  like you know like you can't sell gas for two dollars more than it's actually
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.440]  going for and it's just amazing well listen thank you for so much your time
[42:19.440 --> 42:24.000]  and I hope we can have you back on again congressman from North Texas sure we
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.840]  come on talk about health care thank you sir take your full hour you bet let's do
[42:27.840 --> 42:31.920]  a full hour sometime all right thank you all right there goes congressman
[42:31.920 --> 42:36.920]  representative Michael Burgess we appreciate his time spending about 40
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.760]  minutes with us here on the air today for those who just joined us this is the
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.880]  reason we had him on John go ahead and play the clip again of him now this is
[42:47.880 --> 42:53.360]  the congressman in debate Saturday being thrown out of meetings and being told
[42:53.360 --> 42:57.320]  that martial law had been declared in the house here it is gentlemen time has
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.320]  expired the gentleman from Texas the speaker has to address address the house
[43:01.320 --> 43:04.320]  for one minute revise it extend my remarks without objection this speaker I
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.800]  also come to the floor today to talk about this $700 billion bill it's in
[43:07.800 --> 43:13.160]  front of us I use the term bill advisedly because we have seen no bill we are
[43:13.160 --> 43:17.280]  here debating talking points on perhaps what is one of the most largest the
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.360]  largest fundamental change in our nation's financial system in its history
[43:21.360 --> 43:25.280]  and House Republicans have been cut out of the process not only have we been
[43:25.280 --> 43:28.480]  cut out of the process we've also been derided by the leadership of the
[43:28.480 --> 43:32.760]  Democratic Party and called unpatriotic for not participating Mr. Speaker I
[43:32.760 --> 43:36.720]  have been thrown out of more meetings in this capital in the last 24 hours than I
[43:36.720 --> 43:42.120]  ever thought possible as a duly elected representative of 820,000 citizens of
[43:42.120 --> 43:47.840]  North Texas this speaker politics is a full-contact sport and I understand that
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.880]  but it is a full-contact sport in the light of day in the public arena since
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.840]  we didn't have hearings since we didn't have markups let's at least put this
[43:56.840 --> 44:01.600]  legislation up on the internet for 24 hours that's what Thomas was made for
[44:01.600 --> 44:05.280]  let's do that and let the American people see what we have done in the dark
[44:05.280 --> 44:10.280]  of night after all I have not gotten any more mail any more emails on any other
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.400]  subject than this one that is before us today mr. Speaker I understand we're
[44:14.400 --> 44:18.400]  under martial law is declared by the speaker last night I think it's ironic
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.520]  House Republicans have not been needed for a single thing in this house to
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.360]  assure passage for the last 22 months and today we're going to be asked to vote
[44:28.360 --> 44:32.640]  for a bill for political cover because Democrats are too weak to stand up to
[44:32.640 --> 44:34.960]  the their speaker I yield back
[44:34.960 --> 44:40.480]  gentlemen's time as it's all right let's go ahead now and play Congresswoman
[44:40.480 --> 44:46.720]  Marcy Kaptur boldly slamming the bailout bill this last weekend as well as the
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.680]  work of criminal insiders who have shut down the normal legislative process to
[44:50.680 --> 44:55.120]  commit high financial crimes and that is exactly what's happening right now
[44:55.120 --> 44:59.760]  let's go ahead and play that clip time the general woman from Ohio one minute
[44:59.760 --> 45:04.160]  mr. Speaker without objection mr. Speaker my message to the American people
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.680]  don't let Congress seal this Wall Street deal high financial crimes have been
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.880]  committed now Congress is being asked to bail out the culprits and to do so at
[45:13.880 --> 45:17.720]  the expense of those who elected us to guard their interests the people of our
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.600]  country the normal legislative process that should accompany review of a
[45:22.600 --> 45:28.000]  monumental proposal to bail out Wall Street has been shelved yes shelved only
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.560]  a few insiders are doing the dealing sounds like insider trading to me these
[45:33.560 --> 45:37.600]  criminals have so much political power they can shut down the normal legislative
[45:37.600 --> 45:41.840]  process of the highest lawmaking body in this land all the committees that should
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.400]  be scanning every word of what is being negotiated are benched and that means the
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.800]  American people are benched to we are constitutionally sworn to protect and
[45:51.800 --> 45:57.320]  defend this republic against all enemies foreign and domestic and my friends
[45:57.320 --> 46:00.680]  there are enemies we are told we will have a bill a trillion dollar bill to
[46:00.680 --> 46:05.760]  review soon and have less than 24 hours with no regular hearings to try to vote
[46:05.760 --> 46:11.400]  on this tar baby the people pushing this deal are the very same ones who were
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.520]  responsible for the implosion on Wall Street they were fraudulent then and
[46:15.520 --> 46:21.280]  they're fraudulent now we should say no to this deal I asked my colleagues to
[46:21.280 --> 46:24.960]  join us at 2 o'clock in HCA to the Capitol to meet with some real experts
[46:24.960 --> 46:28.560]  who've done financial resolutions without putting the burden on the taxpayer
[46:28.560 --> 46:34.480]  please join us HCA at 2 p.m. time the general woman has expired the gentleman
[46:34.480 --> 46:39.240]  from California absolutely amazing and she said it like it is I've got to have
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.560]  heard on the show that's how Congress should be talking about criminal
[46:43.560 --> 46:46.680]  hijacking of the republic and that's what it is then I'm gonna give everybody
[46:46.680 --> 46:52.040]  a little newsflash do you know how much money last week according to Reuters I
[46:52.040 --> 46:56.520]  covered this a lot last night most of you heard it you listen but we gonna go
[46:56.520 --> 46:59.200]  back over it today I'm gonna take the story back out of the big stack of a
[46:59.200 --> 47:02.920]  yesterday's stack and today's stack both of them are over 50 stories deep we
[47:02.920 --> 47:08.160]  haven't even gotten to them yet 940 billion dollars so while everybody's
[47:08.160 --> 47:12.520]  distracted talking about a $700 billion bailout that every expert saying is
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.680]  well over 5 trillion I mean just hundreds of experts hundreds of top
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.640]  economists have sent open letters to Congress that's in the news saying do
[47:20.640 --> 47:27.240]  not do not do not do this it's criminal and while we're busy looking at this a
[47:27.240 --> 47:33.800]  trillion plus a dollar defense bill passed just a few years ago just six
[47:33.800 --> 47:38.440]  seven years ago the defense budget was about 400 billion the last one was
[47:38.440 --> 47:45.480]  about 700 billion now the new ones a trillion for 2009 a trillion plus
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.800]  dollar and that's the on budget defense package and they passed a bunch of
[47:49.800 --> 47:54.360]  sanctions against Iran Friday while everybody was busy talking about the
[47:54.360 --> 48:00.200]  bailout which is not a bailout it gives dictatorial power to Paulson it gives
[48:00.200 --> 48:04.520]  them immunity from all the crimes they've committed and this is the very
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.320]  crew that has orchestrated all of this and remember you could pay off all the
[48:09.320 --> 48:14.960]  mortgages for around a hundred billion dollars that have been insolvent or even
[48:14.960 --> 48:21.160]  have a problem so understand the problem is not the mortgages it is all the
[48:21.160 --> 48:23.640]  hundreds of different types of derivatives and hundreds of other
[48:23.640 --> 48:28.640]  different types of paper instruments that are worse than junk bonds at least a
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.960]  junk bond is some frivolous speculative company you know where they claim their
[48:33.960 --> 48:37.160]  manufacturing something or claim they're making something or doing something
[48:37.160 --> 48:40.160]  and those are bad enough people go to prison for that like the Keating five
[48:40.160 --> 48:46.880]  except for John McCain running at all he didn't him and his mobbed up family but
[48:46.880 --> 48:53.400]  with this it's even worse than that it's it's it's basically one type of
[48:53.400 --> 48:58.160]  derivatives is junk bonds then leverage this triple a assets insured by
[48:58.160 --> 49:04.280]  different unsavory organizations like AIG who insured all this crap this
[49:04.280 --> 49:11.520]  poisonous carcinogen laden garbage and then they leverage it out again and
[49:11.520 --> 49:16.640]  then repackage what they leverage it's just unspeakable and there's over one
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.360]  quadrillion that's over a thousand trillion in these derivatives that we
[49:22.360 --> 49:29.480]  know of now that's what we know of and what are they doing with the hundreds
[49:29.480 --> 49:33.240]  of billions they're sucking out through the Federal Reserve from the American
[49:33.240 --> 49:36.880]  taxpayers every single week what are they doing in the year and a half long
[49:36.880 --> 49:41.760]  bailout that we've been seeing of the what what are they doing they are
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.320]  taking that money and rating the rest of the real economy they are running
[49:45.320 --> 49:51.840]  around victorially going after companies and corporations our entire of
[49:51.840 --> 49:57.360]  future is being sucked dry by this the bailout is the coup de grace it is the
[49:57.360 --> 50:03.220]  liability protection it is the immunity that the crooks need and you just heard
[50:03.220 --> 50:06.800]  a republican congressman tell you that you just heard a democrat congressman
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.160]  tell you that congresswoman here on this show both from audio from the floor
[50:11.160 --> 50:18.600]  and physically on the radio show we had the congressman from Texas Burgesson so
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.320]  I have a lot of news I want to cover I also have these Obama truth squads
[50:22.320 --> 50:26.280]  threatening police action just unprecedented and I have not weighed in
[50:26.280 --> 50:29.640]  for John McCain or Barack Obama saying they're both complete new older puppets
[50:29.640 --> 50:36.720]  but this is something new and I tell you it really makes what Webster Tarpley
[50:36.720 --> 50:42.280]  said have a lot of weight to it and then I had a call for the show who was not
[50:42.280 --> 50:48.520]  joking yesterday because I know him named Cooper saying yeah he wants to have
[50:48.520 --> 50:53.640]  Tarpley arrested for talking bad about Obama so that shows that the mind
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.480]  control is in full swing we'll talk about that as well very important

[54:18.280 --> 54:28.680]  1-800-259-9231 I want to go ahead and just play this St. Louis TV station
[54:28.680 --> 54:33.080]  piece about this and then I made phone calls of Barack Obama campaign this is
[54:33.080 --> 54:38.520]  going on in other states as well I made calls to several of these offices and
[54:38.520 --> 54:42.960]  they say yeah if somebody lies about Barack Obama if somebody has a
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.760]  bumper sticker saying he's a Muslim which is up for you know to be questioned
[54:47.760 --> 54:51.680]  the point is he's been very deceptive and I'm not getting into whether he's a
[54:51.680 --> 54:55.120]  Muslim or not the point is is he really does have terrorist eyes he really does
[54:55.120 --> 55:00.000]  have ties to weathermen he really does have you know a lot of these issues are
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.400]  real but even if they're not people have a right to say whatever they want and
[55:03.400 --> 55:08.120]  then Barack Obama wants to sue them and take them to court and prove that then
[55:08.120 --> 55:12.680]  he can get a judgment but if you send out the police is true squads to start
[55:12.680 --> 55:17.200]  arresting people or intimidating them it's just unprecedented and it really is
[55:17.200 --> 55:22.560]  going on and it is fascism here it is senator Barack Obama's presidential
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.160]  campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or
[55:27.160 --> 55:31.520]  runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign this was John
[55:31.520 --> 55:34.120]  Mills is live at the county election board in Maplewood he's been learning
[55:34.120 --> 55:38.080]  more about which members of law enforcement are getting involved in
[55:38.080 --> 55:41.600]  this John tell us more about this Russell good evening prosecutors and
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.240]  sheriffs from across Missouri are joining something called the Barack
[55:45.240 --> 55:50.720]  Obama truth squad two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team we
[55:50.720 --> 55:54.640]  met them this afternoon in the central west and they are Jennifer Joyce from
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.600]  the city Bob McCullough the st. Louis County prosecuting attorney they will
[55:58.600 --> 56:03.640]  be reminding voters that Barack Obama is a Christian who wants to cut taxes for
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.680]  anyone making less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year they also
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.560]  say they plan to respond immediately to any ads and statements that might
[56:12.560 --> 56:19.560]  violate Missouri ethics laws we want to keep this campaign focused on issues we
[56:19.560 --> 56:22.800]  don't want people to get distracted the Missourians don't want to be distracted
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.600]  by these divisive character attacks so we're here to respond to any character
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.920]  attacks to set the record straight whether it is directly attributable to
[56:31.920 --> 56:35.680]  the campaign or to one of the soft money operations if they're not going to tell
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.040]  the truth and somebody's got to step up and say wait a minute that's not true
[56:39.040 --> 56:44.440]  this is the truth now the Obama campaign tells news for that others
[56:44.440 --> 56:48.560]  prosecutors and sheriffs are also part of the team including some from the
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.240]  Kansas City area and from rural parts of Missouri we're also told the truth's
[56:53.240 --> 56:58.040]  quad is expected to include Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer live in
[56:58.040 --> 57:02.720]  Maplewood John Mills news for all right so what's happening here is this is so
[57:02.720 --> 57:06.160]  over-the-top people can't believe it and I don't blame you I didn't believe it
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.080]  Friday either made phone calls Friday and Saturday and then Webster Tarpley
[57:10.080 --> 57:15.680]  now has press releases out and the names of one guy up in Vermont who just
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.960]  nicely was a liberal by the way walked up to Barack Obama group on the side of
[57:20.960 --> 57:24.000]  the road there at the town square and said well he's tied into Brazilian
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  Brzezinski and basically wants more war and the women basically called the
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.440]  police on him and he was arrested and the police said look you're not allowed to
[57:32.440 --> 57:38.560]  lie about him he's not for war so they're calling it ethics that they're out
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.440]  of their minds let me just tell the police something you're not allowed to
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.320]  arrest people or to threaten to arrest them this is one of the highest forms of
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.920]  tyranny and I can't believe I have to sit here and explain to you in Vermont and
[57:51.920 --> 57:56.600]  Illinois and Missouri and other places I can't believe I have to sit here and
[57:56.600 --> 57:59.880]  explain to you that it's called the First Amendment I mean it's enough to
[57:59.880 --> 58:04.920]  stick us in cages at demonstrations and not let the media see us it's enough of
[58:04.920 --> 58:09.320]  what you've done but now to openly say that well if you if you're made aware of
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.360]  something you're gonna go investigate you're gonna go after them and you heard
[58:13.360 --> 58:21.160]  them say that for being unethical you're not judge jury and executioner a court
[58:21.160 --> 58:28.360]  has to decide that later and it's a civil matter but the globalist are
[58:28.360 --> 58:31.920]  masters they make us hate George Bush make everything about him and even the
[58:31.920 --> 58:35.240]  cops and people want something new so they say well we're gonna take your
[58:35.240 --> 58:39.560]  rights away because Barack Obama is a great guy this is unbelievable stay with

[59:00.680 --> 59:04.520]  the New World Order I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage was
[59:04.520 --> 59:11.640]  engineered by you David Rockefeller that's for a lateral commission to see if we stop
[59:11.640 --> 59:16.520]  asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at
[59:16.520 --> 59:21.160]  our own door seven years after the attacks of September 11th the global
[59:21.160 --> 59:31.240]  awakening has taken place an inside job how dare you if you know that there's
[59:31.240 --> 59:36.880]  treason going on and you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[59:36.880 --> 59:41.880]  if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11
[59:41.880 --> 59:46.840]  please rise download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD
[59:46.840 --> 59:52.480]  at infowars.com it's now time to take the revolution of the next level
[59:52.480 --> 1:00:01.000]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:12.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:20.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:26.200]  Alex Jones we all know that both parties are bought and paid for by the
[1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:30.000]  very same private banking interest that have now orchestrated the ongoing
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:35.160]  collapse of the financial economy and the real economy to terrorize the public
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:40.440]  with threats of depression into giving them godlike imperial powers and
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:47.680]  immunity from their crimes and trillions of our taxpayer money and when you end
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:51.080]  up attacking a John McCain or Barack Obama it only strengthens the overall
[1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:55.560]  structure because they they keep everything controlled in that paradigm
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:00.400]  so that you never get outside the box and attack the overall new world order
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:05.080]  system but when we see John McCain come out and say I think we should use US
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:09.040]  troops to fight crime in the United States that's them getting you ready for
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:13.120]  martial law and then Barack Obama says the same thing people say well then who
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:17.040]  do you vote for but when you have Barack Obama come out and have police in
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:21.680]  Vermont Illinois and Missouri and have them go on the news and say if you lie
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:25.360]  about Barack Obama and say he's a Muslim which we don't know that's true or not
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:29.600]  oh it doesn't matter if it's true or not it's your right to say it and his dad he
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:33.280]  certainly was he did go to Muslim schools he was born outside the country
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:36.400]  these are legitimate questions just like the questions have been raised about
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:41.160]  McCain being born in the Panama Canal military zone and he says he was born at
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:45.280]  a US military base that didn't exist till seven years after he was born he's a
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:51.440]  liar but it wouldn't matter if it was a lie that he was not born in the US
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:57.600]  territory either one of them if I wanted to say they were born on Pluto to Santa
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:04.400]  Claus's reindeer then it would be my right to say that Dasher and Blitzen
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:14.960]  gave birth to John McCain it's not true but it's first amendment right so
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:20.120]  the bottom line here is by the way I'll before I forget get Dr. Corsi on
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:23.560]  call and see we get him on a day or tomorrow I know he's scared to death to
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:26.160]  come on admitted his publishers been trying to block him for the last few
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:29.240]  months I'm coming on here because it became a New York Times article about
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:32.840]  his interviews here but he promised to come on in a month and that was over a
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:36.160]  month ago so calling I just want 10 15 minutes because I want him to
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:40.320]  specifically comment on this too they never really go after him on his facts
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:46.560]  if you read carefully they just say he's a right-wing extremist liar on and on
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:53.000]  and on and then I get a call last night from a guy named Trooper that's his
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  nickname who's a well-known Austrian fixture on talk radio ever since I
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:05.120]  moved here in 1991 and I've met him more than 10 or 15 times at events and he's
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:10.160]  even come to some of my events he called in I thought it was a joke and he
[1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:14.120]  was yelling and screaming so much that we weren't trying to screen his call we
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:18.160]  were just like hello what's your first name blah blah blah I'm Trooper I want
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:21.640]  to get that Webster Tarpley I wanted this and that so I put him on he was
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:24.320]  saying I want to come down there and arrest Webster Tarple and I said well
[1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:29.000]  Webster is in studio with us he's in he's in Washington DC or he's in on the
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.840]  suburb of DC in Maryland I said he can't come on and I mean he's not here
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:38.880]  physically and he said well I'd come down there and arrest him myself and I
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:42.320]  said you're joking right it's his first amendment he said no it's a bunch of
[1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:50.440]  lies and he needs to be arrested and I said but it's his first amendment he
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:56.400]  said I don't care I'm sick of these bush people and he did make one half salient
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:00.360]  point that made some sense well they would have beaten the daylights out of
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:03.920]  you at the RNC like they did everybody but they didn't at the DNC in Denver
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:08.080]  that's because the Democrats are good and the Republicans are bad by the way I
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:12.760]  remember Trooper a decade ago was a you know more of a Republican so I'm going
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:17.680]  whoa man I'm like listen you know that's not a scientific point you're
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:20.920]  making you know it could just be that police force or who was managing that
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:27.160]  but you can at least be partially taken at face value but I mean he was frothing
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:32.200]  sputtering so mad he was screaming at the guy answering the phone
[1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:37.280]  jaren who was just answering the phone to put him in queue hello what's first
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:45.160]  thing were you calling from so just out of control and none of you
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:52.120]  Barack Obama supporters can back up what you're saying and I don't know what
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:55.520]  to do about this I mean this is unprecedented is this an idea of what

[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.640]  everything is intensifying Israel openly talking about hitting Iran in the

[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:15.240]  election this is a crazy time Governor Ventura will be on it noon

[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:47.080]  have pleasure in the success we're having waking people up because it's all
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:50.120]  collapsing no wonder people are listening now like ever before because
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:53.360]  everything we talked about is coming true but I have no pleasure in being
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:58.000]  right I've said over and over again unfortunately we're right about all
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.480]  this and why is it unfortunate because our analysis is scary the facts are
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.920]  hardcore and a lot of people in the middle class and others are waking up
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:11.600]  but you talk to just average folks on the street they laugh at you still with
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:16.080]  that with that self-satisfied pre-programmed grin if you bring up
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.080]  any issues to me if they're just meant like I've had none of that exist you know
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:24.480]  they're all into living in denial and they got another thing coming they got
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:28.880]  a rude awakening coming up for him now I said I take phone calls up for those
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:32.640]  that don't know this is such a big deal I know some stations just take the
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:37.040]  second third and fourth hour that they missed the first one more time today I'm
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:42.000]  gonna air this channel four piece out of St. Louis listen carefully because if
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.240]  you read not called these offices that you hear mentioned or you can call them
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:51.040]  they say if you have a bumper sticker saying Obama's a Muslim you're gonna
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:57.000]  get a police visit if you run an ad saying he's for taxes to raise taxes or
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.920]  anti-gun you get a police visit now listen they announced like it's no big
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:06.000]  deal in the media is like positive and man this is good you know the whole way
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.320]  they phrase it that if you lie and of course the police they decide no judge
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:17.080]  no jury no civil suit they decide if it's unethical we say it's unethical and
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:22.200]  we're gonna come out and we're going to give you a police visit and I'm getting
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:25.160]  people calling me emailing me saying that's right Alex you need to be
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:29.760]  arrested too if you don't like the fact that we're gonna do this you need to be
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:33.760]  arrested or your guests need to be arrested because we're not gonna let the
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:40.200]  evil bushes win with McCain so I guess Webster Tarpolis right with McCain the
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:44.360]  government's a dead duck no one believes it it's hollow it's hated but with
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.200]  Barack Obama he's got dark skin that's the only thing different it's like coke
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:55.440]  putting a new cover on its tin can on its aluminum can and you know he's gonna
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:13:01.280]  he's skinny and he's young and then he and that's it we're foreign and I've
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:05.000]  tried to stay out of this but this Barack Obama business and I did go and
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.560]  pull up his quotes I did go and pull legislation he tried to pass in Illinois
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:16.200]  he wants to ban all 308 rifles he wants to ban all 223 I mean I knew he was
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:23.640]  anti-gun but I guess I hadn't looked this guy this guy's a monster and you
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:27.560]  know what I will talk about him all I want and I will say his daddy was a
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:31.040]  Muslim and I don't get into that whole Muslim bashing thing the point is he's
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.080]  lying about that and he did go to Muslim schools and he was born outside this
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:39.480]  country and you know what people have a right to say that number one it's true
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:44.440]  but even if it was a lie I will fight for anybody's right I will fight for
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:51.400]  people's right to you know say lies about me I will fight for people's right to
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:55.560]  do all sorts of things until it becomes criminal like creating fake websites
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:59.760]  that I supposedly run and then you know in my name saying kill this person kill
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:03.080]  that person and attempt to get me arrested or to get my material taken
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:07.960]  off YouTube and Google but if somebody does something like that that's
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.520]  something else but no they're saying radio TV and print ads and that the
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:17.040]  police the prosecutors they will decide this is going on in three states
[1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:26.920]  Illinois Missouri and and Vermont that we know of here it is oh I forgot John

[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:44.040]  senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law

[1:25:55.640 --> 1:26:00.200]  all approximately 30 telephone conversations with their office in the
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:03.680]  totality of the six years that i've been dealing with them and there's been
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:07.720]  several issues i've brought before them while i called them back after waiting
[1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:11.160]  and waiting they were supposed to send me a file and i said you know where's this
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:16.120]  file it's coming from dc so i waited two months which is in this time frame now i
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:19.600]  call back i said look i'm upset i don't know how to be politically correct i
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:23.080]  never threatened anyone's property or life and i told the ladies there i don't
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:27.880]  appreciate and they hung up on me because they don't like my free speech i told
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:32.080]  them i'm not politically correct now i read nowhere in our constitution that i
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:35.480]  have to be politically correct i cannot threaten anyone's life or property i
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:39.760]  did not do so so what they did is they called the uh... fb i i mean
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.480]  the fb i referred it to the local police department of the town where the
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:45.320]  office is located
[1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:48.400]  they sent two detectives with guns to my property
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:50.800]  cast me about mccook
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:53.600]  well yeah you're not allowed to even believe the bailouts happening you're
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:55.480]  not allowed to believe that
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:59.920]  uh... russia didn't want to sneak attack on georgia you're not allowed to believe
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:01.300]  a fellow reserve
[1:27:01.300 --> 1:27:02.200]  is private

[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:06.840]  they're telling us look
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:10.920]  your freedom doesn't exist to say it does is a conspiracy
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:14.120]  now sit down and shut up
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:17.200]  yes that's basically so what did they say they showed up and they said are you
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:18.160]  a cook
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:21.360]  well that i asked them i go well you know what kind of to you know they said
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.880]  well we're here to check on you to make sure you you know you don't have video
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:25.920]  cameras all over the place you're not a cook
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:29.920]  and then they asked me oh yeah oh i love it they put video cameras stop stop
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:31.360]  stop stop stop
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:33.360]  they put video cameras all over you
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:36.440]  but then i've noticed when we have cameras are actually arresting people all
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:41.720]  over for cameras on their houses calling it is dropping on police but go ahead
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:45.480]  well here's the thing alex uh... my last statement to this congressman's
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:48.000]  office on the last day of last call
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.360]  i asked them that i posted as a question
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:53.640]  what if i come to your office with a video crew
[1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:57.200]  and i come there to ask you why i'm not getting representation
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:27:59.680]  and the lady firmly told me
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:02.920]  that you will be arrested
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:05.720]  so you're not allowed to go to your congressman's office so so the police
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:06.480]  were there
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:08.640]  implying that video cameras were weapons
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:11.120]  you know we have video of that in uh...
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.000]  truth rising they come up the police and and and grab the camera and say
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.400]  cameras are now gone
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:18.480]  right
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:19.760]  well furthermore
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:22.720]  you know i made no threat i had a look what i understand you make you you've
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:26.360]  made that point like twenty times so i want to be clear so i won't give me
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.200]  keep saying if you like that people heard you what ended up happening
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:33.520]  well right now i called back the detectives i put in three calls to their
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:36.520]  office they finally turn my call okay what's going on because i was threatened
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:37.920]  with the restraining order
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:40.720]  by these detectives when they showed up that they want by all restraining order
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:41.800]  against me
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:44.960]  uh... the employees of the office congressman's office
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.640]  and i and i'm like uh... well what's going on with that oh as far as we're
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:52.680]  concerned our cases closed there's no criminal action against you
[1:28:52.680 --> 1:28:55.480]  so i still have no clue as to what's going on they come here
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:58.120]  would come to scare the living out of me
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:28:59.760]  and threatened me
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:00.400]  with
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:05.080]  you know sanctions or whatever what specifically did they say to you
[1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:08.440]  uh... well they specifically said that they want to fight with the first
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:09.920]  introduced themselves
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:14.400]  they said we're here in regards to your calls to congressman's office
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:18.200]  and i'm like okay and then they want to read the ladies in that office said they
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:20.000]  fear you
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:23.320]  and i said well they've never met me
[1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:24.800]  how can they fear me

[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:36.440]  constitutes being a cook sir

[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:42.720]  all right well you should write it up into a story format with all the names

[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:55.200]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:58.200]  You'd better get down in your head.
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:04.200]  This world is ruled by violence.
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:07.200]  But I guess I better let it run thin.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:09.200]  This world is ruled by violence.
[1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:13.200]  From the wrong way to the milking way.
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:16.200]  That's a lot of territory and deals.
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:18.200]  And a man.
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:26.200]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:28.200]  We are back live.
[1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:30.200]  I want to hurry through your calls.
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:34.200]  We've got Bob Daisy coming in studio later to give us a take on the New World Order's criminal banking actions.
[1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:38.200]  From his perspective, I've got a lot of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:40.200]  But let's hurry through your phone calls.
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:42.200]  Oh, I briefly wanted to say something.
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:46.200]  I don't control who streams my radio show out on their own websites.
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:54.200]  In fact, I'm glad when people add links to listen to my radio show from our servers at infowars.com.
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:02.200]  And I'm sure Ken in California is a wonderful guy.
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:06.200]  But he said I'm an affiliate.
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:08.200]  So I thought it was our affiliate KCAA.
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:10.200]  Or I thought it was the one in Needles.
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:12.200]  One that goes into San Diego.
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:14.200]  People think of that term affiliate.
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:20.200]  And they think, oh, it's one of the owners or managers of a radio station.
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:26.200]  And the same thing has happened with other people that take the feed of Ted Anderson's radio network.
[1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:28.200]  Genesis or my radio show.
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:34.200]  And that's why Ted and myself included have gotten tired of that.
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.200]  Because we'll have people that pick up our feeds, send them out, and then call themselves an affiliate.
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:41.200]  Like they're an AM or FM station.
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:45.200]  See, an AM or FM station, they get part of the commercials.
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:47.200]  They get to run those locally.
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.200]  And there's an agreement signed between us.
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:55.200]  That is not what's happening with internet.
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:57.200]  And so people, there's a whole bunch that have done it.
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:03.200]  Will take the shows, sell the ads, run them over us, and even represent themselves as us to people.
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:07.200]  And you'll, you know, an advertiser will call you up, griping at you, going, my ads not running.
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:10.200]  And you go, well, you're not an advertiser of my show.
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:13.200]  And they'll say, yes, I am.
[1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:16.200]  And then you find out it's an internet radio outfit.
[1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:18.200]  And then you tell people, hey, you can't do that.
[1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:21.200]  And they scream, my first amendment, my first amendment.
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:28.200]  Hey, listen, your first amendment doesn't mean you can come sit in my house and sit in my easy chair and sit at my table and say you're me.
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:36.200]  Doesn't mean you can get my social security number and run around and buy things in my name.
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:40.200]  And so that's why I've gotten a bigger and bigger problem.
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:49.200]  There are people who sell all my videos, all of them on one desk, totally cruddy quality, for like $5.
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:52.200]  And we pretty much ignore it, but then that isn't enough for them.
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:57.200]  They're like, you're going to advertise for free that I'm undercutting you so you can't operate.
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:36:59.200]  Well, no, I'm not going to.
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:02.200]  Well, that's censorship.
[1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:08.200]  So I think we've been too nice in a lot of respects with people.
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:16.200]  And that's going to be changing because you give somebody an inch, they take it a mile, as it has been said.
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:17.200]  And that's what happens.
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:22.200]  I love the people that come and try to take advantage of us or try to take over the little things we're doing.
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:29.200]  And we're like, hey, you don't get to tell me what to do or you don't get to come on my show while you talk crap about me and promote yourself.
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:36.200]  And they go, yes, we are. We just want to get along while we spew lies about you.
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:40.200]  Well, we just want to tell a bunch of lies about you and then have you promote us.
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:42.200]  And we're like, well, what are you talking about?
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:43.200]  I'm like five-year-old children.
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:45.200]  They whine and cry and suck their thumbs.
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:47.200]  That's why you've got losers and winners.
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:56.200]  You've got people that are negative, backstabbing, wicked scum who think this is a good movement for them to pile onto.
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:59.200]  And then they wonder why, and within just a few months, nobody works with them.
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:06.200]  And it's because people of quality don't work with scum.
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:13.200]  So just a side program note with the economy coming down around us, everything else that's happening.
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:18.200]  I am tired of people holding themselves out as me.
[1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:23.200]  I mean, I get videos in the mail every day that are copies of my films.
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:28.200]  And the people say, hey, I bought this video. It's got your address on it. You need to return.
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:30.200]  It doesn't work.
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:35.200]  We call them back and we say, well, that's somebody else that's making copies and selling the film.
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:41.200]  And sometimes people are selling thousands of them because they sell them for nothing, basically.
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:43.200]  And we've even called them before.
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:45.200]  There have been probably 50-something groups doing this.
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:50.200]  And we say, look, Alex says you can make copies of the films for nonprofit educational purposes.
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:54.200]  And we really turn a blind eye to people selling them for a few bucks.
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:56.200]  But that's to get the word out.
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:00.200]  We can't pay for bad videos you're shipping out in our name.
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:03.200]  They're like, shut up. I've always hated you, you bastard.
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:09.200]  I would just make a little money off your name.
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:11.200]  And it's like, whoa.
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:19.200]  Man, that is so, so, so just understand, folks, that we have a lot of people holding themselves out as us.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:23.200]  And they do it with internet radio.
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:27.200]  They do it with just a host of others' ways.
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:30.200]  And it becomes a problem.
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:32.200]  We have them holding themselves out.
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:37.200]  People go over all over the web talking about black people or Jews in our name.
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:40.200]  Or they run around and they make stuff up.
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:42.200]  Or they go and manipulate weak-minded people.
[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:44.200]  They go and attack other people in my name.
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.200]  And then the fools end up attacking me thinking, you know, people work for me.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:51.200]  It's all dirty tricks, but it's not working.
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  We are reaching tens of millions of people right now.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:05.200]  And folks need to understand because we are effective for government reasons, disinformation reasons, jealousy reasons, mental illness reasons.
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:09.200]  There are a lot of people swarming around me right now.
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:11.200]  And let me tell you, it's not fun.
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:15.200]  But it is a byproduct of success.
[1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:17.200]  And so I'm committed to this fight.
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:19.200]  I knew this type of stuff would happen.
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:21.200]  It's always been happening, but not at this level.
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:30.200]  And so everybody just pray for us and just remember when you hear hundreds of different curves attacking us from every angle,
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:36.200]  they're either government paid or they're just jealous of people that actually have a huge audience.
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.200]  Folks, it's a great responsibility.
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:42.200]  I don't know what these jealous people are so angry or so upset about.
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:45.200]  And they send me emails going, you know, it doesn't matter.
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:48.200]  Celebrities, why are you always having celebrities on?
[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:49.200]  That's bad.
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:51.200]  You know, who cares about celebrities?
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:54.200]  Well, then why are you emailing me about how we have celebrities on here?
[1:40:54.200 --> 1:41:04.200]  No, it matters when we have a governor or a movie star or a former president on from, say, you know, another nation to say 9-11's an inside job,
[1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:07.200]  because that shows people it's high profile.
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:09.200]  Of course, celebrities matter.
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:20.200]  Why do you think they'll pay millions of dollars to have some celebrity pitched cell phones or millions of dollars to the Steve McQueen estate to have him in Mustang ads last year?
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:23.200]  Or why do you think Paul Newman's salad dressing did so well?
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:36.200]  Don't sit there and act like children and throw fits about the fact that so many celebrities, by the way, seek us out and come on this show.
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:37.200]  They care.
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:38.200]  They want to be part of history.
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:43.200]  They want to be more than just rock and roll stars or movie stars.
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:45.200]  They want to be known for serious issues.
[1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:49.200]  They know they want their celebrity to count for something.
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:58.200]  You know, when the establishment and when the federal government through the studio system fully controlled the movie stars, they were kept on short leashes.
[1:41:58.200 --> 1:41:59.200]  They loved them.
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:04.200]  The government invented the movie stars being part of political action.
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:15.200]  But as soon as they got independent in the last 30 years and got away from the studio system now, oh, who cares what a movie star thinks?
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:18.200]  We would be fools not to have movie stars on this show.
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:28.200]  We would be fools not to have celebrities on this show to talk about issues that we agree with, to garner support for the Liberty Movement against the New World Order.
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:32.200]  And so anybody that criticizes that is a jackass.
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:38.200]  They are filled with jealousy or their feds and shame on all of them as well.
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:45.200]  But yes, celebrities popping up and that's accelerating on this radio show is also driving.
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:46.200]  I have to say it's sad.
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:50.200]  I would like to think most of the attacks on this radio show are by government operatives.
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:53.200]  But sadly, ladies and gentlemen, it's not.
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:43:00.200]  It is by people burning with absolute envy and jealousy over what?
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:02.200]  I've got the biggest target painted on my back.
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:03.200]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now.
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:08.200]  Let's go to Scott in Arizona, then Karmie, Rourke, John, Graham and others.
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:09.200]  Go ahead, Scott.
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:10.200]  You're on the air.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  Hey, Alex.
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:12.200]  How you doing, buddy?
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:13.200]  Good.
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:14.200]  What do you want about the bailout scam?
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:17.200]  Barack Obama's people saying arrest those that criticizing?
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:19.200]  Yeah, that guy's a scumbag.
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:24.200]  I don't want to talk about him, but I do want to talk about the bailout.
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:30.200]  You, like what Webster said, I want to get your take on it.
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:35.200]  His idea of the $15 billion per state, even though we know that problem never happened.
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:39.200]  I just want to see if that is realistic, because it sounded like a great deal.
[1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:44.200]  What happens is the fake conservatives say that's socialism.
[1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:50.200]  I tend to agree that that's a bad idea, but it's much better than just giving it to the
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:51.200]  bankers.
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:52.200]  I agree.
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:55.200]  I mean, we're paying for it.
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:57.200]  We're paying for it.
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:43:58.200]  Yeah.
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:43:59.200]  Listen to me.
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:03.200]  If Wall Street failed, let them swallow up each other, and we gave $15 billion to each
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:04.200]  state.
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:05.200]  What would that do?
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:07.200]  I mean, that would create jobs for everybody, at least if we're going to, if we're going
[1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:09.200]  to, we would suffer if we don't have nothing.
[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:13.200]  But if we let them fail, at least we're giving us something and return for our tax dollars.
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:15.200]  Well, I'll tell you the biggest outrage.
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:20.200]  We need a story about it on Info Wars or Prison Planet or InfoWars.net.
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:24.200]  And that is that the Congress, the parties, aren't stupid.
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:25.200]  Paulson's not stupid.
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:32.200]  Normally, if Greenspan passed gas at the lectern before the House judiciary, I mean, the House
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:35.200]  Banking Committee, the stock market would crash.
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:39.400]  Now they're saying, depression, depression, depression, depression, depression, unless
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:40.400]  you pass this.
[1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:43.440]  I mean, you talk about yelling fire in a theater.
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:48.560]  They are screaming fire in a theater for the entire economic system.
[1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:50.200]  It's pure terrorism.
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:51.600]  It is economic terrorism.
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.240]  They arrest people in Europe and Hong Kong and places for that.
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:57.600]  In fact, they have been for trying to create a run on the market.
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:00.480]  And by the way, last time I checked, I'm going to look it up, the market was just in free
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:01.480]  fall this morning.
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:04.600]  Let me just look that up right now.
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:11.240]  So absolutely, I mean, if they're going to have a bailout, why shouldn't it go into
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:12.360]  the real economy?
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:15.520]  But see, the government's so corrupt locally, they're going to steal it all up for themselves
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:16.520]  too.
[1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:17.920]  You're not going to get any of it, okay?
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:20.640]  This is a country run by criminals for criminals.
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:21.640]  Yeah.
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:22.640]  I know.
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:23.640]  They're just trying to make it look good.
[1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:26.920]  I mean, it's going to crash regardless and I just don't know why they just don't let
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:27.920]  the whole thing crash.
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:30.640]  I mean, this is what they want anyway, just let it crash.
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:31.640]  Absolutely.
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:32.640]  I appreciate your call.
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:38.640]  The problem is they'll then tell the domesticated cattle that it's the fault of people that
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:39.640]  didn't want the bailout.
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:42.440]  And then they'll get an even bigger one after that.
[1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:49.440]  So it's between a rock and a hard place, the, oh, it's incredible.
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:56.440]  Let's go ahead and take another call, Karmie in Kent, and I guess Kent's in England, Kentucky.
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:58.440]  Okay, go ahead.
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:00.320]  It said Kent here on my screen.
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:01.520]  Go ahead.
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:02.840]  Can you hear me?
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:03.840]  Loud and clear.
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:04.840]  Yes.
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:08.200]  You are so right on.
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:13.240]  You are so right on about everything.
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:23.000]  And I listened to the show when Colonel Oliver North came through and was confronted and
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.440]  there were people arrested through, it was the best show here.
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:31.760]  They peacefully on video, they later got the video back from the cops.
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:35.400]  They peacefully asked questions in line and they were arrested for it.
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:42.120]  I know every, oh, you are so right on about everything.
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:47.920]  I am so impressed with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:53.880]  His opinion had been listening and thumbs up, dear.
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:55.480]  I don't know what else to say.
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:56.640]  Well, thumbs up to you.
[1:46:56.640 --> 1:46:57.640]  You know, I wish.
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:01.800]  Oh, well, we're sitting here in the middle of it all.
[1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:06.040]  We got front row seats to some very painful times.
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:07.040]  Thank you for the call.
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:09.840]  Folks, you ain't seen nothing yet with the economy.
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:11.800]  Roark in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:12.800]  Hi, Alex.
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:13.800]  Hello.
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:18.960]  I mean, I know we've identified the problem.
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:21.960]  I don't think we're getting close to any kind of solution now.
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:22.960]  There isn't.
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:23.960]  We were overrun by criminals.
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:26.120]  Well, you know, then we need to do something.
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:27.120]  We need to organize.
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:30.280]  I think we need to attack the television system.
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:36.160]  I'm sorry, I talk to people in the largest politics channel on IRC every day.
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:38.320]  I see how they respond to the television.
[1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:39.960]  They just can't escape it.
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:42.320]  I think we need to destroy the television system.
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:43.320]  It's a huge liability.
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:46.200]  All you have to do is go out there and cut some cables.
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:49.920]  I know it's illegal, but at this point, I don't care.
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:52.200]  And I think organization is a thing.
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:56.280]  Okay, listen, sir, the last thing we want is to escalate this into violence.
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:00.120]  The enemy had to bomb their own federal building and fly remote control aircraft into the
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:04.600]  towers just to, to, to, you know, in the name of keeping the people safe.
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:07.680]  You see, and I appreciate your call, but I'm not going to have calls for violence here
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:08.680]  on my show.
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:09.680]  Okay.
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:10.680]  It is not going to happen.
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:11.680]  Okay.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:16.400]  I got a lot of people mad at me because I'm not calling for shooting, but I noticed the
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:20.360]  people calling for that are never out shooting.
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:21.840]  They're just saying, we need to do this.
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:22.840]  We need to do that.
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:24.640]  I know you're not saying shooting.
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:25.640]  Here's the deal.
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:27.120]  They knew we'd rebel against this tyranny.
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:31.520]  So they preemptively carried out terror attacks to set up an apparatus to suppress that.
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:37.600]  Now, I don't think they can successfully suppress a, a wide-scale rebellion, but they don't
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:38.600]  intend to.
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:43.000]  They want us to chew up the military and chew up the local police and then use an international
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.600]  peacekeeping force after six months to two years of depression.
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:50.880]  You don't think the globalists aren't happy just to let everybody starve to death?
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:55.720]  Do you know how domesticated and slack-jawed this population is?
[1:48:55.720 --> 1:49:01.080]  90 plus percent of them, around 95% of the public, are not self-sufficient.
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:03.880]  Do you know what it'll look like if the society breaks down?
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:09.400]  That's exactly what these people are looking for, and that's exactly what they want.
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:13.760]  A bunch of dead cops laying around in the street, shot up with dear rivals, is not the
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  answer.
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:18.560]  And I know you're not saying that, but I'm hearing it on Limbaugh.
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:20.880]  I'm hearing it on Shot Hannity.
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:24.360]  For some reason, these national shows are allowing people to call in.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:25.360]  I've been hearing it.
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:28.640]  I monitor talk radio every day when I'm in the car and when I'm getting ready in the
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:32.400]  morning and when I'm on the bicycle or whatever.
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:40.240]  And I'm hearing it everywhere, if they bail them out, I'm going to start shooting.
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:45.640]  Well that is not what we want, and I'm very suspect of the national neocon shows that
[1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:53.120]  heavily censor their phone calls and heavily screen them that this is suddenly being said
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:54.120]  by a whole bunch of people.
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:55.880]  This is very, very suspect.
[1:49:55.880 --> 1:50:01.280]  I'm not trying to get in the fight with you, Roark.
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:03.280]  It's just cutting TV lines.
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:09.800]  I mean, you know what they'll do if people ran out and started cutting television cables?
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:14.640]  First off, a lot of you get electrocuted doing that.
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:19.400]  They're going to use crap like that to come arrest people like me.
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:22.480]  We need to stop them launching a war for a distraction.
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.520]  We're at a great danger for them staging terror attacks right now.
[1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:29.000]  I also want to put that alert out.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.240]  We're at a heightened state of alert for the new world order to stage terror.
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:40.280]  The last thing we need is a bunch of craziness.
[1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:45.760]  You know, never, never on the offensive, ladies and gentlemen, always for defense.
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:51.360]  A lot of you that want violence, I don't think a lot of you have actually seen it.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:53.720]  I don't think a lot of you have actually been around it.
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:54.720]  I haven't been around that much.
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:56.760]  Let me tell you, I don't like it.
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:50:58.240]  You don't think I don't have a big can of whoop-ash?
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:02.400]  It doesn't mean I want to open it up.
[1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:04.240]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:08.880]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:09.880]  by you.
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:11.280]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:16.080]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:19.760]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:24.280]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:25.280]  across America.
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:29.280]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:32.920]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:33.920]  healthier I feel.
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:36.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:41.800]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:44.320]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:49.440]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:52:02.000]  Or order online, hbextract.com, heart and body extract, 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:07.400]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds here
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:11.080]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:16.440]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:18.440]  to tell their story.
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:27.040]  And EPA director on the AG made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:31.800]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:34.080]  take action against their global masters.
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:37.120]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:43.080]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:46.560]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:55.080]  No truth rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:55.080 --> 1:52:58.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:06.960]  and bring in martial law.
[1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:13.480]  What will you do when it happens, when you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:21.120]  and fear or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with patreonfood.com?
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:23.040]  The signs are everywhere.
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:25.080]  You have no excuses.
[1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:30.080]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:35.840]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:45.000]  patreonfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:50.840]  Varieties like dried tomatoes, wild rice blend, beef base, granola, vegetable mix, and much
[1:53:50.840 --> 1:53:51.840]  more.
[1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:56.280]  There are just two kinds of people, slave and free.
[1:53:56.280 --> 1:54:19.120]  Be ready, be free with patreonfood.com.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:23.920]  We've got Mob Desha coming in in about 30 minutes and I'm going to go ahead and go
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:30.040]  live to prisonplanet.tv at the start of the next hour for the last two and we're breaking
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:35.000]  down the economic bailout, everything that's happening.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:40.520]  We need national calls to every radio talk show, letters to the editor, calls to congress
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:46.360]  saying, we want Henry Paulson, we want all the people involved in this criminal operation
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:50.560]  and we've got congressmen and women on record saying it's clearly criminal who engineered
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:51.560]  all this.
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:52.600]  We want them indicted.
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:53.600]  We want them arrested.
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:58.920]  We don't want them given immunity and pardons and then a bunch of power.
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:01.560]  That's what we want.
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:06.120]  I mean I'm hearing all sorts of talk about violence, that's the last thing we need.
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:08.840]  John in Hawaii, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:11.560]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:12.560]  You bet.
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.240]  God bless you man.
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:20.120]  I've got a little act show I do on local radio over here in Hawaii where I try to explain
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:25.600]  to people how this was orchestrated, I've been into this since late sixties and how
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:31.320]  they've slowly dismantled our agricultural production system and I think when we talk
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:36.400]  about a bailout we need to begin making low cost loans obviously to farmers, get people
[1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:43.320]  back on the land and eliminate this fake economics that's ripping us off but the point I'm calling
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:48.920]  you about is about this concept of violence and I see there's three or four things coming
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:54.320]  up in the news where obviously seven to ten percent of America, no matter what they say
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:58.640]  about Obama, when they get in there they're not going to be able to vote for a black man
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:05.400]  for president and when we see the numbers saying that Obama is so far ahead in the
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:11.000]  polls and then he loses and we've all been set up especially since the Bush election
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.720]  to the fact that the government can manipulate the numbers, I think we're going to be seeing
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:20.920]  full scale riots the day after the election when McCain wins and I think we're all being
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:26.120]  set up, this is a scam, they're setting us up for martial law, I'd be surprised if McCain
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.560]  ever becomes president with that talent.
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:35.960]  Well I agree with you that all of this is a potential and the next month and a half is
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:40.680]  going to be some of the most interesting times, some of the most dangerous and perilous times
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:44.920]  that we've ever seen, it's also filled with opportunity to light people up because people
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:49.440]  are finally tuning in to the reality, they're finally learning about the new world order.
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:53.400]  You're obviously right Alex and I want to encourage people, I got a little show on Thursday
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:58.320]  at six o'clock Hawaii time where I talk about growing your own food, explaining how to grow
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:03.440]  nutrient dense food, the importance of that, I've been fighting against GMOs for about
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:04.440]  fifteen years now.
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:06.120]  Tell us, go ahead and do the plugs sir.
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  Okay yes, on kcof.net and then I just have to go to kcof.net and then click on the stream
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:16.880]  and I want to move on to some more callers now, thank you.
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:20.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to Graham in California, Graham go ahead.
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:21.080]  Alex.
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  Yes.
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:23.440]  I appreciate your work man.
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:24.440]  Thank you.
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:29.360]  First two quick things, first I heard Ray McGovern has cancer and he's using chemo.
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:31.200]  He has lymphoma cancer.
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:34.200]  Can you introduce him to G. Edward Griffin and...
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:38.000]  Yeah I'm not my brother's keeper, you know we get him on as a guest, he says that he
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.560]  already went through the chemo, he already had the lymph nodes removed, he believes he's
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  in remission.
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:44.200]  Oh that's good, that's good.
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:50.680]  Secondly, you heard of John Kandius, he's the guy that has the salt water, the radio
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:53.360]  aid machine that ignites salt water.
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:56.320]  Yeah I've heard of that, I don't know of any of that stuff's real, I have to look into
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:57:57.320]  it.
[1:57:57.320 --> 1:58:01.480]  Okay well I remember watching a tonight's show with Johnny Carson, there's a gentleman
[1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:05.320]  named Joe Newman and he has a magnetic engine that...
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:07.760]  I know the magnetic engines are real.
[1:58:07.760 --> 1:58:08.760]  What's that?
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:10.360]  The magnetic engines are real.
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:15.400]  Well I was going to say introduce Joe Newman to John Kandius and that would solve the energy
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:16.400]  crisis right there.
[1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:19.720]  Well they have a lot of suppressed technologies, the problem is there's a lot of quacks and
[1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:27.000]  kooks that have moved in to profiteer in it and it's just credited most of the real technology.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:33.720]  If you could just check out Google video, climate crisis we have and that's John...
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:37.920]  Alright thank you for the information, I'm going to hurry through more phone calls at
[1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:41.000]  800-2599-231.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:52.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:57.280]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:58:57.280 --> 1:58:58.800]  against this country.
[1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:03.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  Ben Laden.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  This is his MO.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:08.080]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Ben Laden.
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:12.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:15.360]  networks inside the United States.
[1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:19.840]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:59:19.840 --> 1:59:22.000]  in and on the US.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:25.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.600 --> 1:59:31.160]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:35.160]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:36.160]  much more.
[1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:41.800]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality along with
[1:59:41.800 --> 1:59:46.120]  hundreds of other Texas Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:56.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:56.280 --> 2:00:01.560]  We're live at prisonplanet.tv, coming up in 30 minutes.
[2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:05.560]  We're going to be joining the studio about Bob Desi for the balance of the radio show
[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:09.160]  to talk about what's happening with the economy, the global banking system, the private Federal
[2:00:09.160 --> 2:00:12.040]  Reserve, know your enemy, know who is behind this.
[2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:13.760]  Continued open phones today.
[2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:18.800]  Is anyone shocked by Barack Obama having police and prosecutors threaten to arrest people
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:22.040]  that criticize Barack Obama?
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:27.480]  We're talking about the economic hijinks that are going on, a bunch of other news as
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:29.680]  well right now.
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:31.320]  Let's go back to the calls.
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:35.760]  Let's talk to AJ in Maine, AJ, you are on the air.
[2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:36.760]  Hi, Alex.
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:37.760]  Hi.
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:43.680]  First of all, I know that money is the root of all evil, and I'm wondering if this whole
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:48.040]  bailout thing is kind of, you know, taking everyone's eye off the ball as far as the
[2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:49.400]  other issues that are going on right now.
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:53.000]  Well, money is not the root of all evil, the love of money.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:58.040]  Well, yes, as far as everyone's scared of, you know, losing their retirement, the stock
[2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:00.640]  market crashing, you know, everyone's more concerned about it.
[2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:05.760]  Yeah, they're terrorizing, saying, give the private banks government power, total immunity,
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:09.560]  and let us steal trillions of dollars more from you, because this is the final phase.
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:11.400]  They're saying, why not steal at all?
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:12.400]  You know, we're going for it.
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:13.400]  We're going for a police state.
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:15.160]  We're going for it all.
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:22.240]  And so, yes, the elite, the elite, the elite, to answer your question, are using the people's
[2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:25.320]  greed to support this, but it's not working.
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:27.640]  The people know it's a scam.
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:31.160]  It's a crisis of confidence, both in the markets and with the government.
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:35.320]  And so, you got 90-something percent against it, but the elite shows its colors and says,
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:36.320]  you know what?
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:37.320]  We don't care.
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:38.320]  Exactly.
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:43.160]  But as far as like the organization, as far as the real matters, like the 9-11 Truth
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:48.120]  Movement and, you know, this Iran-Russia thing and the presidential election, isn't there
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:53.880]  any way for like an organization to come together and get some like big lawyers behind them
[2:01:53.880 --> 2:02:01.160]  and kind of like what the ACLU does and kind of really push for that?
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:06.400]  There's no magic silver bullet, but certainly grand juries at the state level where these
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:12.440]  crimes have been committed in Dallas and Houston and LA and New York and DC, they can be calling
[2:02:12.440 --> 2:02:17.280]  for indictments, handing down indictments for all these different criminals.
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:21.120]  That would slow the system down if we had local justice, but we don't.
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:26.880]  The only other option is the whole fear of that, like you were talking about the violence
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:30.560]  and, you know, the militias and all these like secret things that are going on right
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:36.040]  now and these riots and them declaring martial law, I mean, that's totally out of people
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:37.440]  like ours control.
[2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:38.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:40.960]  And people always say, well, give us a solution, Alex.
[2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:45.760]  See, I've probably given 20 or 30 in the last two hours different things we can do ideas,
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:47.920]  but they're all real world.
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.720]  I'm like a carpenter or a farmer.
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:51.960]  People say, well, give us food.
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:53.320]  Well, I've got to find the fields.
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:54.320]  I got to plow them.
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:55.920]  I got to plant the right crop.
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:57.080]  I've got to water it.
[2:02:57.080 --> 2:02:58.080]  I've got to till it.
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:02:59.360]  I got to pull weeds.
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:01.280]  I've got to bring it to harvest.
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:03.120]  I've got to have a silo to put it in.
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  I've got to prepare it.
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:05.440]  We've got to grind it.
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:06.920]  We've got to bake it.
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:10.200]  We've got to have cows to milk to make the butter.
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:13.760]  You know, and people want a loaf of bread, but they're used to the loaf of bread falling
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:14.760]  out of the sky.
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:16.240]  It doesn't fall out of the sky.
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:17.240]  And so there's also...
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:21.200]  Why can't we look at the at the Constitution as the Bible?
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:22.640]  The Bible, you know, is word.
[2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:23.640]  It's not changed.
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:25.840]  People follow it, you know, the Constitution.
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:30.320]  But they'd have to know the Constitution in this long process of corruption.
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:32.840]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:38.920]  The problem here is that we're trying to fix the Titanic after it's hit the iceberg
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:43.560]  and bust it open for five of its bulkheads.
[2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:45.000]  The saltwater is pouring in.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:46.200]  It's flooded the bulkheads.
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:48.880]  You're not going to save it.
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:52.160]  And the elites already gotten the lifeboats and they've already gone off their own private
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:53.160]  islands.
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:57.640]  And they've got SWAT teams on the deck of the ship, making sure we continue to polish
[2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:01.200]  the silverware.
[2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:02.400]  And that's what's going to happen.
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:06.600]  SWAT teams, all of us going under while the elite laughs.
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:12.800]  Only by somehow admitting that this has happened and making makeshift rafts or something, here's
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:15.000]  the analogy, can we try to do that?
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:18.800]  But the SWAT teams like their devil tats and like the steroids and the shaved heads and
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:19.960]  acting tough.
[2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:22.040]  So they're going to lose everything, too.
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:25.720]  So we can at least, after we're on the bottom of the North Atlantic, know what happened.
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:28.080]  So when we start over, we know who to blame.
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:29.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:38.720]  Live from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines, arsenic
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:40.120]  and the water.
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:45.160]  They've become essential to the think of health.
[2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:56.880]  This has to be understood while the next step is to trust the SWAT team and teams.
[2:04:56.880 --> 2:05:00.880]  isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:03.380]  That's why there's Puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[2:05:03.380 --> 2:05:07.880]  Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract
[2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:12.880]  and alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.

[2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:50.880]  Okay, taking your phone calls right now. Bob Desian studio coming up.
[2:07:50.880 --> 2:07:57.880]  Up next here, Keith in Vermont. You're on the air. Welcome.
[2:07:57.880 --> 2:07:59.880]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:01.880]  Good, Keith. Good to talk to you.
[2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:05.880]  Good talk to you too. You know, I just wanted to bring up a couple of quick points.
[2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:09.880]  You know, I've been listening for quite a while and I think that a couple of things that people need to do
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:16.880]  simply is vote. Contact your congresspeople. As I have about voting no on this bailout.
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:21.880]  I've contacted, I live in Vermont currently, but I contacted Barack Obama,
[2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:29.880]  which is where I'm registered to vote and I let all my senators and representatives to vote no on this
[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:31.880]  and I think that's something that people need to do.
[2:08:31.880 --> 2:08:36.880]  And by the way, they admit that. They admit that around 5-9% depending on the poll are for it.
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:41.880]  90 plus percent against it. Another testament, this government is rogue.
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:44.880]  This government is criminal because they are planning to pass it.
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:51.880]  Yeah, and I'm sitting at home today watching, as it doesn't pass in the house, as it has not passed,
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:59.880]  that, you know, watching the stock market just take a tumble, it's like five to six hundred points down at points.
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:04.880]  I think it just goes to show exactly a lot of the things that you've been talking about.
[2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:10.880]  And gold is like the only thing that went up. Gold is like an $18 up.
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.880]  So I think people need it to take stock in some of the things, not just that you say,
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:19.880]  but that other people in the same community say and the people need to listen to it.
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:22.880]  Well, what have we said here that has come true?
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:26.880]  I mean, and it's not hard. The globalists say what they're doing.
[2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:33.880]  I mean, we got it almost three years ago out of Bilderberg that they were going to stage an economic collapse
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:36.880]  triggered by the subprime mortgages and blame it on the people.
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:41.880]  And I mean, we didn't just say there'd be a collapse in a few years. We said exactly what would happen
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:44.880]  because we were getting it from the global rulers.
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  And so, again, we have all these declassified army documents about how they like to stage terror attacks.
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:54.880]  So of course we talk about the government staging terror attacks.
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:59.880]  I mean, we're only going off what they say and what they do.
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:06.880]  And it's been proven. I mean, so thank you. And I just, like I said, I've been in my mom's ear constantly
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:10.880]  because my mom and dad support Obama, even though they're in their 70s,
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:13.880]  which would make them fit more of a McCain.
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:20.880]  Well, so he's a false revolution. The global architects, the social art, the social engineers,
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:25.880]  they know that the people are mad. So they give us something on the surface that looks different,
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:28.880]  a younger, well-spoken black man.
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  Right. And it seems like it would appease a lot of people.
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:37.880]  You know, I gave my parents a copy of the Truth Rising, and they just left my house a couple days ago.
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:41.880]  We'll see what kind of feedback I get from them. But it's just, it's doing stuff like that.
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:43.880]  I've passed it to neighbors. I've passed it to friends.
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:46.880]  Just trying to say, hey, people need to pay attention.
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:51.880]  It's not as simple as, I don't even want to say it. It's not as simple as black and white, but it's not.
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:54.880]  It's not as simple as, is this guy's good and that guy's bad?
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:58.880]  There's a lot more to it, and there's a lot of cards and smoking mirrors that they use to...
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  Absolutely. Absolutely. I appreciate your call, Keith.
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:05.880]  Mike and Tennessee, Mike, you're on the air.
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:12.880]  I went to the debate Friday in Ole Miss, and I tell you, the cops were great.
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:16.880]  I spoke to several of them. We're in blue uniforms, laid back.
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:20.880]  They actually gave me a thumbs up when they saw I made a sign that says 9-11 was inside job,
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:24.880]  and the other side said, save America or Paulson.
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:30.880]  They were great, but the thing that I noticed, they did a poll after the debate.
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:36.880]  I think they said locally there at the event, 36% were pro-Obama, 22% were McCain.
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:41.880]  I think that leaves about 44 undecided, and I was talking to Chris Matthews,
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:44.880]  and I said, I think these undecided are the people that are true conservatives
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:48.880]  that wanted Ron Paul to get in there or somebody other than McCain.
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:53.880]  I think the Democrats up in the northeast crossed party alliance to go vote for McCain
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:56.880]  to get the weakest candidate possible for the Republicans,
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:03.880]  and I think that if these 44% of the people get up and go and vote on election day,
[2:12:03.880 --> 2:12:10.880]  we could possibly have a great turnout for either the constitutional party candidate, Chuck Baldwin,
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:14.880]  or right in for Ron Paul, and he kind of nodded his head.
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:21.880]  And he also signed my 9-11 was an inside job poster, which I found quite interesting.
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:26.880]  Really? So Chris Matthews signed your 9-11 is an inside job poster.
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:31.880]  If you watched Hardball, I'm the guy directly behind him on the left with the sign that keeps flipping.
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:33.880]  One side is 9-11's inside job.
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:37.880]  The other side is, save America, fire Paulson. He signed the back of my sign.
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:39.880]  Didn't want to sign the front, but he did sign the back.
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:46.880]  Well, save America arrest Paulson, but I love your sign. No, I mean, I try to not bash police, though I do do it,
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:49.880]  because the culture's out of control. The orders they're given are unconstitutional,
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:54.880]  and a lot of police really are awake right now, more than even the general public,
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:56.880]  because they know what's going on behind the scenes.
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:13:01.880]  But I mean, it's time. It's time for everybody to speak up and say no,
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:06.880]  because the times that are coming, as bad as things are now, this is nothing.
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:10.880]  How many police were giving you a thumbs up to your 9-11 inside job poster?
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:16.880]  I walked past one pool of maybe 20 or 30 and three or four of them that watched me as I walked by.
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:19.880]  I gave me the thumbs up. The others weren't really paying attention to me.
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:23.880]  I didn't see any secret service. I didn't see anybody with a black suit talking into their sleeve.
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:27.880]  Nothing like that. But of course, I was about 200 yards away.
[2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:31.880]  I was in what we call the Grove, about 200 yards away from the theater.
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:36.880]  But actually, I met some people that, just an hour before the event, who were not supposed to go in,
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:40.880]  got clearance to go in. No background checks. They just went to a metal detector
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  and let their cell phones outside. One lady, she said, five rows back.
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:50.880]  Of course, she was an Obama supporter, but I thought it was pretty nice.
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:56.880]  It was extremely great. First time I'd been down at Ole Miss, and I think that it was a great...
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:01.880]  What do you think of Obama's supporters?
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:05.880]  I met his coordinator from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:10.880]  She was behind everybody passing out brochures telling him everybody was dispersed.
[2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:13.880]  She said, wait a minute. They're going to be back five minutes away right here.
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:15.880]  She was coordinating everybody's activities.
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:18.880]  If you look at hardball and you see people get really excited,
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:22.880]  you had a guy from hardball trying to jazz everybody up beforehand.
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:27.880]  In fact, they're saying, okay, everybody get ready. So it was choreographed,
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:31.880]  I would say, from the Obama standpoint. None of these were paid people,
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:34.880]  but they were their supporters, but they were being coached as to what to do.
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:38.880]  I understand. What do you think about Obama's supporters, police, and others
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:43.880]  in at least three states threatening to arrest people at badmouth Obama?
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:45.880]  Didn't see any of that. Nothing.
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:48.880]  No, no, I'm saying that's been reported now. Do you have a comment on that?
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:53.880]  Yeah. Major tyranny. I think at any time a government agent gets involved
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:56.880]  with anything having to do with a campaign like that,
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:14:59.880]  those people need to be arrested. Those people need to be put in jail
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:03.880]  because they're violating, I believe, federal and state statutes.
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:07.880]  No, they are. They're statutes about officials, government,
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:12.880]  especially police getting involved and trying to frustrate people's choice and elections.
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:18.880]  And that's a big no-no, and I wonder if these Obama police and prosecutors
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:22.880]  and sheriff's department people realize that they're opening themselves up
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:26.880]  for serious felonies. I appreciate your call. There are a bunch of laws against that.
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:32.880]  Who's up next here? Cody in Florida? Or we just talked to Cody.
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:36.880]  Let's go to... Who's up next, Jason?
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:38.880]  Brian in New York.
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:41.880]  Okay, Brian in New York. We just talked to Cody. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:44.880]  Hi, Alex. Hi.
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:49.880]  I was just on CNN, and it looks like the Bellowed package was defeated.
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:53.880]  The shocking. We had a congressman on the first thinking it was going to pass.
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:59.880]  They're stalling it for some reason. They're not letting it not pass.
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:02.880]  The floor is still open on it.
[2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:04.880]  Well, that's what it looked like during the last break.
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:08.880]  I was watching C-Span. It looked like that it was going against.
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:11.880]  But that's very interesting.
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:15.880]  I was going to say, I haven't heard anyone say this yet,
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:20.880]  but that is extremely maxed out on every aspect.
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:24.880]  There's a lot of talk now of going to gold.
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:28.880]  Wouldn't the bankers love to get paid back all that debt in gold?
[2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:33.880]  How are they going to physically, if you've got gold buried under the old Hickory tree,
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:36.880]  or silver, how are they going to physically squeeze that out of you?
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:41.880]  I mean, if we made the dollar gold again,
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:44.880]  they'd put the marrow in it and it was based on gold.
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:47.880]  Sure. Well, that's not seriously being discussed.
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:54.880]  They're talking about re-monetizing the debt with a new regional currency that will be fiat as well.
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:58.880]  So there's just not enough gold and silver to make the currency be backed by that.
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:02.880]  I know some of the economists from the Austrian school have called for that,
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:05.880]  but that's really not being seriously discussed.
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:08.880]  All right. That's all I really had.
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:10.880]  Thank you. Appreciate the call.
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:16.880]  Here is the headline, House Votes Down Bill to Bailout Financial Markets.
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:19.880]  And so the stock market was already plunging.
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:22.880]  It's going to plunge even further as the private fellow reserve,
[2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:28.880]  involved in insider trading, through the plunge protection team,
[2:17:28.880 --> 2:17:33.880]  you watch, they are now not going to basically pump money into the market today,
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:38.880]  and then it will plunge even further and they can say, see, we told you so.
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:43.880]  House Votes Against $700 Million Rescue Plan, Washington.
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:50.880]  House lawmakers voted 205 and 228 Monday against approving the historic $700 Million Financial Rescue Plan,
[2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:55.880]  a sharp blow to the administration and to bipartisan rallying efforts for leaders in the Congress
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:17:59.880]  who warned the countries on the brink of economic collapse unless it's passed.
[2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:03.880]  With elections approaching, some lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican,
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.880]  may feel nervous about voting for a plan that will risk so much taxpayer money and can't promise success.
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:11.880]  But the President has lobbied hard to approve the plan,
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:15.880]  and U.S. officials also have stressed the dire consequences of action.
[2:18:15.880 --> 2:18:20.880]  And there is a bunch of language we've been scanning over the bill about immunity
[2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:24.880]  for those involved in the financial structure for their crimes.
[2:18:24.880 --> 2:18:30.880]  Critics say the plan does not adequately address problems such as job loss and distressed housing market
[2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:32.880]  that underline current economic weakness.
[2:18:32.880 --> 2:18:37.880]  U.S. officials have hoped that the plan would ease the credit crunch and restore confidence in markets
[2:18:37.880 --> 2:18:41.880]  even as the markets plunge around the world, worldwide they're plunging.
[2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:46.880]  Those in favor of the rescue plan may have been trying to treat the most manageable symptom,
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:49.880]  the frozen credit market, if not the actual disease.
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:55.880]  A vote in the Senate was expected Wednesday, and the President would have followed the speedy signature.
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:18:59.880]  Earlier today, down emerged over whether enough representatives would vote in favor of the plan,
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:04.880]  as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appealed to colleagues in the earlier afternoon.
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:10.880]  Stressing representatives will continue to monitor financial issues and pursue additional strategies.
[2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:16.880]  She said it's imperative that the measure on the floor receives bipartisan support.
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:23.880]  So, we'll continue breaking down the latest economic developments as they unfold on the other side of this quick break.

[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:35.880]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:37.880]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:39.880]  But who is the enemy?
[2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:40.880]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:41.880]  This is his MO.
[2:20:41.880 --> 2:20:42.880]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:44.880]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:51.880]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:20:51.880 --> 2:20:58.880]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:02.880]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:02.880 --> 2:21:07.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:12.880]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:32.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:56.880]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:03.880]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We are here. We are live right now.
[2:24:03.880 --> 2:24:09.880]  Amazing. House votes down bill to bail out financial markets.
[2:24:09.880 --> 2:24:20.880]  Central banks try to keep crisis from spreading close to $1 trillion by the Federal Reserve pumped in to the markets last week alone.
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:28.880]  That was just last week alone. The same thing is going on right now.
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:35.880]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, ladies and gentlemen, previously closed at $11,143.
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:44.880]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average stands an index of the top 30 stocks at $10,691.21.
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:51.880]  A 451.92 drop or 4.06% plunge.
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:56.880]  NASDAQ stands at $2,500. Remember back when it was at $5,000?
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:15.880]  It's dropped 127.36. S&P has dropped from 1 to 1,147.76 or 65.25 change overall, a 5.38 change in one day.
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:27.880]  And it is continuing to drop right now as we speak. We will continue to cover this as it all unfolds and develops.
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:34.880]  This is amazing. You had the entire Democrat-Republican leadership for the last week and a half fear-mongering.
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:39.880]  This is an amazing thing that's happened. Fear-mongering saying there would be a depression.
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:47.880]  Paulson said that over the weekend again. Secretary of the Treasury, who's behind much of this, the cause of it.
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:54.880]  This is actually incredibly positive what's happening right now to have wall-to-wall fear-mongering.
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:26:03.880]  Every major TV news show, almost every radio talk show, the newspaper saying we need the bailout, we need the bailout, we need the bailout.
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:10.880]  No, it's not perfect, but it's the best thing we've got. Pushing it and pushing it and pushing it.
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:17.880]  And the Congress says no. Now, the Congress did narrowly say no, but still.
[2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:26.880]  Also something positive is happening. Ron Paul is now all over radio and TV with people saying he was right, he predicted all of this.
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:33.880]  Same thing's happening for this radio show. Folks are saying we were right. We were. The credibility is just shooting up.
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:41.880]  So they're able to freeze him out of the presidential run to where he couldn't get that nomination, but now everybody remembers what Ron Paul said in the debates
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:50.880]  in all of our television and in Congress. To such an extent that Chuck Norris has written an editorial, Paul would point them out and I would choke them.
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:27:00.880]  Chuck Norris is defecting from being a neocon minion now. I've been told by folks that know Chuck Norris well, who I know that know him up in Dallas where he lives,
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:11.880]  that he is a closet patriot. Looks like he's taken the step of recusing himself from the neocons, just like we've seen Bruce Willis do.
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:20.880]  We told you here with director Rick Linklater that made a movie with him that on the set he gave him a bunch of my videos and Bruce said, about a year and a half ago, I'm no longer a neocon.
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:28.880]  I've woken up to the left-right paradigm and then people didn't believe it on this show. And then he went in Vanity Fair and talked about government-sponsored terror and how the government killed Kennedy
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:34.880]  and how he didn't trust Republicans or Democrats now. So Chuck Norris waking up.
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:48.880]  Bruce Willis, the point is, they're canaries in the coal mine. If Chuck Norris were granted one wish, he would walk through Congress with Ron Paul and watch as Paul, the Republican representative from Texas, pointed out the corrupt politicians.
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:28:02.880]  One by one, Norris would grab each crooked congressman and choke him unconscious. I keep sticking them in a pile, piling them up to the martial arts star who at 68 looks as young and bluffes the Walker, Texas Ranger.
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:16.880]  Glory days. The ones that are honest, they stay. This is the black belt patriotism. The roundhouse kick to the point political philosophy Norris explains in the new book of the same title.
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:26.880]  I actually have that book. It was in here and somebody got it out of my studio. The point is that even Chuck Norris now waking up. I always knew he was a good guy.
[2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:36.880]  He just, it takes so much to wake these people up. See, we were telling you the truth the whole time. Oklahoma City was an inside job. Waco was a massacre.
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:42.880]  The first World Trade Center attack was government provocateur. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:59.880]  And so Congress has said no to the bailout. Now they'll probably totally spike the stock market and say, okay, you better pass it. Then they'll try to pass it and then maybe buoy it back up because the private fellow reserve puts tens of billions a day into the stock market.
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:18.880]  Insider trading. Totally criminal, but they do it. So we will continue to break that down. Bob Desi in studio. When we get back, I'm going to hit on some other news items that are developing and unfolding and then we're also going to continue taking your phone calls.
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:37.880]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:50.880]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston online from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:59.880]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[2:30:29.880 --> 2:30:36.880]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:39.880]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:49.880]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFR.
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:55.880]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:30:55.880 --> 2:31:01.880]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:01.880 --> 2:31:08.880]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:31:08.880 --> 2:31:11.880]  Do you know that there's treason going on? You can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:14.880]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:20.880]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:26.880]  Truth rises. Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:31:26.880 --> 2:31:29.880]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.

[2:33:32.880 --> 2:33:39.880]  The stock market just dropped 35 points plus in the last 5 minutes.
[2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:49.880]  So that's not going well on news of the Congress saying they're not going to give the private banks that caused all these problems a free ride.
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:53.880]  Bob Dacey will be with us for the rest of the broadcast about an hour and 20 minutes of it.
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:33:59.880]  For the next 5 minutes, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson on not to say, see, I told you so.
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:03.880]  In fact, for those watching me on PrisonPlanet.TV, they could see me dancing around with the music.
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:12.880]  I'm making myself be positive. I'm making myself be happy. I'm making myself not be negative here because I'm very, very upset about what's happening.
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:29.880]  This could turn into a road warrior type economic collapse because the fact that we're 90% plus urban, no longer agrarian, 7 million people according to different studies that have been done by universities, 7 plus million starved to death during the decade of depression.
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:40.880]  And this is very predatory of what's being set up. This has been engineered by design and then they want to, through the crisis, they create a world dictatorship of the banks.
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:50.880]  Henry Kissinger and others called for that last week. There were stories up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.net by Steve Watson on that with their quotes and videos of them saying it.
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:59.880]  How many years have we said they'll create a world economic crisis based in the U.S. then offer a new global economic order to deal with the last scam they ran?
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:13.880]  A new Ponzi scheme for the old one now coming to an end. So we're at a very important crossroads and I thought the house was going to pass the economic bailout of the bankers, the takeover bill, the criminal stick up bill, but it didn't.
[2:35:13.880 --> 2:35:25.880]  And I said last week if that didn't happen, then they would just plunge the market because the fellow reserves have been propping it up for years with our tax money every day with the plunge protection team, the committee on open markets that they set up back in the 80s.
[2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:35.880]  And that they would then let it crash, then pump it back up when people finally acquiesced. That remains to now be seen.
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:44.880]  So this is a big defeat for the new world order right now. Will they now do as they've threatened yelling, firing a theater, screaming, depression, depression, depression?
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:55.880]  If we didn't give them anonymity, immunity, and by anonymity they could secretly do whatever they wanted. Bob Desi's got all the documents on that and his big thing is the fellow reserve.
[2:35:55.880 --> 2:36:09.880]  By the way, we carry the three hour, three and a half hour documentary, The Money Masters, on one DVD, the definitive film that I think was one of the things Bob up, I've been airing that since 1996 when it came out here locally in Austin on the local cable.
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:18.880]  But the point is we have it on DVD now, available at infowars.com and I haven't even plugged that. Yes, you know all about it listeners, but your neighbor doesn't.
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:25.880]  Give them the pretty DVD with the cover and say, do you want to be an expert on this? Well, the next three nights, watch an hour of it.
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:32.880]  And people used to, I don't care about that, the cowboys are on. They just lost to the red skins. This is a disaster.
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:39.880]  Well, maybe now they will care and check it out and the answer is yes. But I want to bring Ted Anderson up for five minutes.
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:48.880]  Ted, I hate to say, gee, we told you so, but we're right again and gold is exploding in price today and folks, it may go up and down the months to come.
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:55.880]  But bottom line, the dollar is a dead duck and to 1980 numbers, we're talking close to three grand an ounce for inflation.
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:37:03.880]  The CPI is cooked, but even according to government numbers, it should be above 3000. Some are talking about 6000 an ounce gold.
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:11.880]  I don't know if that's ever going to happen. The point is the dollar is a dead duck with the bailouts we've already seen.
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:17.880]  If they would have done this bailout, which they may still do, guaranteed even faster. But Ted, give me your take on what's happening right now.
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:28.880]  Oh, I sure will. I think it's just a victory for Congress not to do this. That doesn't mean the dollar is going to be saved, but at least we're not handing it over to the banks right now at this time.
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:36.880]  Wall Street's not getting bailed out. Yes, indeed, there's going to be some very severe consequences on Main Street where you and I are trying to live.
[2:37:36.880 --> 2:37:42.880]  The banks not lending money means the money supply is going to shrink. It's going to get very tough, very tough.
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:50.880]  A depression style like we had in the 1930s. Of course, there still will be a bailout, just like they said.
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:38:00.880]  The U.S. government has FDIC to cover. They have all the welfare programs to cover, the unemployment programs to cover. They're going to be shifting a lot of new money.
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:03.880]  They just passed a trillion dollar defense budget last week.
[2:38:03.880 --> 2:38:16.880]  So there's what it comes down to. We got problems, but at least we're not bailing out the banks. We are going to see the dollar fall and it's going to become, I doubt it a bit if we're still trading fellow reserve notes even 10 years from now.
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:23.880]  And folks, I know you like to procrastinate. They'll try to have a marrow within four years. I believe a lot of experts believe.
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:38.880]  I'm looking right now at the gold numbers from CNBC and gold is up 27 plus dollars today at 904.80 cents. 904.80 cents.
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:50.880]  And people, you think that's high? This is a buying opportunity. Gold always goes up in the fall and winter and it is way undervalued.
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:39:00.880]  It is undervalued right now, Alex. There's no question about it. But here's another kicker for you. When gold was what? It was 987, 978 right in there and we're offering things last week.
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:15.880]  We've got the same prices right now. People can get at the very same items. I was able to hold on to that level because I was watching this thing happen and I just knew I had to accumulate and set up an opportunity for my people to buy once the market...
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:25.880]  Yeah, let's be clear about that. Let's stop and I want everyone to listen very carefully. Ted last Friday couldn't even talk to me on the phone when I called him in the afternoon.
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  The owner of the Genesis Network, same big building, Midas Resources is in. Ted's been in this almost 30 years, had Midas for what, 12?
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:49.880]  Ted couldn't talk to me. He said, look, I'm too busy. I'm making some buys right now while gold is only at $875 because I believe it's going to explode next week whether they do the bailout or not.
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:40:03.880]  And boy was Ted right. It's up $27 from the close Friday and so Ted, you're saying you've got gold at how much below spot?
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  Same prices, 241 on the British sovereigns. That's about 20 bucks below what it would cost if I entered into the marketplace to buy the same thing at this time.
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:22.880]  I still have the Franks right now. They're at 196. That's the same price I offered them on Friday and gold's gone up like crazy and obviously silver is about to make an explosive move too.
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:28.880]  And I still have the dimes right now at 1600 per face, you know, per $100 face.
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:36.880]  And I got to tell you right now, Alex, there's just way, way, way too much trouble out there to ignore this buy. This is one of the better buys.
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:44.880]  I would say it's one of the best buys I've ever done except for that one time on Monday I locked in and gold shot up 80 some bucks that day.
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:55.880]  But I don't know that's the only time gold's ever done that in history. And right now it's up 30 bucks. This whole thing's melting down and we don't know what the market is going to carry forward to the rest of today.
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:59.880]  That's right. And the futures show it only going up as well.
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:11.880]  And so I think it's safe to say that gold's broken the psychological of 900 is sailing up on its way towards 1000. Ted, how long do you think till it potentially hits 1000?
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:17.880]  Well, you know, obviously if we break through that $900 level, we could see 1000 in three days. It could go that quick.
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:22.880]  I mean, we went $85 up in one day and then we're up over 130 within two.
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:33.880]  And folks, you know, I bought gold and silver over the years a little bit here a little bit there and invested it and done things with it. And I bought gold when it was 264 and it was 300 when it was 400, 500, 600, 700, 800.
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:41.880]  I bought gold from Ted when it was 1000. Did I sell it when it went down to 800 and something? No. I kept it because it's my insurance policy.
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:45.880]  The Federal Reserve notes are dead. We could be in a depression next week. God forbid.
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:54.880]  But in the future, every economist we have on says within two to three years, the worst depression we've ever seen. And now is the time to move out of dollars.
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:42:04.880]  Now is the time to get out of the bank and get out of paper because this derivatives bubble that is over 1000 trillion over a quadrillion, it is not going away, period.
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:14.880]  So you are insane if you don't move into gold and silver. And if you are moving into gold and silver and metals, you are even more insane not to get it from Ted Anderson right now
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:25.880]  who has it in his vault who got it when gold was down $30. Okay. It is up 30. He made a major buy Thursday and Friday made buys.
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:34.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, he has the gold. He has the silver. But here's the problem. Ted's told me he's having trouble getting the gold and silver in these really good coins
[2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:40.880]  because and there's a lot of articles about real scarcity in gold. They're trying to suppress it and can't suppress the price.
[2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:50.880]  But they're suppressing it from where it should be at above 2000 for inflation from 1980 numbers. But physically in this market, in the real market, they're running out of gold and silver.
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:55.880]  Ted, I mean, look, just last week, the US meant suspended gold sales.
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:43:01.880]  Yeah, that's right. That's what's going on. When you watch that volatility, it means that the futures market is bouncing up and down.
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:09.880]  But that's all paper and it's all credit and leverage. I mean, for God's sakes, the only 10 cents on the dollars there to back the trades that are going through.
[2:43:09.880 --> 2:43:16.880]  And when that goes down and that goes up, that doesn't affect the physical market like you, Alex. People are buying this stuff and they're holding on to it.
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:22.880]  Just because they paid 1000 bucks for it doesn't mean they're willing to sell it when silver or gold is down in the 780 range.
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:25.880]  And now it's just bouncing right back up again.
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:44.880]  In fact, from 780 to 905, it just went up again, we're talking about a massive increase here. We're talking about $125 increase in the last two weeks.
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:50.880]  Most of the countries around the world quit coining gold and silver coins back in World War II.
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:44:00.880]  I mean, yeah, you got the Eagles, you got some, you know, the Canadian Maple Leaf and this kind of adds a little bit of supply to the market, but it's nothing in comparison to what it used to be like.
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:08.880]  The supply of gold and silver is drying up, especially silver, but gold is too. There just isn't enough to go around to everybody that wants it.
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:21.880]  Look, folks, Ted Anderson is offering you gold at around $30 under what it's selling for right now. These are semi-collectible coins that are at bullion prices.
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:30.880]  You cannot beat this and I believe in it. And Ted literally lost money on one of the pitches he did a week and a half ago when it went up 80-something bucks in one day.
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:41.880]  He still fulfilled it all, did it all. Ted has locked in on these so he won't lose money because he locked in with his gamble, but he is passing that savings on.
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:50.880]  This is the second best deal I've ever heard Ted offer and if it keeps going up today, Ted has locked in so he can still offer it to you.
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:52.880]  How long can you hold this deal, Ted?
[2:44:52.880 --> 2:45:00.880]  Transactions till midnight and Alex, you're right, last time around I locked in a position I must have sold 10 times as much as I locked in on, but I'll honor it.
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:09.880]  I'll honor every single one of these trades because people need to have gold and when I give my word, my word is my word and I can't say it enough.
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:15.880]  Gold's up 30 bucks and I'm offering the same stuff at the same price as I was last week when gold was lower.
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:20.880]  Absolutely amazing, Ted. Let's give them the number 1-800-686. Give them the number, Ted.
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:34.880]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237. It's 1-800-686-2237. Man, you want to get involved with this now and if you don't have the brains to get out of paper now, you don't deserve to have gold.
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:37.880]  You know what I'm saying? There's just way too many.
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:47.880]  Well, a lot of us are just so busy we don't have time to do it, but I mean, I've been meaning to get some for two weeks knowing it was going up and I've been too busy to go scrabble around and get money out of the children's savings account to go get it.
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:53.880]  But I've got to do that today, Ted. Now I'm, you know, I'm 120 bucks down on this announce because I've just been too busy.
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:46:06.880]  Folks, don't wait 1-800-686-2237. The brokers will be there until midnight tonight, 800-686-2237. Do not wait. Lock it in today.
[2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:17.880]  Gold is only going up as we speak one more time. That toll free number and I'm refreshing the gold price right now. I'm going to give that number out to everybody.
[2:46:17.880 --> 2:46:24.880]  800-686-2237. Gold just went up another $3, Ted.
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:35.880]  That's what it's doing right now and it's just reacting. It's saying, okay, we're not going to get the bailout. If we did get the bailout, we'd add so much currency coming in the system would be coming by the buckets full.
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:44.880]  But for the time being, gold would have probably sat still. Now as it is, boom, 800-686-2237. Gold up 3 bucks in the last 5 minutes.
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:45.880]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:46.880]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:53.880]  He said, 907 right now are up right at $30 today. Okay, he's with us till the end of the show.
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:59.880]  Coming up later, I'm going to go to your calls on the economy and what's happening and we'll cover things as they develop.
[2:46:59.880 --> 2:47:09.880]  Bob Dacey really is an expert on the Federal Reserve in the now decade plus that he has been studying what's going on and what has been happening.
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:14.880]  And I'm pleased to have Bob Dacey in studio with us. Bob, it's good to have you here, my friend.
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  Alex, it's been a while since I've been in here. I'm glad to be back.
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:23.880]  That's right. Folks know Bob has sat in on quite a few shows and done an excellent job other than speaking too softly.
[2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:26.880]  My guys didn't turn his mic up, but he is just awesome.
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:34.880]  We've got about 3 or 4 minutes before break, but let's go ahead and get into your bottom line take on what's happening with the banker bailout.
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:37.880]  Well, I got to tell you something, Alex. I'm a little bit confused right now.
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:40.880]  I was betting on them voting for this thing anyway.
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:47.880]  I mean, I called my congressman and my senators every single day for the last week and very calmly, like I always do,
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:51.880]  explain why there's no way they should vote for this and I'm sure it was going on all over the country.
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.880]  But I'm trying to figure out and I don't understand this. This is one of these anatomical anomalies.
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:06.880]  How did a creature without a spine walk erect and then develop a spine and actually develop some cajonis and actually vote the right way?
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:15.880]  I'm confused by that. I'm actually thinking that this gigantic amount of pressure that we the people put on these creatures actually might have had an effect.
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  I'm a little concerned that they're going to try to pull something else out of the hat before, you know...
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:26.880]  No, they're going to crash it and say it's our fault. I mean, that's why they blame it on the subprime. It's always about blaming us.
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  Well, it's always our fault, but the thing that people have to understand and this is the bottom line and Alex is right about this.
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:40.880]  They're not really trying to fix anything. I mean, they're trying to tank the economy one way or another.
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:45.880]  They're trying to... It's a highway robbery. It's a theft. And that's all it is.
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:52.880]  It's a G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island, Chapter 2 explains it really well, you know.
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:58.880]  The name of the game is bailout. Well, this time they're not bailing out this, but they're bailing out everything else.
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:01.880]  And again, I am confused. I have to admit it. I do not understand...
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:06.880]  And by the way, I've been pointed out in weeks that the Bush's specialty, all of them have different criminal specialties,
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:12.880]  but it's all about rating SNLs, blowing out savings and loans, robbing banks, you know, being bank directors.
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:16.880]  I mean, that's the Bush specialties and McCain's specialties.
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:18.880]  Financing dictators, don't forget that.
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:25.880]  So, you know, so I like to say I am... I'm a little bit confused. I mean, just before I go in the air, we find out that the House voted against it.
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:29.880]  Well, now the Senate's not going to be able to vote on anything, are they? Right?
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  And people are asking because it's the end of the fiscal year. They're about to go away on a holiday recess. Good.
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:41.880]  I mean, let it tank. Let it implode because letting it tank later will only make it worse, folks.
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:47.880]  They're saying we owe all this money and it's going to devalue the currency that is in the real economy.
[2:49:47.880 --> 2:49:50.880]  Main Street versus Wall Street. You want to explain that to people?
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:54.880]  Well, Main Street versus Wall Street, I give you a great example of Main Street versus Wall Street.
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:49:59.880]  The logic must have been so ridiculous that even the congressman must have been able to figure it out.
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:09.880]  What they're proposing to do, according to Bernanke, was to buy this stuff back, all these bad mortgages, at what their market value was in more normal times.
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  So, you got $100,000 mortgages worth $60,000 now and they're going to take taxpayer money and spend $100,000 on it.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:19.880]  That doesn't make sense to anybody.
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:23.880]  And if we're going to be complete socialists, why be socialists for the billionaire bankers?
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:29.880]  I mean, if we're going to do this, if we're going to be paying interest on this, this is a credit card, then we might as well be able to buy the crap.
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:38.880]  The stock market is crazy. The camchills are spraying us with the chemicals.
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:43.880]  It's time to think about what is important. Most forget just how important life is.

[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:36.880]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:40.880]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:51:40.880 --> 2:51:42.880]  He's bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:51:42.880 --> 2:51:45.880]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:52.880]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.

[2:52:03.880 --> 2:52:13.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[2:53:55.880 --> 2:53:59.880]  We're talking about the history of this thing. This goes way back over a hundred years.
[2:53:59.880 --> 2:54:06.880]  I think you were on my show many, many, many years ago. By the way, that's The Simple Truth TV show here in Austin.
[2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:15.880]  We have a web site now, by the way, www.SimpleTruthOnline.net. We have a webmaster. We've got a reporter. We've got two producers and we've got five people working on our show now.
[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:16.880]  Good job.
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  www.SimpleTruthOnline.net. But this thing goes back way over a hundred years. Cecil Rhodes, the super rich guy from way back in the good old days, the 1890s and whatnot,
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:37.880]  he was the one that went over to South Africa and he founded the beers, just super rich, kicked a bunch of Africans off their land, the Metabili tribe and got their golden stuff and all that.
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:44.880]  This guy was one of the super rich guys back then and when he died, he had a will and in his will, he set up the Rhodes Scholarship.
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:51.880]  You just think that's for a bunch of smart people. Well, no, it's a Rhodes Scholarship program was set up as a recruiting ground for elitists.
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  And his fondest desire, according to his biographer, was to gradually absorb the wealth of the world into the hands of the few.
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:14.880]  And from the Rhodes Scholarship, from the Rhodes Trust and all that, came financing for the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London and its cousin over here in the United States, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[2:55:14.880 --> 2:55:23.880]  And this is not something which is debatable. They admit it. They admit it's in the book, Tragedy and Hope.
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:31.880]  What's his name? Give me his name. I just forgot it. Carol Quigley. Carol Quigley. Carol Quigley wrote about it in the 60s. He was a member of the CFR.
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:33.880]  You know, it's funny. It's in the book.
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:40.880]  It's funny you brought this up because I meant Sunday to have time to get to this and put it up on screen for people.
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:48.880]  I meant to get to this. The New World Order conspiracy theory. This is Wikipedia.
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  And it goes on to say it refers to a purported conspiracy in which a powerful and secretive group is plotting to eventually rule the world via an autonomous world government, which would replace sovereign states and other checks and balances and world power struggles.
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:14.880]  And it goes on to say it's an imaginary theory, but then when you start reading it gets into Cecil Rhodes' book, Cecil Rhodes' will, a New World Order set up for the British Empire with the United States and Anglo-American establishment.
[2:56:14.880 --> 2:56:24.880]  Then it goes through all the books written by the elites and the real groups they set up to do it and all the presidents that have called for it and prime ministers, but it still doesn't exist, Bob.
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:33.880]  Well, that's because the definition of the definition of conspiracy. I mean, you can have all these people telling you about all these horrible things, but a conspiracy is obviously Cooke's.
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  They have conditioned the American people into thinking that anybody who uses that word is a Cooke. But all a conspiracy is, is what? Two or more people conspiring to do something that's wrong? That's all it is.
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:54.880]  And when Cecil Rhodes puts it in his will, and by the way, one of the things in his will was he wanted to recruit people through this Rhodes Scholarship Fund of what he called unctuous rectitude. Nobody uses that word anymore.
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:57:05.880]  Unctuous means slippery. In common parlance, it means used car salesman. And, you know, what do you, what do you figure about? What's his name? Bill Clinton?
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:20.880]  I mean, that's what he is. He's a used car salesman. Jimmy Carter was a used car salesman. Barack Obama is the latest used car salesman. They're slick. They're polished. They're, they're, they're very well educated and they're working for global government, all of them.
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:29.880]  And it doesn't matter if you have North American Union documents. It doesn't matter if you have presidents calling for world government. It doesn't matter if all these corporations are calling for it.
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:38.880]  They just respond to us by saying it doesn't exist. And Wikipedia basically says it doesn't exist, but then goes on to show all the elitists saying it does exist.
[2:57:38.880 --> 2:57:50.880]  You know, there was a book written a few years ago about, what was it, trying to, oh, it was taking over all these countries with economic means. I forgot things.
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:55.880]  Well, take super class, just written by the head of the Kissinger Group. He came on the show and said, yeah, we're setting all this up.
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  But then they say it's not a conspiracy, like it happens by osmosis or something.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:04.880]  Global governance. Well, we've got Walter Cronkite saying they're setting up world government.
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:29.880]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, back in 70 seconds for the fourth hour.

[2:59:21.880 --> 2:59:47.880]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:59:47.880 --> 2:59:57.880]  Okay, Bob Desi, our guest in the studio. Bob, you've got a lot of notes and comments and news articles you want to go over concerning the bailout that at least for this round failed today in the house.
[2:59:57.880 --> 3:00:06.880]  A big shocker, but the polls show around 5-9% depending on which poll. We've got a bunch of them up on infowarzen.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:00:06.880 --> 3:00:13.880]  Also, hundreds of top economists have written emails, letters, they've gone on TV, they've gone radio. They've said it's a big scam.
[3:00:13.880 --> 3:00:23.880]  They've said that these are criminal acts committed by those in the banking structure. We played some congressmen and women commenting on this during the debates earlier in the first hour.
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:30.880]  I had a congressman on from Texas who said they basically declared martial law in the house, saying the normal rules were suspended.
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:35.880]  I mean, these are some crazy times that we're in the middle of right now. Bob Desi, continue.
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:46.880]  I think that what they were trying to do, Alex, was just too over the top. I mean, I looked at the so-called improved bill, the 110 pages of garbage that they posted last night on the Internet,
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:55.880]  but basically four things they promised us idiots that they were going to do. One of them was to make sure that the executives didn't get paid too much.
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:59.880]  You know what kind of a nonsense that is relative to the amount of money they were talking about?
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:05.880]  You're talking about a few million here or there instead of billions and millions and millions with the shareholders.
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:14.880]  But the larger issue is they said, don't worry, an independent commission made up of Paulson and the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the head of the security exchange commission,
[3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:18.880]  the guys that literally did the bank robbery, they will oversee it.
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:29.880]  You're going to have Paulson and you're going to have Bernanke and you're going to have a couple of other executive branch people are going to oversee it.
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  The authors of the bill would oversee it.
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:38.880]  That's like installing a group of foxes to determine what it is, why the chickens are missing from the henhouse.
[3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:42.880]  We're going to figure this out for you guys and that's going to be good.
[3:01:42.880 --> 3:01:48.880]  They also said they were going to, again, with this limiting executive compensation, that was nonsense.
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:55.880]  That's because the public has been taught to obsess on CEOs making 50 million a piece when we're talking about trillions of dollars here.
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:04.880]  They also said that they were going to make sure that in several years from now, if the enterprises that they're going to buy for way more than they're worth,
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:09.880]  start making money that they're going to have to like, no, they didn't say they were going to have to pay it back.
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:14.880]  They said the president was going to have to make a proposal that they pay it back.
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:17.880]  So, I mean, when you ask the girl to marry her, that's a proposal.
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:19.880]  She doesn't have to say yes, does she?
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:21.880]  It's a crock, a total crock.
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:22.880]  They said maybe later.
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:23.880]  Maybe later.
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:25.880]  And here's the math of the deal.
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:29.880]  You got $100,000 mortgage on a house, right?
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:35.880]  The thing is now the house that holds it up is only worth 60 now because like in California, they say the real estate dropped 40%.
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:38.880]  So you got $100,000 mortgage with a $60,000 house.
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:39.880]  Okay.
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:47.880]  Bernanke said that the point of all this was to take the $700 billion and buy these things for more like what their normal market value would be.
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:48.880]  $100,000.
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:54.880]  So if you buy something that's worth 60, how in the world are you going to make any money on it in a few years so you can pay us back?
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:03:00.880]  It is a total crock and I think even the congresspeople were able to figure that out.
[3:03:00.880 --> 3:03:02.880]  Well, I think they know getting millions of phone calls.
[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:15.880]  I mean, per congressman, they said it was thousands and thousands and they said at a congressman on first hour saying out of several thousand phone calls against five, count it, five were for it, for the bailout.
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:17.880]  Yeah, those are probably the guys that are members of the Federal Reserve.
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:21.880]  But that's kind of like TextDot handing over our roads to the private company Centra.
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:26.880]  They'll have a meeting with 1,200 people and there'll be three or four there for it and they're all TextDot employees.
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:28.880]  And then they say, okay, we're voting against what the people want.
[3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:30.880]  We're going to hand it over to Centra.
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:32.880]  And I've got a story on that I'm working on right now.
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:35.880]  Alex, too, about the staff to Superhighway.
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:37.880]  Big, big story, huge one.
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:39.880]  Are you interested in it?
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:40.880]  It's a big sucker.
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  I wouldn't wait on it though.
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:42.880]  I'd go ahead and get the story out.
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:46.880]  Well, basically, this is something that I think you need to handle because you're the big cheese, okay?
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:48.880]  You know, you're the imperious leader and all that stuff.
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:49.880]  Oh, yeah, right.
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:55.880]  You know, we've been working on a trans-Texas corridor for a long time and our little TV shows had a lot to do with it and our work.
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:58.880]  And the new American has had a lot to do with stopping the trans-Texas corridor.
[3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:01.880]  The pastor came out a few months ago and said it was dead, which it really is.
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:02.880]  Yeah, sure, it's dead.
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:03.880]  That's awesome behavior, you know.
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:04.880]  Yeah.
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:09.880]  But there's a new deal coming out in Arizona, which is obscene and it's huge.
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:19.880]  They're trying to kick 450 people out of their houses because their houses are in the way of a hub they want to build and the Canamex route going through Arizona.
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:20.880]  Which doesn't exist.
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:22.880]  It's in all the official documents, but it doesn't exist.
[3:04:22.880 --> 3:04:23.880]  Well, it exists.
[3:04:23.880 --> 3:04:24.880]  No, no.
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:25.880]  The sky doesn't exist.
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:26.880]  The bailout doesn't exist.
[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:28.880]  The government's good.
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:30.880]  Don't lie.
[3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:36.880]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:39.880]  At Lays Med Inc., the future is here.
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:46.880]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology, without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation.
[3:04:46.880 --> 3:04:49.880]  I know I'm on air, but I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[3:04:49.880 --> 3:04:56.880]  Because somebody's lunch here at my office with a guy running my board, he's at lunch and he's not back.
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:04:58.880]  Did John Harmon ever come back from his meeting?
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:04:59.880]  Yep, I'm back now.
[3:04:59.880 --> 3:05:00.880]  Oh, your Lordship.
[3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:01.880]  I am back, Jones.
[3:05:01.880 --> 3:05:05.880]  We may skip a few breaks for folks that are watching, so get ready for that in the next segment.
[3:05:05.880 --> 3:05:07.880]  Okay, you got it.
[3:05:07.880 --> 3:05:09.880]  They must be getting a lot of calls at Midas.
[3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:13.880]  I tried to call you on the back line and all circuits were busy twice.
[3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:16.880]  You're calling 125 and it was busy?
[3:05:16.880 --> 3:05:17.880]  Uh-huh.
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:19.880]  Well, remember, we're on air.
[3:05:19.880 --> 3:05:21.880]  Let's just...
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:23.880]  Okay, well, I'll...
[3:05:23.880 --> 3:05:24.880]  No, I mean, not now.
[3:05:24.880 --> 3:05:26.880]  I mean, maybe not now, but...
[3:05:26.880 --> 3:05:28.880]  Anyways, how are you doing today?
[3:05:28.880 --> 3:05:29.880]  I'm doing good.
[3:05:29.880 --> 3:05:33.880]  What would you like to say on air to the folks watching and listening?
[3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:35.880]  God bless you all.
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:36.880]  You make this show possible.
[3:05:36.880 --> 3:05:38.880]  God bless you all.
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:40.880]  What does Tiny Tim say at the end of the Christmas story?
[3:05:40.880 --> 3:05:43.880]  God bless you, everyone.
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:45.880]  Every one of us.
[3:05:45.880 --> 3:05:48.880]  That doesn't exist. Christmas doesn't exist.
[3:05:48.880 --> 3:05:49.880]  You're making it up.
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:53.880]  If you see a bird hopping around in a tree, it doesn't exist.
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:55.880]  Nothing exists but what the government says, John.
[3:05:55.880 --> 3:05:56.880]  Yes.
[3:05:56.880 --> 3:05:58.880]  If the government tells you you don't exist, you don't exist.
[3:05:58.880 --> 3:05:59.880]  I don't.
[3:05:59.880 --> 3:06:00.880]  They know...
[3:06:00.880 --> 3:06:04.880]  And if I tell you 2 plus 2 equals 97, it does, or you're without kind of boy.
[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:06.880]  That's right.
[3:06:06.880 --> 3:06:07.880]  Thank you, John, for talking to us.
[3:06:07.880 --> 3:06:14.880]  Hey, Bob Desi, doesn't it seem to you, though, like no matter what crap the government puts out in the corporations now, no one's buying it?
[3:06:14.880 --> 3:06:17.880]  You know, we've done quite a bit of good waking people up.
[3:06:17.880 --> 3:06:27.880]  Is it possible that people like Alex Jones working 18 hours and 20 hours a day for all these years for all this time have actually started to have an effect?
[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:31.880]  Is it possible that we're pushing back against these people and they're getting a little nervous?
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:34.880]  Is it possible that we are actually winning this thing?
[3:06:34.880 --> 3:06:39.880]  Is it possible that someday we'll be able to arrest them and try them?
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:41.880]  They're going to get full due process.
[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:42.880]  Absolutely.
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:44.880]  Full due process.
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:45.880]  They're going to get...
[3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:46.880]  But what is the jury of their peers?
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:47.880]  What is that?
[3:06:47.880 --> 3:06:49.880]  Is it like other CFR members or what?
[3:06:49.880 --> 3:06:51.880]  I have a hard time picturing what their definition...
[3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:54.880]  A jury of their peers just means randomly select them from the community.
[3:06:54.880 --> 3:06:55.880]  Okay, well, they don't...
[3:06:55.880 --> 3:06:58.880]  I don't think that's their definition of peers because they think they don't have any.
[3:06:58.880 --> 3:07:00.880]  Right?
[3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:03.880]  Did you have a nice lunch?
[3:07:03.880 --> 3:07:05.880]  Mr. Lunchie's back.
[3:07:05.880 --> 3:07:07.880]  Actually, no, I didn't have one.
[3:07:07.880 --> 3:07:09.880]  No, no, I'm talking to the other culprit down here.
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:10.880]  Oh, sorry.
[3:07:10.880 --> 3:07:12.880]  I'm just joking around.
[3:07:12.880 --> 3:07:13.880]  You know what?
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:14.880]  I'm glad this bailout didn't pass.
[3:07:14.880 --> 3:07:17.880]  But now they're going to destroy the economy and say it was all our fault.
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:19.880]  They're masters at psychology.
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:20.880]  Now, I believe they lost control here.
[3:07:20.880 --> 3:07:22.880]  I believe they were trying to pass it to...
[3:07:22.880 --> 3:07:23.880]  I'm going to say that when we get back.
[3:07:23.880 --> 3:07:25.880]  We're going live to the full audience right now.
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:29.880]  Prisonplanet.tv viewers get to see all the silliness that goes on.
[3:07:29.880 --> 3:07:31.880]  But here we go.
[3:07:34.880 --> 3:07:35.880]  Big Brother.
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:37.880]  Mainstream media.
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:39.880]  Government cover-ups.
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:40.880]  Fun answers?
[3:07:40.880 --> 3:07:42.880]  Well, so does he.
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:46.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:51.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:07:53.880 --> 3:07:54.880]  All right.
[3:07:54.880 --> 3:07:55.880]  I'm in a good mood right now.
[3:07:55.880 --> 3:07:57.880]  I'm giddy.
[3:07:57.880 --> 3:08:00.880]  Because clearly this is not staged.
[3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:02.880]  My instincts, my gut.
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:03.880]  What is your instinct?
[3:08:03.880 --> 3:08:04.880]  What is your gut?
[3:08:04.880 --> 3:08:08.880]  It's hundreds of points, facts, research, history, body language.
[3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:10.880]  It's like asking a good police detective,
[3:08:10.880 --> 3:08:12.880]  well, why is it your hunch he committed the murder
[3:08:12.880 --> 3:08:14.880]  and nine times out of ten it turns out they were right?
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:15.880]  It's not really a hunch.
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:21.880]  A hunch is a word for, I don't have ten hours to go through all the evidence of why I know Billy Bob did it.
[3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:25.880]  And then later you go, you know, look at the evidence that Billy Bob did.
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:34.880]  I don't know for a fact that this isn't staged with the failure of the bailout passage a few hours ago.
[3:08:34.880 --> 3:08:37.880]  I don't know that that was not staged.
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:39.880]  But I know that every member of the House is not controlled.
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:41.880]  It's the committee chairman that are.
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:47.880]  I know that I've interviewed a congressman on air, several others I've seen giving interviews have been saying,
[3:08:47.880 --> 3:08:50.880]  and the polls show around five to nine percent.
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:57.880]  Any way you cut it, 90 plus percent are against this bailout package.
[3:08:57.880 --> 3:09:05.880]  And the masses of calls, thousands and thousands and thousands of calls and letters and emails in the last week and a half to Congress,
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:09.880]  the fiscal year is about to end tomorrow.
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:12.880]  I don't think they're going to get the bailout plan.
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:14.880]  Big defeat with it failing.
[3:09:14.880 --> 3:09:16.880]  Will they be able to repackage it and bring it back?
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:18.880]  Bob Desi's been reading over it.
[3:09:18.880 --> 3:09:19.880]  We've been reading over it.
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:22.880]  Strangely enough, it won't let us print it on two different computers.
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:26.880]  So it's not even letting us copy it and put it in documents and print it.
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:30.880]  So somebody put systems on there to keep you from printing it.
[3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:34.880]  It's got all the same crap in there, the immunity and the rest of it is in there.
[3:09:34.880 --> 3:09:36.880]  We've confirmed that.
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:38.880]  And so what's going to happen now?
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:42.880]  We probably should analyze that and then go back and look at the last bailout.
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:46.880]  They are going to plunge the stock market and it's down almost 600 points right now.
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:54.880]  Gold is up $30, a cool 30 right now.
[3:09:54.880 --> 3:09:55.880]  It's a few cents short of 30.
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:59.880]  I'm refreshing.
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:01.880]  And so a lot of things are happening.
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:04.880]  Oh, I'm sorry, gold is up $33.10.
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:10.880]  It's gone up three bucks and 20 cents in the last 20 minutes.
[3:10:10.880 --> 3:10:13.880]  So it's going straight to the moon.
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:16.880]  So much is happening on that front.
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:19.880]  So we should talk about, and we're going to open the phones up in about 10 minutes.
[3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:23.880]  We should talk about what Bob Desi today really has been studying and writes articles for New American Magazine
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:25.880]  and hosting his TV show for nigh on.
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:26.880]  Is it a decade yet?
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:27.880]  Nine years.
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:28.880]  Nine years.
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:31.880]  We just finished our ninth year, I can't believe it.
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:36.880]  So bottom line, this is being devalued, but not as fast as the bankers would have liked.
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:39.880]  If this bailout would have passed, the dollar would have gone down.
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:42.880]  Gold probably, the more I think about it, probably would have gone up either way.
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:47.880]  Now, look for the dollar to stay the same, though it's dropping.
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:51.880]  I would think it would stay the same, saying that as much damage has been done,
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:53.880]  we wouldn't drop any more for now.
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:10:56.880]  I would think it would have gone down further if they would have passed this,
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:11:00.880]  but gold regardless is why it's a lot of crazy things are going on.
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  What is the establishment going to do now?
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:09.880]  Because they had the Republican and Democratic leadership in the House and in the Senate,
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:16.880]  in the executive with the Republicans and most of these governors on both parties coming out and saying we had to have it.
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:19.880]  Most of the TV coverage said, well, the people don't want it, but you need it.
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:23.880]  And so the new spin over the weekend was, we know the people don't want it,
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:25.880]  but you don't know what's best for you.
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:26.880]  You've got to have something.
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:28.880]  It's a bad plan, but it's better than nothing.
[3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:29.880]  We're going to have a depression.
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:31.880]  Paulson came out yelling, fire in a theater.
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:34.880]  He should be, you know, you've got free speech.
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:40.880]  But as the Secretary of the Treasury who's committed most of these crimes and let all this happen and been involved in it,
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:46.880]  and conflict of interest giving tens of billions a week to Goldman Sachs that he just ran a few years ago,
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:48.880]  he needs to step down.
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:49.880]  He needs a resign.
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:54.880]  Now, I don't think he should be arrested, even though in his power position, he yelled fire in a theater.
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:56.880]  I mean, he needs to be shut up.
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:12:03.880]  He needs to be told by the President, shut your mouth, stop saying we're going to have a depression.
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:07.880]  And they've had Bernanke running around saying that, because these are the big financial heads,
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:10.880]  and they're saying run for the hills if this doesn't pass.
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:12.880]  And now, here's the bottom line.
[3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:15.880]  I'm thinking about this as I talk.
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:17.880]  Here's the bottom line.
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:22.880]  If there is a depression out of this, they'd already set all this up and let us into this.
[3:12:22.880 --> 3:12:27.880]  They need to get the blame for saying a depression would come if this didn't pass.
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:35.880]  If the stock market tanks buy a third today, which is shaping up to lose 10% at least today, it looks like,
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:38.880]  if that happens, they are the ones that did it.
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:46.880]  They caused the previous economic activities and set up the system that's now causing this,
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:52.880]  and they then grandstand it and said, give us pardons, give us unlimited political power,
[3:12:52.880 --> 3:12:55.880]  create a fourth branch of government, above all the rest of the government,
[3:12:55.880 --> 3:12:59.880]  make the private, federal reserve governmental, just always been private basically,
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:03.880]  give them governmental powers, or armageddon, fiscal armageddon.
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:06.880]  And so they are behind it all.
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:09.880]  They engineered what's happened, and now they're fear-mongering.
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  I'm concerned, Bob, I don't know how the market isn't going to completely tank.
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:16.880]  And plus, you notice they're not in there with the plunge protection team, it appears,
[3:13:16.880 --> 3:13:19.880]  with the federal reserve dumping money into the market to prop it up.
[3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:22.880]  So these bastards are in control, and they're doing it any way you cut it.
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:23.880]  Bob Dacian.
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:29.880]  Well, you know, one good thing about all this, and people of my ilk have said for years and years and years,
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:35.880]  that the salvation of this country in terms of politically has never been through the executive branch of the government.
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  The House of Representatives has always been the place that it's kind of like we have to rely on them, unfortunately.
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:47.880]  And look, and in this particular case, it looks like massive pressure on the part of the people of the United States
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:51.880]  has finally gotten the House to pay attention.
[3:13:51.880 --> 3:13:56.880]  And, you know, although I would be a lot more comfortable if they would conduct an investigation
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:14:03.880]  and start indicting some of these people, because, you know, Nancy Kaptor herself, Democratic representative,
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:08.880]  she said yesterday that there's criminal behavior going on here.
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:12.880]  Well, hey, let's go. You know, now that we've stopped the bailout,
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:15.880]  $2 going up in smoke there, Alex, you better be careful.
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:17.880]  I'm burning a dollar here in the studio.
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:20.880]  I'm burning a dollar here in the studio trying to distract me here.
[3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:22.880]  Yeah, I'm afraid it's going to get on me.
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:28.880]  But, you know, why don't they start, get a grand jury and, uh-oh.
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:30.880]  Okay.
[3:14:30.880 --> 3:14:31.880]  I'm sorry.
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:33.880]  Yeah, blow it at me, Alex.
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:35.880]  Hang on, we got a fire here.
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:37.880]  Well, I wanted to illustrate for people.
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:39.880]  That's going to be the value of the dollar.
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:41.880]  That's about how much it's going to be left.
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:42.880]  Well, actually, Alex.
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:44.880]  From what it was in 1913.
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:45.880]  How big of a piece.
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:46.880]  When the private Federal Reserve took over.
[3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:48.880]  We told you these guys would take advantage of everybody.
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:51.880]  Hey, anybody, if you want to believe this, all you got to do is go on the Internet
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:55.880]  and get one of those inflation calculators and type in whatever amount of money you want to.
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:59.880]  That's already about the value of what it was from that note, about one and a half percent.
[3:14:59.880 --> 3:15:00.880]  That's about right.
[3:15:00.880 --> 3:15:01.880]  I think if I remember correctly.
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:04.880]  They claim three, but that last number was done about two years ago.
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:10.880]  Yeah, I think what it took a dollar to buy now back then, it would cost you a couple of pennies.
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:11.880]  Here, Bob Schoeman's one.
[3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:12.880]  Thank you.
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  This is your dollar relative to like 1913 or 1911.
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:21.880]  When the Jekyll Island meeting took place and they started forming the Federal Reserve.
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:25.880]  This is what they've done to your dollar over the last several years.
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:29.880]  Because literally, I mean, two cents back then.
[3:15:29.880 --> 3:15:33.880]  But while it was worth something, they took it and bought up real assets.
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:36.880]  The final line is all this is, it's a giant scam.
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:41.880]  It's theft of your hard work, your hard labor through the vehicle of inflation.
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:43.880]  You can put that in your wallet.
[3:15:43.880 --> 3:15:46.880]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, I get me happy meal with that, you know.
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:50.880]  I mean, he's vandalizing the currency.
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:52.880]  Shame on you, Alex.
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:55.880]  I mean, literally, that's what this is.
[3:15:55.880 --> 3:16:00.880]  They've been confiscating the value of your hard earned assets for decades through the Federal Reserve system.
[3:16:00.880 --> 3:16:04.880]  It's not hard to understand, but people don't understand money.
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:07.880]  They flat do not understand money.
[3:16:07.880 --> 3:16:12.880]  You know, when they pour a bunch of money into a system without a rise of goods and services,
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:15.880]  then you just dilute the value of the money.
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:17.880]  If you don't understand money, do you understand iced tea?
[3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:21.880]  Well, by the way, someday they're going to get completely rid of the currency.
[3:16:21.880 --> 3:16:22.880]  Got them arrows?
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:27.880]  And when that happens, they're going to take the one and a half percent of what it was worth
[3:16:27.880 --> 3:16:28.880]  when the Federal Reserve took over.
[3:16:28.880 --> 3:16:33.880]  And by the way, in the hundred plus years before that, the dollar kept its value.
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:36.880]  In fact, sometimes they had deflation and it was more valuable.
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:38.880]  See, that way, it encouraged savings.
[3:16:38.880 --> 3:16:44.880]  But why should you save in an economy where they're taking all of the value?
[3:16:44.880 --> 3:16:46.880]  Yeah, used to be in the good old days.
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:48.880]  Well, I guess it was a collection, kind of like old Confederate notes.
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:55.880]  If you took a dollar and parked it on the shelf for a year, you could buy the same amount of stuff with it a year later.
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:16:59.880]  Now you come back and your dollar is missing a big chunk.
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:00.880]  How did that happen?
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:03.880]  And people are too dumb to figure out that that was an inflation tax.
[3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  And that's what they've been doing for all these years.
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:12.880]  And now, like I said, the House of Representatives did something I hadn't figured it out yet.
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:14.880]  I don't know how this is going to settle out, Alex.
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:15.880]  We're celebrating my burning money.
[3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:17.880]  Yeah, we got money to burn.
[3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:18.880]  Why not?
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:19.880]  It's going to be worthless.
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:22.880]  Actually, that'll be used as toilet paper.
[3:17:22.880 --> 3:17:27.880]  Well, yeah, actually, I prefer the U.N. toilet paper to roll myself, but that's a whole other subject.
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:28.880]  You know, I'll actually use that.
[3:17:28.880 --> 3:17:30.880]  I bought a whole thing at a gun show.
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:31.880]  Well, I got some of that.
[3:17:31.880 --> 3:17:33.880]  And when I had family come into town as a joke, it was in there.
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:36.880]  I got that from Daniel New, and I still have it.
[3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:40.880]  You know, it's in my stores in my showcase there, a little roll of U.N. toilet paper.
[3:17:40.880 --> 3:17:41.880]  You don't use it?
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.880]  Well, I like to look at it, you know, because I don't want to run out.
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:46.880]  After it's been used?
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:47.880]  I don't want to run out.
[3:17:47.880 --> 3:17:48.880]  I want to hoard it.
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:50.880]  You know, I want to hoard this stuff.
[3:17:50.880 --> 3:17:52.880]  You're hoarding used toilet paper?
[3:17:52.880 --> 3:17:54.880]  No, U.N. toilet paper, not used toilet paper.
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:17:56.880]  U.N. toilet paper.
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:17:58.880]  There's a difference there, Alex.
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:17:59.880]  Yeah.
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:04.880]  But anyway, I mean, you know, I think part of the problem is you got this one giant bailout.
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:05.880]  I'm not being mean, but it is funny.
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:09.880]  When the illegal aliens, like Walmart and stuff, you notice they don't throw it in the toilet.
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:11.880]  They throw it in the corner.
[3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:15.880]  I'm sorry, folks.
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:16.880]  That's good.
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:18.880]  This show is deteriorating.
[3:18:18.880 --> 3:18:20.880]  I can't handle it anymore.
[3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:22.880]  Yeah, you know, because everything...
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:24.880]  They're coming to take me away.
[3:18:24.880 --> 3:18:25.880]  Everything is insane.
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:28.880]  I mean, the House of Representatives did something good for a change.
[3:18:28.880 --> 3:18:29.880]  I mean, what's with that?
[3:18:29.880 --> 3:18:31.880]  You know, I mean, it's like...
[3:18:31.880 --> 3:18:32.880]  I have said before that...
[3:18:32.880 --> 3:18:34.880]  Because they're probably going to crash the economy and blame it on us.
[3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:35.880]  I don't know.
[3:18:35.880 --> 3:18:38.880]  But, you know, recently I thought that, you know, we've been fighting this delaying action,
[3:18:38.880 --> 3:18:40.880]  going back and back and back and back.
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:44.880]  And the last couple of years to this NAFTA superhighway fight that we've been on,
[3:18:44.880 --> 3:18:47.880]  I feel like we've been going forward and making them retreat.
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:49.880]  There's another little victory for this.
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:51.880]  I don't know whether it's going to be a Pyrrhic victory for us.
[3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:53.880]  Oh, no, Alex is getting some more of his money.
[3:18:53.880 --> 3:18:55.880]  Hey, Alex, I dare you to burn that $100 bill.
[3:18:55.880 --> 3:18:57.880]  I don't have $100 bill.
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:18:58.880]  Oh, well, he's got a $20.
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:18:59.880]  No, I stopped that.
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:01.880]  Look at that.
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:04.880]  He's going to cause a fire in here.
[3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:06.880]  With all the theater lights and everything?
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:09.880]  Yeah.
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:11.880]  I think Alex is celebrating, y'all.
[3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:12.880]  I think he's happy.
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:14.880]  The House of Representatives finally did something smart.
[3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:16.880]  All right, Bob, let's get serious.
[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:19.880]  We're going to end this break for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:23.880]  We are going to let Bob continue.
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:24.880]  We're going to come back and take phone calls.
[3:19:24.880 --> 3:19:27.880]  Bob, we're going to continue right now.
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:29.880]  All right, we'll get serious.
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:31.880]  All right, Bob, go ahead.
[3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:32.880]  This is the break part.
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:33.880]  We're skipping the break.
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:34.880]  We're skipping the break.
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:36.880]  I didn't hear you say that.
[3:19:36.880 --> 3:19:38.880]  Anyway, can I get back to my other subjects?
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:40.880]  Can I tell you about this huge news story?
[3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:41.880]  Because this is important.
[3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:42.880]  This is important.
[3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:43.880]  I want to talk about the economy,
[3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:45.880]  but this is another way of screwing us out of our property.
[3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:46.880]  Sure, go ahead.
[3:19:46.880 --> 3:19:47.880]  All right.
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:48.880]  I'll burn money while you do that.
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:49.880]  Now, you do that.
[3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:53.880]  Okay, we've got in Arizona, you've got a situation where the attorney general,
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:56.880]  under the guise of saving an Air Force base,
[3:19:56.880 --> 3:19:59.880]  is kicking people out of a residential area.
[3:19:59.880 --> 3:20:00.880]  That's freedom.
[3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:01.880]  That's what America's about.
[3:20:01.880 --> 3:20:03.880]  What are you with El Cada, boy?
[3:20:03.880 --> 3:20:05.880]  It's a step up from imminent domain.
[3:20:05.880 --> 3:20:09.880]  With imminent domain, you've got to pay the suckers, see?
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:13.880]  But with this procedure, they have just made sure that nobody in the subdivision
[3:20:13.880 --> 3:20:15.880]  can get a permit to do anything.
[3:20:15.880 --> 3:20:17.880]  Therefore, the house is worthless and they're going to,
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:19.880]  if they have to move, nobody's going to buy it.
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:21.880]  And this thing is sitting literally in between.
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:23.880]  And those people don't move off right now
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:25.880]  without you sending a SWAT team in.
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:29.880]  Yeah, it's sitting between a Canamax corridor location
[3:20:29.880 --> 3:20:35.880]  and a big multi-modal hub that's supposed to be on the other side of it.
[3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:36.880]  And they're kind of in the way.
[3:20:36.880 --> 3:20:39.880]  And what's interesting is that the attorney general of the state,
[3:20:39.880 --> 3:20:40.880]  who wants to run for governor,
[3:20:40.880 --> 3:20:43.880]  has imposed this building moratorium, this permit.
[3:20:43.880 --> 3:20:45.880]  You can't get a permit to do anything in this area.
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:46.880]  That's how you do it.
[3:20:46.880 --> 3:20:47.880]  But...
[3:20:47.880 --> 3:20:48.880]  That's America!
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:50.880]  If it's a commercial development, guess what?
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:52.880]  The permitting process goes on.
[3:20:52.880 --> 3:20:53.880]  It's just the residential.
[3:20:53.880 --> 3:20:54.880]  That's right.
[3:20:54.880 --> 3:20:58.880]  So, obviously, this residence is in the way of this multi-modal hub
[3:20:58.880 --> 3:21:00.880]  linking up to the Canamax corridor.
[3:21:00.880 --> 3:21:01.880]  It doesn't exist.
[3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:02.880]  And the guy who's...
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:04.880]  Seeing an instance of the transition corridor doesn't exist.
[3:21:04.880 --> 3:21:06.880]  Well, yeah, we've been fixing them real good.
[3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:07.880]  We got them pretty good.
[3:21:07.880 --> 3:21:08.880]  You're insane.
[3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:09.880]  Yeah, I'm insane.
[3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:13.880]  Yeah, go read one of my stories on the New American Highway robbery.
[3:21:13.880 --> 3:21:14.880]  It doesn't exist.
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:15.880]  It doesn't exist.
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:16.880]  Yeah, it doesn't exist.
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:17.880]  It doesn't exist.
[3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:18.880]  It doesn't exist.
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:19.880]  Yeah, just talk to...
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:20.880]  None of it exists.
[3:21:20.880 --> 3:21:21.880]  Everything's fine.
[3:21:21.880 --> 3:21:23.880]  The Nation Magazine will tell you that we're all a bunch of nuts.
[3:21:23.880 --> 3:21:26.880]  The Nation Magazine will tell you we're all crazy.
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:27.880]  Yeah.
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:31.880]  But anyway, this story is something else because it's a human interest thing
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:34.880]  where they're kicking people off their property without even having to pay for it.
[3:21:34.880 --> 3:21:36.880]  They're kicking Al-Qaeda off, boy!
[3:21:36.880 --> 3:21:37.880]  White Al-Qaeda.
[3:21:37.880 --> 3:21:38.880]  White Al-Qaeda.
[3:21:38.880 --> 3:21:40.880]  They're secret Al-Qaeda teams everywhere.
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:43.880]  So we gotta take all your rights.
[3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:44.880]  Yeah.
[3:21:44.880 --> 3:21:49.880]  Take all the money because I'm Officer Jack Beard and I'm gonna deal with it for ya.
[3:21:49.880 --> 3:21:52.880]  Well, in this case, it's in Maricopa County.
[3:21:52.880 --> 3:21:54.880]  I don't know what our pile is.
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:57.880]  Oh, that's a great American right there.
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:21:58.880]  Yeah, that's right.
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:00.880]  But anyway, it's gonna be interesting to see what happens there.
[3:22:00.880 --> 3:22:04.880]  And the problem is that it's a long-term deal.
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:06.880]  The military says they don't need the land for their...
[3:22:06.880 --> 3:22:08.880]  In fact, I'm sure of our pile.
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:10.880]  Give me your wallet right now or you're with Al-Qaeda.
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:11.880]  Pink underwear for you, buddy.
[3:22:11.880 --> 3:22:12.880]  Give me the wallet.
[3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:13.880]  Pink underwear.
[3:22:13.880 --> 3:22:14.880]  Give me the wallet, boy.
[3:22:14.880 --> 3:22:15.880]  Pink drawers.
[3:22:15.880 --> 3:22:17.880]  Give me your wallet right now.
[3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:18.880]  Give it to me.
[3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:19.880]  No.
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:20.880]  Give it to me.
[3:22:20.880 --> 3:22:21.880]  No.
[3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:23.880]  Get the SWAT team immediately.
[3:22:23.880 --> 3:22:24.880]  Yeah, that's right.
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:25.880]  Yeah, right.
[3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:26.880]  The SWAT team.
[3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:27.880]  What?
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:28.880]  The SWAT team?
[3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:29.880]  I don't know.
[3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:30.880]  Look at this guy.
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:31.880]  He's going nuts.
[3:22:31.880 --> 3:22:32.880]  I swear.
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:33.880]  We're gonna get the SWAT team.
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:34.880]  That ain't gonna happen.
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:35.880]  That ain't gonna happen.
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:36.880]  Give it to me.
[3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:37.880]  Okay, give you what?
[3:22:37.880 --> 3:22:38.880]  It's a joke.
[3:22:38.880 --> 3:22:39.880]  What am I gonna give it to you?
[3:22:39.880 --> 3:22:40.880]  Well, you're afraid I'm gonna burn it?
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:41.880]  Hey, this?
[3:22:41.880 --> 3:22:42.880]  This money?
[3:22:42.880 --> 3:22:44.880]  What do you want me to give to you?
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:45.880]  My wallet?
[3:22:45.880 --> 3:22:46.880]  No, I don't have...
[3:22:46.880 --> 3:22:47.880]  I'm sorry.
[3:22:47.880 --> 3:22:48.880]  I don't have...
[3:22:48.880 --> 3:22:49.880]  I don't carry a wallet.
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:50.880]  I don't have my papers on me, Alex.
[3:22:50.880 --> 3:22:51.880]  I'm sorry.
[3:22:51.880 --> 3:22:52.880]  You don't have your papers?
[3:22:52.880 --> 3:22:54.880]  No, I do not have my papers on me.
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:22:55.880]  We're coming back to the full audience.
[3:22:55.880 --> 3:22:57.880]  Actually, tell your story in a serious fashion.
[3:22:57.880 --> 3:22:58.880]  Okay.
[3:22:58.880 --> 3:22:59.880]  In a serious fashion.
[3:22:59.880 --> 3:23:00.880]  Hold on.
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:01.880]  We're coming back in just a minute.
[3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:02.880]  First, give me your wallet.
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:03.880]  No.
[3:23:03.880 --> 3:23:04.880]  Forget that.
[3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:06.880]  I don't have assets to myself.
[3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:09.880]  But I'm gonna send a SWAT team anti-government.
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:14.380]  Okay, so when are we gonna be back on the normal audience right now, so I can be serious
[3:23:14.380 --> 3:23:15.380]  about this?
[3:23:15.380 --> 3:23:17.880]  This is the insane asylum alternate dimension.
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:18.880]  Yeah.
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:21.880]  Well, this is important stuff, though.
[3:23:21.880 --> 3:23:22.880]  All right, all right, all right.
[3:23:22.880 --> 3:23:23.880]  I'm gonna be serious right now.
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:25.880]  In fact, I'm gonna give you the floor.
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:26.880]  I'm gonna...
[3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:29.880]  I just want everybody to know he's an extremist.
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:31.880]  Alcada wants to attack you.
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:33.880]  Don't listen to him.
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:34.880]  Go ahead.
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:35.880]  All right.
[3:23:35.880 --> 3:23:36.880]  We're back live.
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:37.880]  So here's what you have, basically.
[3:23:37.880 --> 3:23:38.880]  There's a war on for your mind.
[3:23:38.880 --> 3:23:39.880]  All right, Bob.
[3:23:39.880 --> 3:23:41.880]  I'm gonna quit screwing around.
[3:23:41.880 --> 3:23:45.880]  Once I start into comics, I'm actually like to screw around and be funny.
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:46.880]  Once I start, it's hard to quit.
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:48.880]  That's why I don't do it very often.
[3:23:48.880 --> 3:23:50.880]  Officer Jack Budd has now left the building.
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:51.880]  He's very handsome.
[3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:56.880]  He looks just like me, except he has a face like this.
[3:23:56.880 --> 3:23:59.880]  He feels very entitled, but I'm gonna stop it.
[3:23:59.880 --> 3:24:01.880]  Tell me about the Cannamax Highway thing.
[3:24:01.880 --> 3:24:02.880]  That's big.
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:03.880]  It's a Kansas City hub.
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:06.880]  They're trying to take over Texas, but they're also setting some stuff up in Arizona.
[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:07.880]  Tell us about it.
[3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:11.880]  Well, the NAFTA Super Highway is not just Trans-Texas Corridor 35 going through Texas.
[3:24:11.880 --> 3:24:14.880]  It's a series of about 80 highways going all over the place.
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:18.880]  And this particular one is running near Whitman, Arizona.
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:21.880]  And there's a former radio talk show host out there by the name of Dave Hodges.
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:23.880]  I don't know if you know who he is.
[3:24:23.880 --> 3:24:24.880]  They oughta breast him.
[3:24:24.880 --> 3:24:25.880]  But, well, he...
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:27.880]  I was on his show about a year ago.
[3:24:27.880 --> 3:24:29.880]  He's talking about imaginary North American Union.
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:30.880]  That's illegal.
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:33.880]  Hey, what do you think of the Obama truth squads out wanting to have cops arrest people
[3:24:33.880 --> 3:24:34.880]  that disagree with Obama?
[3:24:34.880 --> 3:24:36.880]  That is the definition of insanity.
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:39.880]  No, that's the definition of freedom, boy.
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:41.880]  I'll say whatever I want to about Obama.
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:43.880]  I'll say whatever I want to about McCain.
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:50.880]  And speaking of McCain, McCain is the guy behind this stuff in Arizona.
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:52.880]  That's the interesting part about this.
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:53.880]  Now we will get serious.
[3:24:53.880 --> 3:24:54.880]  Tell us about it.
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:55.880]  All right.
[3:24:55.880 --> 3:24:58.880]  So you've got these people that are living in this area, which has been permitted.
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:03.880]  The attorney general of the state of Arizona has said, sorry, guys, no more permits for
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:04.880]  you.
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:05.880]  That'll force them off their land.
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:09.880]  Remember in Austin several years ago, out west of here, they said, okay, no more development.
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:10.880]  We've got to protect the...
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:14.880]  And then they later take the restriction off ahead of themselves as our criminals and
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:16.880]  the mindless yacht, these dance around loving men con.
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:20.880]  They drove down the price of everybody's stuff out there, and then they get a bond
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:21.880]  for us to buy it.
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:22.880]  And the farmers wouldn't get their land up.
[3:25:22.880 --> 3:25:23.880]  They sent SWAT teams.
[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:27.880]  And then after the price was down, they bought it, and then all of a sudden a few years later,
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:30.120]  all these rich developments are popping up out there.
[3:25:30.120 --> 3:25:31.120]  Of course.
[3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:34.000]  Well, that's the same idea out here, except for these guys are in the way of the Cannamix
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:35.760]  corridor development.
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:38.040]  And it's a real interesting story.
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:44.480]  And I think that the human interest part of it is like, okay, how would you like it if
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:49.880]  you had a house and you had a fire and you couldn't get a permit to rebuild your kitchen?
[3:25:49.880 --> 3:25:51.480]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[3:25:51.480 --> 3:25:54.920]  Or if you've got to move, you own a house, you want to move, and nobody's going to buy
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:55.920]  your house.
[3:25:55.920 --> 3:25:56.920]  So it's just like New London, Connecticut.
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:25:57.920]  They're going to kick them out.
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:25:58.920]  They're forcing it.
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:01.320]  But it's better than New London, Connecticut, for the New World Order crowd.
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:03.840]  I mean, oh, it's more abusive.
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:06.200]  Because they don't even have to do the imminent domain.
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:07.200]  Excellent.
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:09.520]  Because they have a longer period of time before they build this thing.
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:11.560]  They're just going to force them out by attrition.
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:12.920]  They don't even have to pay them.
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:14.200]  They're going to kick them out by attrition.
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:15.200]  That's freedom.
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:16.200]  Yeah.
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:17.200]  That's freedom for the New World Order.
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:19.520]  The American people laughed and giggled about that Iraqi children.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:20.520]  Now they can be slashed.
[3:26:20.520 --> 3:26:23.520]  And the same thing they do in Texas, they're doing over there, they're couching it with
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:29.760]  all the local politicos as some sort of a economic development thing, and you peonic
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:31.360]  homeowners are in the way.
[3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:35.320]  And they try to make it a local issue when they know full well it's not.
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:38.160]  And John McCain is the one that was behind all this.
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:39.160]  No.
[3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:40.160]  That's right.
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:45.480]  His people were at the meetings trying to make sure that this stuff was going through.
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:48.400]  He had a peculiar interest in making sure that these...
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:50.120]  Well, I'm sure it's Mafia Don Watsonball.
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:55.440]  These deed exceptions were gotten rid of, so these people are in big trouble.
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:58.360]  There's four areas in the state that they're doing this, not just one.
[3:26:58.360 --> 3:26:59.360]  Four areas.
[3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:03.400]  And when we get a story up on that, I want to send it to you because it's huge.
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:06.920]  It is huge because this trans-Texas corridor thing we've been going through, that's just
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:07.920]  Texas.
[3:27:07.920 --> 3:27:08.960]  You know, that's the main trunk.
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:11.260]  But they got the Can-Mex corridor, they got the inter-
[3:27:11.260 --> 3:27:15.840]  There's 83 of these, and by the way, when state started blocking it, Bush just signed
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:19.640]  an executive order to start grabbing people's land and grabbing the roads.
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:27.320]  Yeah, and of course, our governor here in the state totally trashed House Bill 2006,
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:31.800]  which prohibited these imminent domain proceedings, where they force you off your land.
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:35.680]  Yeah, but when he does a press conference, he puts on a fake Texas accent and goes,
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:38.400]  Eugh, yeet, so people like it.
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:40.440]  Don't be hard on him, Alex.
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:41.520]  His mansion burned down.
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:42.880]  He's living in a shack somewhere.
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:43.880]  Yeah, one of the...
[3:27:43.880 --> 3:27:46.520]  Oh, by the way, I was supposed to call Texas Monthly again this morning.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:48.200]  They want to interview me.
[3:27:48.200 --> 3:27:49.960]  What is going on around here?
[3:27:49.960 --> 3:27:53.120]  I just forget everything, and I'm supposed to call...
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:57.120]  We're going to talk about that after I burn some more Federal Reserve notes.
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:00.160]  Why don't you just go buy some stuff with them now instead of later, because they're
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:01.840]  worth more now than they will be tomorrow.
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:03.360]  That's my whole point, is that the new order...
[3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:04.360]  I mean, you better...
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:05.360]  Well, yeah, but don't burn them.
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:07.120]  Just go buy toilet paper with them.
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:08.120]  You...
[3:28:08.120 --> 3:28:09.120]  United Nations with the United Nations?
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:10.120]  United Nations toilet paper.
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:11.120]  It's on sale.
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:12.120]  You ought to get some.
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:13.640]  Yeah, it works.
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:15.400]  But the UN doesn't exist, Bob.
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:16.400]  Yeah, right.
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:17.400]  Yeah, right.
[3:28:17.400 --> 3:28:21.760]  Well, I have people telling me that the European Union doesn't exist, and they're serious.
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:24.920]  Did you know it's still called a conspiracy theory to say that exists?
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:30.120]  Well, look, you know as well as I do that 70% of the population in the United States
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:31.160]  is a bunch of idiots.
[3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:35.000]  You know that, and you'll never wake them up, because all they care about is them cowboys.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  How about them cowboys?
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  What's about them cowboys?
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:40.520]  They lost yesterday to what all this economy stuff.
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:43.280]  The cowboys lost to the redskins of all places.
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:44.600]  However, you know what happened to us?
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:45.600]  It was good.
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:47.600]  The Eagles lost, too.
[3:28:47.600 --> 3:28:48.600]  Oh, no!
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:51.600]  You mean the cowboys lost to the redskins?
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:52.600]  All is not lost.
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:53.600]  Get a rope, Junior!
[3:28:53.600 --> 3:28:56.080]  The Eagles lost, though, so all is not lost.
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:29:02.600]  I'm just glad I got your Debbie, but I like the way things are runnin' and runnin'.
[3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:07.000]  Anyways, I had a caller yesterday say that he wanted to come down to the studio and arrest
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  Webster Tarpley, because he was criticizing Lord Obama.
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:12.000]  He doesn't get it, does he?
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:13.920]  All right, I'm going to start taking phone calls.
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:19.920]  This is Descendant and the Jodlin, Sanity Bob is the one acting crazy.
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:24.040]  All right, anyways, I love doing hillbillies.
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:25.040]  You know why?
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:26.920]  Because I'm hillbilly, so I can do it.
[3:29:26.920 --> 3:29:30.000]  You did something years ago on my show, which you ought to bring back.
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  What's going on?
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:33.120]  Yeah, we're still on there.
[3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:35.920]  You had some guy named Professor Enselmo that you did.
[3:29:35.920 --> 3:29:40.720]  You did this little thing for this Lord, riding along, looking at all the peons.
[3:29:40.720 --> 3:29:42.920]  Look at the pathetic rabble.
[3:29:42.920 --> 3:29:46.320]  Yeah, the rabble.
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:48.680]  That was some funny stuff.
[3:29:48.680 --> 3:29:50.920]  You see, this is the hillbilly look.
[3:29:50.920 --> 3:29:52.920]  Hold on, hold on.
[3:29:52.920 --> 3:29:53.920]  I have to get the mindset.
[3:29:53.920 --> 3:29:57.400]  It's hard to switch back and forth between characters.
[3:29:57.400 --> 3:30:05.000]  And we don't take all the rights, how kind it'll get the rights, you know, or countable.
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:09.400]  But then, there's also, let me do the elitist.
[3:30:09.400 --> 3:30:13.920]  Of course, we've got to eliminate 90% of the rabble.
[3:30:13.920 --> 3:30:16.320]  Why do you think we poison the water?
[3:30:16.320 --> 3:30:18.320]  This is immediately needed.
[3:30:18.320 --> 3:30:23.480]  Yeah, that's the elitist, yeah.
[3:30:23.480 --> 3:30:26.280]  And they had the elitist back in the good old days with the horses when all the peas...
[3:30:26.280 --> 3:30:27.280]  No such thing.
[3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:28.680]  There were no kings or queens.
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:31.240]  No elites dominated the people, doesn't exist.
[3:30:31.240 --> 3:30:32.440]  There's no elite corruption.
[3:30:32.440 --> 3:30:35.000]  There's nothing bad going on, Bob.
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  Everything's fine.
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:39.040]  Everything is fine because the eagles lost too, okay?
[3:30:39.040 --> 3:30:40.040]  It's good.
[3:30:40.040 --> 3:30:41.040]  The eagles lost.
[3:30:41.040 --> 3:30:43.680]  That means the cowboys really didn't lose any ground in their division, you understand?
[3:30:43.680 --> 3:30:44.680]  Were you watching the game last night?
[3:30:44.680 --> 3:30:46.120]  Did you understand what I'm saying?
[3:30:46.120 --> 3:30:47.120]  Were you watching the game?
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:48.920]  Chicago Bears, man.
[3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:50.120]  Come on.
[3:30:50.120 --> 3:30:52.440]  You know, I went to the gym yesterday to lift weights.
[3:30:52.440 --> 3:30:55.840]  And yesterday afternoon was the morning, actually.
[3:30:55.840 --> 3:30:57.840]  And I just watched the men.
[3:30:57.840 --> 3:31:01.440]  And I work out at kind of old folks' gyms, you know, there's something...
[3:31:01.440 --> 3:31:02.640]  Well, you know, you're getting older now.
[3:31:02.640 --> 3:31:03.640]  Well, no, no.
[3:31:03.640 --> 3:31:04.640]  I don't work out at a meat market.
[3:31:04.640 --> 3:31:05.640]  Okay?
[3:31:05.640 --> 3:31:06.640]  Because I just don't like the distractions.
[3:31:06.640 --> 3:31:12.480]  You know, it's just too many guys walking around going, oh, boy, just looking for a problem,
[3:31:12.480 --> 3:31:13.880]  you know, you know, puffed up.
[3:31:13.880 --> 3:31:16.640]  You like to be the only one doing that and intimidating all the old guys.
[3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:17.640]  Exactly.
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:18.640]  No, no, no.
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:19.640]  Now you got it straight.
[3:31:19.640 --> 3:31:20.640]  No, no, seriously.
[3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:23.440]  No one's watching the old guys do it.
[3:31:23.440 --> 3:31:27.840]  Everybody's posing and looking and I'm just trying to ignore it and work out.
[3:31:27.840 --> 3:31:30.280]  I just thought about these guys all act so tough.
[3:31:30.280 --> 3:31:33.240]  Everybody's just so into their image and nobody's going to screw them and their bad
[3:31:33.240 --> 3:31:37.280]  ass and all this and, you know, like men will like walk around a corner and you're trying
[3:31:37.280 --> 3:31:40.920]  to walk somewhere and then when you try to get out of their way, they kind of go, hmm.
[3:31:40.920 --> 3:31:43.400]  I mean, it's really freaking weird.
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:47.520]  And you know, as a man, I'm not thinking about that kind of stuff because, you know, back
[3:31:47.520 --> 3:31:52.160]  when I was a teenager, I was, you know, I was into, you know, fist fighting and being tough
[3:31:52.160 --> 3:31:53.160]  and I thought that was really important.
[3:31:53.160 --> 3:31:56.160]  And later I figured out it's important not to get into those situations.
[3:31:56.160 --> 3:32:00.640]  But the point I was making is these men are so into image and acting tough and acting
[3:32:00.640 --> 3:32:09.360]  savage and full of, you know, bravada and machismo or, you know, they're macho.
[3:32:09.360 --> 3:32:13.480]  Whatever the word is, hey, will you set this with Texas Monthly back up because I keep
[3:32:13.480 --> 3:32:14.480]  forgetting.
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:15.480]  Thank you.
[3:32:15.480 --> 3:32:17.360]  Anyways, the point is, is that, but they cower to cops.
[3:32:17.360 --> 3:32:18.960]  They cower to having their rights violated.
[3:32:18.960 --> 3:32:21.920]  They cower to bankers robbing them and stealing them blind.
[3:32:21.920 --> 3:32:26.760]  They, I mean, a real man gets really mad about being a slave and his children being slaves
[3:32:26.760 --> 3:32:28.400]  and corrupt elites.
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:31.000]  And then somehow we've been taught, oh, we're going back live.
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:32.000]  Here we go.
[3:32:32.000 --> 3:32:33.000]  We're going live.
[3:32:33.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  Here we go.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:44.600]  I was telling the story that we're going to your phone calls, part of the insane asylum
[3:32:44.600 --> 3:32:48.200]  and day here on the radio with Bob Desi.
[3:32:48.200 --> 3:32:50.840]  He's been really out of control today, Bob, and I don't appreciate it.
[3:32:50.840 --> 3:32:53.520]  You need to learn to settle down on air a little bit.
[3:32:53.520 --> 3:32:55.760]  You know, you're going to be with those yuppies one of these days.
[3:32:55.760 --> 3:32:59.120]  Boy, you're going to be on the street corner holding up a sign that says, we'll work for
[3:32:59.120 --> 3:33:00.120]  latte.
[3:33:00.120 --> 3:33:01.120]  Exactly.
[3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:03.640]  You know, or maybe dreaming of the ultimate expresso.
[3:33:03.640 --> 3:33:05.440]  But Bobby really should settle down to that.
[3:33:05.440 --> 3:33:06.440]  This has been kind of a crowd.
[3:33:06.440 --> 3:33:07.880]  I've never seen you act like this.
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:10.680]  You're going to be sitting there with a shopping cart next to you with a sign that says my
[3:33:10.680 --> 3:33:12.240]  other car was a Mercedes.
[3:33:12.240 --> 3:33:16.680]  You know, people tell me that I shouldn't be so serious and let me tell you the truth.
[3:33:16.680 --> 3:33:18.240]  I'm having trouble being serious all the time.
[3:33:18.240 --> 3:33:20.440]  I am sick of the new world order, aren't you, Bob?
[3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:21.800]  Yeah, but you know what?
[3:33:21.800 --> 3:33:24.240]  It's kind of fun fighting them, you know?
[3:33:24.240 --> 3:33:25.760]  I don't have any trouble sleeping or not.
[3:33:25.760 --> 3:33:26.760]  I really don't.
[3:33:26.760 --> 3:33:27.760]  But see, you're a real man.
[3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:28.880]  I'm not, and you're not a macho guy.
[3:33:28.880 --> 3:33:31.680]  You're not a guy that gets into being a tough guy, but you know, your whole family, military
[3:33:31.680 --> 3:33:33.480]  folks, cops, people like that.
[3:33:33.480 --> 3:33:35.160]  And you know, you're people that really do love America.
[3:33:35.160 --> 3:33:37.880]  So as a real patriot, you're actually fighting a new world order.
[3:33:37.880 --> 3:33:40.480]  Not all these fake conservatives that like I was talking about during the break, they
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:46.040]  go to the gym and they walk around looking at everybody and acting tough and swaggering.
[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:49.680]  But if somebody's violating their rights, they literally start peeing down the side
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:50.760]  of their leg.
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:55.160]  If somebody pushes them around, if the IRS does something, they crap their pants.
[3:33:55.160 --> 3:33:57.640]  And they live this life of cowardice to government.
[3:33:57.640 --> 3:34:01.080]  And they rationalize that the government isn't corrupt and the government isn't bad.
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:04.600]  And they cower in fear of what their neighbors would think if they were to come out and fight
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:05.960]  the new world order.
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:10.440]  And they, you know, we need you to be real men out there and real women and just stop
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:15.360]  being so stupid and stop, I mean, you know, these good old boys will get mad at their
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:17.920]  neighbor parks and their parking space.
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:21.800]  But they could care less if somebody's putting sodium fluoride that eats holes in their brains
[3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:22.800]  in their water.
[3:34:22.800 --> 3:34:24.000]  I mean, Bob, you get the point I'm making.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:25.760]  I completely understand the point you're making.
[3:34:25.760 --> 3:34:30.680]  Today in my store, we were talking, we always talk politics in the store, a customer comes
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:35.120]  in, listens to us talking about the proposed terms of the bailout and he just comes up
[3:34:35.120 --> 3:34:38.480]  to the front and he says, hey, they're not going to let those executives have any of
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:39.480]  that money.
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:40.480]  That's good.
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:47.680]  And then they're going to make them, they're going to make them pay back the money in
[3:34:47.680 --> 3:34:48.680]  five years.
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:52.400]  So like, so like you're hearing him regard to take the pre-packaged propaganda where
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:34:54.240]  they told, oh, we'll get the executives.
[3:34:54.240 --> 3:34:55.240]  Oh, yes.
[3:34:55.240 --> 3:34:57.720]  Well, not the shareholders, though, the Rothschilds.
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:00.960]  I mean, when I heard that, I think this guy just fallen for a hook line and sinker.
[3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:02.200]  Of course, I straighten him out.
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:05.800]  I don't know if he left straightened out, but, but I explained what it actually said.
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:07.320]  These guys never want to admit when they're wrong.
[3:35:07.320 --> 3:35:08.680]  I want to know if I'm wrong.
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:10.080]  I want to know if I'm being conned.
[3:35:10.080 --> 3:35:15.800]  A lot of these, you know, good old boy types, they're into, you just shut your mouth, Alcada.
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:18.920]  You know what I find out about you, Alex, I'm going to tell you something about you.
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:22.600]  You know, I get all these comp, these comments about, you know, I'm on TV in Austin and
[3:35:22.600 --> 3:35:26.880]  Alameda talking about, oh, Alex Jones, you know, Alex Jones, and a lot of people love
[3:35:26.880 --> 3:35:31.600]  to criticize you because of how bombastic you are or whatever.
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:33.720]  You know, you're, and you know what I tell them?
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.440]  I say, I'm going to tell you what's wrong with Alex Jones.
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:41.520]  What I'll tell you, because I know the guy, what's wrong with Alex Jones is he knows
[3:35:41.520 --> 3:35:43.440]  more than you do.
[3:35:43.440 --> 3:35:44.940]  And that's it.
[3:35:44.940 --> 3:35:45.940]  That's it.
[3:35:45.940 --> 3:35:46.940]  That's your problem.
[3:35:46.940 --> 3:35:47.940]  You know too much.
[3:35:47.940 --> 3:35:52.040]  Well, you've been around long enough to know my story, you know, I saw him when my dad
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:55.720]  came back one day from the IRS, he's been talking about it, and he said, I've always
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:35:59.640]  paid, I have a CPA, and they sat across the table from him in Dallas, and they said, we're
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:02.520]  white crawler criminals, we're going to take everything you have, you know, and they laughed
[3:36:02.520 --> 3:36:03.520]  at him.
[3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:07.040]  And I remember seeing my dad when I was, you know, like 12 years old, talking about that
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:08.960]  at the dinner table, and I knew he was straight-less.
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:12.960]  He stopped and changed tires, me and my mother would say, please don't stop, he stopped at
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  every car.
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:16.760]  You know, I mean, really goody two shoes, but also smart and nice guy.
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:19.480]  And I watched him get pushed around, cheated, things like that.
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:22.960]  Then my grandparents, you know, they didn't even own this creek behind their house, but
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:25.320]  the city gave them $2,000 a day fines.
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:28.560]  While I was covering him doing this to other old people, my grandpa went back there, cleaned
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:31.000]  it out, had a heart attack, and basically let her kill him.
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:34.400]  And so that's the kind of thing, I mean, you know, in America, you're not supposed to have
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:39.000]  some bastard from the city making your grandparents clean out city property so they can try to
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:42.320]  steal their house, or you're not supposed to, I remember going to ranchers and farmers'
[3:36:42.320 --> 3:36:47.000]  houses after I got on air, when the city was stealing it for environmental reasons, giggling
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:50.240]  and laughing that they were going to sell it all to developers later.
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:52.400]  And they wouldn't pay, and I mean, that pissed me off.
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:55.720]  And I'm not a good guy, I'm a normal person.
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:37:00.920]  As a man, when criminals are robbing people of their land, that pisses me off, Bob.
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:03.160]  And well it should, and there needs to be more of that.
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:05.560]  But people always thank me, I don't need to be thanked.
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:08.440]  I mean, aren't we supposed to be mad about being screwed?
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:09.440]  Absolutely.
[3:37:09.440 --> 3:37:12.280]  And I got news for anybody that's, you know, on the, on the road.
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:15.360]  On the fringe of whether they want to get involved in fighting the New World Order or
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:16.360]  not.
[3:37:16.360 --> 3:37:19.560]  You know, I've been doing this now for fighting the New World Order for 10 years.
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:24.760]  And my response, and I've gotten a, you know, I have some national following now, and I've
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:26.560]  got a lot of local following.
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:34.840]  My response to that is, in my own personal experience, I would say 99.5% of my direct
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:37.640]  responses from people have been positive.
[3:37:37.640 --> 3:37:43.080]  And that little 0.5% that's negative is coming from guys that are supposed to be on our side
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:44.720]  that just disagree with our methodology.
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:46.680]  Well, no, they'd like to bitch.
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:49.920]  They're in this to be studs and to be leaders.
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:54.840]  And they get sick of hearing, you know, Alex Jones' name, hey folks, I'm not Bernaki taking
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:55.840]  your money.
[3:37:55.840 --> 3:38:00.440]  And that's what's wrong about this, is we're a nation of second-guessers, and it's fine
[3:38:00.440 --> 3:38:02.440]  to second-guess if you're on the field.
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:07.000]  But they're sitting up in the peanut gallery, bitching and complaining, and they haven't
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:10.600]  walked a mile or a hundred miles or a thousand miles in our shoes, Bob.
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:17.440]  Yeah, and I would like to say, I wish I could go back in time and get a hold of Paul Revere
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:18.680]  and Patrick Henry.
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:20.320]  Al Qaeda Revere, according to the government?
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:23.960]  Paul Revere and Patrick Henry, and take a look at him and see whether or not you or
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:25.520]  both of those guys reincarnate.
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:26.520]  Oh, please.
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:30.320]  Bob, you need to quit being so nice to me, please.
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:32.000]  Oh, man, I'll tell you what, you know.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:34.480]  You know, it actually makes me feel bad, though, because I realize I'm not doing a good enough
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  job.
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:38.080]  I don't work hard enough in this fight, and I'm just doing my day.
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:39.080]  Here's another one.
[3:38:39.080 --> 3:38:40.080]  Here's another one, Alex.
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:42.200]  You know, you're just a guy.
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:43.200]  You know?
[3:38:43.200 --> 3:38:44.200]  I mean, you know, you're just a guy.
[3:38:44.200 --> 3:38:48.160]  Jason Burmese has been down here for several months working on his film down here, right?
[3:38:48.160 --> 3:38:49.160]  Yeah.
[3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:50.160]  Okay, he's got this.
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:54.360]  He's got the number one film in the history of the Internet, Loose Change's second edition.
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:57.120]  He comes up with another one, Loose Change's Final Cut.
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:00.440]  He's down here in your area, here in Austin, for several months.
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:04.440]  He was on our show, Simple Truth, locally here three times.
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:08.760]  And guess what, Jason Burmese is just a guy.
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:10.360]  Just a nice guy.
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:11.360]  That's all.
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:12.560]  He's not pretentious.
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:14.040]  He's just a nice guy.
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:15.040]  And that's who we are.
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:17.720]  And he's not borderline insane like me, so that's good.
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:22.240]  Yeah, well, he's not as bombastic as you are, you know, but he's just a nice guy.
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:28.360]  The people that we work with in this movement, by and large, are just people, just regular
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:29.360]  folks.
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:32.360]  Well, and I want to point that out, and I want to point out to those that detract who
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:33.520]  claim they're in our movement.
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:38.000]  A lot of them are feds, but a lot of them are just, they're the damaged goods of America.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:41.440]  And so they woke up, but they still can't shed, you know, the things they do and the
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:42.440]  way they operate.
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:43.440]  But that's okay.
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:46.560]  We have to ignore those people, not spend our time on it and move on.
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:50.160]  But Bob, I want to take the last 15 minutes, we've got 20 left, but in the last 15 I want
[3:39:50.160 --> 3:39:51.160]  to take calls.
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:54.400]  I promise 1-800-25 at 999-231, we're about to go to them.
[3:39:54.400 --> 3:39:56.800]  But Bob, before we do that, there was some other things in your list.
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:00.120]  I mean, run through the gamut quickly of your points, because they're so good.
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:06.320]  Well, you know, the point is that in order to understand this, you have to understand
[3:40:06.320 --> 3:40:10.920]  that the powers that be are not trying to fix anything.
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:15.480]  If you think, like the press says, that they're trying to fix the economy, they're not trying
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:20.920]  to fix the economy, they're trying to fix themselves to your wallet, transfer all their
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:25.240]  bad debt to you, and abscond with the goods.
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:30.240]  If you think that the leaders of the House, the leaders of the Senate, the people in the
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:34.760]  Federal Reserve, the executive branch, Bush and Crow, you think they're trying to help
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:37.960]  you, you are so off base, you're never going to get it.
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:43.000]  I mean, even Ben Sargent, who we can't stand, you know, he's a cartoonist for the American
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:46.040]  Statesmen, he draws some pretty good cartoons every once in a while.
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:53.760]  He had a cartoon the other day where you had this used car salesman, which was the Treasury
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:56.920]  Secretary, trying to sell his used cars as is.
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:40:59.680]  You got to take the whole thing, and that's all it is to it.
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:03.240]  And this woman is looking at the used car salesman, and Bush is standing behind the
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:08.080]  used car salesman, and the woman says, aren't you the same guys that sold us the Patriot
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:11.600]  Act as is, and the Iraq War as is?
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:13.160]  I mean, wake up.
[3:41:13.160 --> 3:41:14.160]  You know, wake up.
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:19.680]  Now that we're trying to sell you this as is, and I think maybe, just maybe, we're starting
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:20.680]  to wake up.
[3:41:20.680 --> 3:41:24.480]  Well, let's look at what the stock market's doing right now.
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:30.320]  Gold has exploded in price today, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:37.440]  It is up over $33, oh my gosh, I just hit refresh, I'm sorry.
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:44.080]  It's up $40 and 20 cents right now, $40 and 20 cents.
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:52.880]  Ted is offering gold that he bought at $8.75, and he has that position locked in, so there's
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:56.280]  a little markup for the guys, you know, to take the call, but that's, that's, that's,
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:00.760]  tell you what, go grab Ted in here for just 60 seconds, because this is, he said he's
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:05.720]  going to hold this to the end of the day regardless, but gold is now at $40 and 20 cents over
[3:42:05.720 --> 3:42:07.040]  what he's selling it for.
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:10.480]  Now, he already bought it so he can sell it to you, but I don't know how much he has.
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:14.080]  He says he's going to midnight with this.
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.200]  Bob Finisher of The Points, we're going to go to some calls here.
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:18.200]  Well, let me see.
[3:42:18.200 --> 3:42:20.200]  I want to get a lot of yellow notepads.
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:21.440]  I got a lot of yellow notepads.
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:29.040]  I always have hundreds of fine points, but I want to say that this, you know, back, back
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:32.760]  five, three years ago, I went to Baylor University for the new American, and they were talking
[3:42:32.760 --> 3:42:37.800]  about this free trader, the Americas, and I was talking to the heads of the economics
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:40.320]  department at Baylor, the business school people.
[3:42:40.320 --> 3:42:42.640]  They had a little get together before the conference.
[3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:46.520]  The head guys, the deans of the schools, and I was a reporter, and I was talking to them
[3:42:46.520 --> 3:42:47.520]  about economics.
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:53.080]  That's when Lord Fox and, you know, yeah, that was after Fox, that was the follow-up
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:55.600]  meeting to that meeting in Baylor.
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:42:58.880]  And I was talking to them about economics, and I'm not an economist, but I mentioned
[3:42:58.880 --> 3:43:03.560]  that I, you know, I was, I believe in the Austrian School of Economics, you know, Ludwig
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:06.640]  von Mises or whatever, von Mises, however you pronounce it.
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:12.240]  And these guys looked at me like, they had, they literally hadn't even heard the term.
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:13.240]  They hadn't even heard of it.
[3:43:13.240 --> 3:43:16.800]  Well, most of these economists at schools just, just go to little parties and play golf,
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:21.200]  and I have to say it, pick their nose all day, and scratch the crack of their pants.
[3:43:21.200 --> 3:43:26.080]  I mean, well, I mean, they're so educated in the system.
[3:43:26.080 --> 3:43:27.080]  Ted's ready.
[3:43:27.080 --> 3:43:31.320]  You know, that they don't, they didn't even understand what Austrian economics was.
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:33.480]  Maybe I'll listen to Ron Paul now, huh?
[3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:34.480]  Now he looks like a genius.
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:35.480]  Well, see, that's what's happening.
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:36.480]  He isn't that smart.
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:37.480]  I'm not that smart.
[3:43:37.480 --> 3:43:38.480]  We're just average people.
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:39.480]  We're not stupid.
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:42.280]  And we decided we better find out what's going on in the world, and then you find out that
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:43.280]  criminals are running wild.
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:44.680]  I mean, that's really all we're doing.
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:48.200]  And then every time you go, hey, there's crime, the public says that does not exist
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:49.200]  in high places.
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:52.880]  Well, and if, and if you, if you show the crime, then you're a conspiracy theorist, and
[3:43:52.880 --> 3:43:53.880]  I don't deal in theory.
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:54.880]  I really don't.
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:43:55.880]  I don't deal.
[3:43:55.880 --> 3:43:57.400]  I never, I never really have much to, I just deal in fact.
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:00.200]  I'll tell you who engages in theories is the government and the media.
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  Yeah.
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:02.680]  Now there's some real theories out there.
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:03.880]  Like 9-Eleven official story.
[3:44:03.880 --> 3:44:06.320]  That's, that's, that, no, there's a crock right there.
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:09.440]  Now there, now there's a conspiracy theory, 9-Eleven.
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:10.440]  What a conspiracy theory.
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:13.920]  And if you study 9-Eleven as much as we have, I'm going to have you back up sooner.
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:16.800]  I know I've gone crazy today, but we're going to have you up soon.
[3:44:16.800 --> 3:44:21.960]  We're going to take calls here in a moment, but, but Ted Anderson, gold is up over $40
[3:44:21.960 --> 3:44:23.160]  from when you bought it Friday.
[3:44:23.160 --> 3:44:28.480]  You have it $40 cheaper than what it's now being sold for when you factor it in.
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:32.280]  I mean, you're going to be able to hold this deal today.
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:40.880]  Ted, Ted Anderson is in the Minnesota studio, but he is not coming to the microphone.
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:46.120]  I don't know why they have the studio in a separate room in the control room, but he's
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:50.000]  obviously on the cell phone or playing tiddlywinks or something's going on.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:52.120]  I guess we don't have him, John.
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:53.120]  You're sorry about that, Alex.
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:56.040]  I was just printing up the latest market quotes.
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:44:57.040]  What a crazy day.
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:44:58.040]  Are you there still?
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:44:59.040]  Yes, sir.
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:03.880]  Yeah, I tell you, and, and the markets are just, you know, in the toilet, the gold and
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:05.880]  silver is, you know, gold is up like crazy.
[3:45:05.880 --> 3:45:06.880]  Yeah.
[3:45:06.880 --> 3:45:09.120]  How far down the market was almost 600 points down when I last looked.
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:10.120]  Yeah, I know.
[3:45:10.120 --> 3:45:11.480]  It's, it's just been volatile as ever.
[3:45:11.480 --> 3:45:15.200]  And, and, and like I said, Alex, I mean, the gold and silver markets just been strong.
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:16.200]  And I really apologize.
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:20.920]  I'm just trying to pull up the latest kit go it, it is, it's been just crazy.
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:21.920]  The people are calling it.
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:23.320]  I, they really should.
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:29.400]  I still have those, those British sovereigns and the Franks in the, at the same price level.
[3:45:29.400 --> 3:45:31.280]  I didn't change those at all.
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:34.800]  And obviously, you know, gold's now up over 36 bucks.
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:37.680]  We've now, Chad, it's, it's, it's up more than that.
[3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:38.840]  I'm just, I'm sorry.
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:40.120]  They just brought me in a printout here.
[3:45:40.120 --> 3:45:41.120]  Let me take a look here.
[3:45:41.120 --> 3:45:42.120]  Yeah.
[3:45:42.120 --> 3:45:43.120]  Well, it's going up and down.
[3:45:43.120 --> 3:45:44.120]  Yeah.
[3:45:44.120 --> 3:45:46.880]  We're, we're looking at, we're looking at a 91550 right now.
[3:45:46.880 --> 3:45:51.000]  And, and this one cut off the, the high of today, so I don't even get to see that.
[3:45:51.000 --> 3:45:58.520]  But yeah, the markets are just nuts and people, I mean, just about everybody has a stake in
[3:45:58.520 --> 3:46:02.680]  either money in the bank or they got money in the stock market or they're looking at
[3:46:02.680 --> 3:46:05.520]  the annuities or I mean, you name it.
[3:46:05.520 --> 3:46:07.600]  I mean, there's so many different investments that are out there.
[3:46:07.600 --> 3:46:10.880]  You've got IRAs sitting in mutual funds.
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:11.880]  Are you sitting in?
[3:46:11.880 --> 3:46:14.880]  Well, Ted, I'm not going to trust gold and silver in my personal possession.
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:16.760]  I'm going to trust the bankers.
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:23.600]  So I'm going to go invest in, in, you know, the bank stock, say, for Washington Mutual
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:26.760]  because it's, it's, that's what I'm going to do.
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:32.680]  No, I mean, I mean, the, the paper market is, is so, is so gyrating right now.
[3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:33.680]  No.
[3:46:33.680 --> 3:46:37.840]  We've exposed the, you know, this exposes the weaknesses and the manipulation of what
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:39.520]  the fed's been doing.
[3:46:39.520 --> 3:46:44.160]  And now it's just like hitting mainstream and everybody's waking up to this fact.
[3:46:44.160 --> 3:46:48.400]  And gold and silver is in short supply, so people should know listening that when the
[3:46:48.400 --> 3:46:55.480]  general public, I was going to say, public, uh, finally, uh, uh, fumbling public finally
[3:46:55.480 --> 3:46:59.760]  figures this out, Katie Barlador, you're not going to be able to probably get gold or silver
[3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:00.760]  at any price.
[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:03.520]  I mean, that is a real potential we're looking at, Ted.
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:04.520]  It is Alex.
[3:47:04.520 --> 3:47:06.760]  I can tell you right now, supply is tough.
[3:47:06.760 --> 3:47:08.520]  I mean, you can go out there and you can Google it.
[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:12.080]  Like you said, it's right on the very front page of Kitco.
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:14.760]  It's a qualification right on the very first page.
[3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:16.160]  I mean, it is tough.
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:19.280]  Uh, the silver dollars were just non-existent.
[3:47:19.280 --> 3:47:24.520]  I still have some of those right now, but they're poking up there at about $20 a piece.
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:29.440]  And right now you can still pick up the dimes at about 16 per dollar face for, uh, for the
[3:47:29.440 --> 3:47:33.840]  collector type dimes, not the ones that are junk silver like you have, uh, you know, the,
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:34.840]  I understand this.
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:40.360]  I was on Kitco and it said 40 up and then it says 32 up, but doesn't show the bar dropping.
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:41.360]  It's all insane.
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:43.000]  Um, it's hard to catch up.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:44.480]  There's so much volatility right now.
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:48.040]  I mean, you're going to have to look, take a look back, but I will hold these prices
[3:47:48.040 --> 3:47:51.560]  till this evening and people are, people will be crazy.
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:52.560]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:53.560]  Okay.
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:47:56.840]  Let's, uh, thank you, Ted, for coming on.
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:47:57.840]  Yeah.
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:47:58.840]  Thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:47:59.840]  I'll keep you up.
[3:47:59.840 --> 3:48:00.840]  You bet.
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:01.840]  I wanted to have Ted, uh, pop in and just offer it one more time.
[3:48:01.840 --> 3:48:02.840]  I did.
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:03.840]  Ted, be specific.
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:04.840]  He already left.
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:05.840]  I'm here still.
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:06.840]  You bought gold at what?
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:07.840]  And it's now being offered at what?
[3:48:07.840 --> 3:48:08.840]  Well, I mean, we worked out.
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:14.080]  This training ran at 8.79 range, uh, last Friday, uh, to 8.82.
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:18.320]  I can't remember exactly where it locked, where, where we're closed at, but I was able
[3:48:18.320 --> 3:48:22.760]  to accumulate a position at the same British sovereigns I offered on your, our show, your
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:26.960]  show on Friday at the same, exactly price that I'm offering them today.
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:30.520]  Same with the, uh, same with the French Frank and same with the silver coins.
[3:48:30.520 --> 3:48:34.360]  I mean, I'm, I'm holding that deal because I was able to get in there and do something.
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:36.040]  I mean, it was, to me, it was obvious.
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:40.480]  I mean, we, if they bail out the bank, say it could have gone either way, if they, if
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:43.600]  they bailed out the banks, we knew the dollar was going to crash.
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:47.640]  If they didn't bail out the banks, we knew that there's going to be tremendous volatility
[3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:48.640]  in the stock market.
[3:48:48.640 --> 3:48:50.800]  And either way, people win with gold.
[3:48:50.800 --> 3:48:55.800]  It's a win-win situation in 90, in the, in the depression of the 1930s, we went through
[3:48:55.800 --> 3:49:00.120]  this deflationary depression because there was no way for the federal reserve system
[3:49:00.120 --> 3:49:05.480]  to get the money into the economy fast enough to, to, uh, you know, to replace the money
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:08.040]  that was in, that was being defaulted on.
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:12.520]  Every time there's a default in the economy, that money supply disappears, that dollar
[3:49:12.520 --> 3:49:14.160]  for dollar, it goes away.
[3:49:14.160 --> 3:49:15.160]  The way that the Fed gets.
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:17.160]  No, there's no inflation.
[3:49:17.160 --> 3:49:18.480]  So, so here's the thing.
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:19.920]  It's a little different right now, Alex.
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:24.160]  We've got all these government programs that the government has to cover.
[3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:26.200]  You know, they're already on the hook for it.
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:31.160]  When inflation starts rising and the tax base starts to drop and the United States Treasury
[3:49:31.160 --> 3:49:36.040]  is going to have to pay out unemployment benefits and, and, uh, and all these different
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:38.040]  No, no, the economy's wonderful and strong.
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:39.040]  Just hand over your firearms.
[3:49:39.040 --> 3:49:40.040]  Everything will be fine.
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:41.320]  Well, Bob, you wanted to comment?
[3:49:41.320 --> 3:49:42.320]  Yeah.
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:45.640]  Ted, you just said something that really needs to be pointed out when the tax base starts
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:46.640]  to drop.
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:49.240]  You know, they're, they're relying on, just keep raising sales taxes.
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:54.320]  They're relying on communism to bail out capitalism, if, if crony capitalism.
[3:49:54.320 --> 3:50:00.360]  And when, when the government say owns 80% of AIG, well, that means any money that AIG
[3:50:00.360 --> 3:50:02.560]  makes is no longer in the tax space.
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:03.560]  And that's what he's talking about.
[3:50:03.560 --> 3:50:08.120]  You're, and also then those government bureaucrats get to pimp over their own little baronies
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:09.640]  and then selectively enforce.
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:11.920]  You think there's going to be less corruption in AIG?
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:12.920]  It's going to get worse.
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:13.920]  Now.
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:14.920]  Yeah.
[3:50:14.920 --> 3:50:15.920]  And then the government's going to funnel money to them at the expense of the other
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:17.920]  insurance companies because they own it.
[3:50:17.920 --> 3:50:18.920]  All right.
[3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:19.920]  Let's talk to Dan and Matt and others.
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:20.920]  Ted.
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:21.920]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:22.920]  Here's the number one more time.
[3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:24.480]  And then I rest my peace for this day.
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:28.120]  I've said my peace 800 686 2237.
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:31.960]  We're going to talk behind the scenes right now to get everybody government government
[3:50:31.960 --> 3:50:36.400]  is best at governs lease, uh, by the way, that Liberty stickers, I like them, but they
[3:50:36.400 --> 3:50:39.360]  took my 1984 to 1776.
[3:50:39.360 --> 3:50:42.600]  The answer in 1984 to 1776 and they didn't own their bumper sticker.
[3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:46.480]  They didn't give me credit for coining that and that's fine, but they give everybody
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:47.480]  else a quote.
[3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:48.480]  Well, those are good guys.
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:54.360]  I like they are good guys, but I, I, I, I want my name on the sticker.
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:50:57.280]  Turn about his fair play, turkeys.
[3:50:57.280 --> 3:50:58.280]  I don't know.
[3:50:58.280 --> 3:50:59.280]  I'm just joking around.
[3:50:59.280 --> 3:51:00.280]  I don't even care.
[3:51:00.280 --> 3:51:03.600]  The point is, I think that's kind of a cute little saying it was a great saying.
[3:51:03.600 --> 3:51:07.160]  Are you the one that did the, the founding father material quote for Ron Paul?
[3:51:07.160 --> 3:51:08.160]  Yes.
[3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:09.160]  Well, you should get credit for that.
[3:51:09.160 --> 3:51:10.160]  No, I get nothing.
[3:51:10.160 --> 3:51:11.160]  I get hatred.
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:14.280]  Oh, well, it's because you're, you know, you're over the target.
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:15.280]  You get the flag, right?
[3:51:15.280 --> 3:51:16.280]  That's right.
[3:51:16.280 --> 3:51:17.280]  That's right.
[3:51:17.280 --> 3:51:18.280]  Absolutely.
[3:51:18.280 --> 3:51:19.280]  I don't even care.
[3:51:19.280 --> 3:51:22.280]  It's just that, you know, I come up with these little, I've come with a lot of other
[3:51:22.280 --> 3:51:27.260]  sayings, by the way, that maybe you ought to write a little red book of Alex Jones
[3:51:27.260 --> 3:51:29.200]  famous sayings and selling.
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:30.200]  I don't even care anymore.
[3:51:30.200 --> 3:51:31.480]  I haven't even plugged my videos.
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:33.040]  They're a huge part of the solution here.
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:34.040]  It's the same.
[3:51:34.040 --> 3:51:35.040]  And I'm not even plugging those.
[3:51:35.040 --> 3:51:36.040]  I'm plugging nothing.
[3:51:36.040 --> 3:51:39.040]  The sayings of Chairman Alex, you could have a little book.
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:40.040]  Think about it.
[3:51:40.040 --> 3:51:41.040]  Little red one.
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:42.040]  A little red one.
[3:51:42.040 --> 3:51:46.080]  Because, you know, obviously you're, obviously, we could have a little, a little, obviously
[3:51:46.080 --> 3:51:47.080]  you're a communist.
[3:51:47.080 --> 3:51:48.080]  Obviously.
[3:51:48.080 --> 3:51:49.080]  Oh, Jesus, help me.
[3:51:49.080 --> 3:51:50.080]  You don't believe me.
[3:51:50.080 --> 3:51:51.080]  All right.
[3:51:51.080 --> 3:51:52.080]  All right.
[3:51:52.080 --> 3:51:53.080]  Let's go to Dan in Alabama.
[3:51:53.080 --> 3:51:54.080]  You're on the air, Dan.
[3:51:54.080 --> 3:51:55.080]  Hello, Dan-O.
[3:51:55.080 --> 3:51:56.080]  Oh, yes.
[3:51:56.080 --> 3:51:57.080]  Yes.
[3:51:57.080 --> 3:51:58.080]  Book them, Dan-O.
[3:51:58.080 --> 3:51:59.080]  That's what I was mentioning.
[3:51:59.080 --> 3:52:00.080]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:52:00.080 --> 3:52:04.600]  The biggest trouble we got, we got oil to run out of gas in Alabama.
[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:07.680]  Gas is up in oil is 50 cents a gallon.
[3:52:07.680 --> 3:52:12.080]  We can count on farm relation that owns a Senate.
[3:52:12.080 --> 3:52:15.160]  That's the one that's causing all of our, most of 90% of our trouble.
[3:52:15.160 --> 3:52:16.160]  Yeah.
[3:52:16.160 --> 3:52:19.080]  They admit that it was set up by the British to take over the US government, and that's
[3:52:19.080 --> 3:52:24.480]  in official government documents and the states would just start recalling some of these senators
[3:52:24.480 --> 3:52:25.480]  and get them out.
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:27.800]  They might just scare them enough to do something.
[3:52:27.800 --> 3:52:32.720]  Remember 15 years ago when Rush Limbaugh said the CFR didn't exist, and then the internet
[3:52:32.720 --> 3:52:36.440]  came along, people found out they did exist, and now they have to come out on C-span and
[3:52:36.440 --> 3:52:37.440]  TV?
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:39.360]  God, he should have no credibility.
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:41.840]  He knew all about this a long time ago.
[3:52:41.840 --> 3:52:43.520]  He actually admitted it in his books.
[3:52:43.520 --> 3:52:49.080]  Just get something started to get the senators recalled, if CFR senators recall, right?
[3:52:49.080 --> 3:52:52.560]  Well, we used to could do that before the 17th Amendment.
[3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:54.160]  The senators were creatures of the state.
[3:52:54.160 --> 3:52:55.720]  Bob, you're for that, aren't you?
[3:52:55.720 --> 3:52:56.720]  Well, yeah.
[3:52:56.720 --> 3:52:57.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:52:57.720 --> 3:53:00.000]  Because, you know, they get, they get, they screw everything up.
[3:53:00.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  That's what they do.
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:04.200]  But that Limbaugh thing, listen, Limbaugh knows all about this stuff.
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:05.200]  He wrote about it.
[3:53:05.200 --> 3:53:07.240]  He talked about it way back many years ago.
[3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:08.920]  New World Order of the Whole Nine Yards.
[3:53:08.920 --> 3:53:12.880]  He's been exposed to the same material that you were exposed to, and something made him
[3:53:12.880 --> 3:53:13.880]  flip.
[3:53:13.880 --> 3:53:15.600]  You know, maybe that was job security or something.
[3:53:15.600 --> 3:53:18.240]  Maybe that was that $290-something million dollar contract.
[3:53:18.240 --> 3:53:19.240]  Could have been.
[3:53:19.240 --> 3:53:20.240]  Could have been.
[3:53:20.240 --> 3:53:21.240]  Yeah.
[3:53:21.240 --> 3:53:22.240]  It's calling, selling out for the money.
[3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:23.240]  All right.
[3:53:23.240 --> 3:53:24.240]  I appreciate your call.
[3:53:24.240 --> 3:53:28.800]  But don't criticize the Senate or the local police will just say it doesn't exist.
[3:53:28.800 --> 3:53:29.800]  I appreciate your call, Dan.
[3:53:29.800 --> 3:53:30.800]  Here we go.
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:33.120]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:53:33.120 --> 3:53:36.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:53:36.040 --> 3:53:39.760]  Matt in New York, you're on in the final segment with Bob Desi.
[3:53:39.760 --> 3:53:42.360]  Hey, hey, brother Jones.
[3:53:42.360 --> 3:53:43.360]  Hi.
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:44.360]  How you doing?
[3:53:44.360 --> 3:53:45.720]  Matt from We Are Changing New York.
[3:53:45.720 --> 3:53:46.720]  Hey, buddy.
[3:53:46.720 --> 3:53:47.720]  Enjoying.
[3:53:47.720 --> 3:53:48.720]  Enjoying your good humor today.
[3:53:48.720 --> 3:53:50.960]  I love that British elitist character.
[3:53:50.960 --> 3:53:55.280]  You got to do some more of that, but excuse me.
[3:53:55.280 --> 3:54:00.440]  You know, I'm actually calling for him, but I'm actually calling to get some shameless
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:01.440]  plugs in here.
[3:54:01.440 --> 3:54:03.640]  That's what the phone calls are for.
[3:54:03.640 --> 3:54:06.400]  You know, we've got a couple of really big things going on.
[3:54:06.400 --> 3:54:11.440]  You know, they changed our bill number again, and the change of just the change, the Droga
[3:54:11.440 --> 3:54:12.440]  bill.
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:14.640]  It's now HR, 71-74.
[3:54:14.640 --> 3:54:17.760]  Tell folks specifically what that is.
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:22.840]  What that is, is that's the Health and Compensation Act to take all of the dying first responders
[3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:27.040]  who are in misery right now and give them a little bit of a platform to maybe survive.
[3:54:27.040 --> 3:54:30.400]  Well, yeah, and Congress keeps saying no to that, because you can't give the firemen
[3:54:30.400 --> 3:54:32.000]  and police any help, you know.
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:35.040]  Hey, but listen, we got 219 congressmen.
[3:54:35.040 --> 3:54:36.520]  I never expected that to happen.
[3:54:36.520 --> 3:54:41.240]  No, in fact, truth rising, I should add, tells that story and shows that you guys valiantly
[3:54:41.240 --> 3:54:44.360]  in Congress with Cassinic and others fighting for that.
[3:54:44.360 --> 3:54:46.600]  So what's the pluggy, Wug?
[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:51.960]  The plug is, we've got to get on to LLC.gov, find the congressmen that didn't vote, yes,
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:55.280]  and call them, because we've got a couple of days, Congress is in session.
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:54:56.680]  We can get this thing passed.
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:54:59.000]  It takes nothing but 40 more votes.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:02.440]  What bill, what bill, what bill is it attached to?
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:07.160]  It is HR, 71-74, that's what you look it up on LLC.gov.
[3:55:07.160 --> 3:55:10.880]  No, no, I know about the bill, but it's not attached in a larger spending package.
[3:55:10.880 --> 3:55:14.760]  Not, and as far as I know, it's probably not going to pass this session, but yeah, folks
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:16.760]  should call.
[3:55:16.760 --> 3:55:17.760]  Good to hear from you, Matt.
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:18.760]  I really appreciate your call.
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:19.760]  Is this Matt LaPasic?
[3:55:19.760 --> 3:55:21.840]  Oh, I didn't mean to let him go there.
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:26.240]  I wanted to, Matt LaPasic's been on fire lately, great, great guy.
[3:55:26.240 --> 3:55:27.240]  Those guys are awesome.
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:32.680]  In fact, I mean to get Luke and Matt and all those guys on the show very, very soon.
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:35.720]  I had all these sponsors I was supposed to plug, but looks like they don't get theirs
[3:55:35.720 --> 3:55:36.720]  today.
[3:55:36.720 --> 3:55:40.120]  Well, you know, hey, I know you, Alex, you're more interested in the information than you
[3:55:40.120 --> 3:55:42.360]  are in the commercial aspect of your enterprise.
[3:55:42.360 --> 3:55:43.360]  Are you kidding?
[3:55:43.360 --> 3:55:44.360]  I can't, I can't.
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:45.360]  Yeah, you are.
[3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:46.360]  I know.
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:47.360]  I know.
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:49.920]  You know, that makes you, that makes you honest.
[3:55:49.920 --> 3:55:53.520]  Well, I need to plug things, so that's what pays the bills plus their great products.
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:54.520]  In fact, speak of the devil.
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:56.800]  I'm just going to do that here at the end of the show.
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:56:00.840]  Bob Dacey, you know, go in there with Trey and let's get you set up in about two weeks
[3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:04.120]  from now for two hours to come in and talk about all the stuff you're doing because you're
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:05.120]  doing a lot.
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:10.040]  You have a lot of original research and I got so ecstatic and that kind of tripped the
[3:56:10.040 --> 3:56:14.560]  endorphins in my brain with the house voting this down that I kind of got off skilter.
[3:56:14.560 --> 3:56:15.560]  Yeah, it's confusing.
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:17.600]  I'm still, I really, I'm unsettled about it.
[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:22.240]  I'm trying to sort it out and it's going to, it's going to fall somewhere.
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:24.720]  Go set yourself up for two weeks from now and I appreciate you coming in.
[3:56:24.720 --> 3:56:25.720]  Okay.
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:26.720]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:27.720]  I appreciate it.
[3:56:27.720 --> 3:56:28.720]  Bob, thanks for coming in.
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:29.720]  We're going to have you fill in on the show soon too.
[3:56:29.720 --> 3:56:30.720]  Yeah.
[3:56:30.720 --> 3:56:31.720]  Do an excellent job.
[3:56:31.720 --> 3:56:32.720]  It's going to have somebody here to turn the mic up for you.
[3:56:32.720 --> 3:56:33.720]  But not today.
[3:56:33.720 --> 3:56:34.720]  I had to turn your mic down.
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:35.720]  Well, you know, that's because we've got little rambushes.
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:36.720]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:37.720]  Hey, good to have you here.
[3:56:37.720 --> 3:56:41.080]  I appreciate Bob Dacey coming in studio with us.
[3:56:41.080 --> 3:56:44.080]  Re-broadcast is about to start at infowars.com on the internet stream.
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:45.600]  She got to go to those specific streams.
[3:56:45.600 --> 3:56:49.080]  I had a congressman on and started the show about martial law in the house.
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:51.960]  That starts right at the first of the show, five minutes in.
[3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:54.600]  Don't want to miss that starting right now at infowars.com.
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:57:01.440]  Akola Blue is just an incredible news sponsor and Akola Blue is an atmospheric water generator.
[3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:04.040]  These things are some of the hottest things in the nation.
[3:57:04.040 --> 3:57:07.440]  Atmospheric water generator for the home pays for itself in one year if you buy your water
[3:57:07.440 --> 3:57:08.440]  from the store.
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:12.320]  Pure clean water without the fluoride directly from the air, seven and a half gallons a day,
[3:57:12.320 --> 3:57:13.800]  about half that in the desert.
[3:57:13.800 --> 3:57:18.280]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way Mother Nature wants it, with a neutral pH, no chemicals,
[3:57:18.280 --> 3:57:19.280]  pollutants.
[3:57:19.280 --> 3:57:23.080]  It has five filters inside of it, and at first it takes it out of the air, which is pretty
[3:57:23.080 --> 3:57:24.080]  darn clean.
[3:57:24.080 --> 3:57:25.080]  Then it cleans it up in there.
[3:57:25.080 --> 3:57:34.200]  Give them a call or get a free brochure, 866-585-4044, amazing system, 1-866-585-4044, or AkolaBlue.com,
[3:57:34.200 --> 3:57:39.920]  big banner up on infowars.com, 866-585-4044, and then don't forget the best storeable
[3:57:39.920 --> 3:57:45.680]  foods company in the nation, eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group, big fat banners
[3:57:45.680 --> 3:57:50.600]  at the top of infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[3:57:50.600 --> 3:57:54.320]  With all the things that are happening in the world today, it is more important to ask
[3:57:54.320 --> 3:57:56.240]  for storeable food than ever, get it while you can.
[3:57:56.240 --> 3:58:07.360]  The prices are exploding, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, retransmission
[3:58:07.360 --> 3:58:10.120]  starts now, one place, infowars.com.
[3:58:10.120 --> 3:58:14.760]  Yes, another excellent transmission, I want to say bye to everybody, hold on one minute.
[3:58:14.760 --> 3:58:17.320]  John, I want to say great job there.
[3:58:17.320 --> 3:58:18.480]  Thank you, sir.
[3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:21.880]  And good job for Wersley, filling in for the hour.
[3:58:21.880 --> 3:58:22.880]  He did good.
[3:58:22.880 --> 3:58:23.880]  He did excellent.
[3:58:23.880 --> 3:58:24.880]  Good.
[3:58:24.880 --> 3:58:32.880]  I was forced to walk the plank and into a shark tank of J. C. Clayton's, but hey, listen,
[3:58:32.880 --> 3:58:41.840]  I really appreciate you and everything you're doing, and I will see you back live tomorrow,
[3:58:41.840 --> 3:58:42.840]  my friend.
[3:58:42.840 --> 3:58:43.840]  Damn right, we'll see you tomorrow.
[3:58:43.840 --> 3:58:44.840]  Same time.
[3:58:44.840 --> 3:58:45.840]  Well done.
[3:58:45.840 --> 3:58:46.840]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[3:58:46.840 --> 3:58:47.840]  Take care.
[3:58:47.840 --> 3:58:48.840]  Take care.
[3:58:48.840 --> 3:58:49.840]  Everybody else out there, exciting things are happening.
[3:58:49.840 --> 3:58:52.200]  I've never seen people waking up at the New World War like they are right now.
[3:58:52.200 --> 3:58:54.280]  A lot of bad stuff is happening too.
[3:58:54.280 --> 3:58:59.560]  But we can certainly use this right now against the New World Order and really expose these
[3:58:59.560 --> 3:59:01.520]  dirty bastards for who they are.
[3:59:01.520 --> 3:59:07.480]  As I said, we will be right back with the congressman, Burgress, who was on, dealing
[3:59:07.480 --> 3:59:10.440]  with martial law and a whole other group of things.
[3:59:10.440 --> 3:59:13.840]  And I'll tell you about some of the special guests that are coming up Wednesday.
[3:59:13.840 --> 3:59:19.400]  All of that right now as we go back into retransmission in about the next 30 seconds.
[3:59:19.400 --> 3:59:23.560]  In fact, you don't want to hear the ad, so I'll just keep talking for 30 seconds.
[3:59:23.560 --> 3:59:24.560]  I can't help it, folks.
[3:59:24.560 --> 3:59:28.600]  I'm so mission-oriented that when good things happen, I just get excited.
[3:59:28.600 --> 3:59:30.840]  It's like my team just won the Super Bowl.
[3:59:30.840 --> 3:59:35.960]  There's not a bunch of steroid-head, arrogant gang members, you know, like in sports.
[3:59:35.960 --> 3:59:38.080]  It's the American people just won a big victory.
[3:59:38.080 --> 3:59:40.640]  And I'm totally dedicated to this fight against the New World Order.
[3:59:40.640 --> 3:59:44.920]  We can beat them, we can expose them, but you have to take action.
[3:59:44.920 --> 3:59:47.520]  That's what causes it all to happen.
[3:59:47.520 --> 3:59:48.840]  And so it is up to you.
[3:59:48.840 --> 3:59:55.200]  All right, I figure now is a good time to go back into retransmission at infowars.com.
[3:59:55.200 --> 4:00:01.760]  We'll be back for everybody else in 22 hours from now, no, it's 20 hours from now, at infowars.com
[4:00:01.760 --> 4:00:02.920]  and on the MNFM dial.
[4:00:02.920 --> 4:00:05.080]  But for everybody else, God bless you all.
[4:00:05.080 --> 4:00:06.560]  Don't forget the new podcast.
[4:00:06.560 --> 4:00:10.440]  And we are about to have free archives going back two years of all the shows as well.
[4:00:10.440 --> 4:00:13.080]  Big Mouth now signs off with a big victory for liberty.
[4:00:13.080 --> 4:00:16.840]  Now they'll probably stage a depression and blame it all on us, but we'll expose the terrorist
[4:00:16.840 --> 4:00:18.320]  again in their financial terrorism.
[4:00:18.320 --> 4:00:19.480]  Goodbye and good luck.
