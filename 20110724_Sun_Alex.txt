[00:00.000 --> 00:01.500]  We've got it, Tata.
[00:01.500 --> 00:03.500]  The Earth Space is coming to you.
[00:07.200 --> 00:09.500]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.500]  Alright, you are a ghost.
[00:11.500 --> 00:13.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:13.500 --> 00:17.500]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.500]  Can we see the Earth?
[00:22.500 --> 00:23.500]  You've got it.
[00:25.500 --> 00:27.500]  Can we see the Earth now?
[00:27.500 --> 00:29.000]  You've got it.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Can we see the Earth?
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  We are live, my friends.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.500]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:38.500 --> 00:43.000]  It is Sunday, the 24th day of July 2011.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  I am going to attempt to be calm today
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  and look over every facet and angle
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  of the incredibly devastating attack in Oslo, Norway.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  I'm not talking about the seven dead.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  Of course, that's bad enough with the car bomb,
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  but the 93 dead and scores of others injured
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  in this nightmarish attack,
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  reportedly carried out by Anders Brevik or Bravik.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  I am hoping and praying right now that as bad as this is,
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  that this is a lone nut.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  Unfortunately, all the evidence points towards
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  it being a provocateur event in the mold
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  of countless other confirmed provocateur events
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  that we've seen.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  Doctor of History, also an economist, Webster Tarpley,
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  has published an article that's just gone up at Infowars.com
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  where he concurs in his own analysis with our research
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  that this is a false flag terror attack.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  We also have an eyewitness who was actually blown back
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  by the bomb going off.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  He'd have left 20 seconds earlier from work
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  walking down the street towards the car bomb.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  He would have been killed or seriously injured by it.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  He's going to be joining us.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  I'm sure I'm going to butcher this name,
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  but we talked to him some Friday.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  Doctor of History, George Jepistol, who lives and works
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  in Oslo and contacted us when we called him back
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  at his Oslo phone number Friday.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  And now he'll have a lot more for us on the developments
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  coming up in about 30 minutes from now.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  And then Doctor Webster Griffin Tarpley, of course,
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  We'll also interspers your phone calls later in the hour
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  and into the second hour when I open the phones up specifically
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  on this issue.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  Now, how do you sit here and explain to someone
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  how your gut knows that something's an inside job?
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  I mean, there's data that goes into that,
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  but it's thousands of pieces of data and research
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  and history and understanding and timing.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  How do you tell people about things
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  that most folks are not aware of
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  and that most people subconsciously find very frightening?
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  And you should.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  If megacorporations running governments
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  are staging terror attacks and framing patsies
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  and creating elaborate backstories
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  or provocaturing psychopaths,
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  as we know they've been caught doing in the past,
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  then we're in a lot of trouble.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  We're going to come back from break
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  and get into the body of this information
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  on this very important Sunday broadcast.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  Here's another example of people
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  not being able to deal with reality.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  Jaren came in here right before I went live
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  and said, here's a daily mail article.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  It's also in the BBC.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  In England, they've created 150,
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  or done 150 different studies
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  crossing humans and animals
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  right out of the island of Dr. Maroud.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  Now, I remember 15 years ago
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  this being in scientific publications.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  I remember 10 years ago
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  it being in the Washington Post
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  or nine years ago
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  that in Costa Rica
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  they actually have brought the human clones to term.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  They've got humanities down there,
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  a lot of other things,
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  and it was in the news
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  buried in that particular article.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  In England, they've gotten approval for this,
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  and so here it is, mainstream news.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  Now, just like a lot of you have been listening for 15 years,
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  I've been on 16+.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  You heard me talk about all this
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  and give people the news items at the time,
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  but just like false flag terror sounds crazy,
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  so does this headline,
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  150 human animal hybrids grown in UK labs,
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  embryos have been produced secretly
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  for the past three years,
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  try at least 15.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  See, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  It's 2011.
[04:54.000 --> 05:04.000]  Locke Rogers will be right back.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  While new socialist legislation
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  is only compounding the problem,
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  to local grids.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  from weather-related onages.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Number five, a solar power generator
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  provides powerful backup insurance
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  and peace of mind.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  one of my old sponsors.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  You can get more information at
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[05:59.000 --> 06:02.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  proudly presents The Alex Jones Show
[06:05.000 --> 06:25.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  We are live, my friends.
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  It is Sunday, the 24th day of July.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  2011, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  with the abbreviated Sunday Special Edition
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  special news coverage.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  Of course, I'm also live Monday through Friday,
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  11 a.m. until 2 p.m. weekdays,
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  but we always come in and engage in a special news
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  reportage every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  because other radio hosts rest on their laurels.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Again, a complete workaholic,
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  totally and completely obsessed with reality
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  and information and geopolitical developments
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  and science and technology.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  And so, if I was at home,
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  I would be working right now and researching,
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  so why not just come in on Sundays for two hours as well?
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  Obviously, we're going to be covering
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  the Anders Bravik story,
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  where we have three reportedly shot to death
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  on an island media slash government retreat
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  with a lot of young people and children at it
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  off the coast of Norway, close to Oslo.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  And, of course, that came just a few hours after the tragic
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  car bombing that ripped through government-building,
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  primarily the prime minister's office,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  as well on Friday.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Now, I want to calmly go through this news and information
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  and I want to ask radio listeners,
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  especially if you're a new listener,
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  to take notes on the things I say,
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  the news articles I mentioned,
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  and to go check out these claims for yourself
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  so that you'll understand why this Bravik situation,
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  or Bravik situation, is so incredibly dangerous.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  You will notice that on Thursday,
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  we had an article that, according to Alexa.com,
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  run by Amazon, the main web rating system.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  Google Analytics showed it as the fifth largest story
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  on the web.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  Alexa showed it as the sixth largest story
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.000]  in the world.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  On Thursday, and this, of course,
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  will integrate into the, quote,
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  right-wing attack in Norway and the government hyping
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  that more attacks are on the way.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  I'll get into that in a moment and I'll get into the evidence
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  that points towards false flag staged event.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  But first, I want to direct you to the article
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  that was the fifth or sixth biggest story in the world
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  on the web on Thursday into Friday.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  We've actually had articles rated as number one
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  on Google Analytics and Alexa before,
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  and we're routinely now in the top 10.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  Just want to point out this is a major news operation here,
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  and the world is watching and is listening
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  because of our track record of accuracy.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  Now, the mainstream media can be accurate as well
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  if they wanted to be.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  We told you three years ago that the depression would get worse,
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  not better with the bank or bailout,
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  because that was the plan of the big six megabanks.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  And of course, now they admit the recession never ended
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  and we're really in a depression.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  But the mainstream media told you things were getting better
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  and we're going to get better.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Just like they're saying, if you raise the debt ceiling,
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  things aren't going to get better.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Well, if we don't raise the debt ceiling,
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  it'll be a total catastrophe.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  And if we do raise it, it'll be a catastrophe.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  We've been maneuvered into this position.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  And we have a survivor of the Oslo bombing
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  who was blown back and was only about 200 feet from the blast.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  When it took place, joining us in about 23 minutes from now,
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  and we have Doctor of History and also economist Webster Tarpley
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  who's written a big report at infowars.com.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  We called Tarpley to get his take on it and he said,
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  well, see my report that's just been filed.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  It is a false flag attack and he goes through the evidence
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  of this being a staged event
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  and exactly how they provocateur these mentally ill types.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  We were reporting, of course, on Friday
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  from the Norwegian newspapers
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  that there were multiple shooters, as many as four.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  We were reporting that he is a Knights Templar,
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  high-level Mason, people laughed at us.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  That's now CNN Associated Press.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  This is a very serious, globalist event.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  His close friends say that he'd been disappearing
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  for a while, acting strangely.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  They believe, quote, he'd been brainwashed.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  Of course, it was declassified in 77
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  that the CIA can take any man, woman, or child
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  and turn them into an absolute complete mind control slave
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  in less than a year.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  And there have been many cases of this being confirmed
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  that this has been carried out.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  Both the shooter of Ronald Reagan and the shooter of John Lennon
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  on record it came out worked for the same U.S. government project
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  at CIA mind control bases, one in the Middle East,
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  one in Africa.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  I mean, you just can't make this stuff up.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  And, of course, the letter from Senator Strom Thurman
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  to the Republican leadership saying,
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  we've got to get rid of, we've got to take out John Lennon
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  has now been, of course, brought into evidence
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  and released four years ago and is in the film,
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  The People vs. John Lennon.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  And, obviously, the family has had their comments
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  about the fact that that was a government operation,
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  mind control program.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  Their statements are on record.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  Now, like I've talked to them or anything.
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  Okay.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  All right, my friends.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  Where to begin here?
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  Where to begin?
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  If you go to Thursday's show,
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  why was I mentioning that we had the number one news article
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  in the alternative media, the sixth or fifth most read
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  in online mainstream and alternative news, period?
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  Why am I raising that issue?
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  Because I did a three-hour radio show that Thursday
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  that streamed live on the web, aired on AM and FM affiliates,
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  was archived at prisonplanet.tv
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  and at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  And I interviewed several people in studio.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's on record.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  I was live.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  People are already there on my channel saying,
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.000]  well, I see this was uploaded on the night of Thursday.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  This must be fake.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  There's no way he could predict that this was going to happen.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  Well, I'm sorry for you.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  It's on record that I did that radio show Thursday
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  and wore the dark jacket and the green shirt.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  And it's on record.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  I had those guests in studio and it's on record
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  as they were in studio, as I went to my in-studio guest,
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  one of them, a national TV host.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  Forget his name.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  What's that comedian's name?
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  Hal Sparks.
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  Hal Sparks.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  That as I went to them, I said,
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  you watch.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  They're about to stage terror attacks in Europe,
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  the United States, and blame it on the right wing.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  The system is in the process of transferring the whole
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  police state that's been built in the name of fighting
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  the Arab, quote, Muslim, quote, menace that's been hyped up.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  That's going to be transferred over onto Christians,
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  conservatives, Ron Ball supporters,
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  returning veterans, gun owners, people that don't want
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  banker bailouts, people that don't want open borders.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  And of the three hour radio show,
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  I spent more than two hours of the show,
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  about two hours and 15 minutes.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  In fact, I made my guest sit here in studio while I finished
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  ranting and laying out that I could see the mainstream
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  corporate media preparing people's minds for this.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  In the dramas, the cop shows, the sitcoms,
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  the mainstream news articles, the homeland security videos,
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  where they say if you see a white person writing on a piece
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  of paper, talking on a cell phone, wearing a hoodie,
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  driving a white van, call the police.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  In the video, 10 minute video, that's in the article,
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  terrorists, Fox News, Daily Mail, Breitbart,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  they all covered our story and they concurred,
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  yes it clearly shows, out of dozens and dozens of terrorists,
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  all but two are white and it's all minorities,
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  black people, Asians, Hispanics, reporting on the white terrorist.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  And there's shots of blonde-haired women with blue eyes
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  with their eyes shining blue.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  It's all meant to brand that hey, the new Al Qaeda
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  is the American people.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  And there's two plus hours of video on my YouTube channel.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  The MP3 went out that day, it's time stamped on record.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  I said, prepare for imminent stage right wing attacks.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  I'm going to break down what this signifies on the other side
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  and play a clip from Thursday's show.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans,
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[16:55.000 --> 17:24.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  It exposes how the continuity of government program
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  to which our republic has fallen.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  The police state isn't coming, it's here.

[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner,
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  General Growth Properties.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  I can't stress this enough.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  He explains everything you need to know,
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[19:57.000 --> 20:25.000]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  All right, we're back live.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  Coming up in the next segment, we will take you to Oslo, Norway
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  to talk to a listener and a survivor who was in the bombing,
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  blown back by it.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  If he was 20 seconds earlier, he would have been hurt or killed.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  That gentleman will be joining us, Robert from Norway,
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  coming up in the next segment.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  Now I want to be clear.
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.000]  I wish that this was not a false flag or inside job.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  I wish the evidence wasn't pointing that direction.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  It is a lot more scary to know that it's mega corporations,
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  government networks, intelligence agencies,
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  that are clearly involved in so many of these attacks.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  And because our government and other governments
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  have been caught staging terror attacks before,
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  we have to look at them as suspects and see,
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  are there the standard signatures, the fingerprints,
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  the earmarks, and unfortunately, this has them all.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  There was a drill, a day and a half before,
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  a few hundred yards away from the government buildings
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  of multiple terrorist bombings.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  There were also the standard reports of other bombers
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  and other shooters now being confirmed.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  And reportedly, one arrest has been made,
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  quote, Norwegian Special Forces arrest a second man,
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  just like Oklahoma City.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  That was John Doe number two, caught on the surveillance tapes.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  The FBI has declared national security
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  and never released any of those 27 tapes.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  Though an FBI agent told the LA Times he saw it,
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  and it showed McVeigh with other men, including John Doe number two.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  Why aren't we supposed to talk about that?
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Well, I've interviewed multiple people
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  that worked in the Oklahoma City building,
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  like Jane Graham, the head of the department.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  On the ninth floor, she saw Tim McVeigh and others
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  planting large gray sticks of butter,
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  she didn't know what they were, and thought that they were
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  the telephone company.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  And she saw them there with, reportedly,
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  who she later saw in the news,
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  a member of German intelligence, Andrea Strasmeier,
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  and some other U.S. government agents.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  And again, this is all on record.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  And the building was blown out, not in.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  I have the newscast of them removing the unexploded bombs.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  The governor's saying we found the bombs,
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  the pillars in the back blown out,
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  further away from the rider truck,
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  then pillars that were right by the rider truck
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  weren't destroyed, blast points, shape-charge blast points,
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  the head of Air Force Weapons Development,
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  Benton Parton ran out there, General Parton,
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  and said, this is an inside job.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  You see, that was done when the American people
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  were rising up and saying no to Bill Clinton,
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  and he was about to lose the election.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  And so, boom, there was a bombing.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  His approval rating went up, and Bill Clinton told
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  USA Today and others, after he was reelected the next year,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  he said, I owe my reelection to Oklahoma City.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  In fact, I forgot.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  I got to dig up the Michael Savage clip where he said,
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  mark my words, the government's going to stage terror attacks
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  and blame right-wingers.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  I'm not the only one saying this.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  I could also pull up the clips of Obama advisors saying,
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  we need Stage 9-11 or Oklahoma City
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  to really get our agenda through.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  They got so clear with all this that even Glenn Beck
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  six months ago came out and said they're preparing
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  to stage attacks and blame people
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  that aren't for a new world order.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  In fact, if I don't have time to play those today
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  and have a guest coming up, I'll definitely play them
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  on the Monday show, the weekday show, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  But I think we're going to dig those up.
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  Let's dig up the Savage.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  I know it's in the computer.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  Savage talks about stage terror attacks or Reichstag.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Obama will stage Reichstag in the name of it.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  There's a bunch of them, but that's the really informative one.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a little while,
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  but I wanted to, before I get into all this,
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  the multiple shooters, the drill,
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  the police standing down for 90 minutes on the island,
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  even though it turns out there was a police station
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  a half mile away on the mainland,
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  which is right off the coast, a little retreat island,
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  all of this.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  But that's not the issue.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  It's that I saw them hyping
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  and the police training manuals being changed
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  to, okay, we're not worried about Muslim terrorists anymore.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  The new terrorists are conservatives
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  that don't want a new world order.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  And I heard it on Fox News today on the radio driving in.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  I heard local radio talking about it.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  I saw it on CNN this morning, and it's all over the news.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  No fly list for conservatives.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  Oh, have you given to a group against open borders?
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  Oh, you may not be able to fly.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  You may be on the no gun by list.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  Obama's talking about putting in place
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  with an executive order outside of law.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  See, the whole apparatus behind the scenes
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  has already been shifted onto people
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  that don't want a new world order,
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  people that want a constitution, a bill of rights.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  Same thing in Europe.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  And I've told you it's going to be attacks in Europe first.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  I know how to call this stuff,
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  because the banks are imploding them right now
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  and they want to politically divert folks.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  Now, this is a clip, and there's over two hours of this.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  This is just one that listeners pulled
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  and pointed out that I saw online where I predicted it.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  Info wars predicted Norway terror attacks day before.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  And if you actually go into the last few months of shows,
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  I particularly said, and I hope listeners will go find it for us,
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  I said they're going to start in Europe,
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  move to England and move to the U.S.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  because that's the scripting timeline.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  Now, we'll go to Brighton, come back and finish the rest of this
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  and go to our guest.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  But here I am laying out how this started in Nazi Germany,
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  how they first target an unpopular group
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  and then move on to the general public.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  Here I am Thursday, less than 24 hours before this happened,
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  saying they're going to rebrand terrorists from Muslims
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  to conservatives. Here it is.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  What did Hitler do?
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  First, he goes after unpopular groups in Germany,
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.000]  Jews, Gypsies, Communists,
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  and he takes their rights away in law,
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  and people get behind it, yeah, get them.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  Then he's swungin' around against Christians,
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  against Protestants, against Seventh-day Adventists,
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  you name it, against his competition in business,
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  even fellow Nazis.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  They would rob their companies and send them off to a death camp.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  This is what they did.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  A lot of the French that helped the Nazis take over France,
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  they got turned against.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  A lot of the Vichy did.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  So that's how this works.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  You first set something up with an unpopular group,
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  and whether it's a good thing to make Muslims and Arabs unpopular
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  or not, and obviously it's discrimination
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  and stereotypical and wrong,
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  it was acceptable to say these people are devils,
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  nukem, to call them horrible,
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  pejoratives, camel bleepers,
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  ragged bleepers, sand inwards.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  That's all cute and funny on talk radio.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  Well, I don't think it is.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  Because even if you think Muslims are evil and bad
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  and want to get you, at the end of the day,
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  this was being beta-tested on them
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  to then be used against everybody else.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  And I told you from the FBI,
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  federal marshals, state police in California, Missouri,
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  state police in Florida, Texas,
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  federal marshals sending me slat training,
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  the videos, we've shown them here,
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  we've done special reports on it,
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  where they say who are the number one terrorists, gun owners,
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  returning veterans, libertarians in the fetters,
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  John Paul supporters. I mean, I have the training manuals here.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  The Homeland Security, the MYAC reports.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  Remember this being national news two years ago?
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  Remember all this?
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  Now, I told you, they've taken over the Middle East,
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  they've invaded all the countries,
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  they are now flipping over to work with al-Qaeda
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  to overthrow Qaddafi,
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow Mubarak,
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  they're now shifting to a new phase.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  They're going to keep the Muslim demonization going,
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  but it's now a dish that's cooked.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  They're going to keep the back burner to keep it warm.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  They've killed bin Laden in their staged event.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  They're now moving on to the next phase to,
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  okay, we don't have a bill of rights,
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  we spy on you, you have no rights,
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  we can secretly arrest citizens
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  out of the John Warren Defense Authorization Act,
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  Enemy Commissions Act,
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  we can fly into places to be tortured.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  We're going to come back and finish the last two minutes
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  of this little clip,
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  then we're going to go to an eyewitness and survivor
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  of the car bomb in Oslo.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  And then I'm going to get into all this weird
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  night's Templar stuff, him dressed up,
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  he'll mason outfits,
[28:55.000 --> 29:21.000]  and this is got Neural Order written all over it.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  And now, new socialist legislation
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  is only compounding the problem.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  to local grids.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  from weather-related onages.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  You can get more information at
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  mysolarbackup.com.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[29:57.000 --> 30:01.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  to tyranny in the last century alone.
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  This is our last chance
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  to not relive history.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  Americans at home.
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  I have tremendous influence
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  on Congress, and they really
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  are calling the shots.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  For the Republic identifies
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  the enemies of our nation,
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  the criminal offshore cartel
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  and on its ashes, constructing world government.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  They're asking for more matches,
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  and the Congress is saying,
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  who do we make the check out to?
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  As we see, we have seen
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  a fall of the Republic.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  on DVD at infowars.com.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  We're watching online right now
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  in super high quality at
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  prismplanet.tv.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones,
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[31:05.000 --> 31:07.000]  Now you can produce pure
[31:07.000 --> 31:09.000]  and endless colloidal silver
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  by breathing the solution
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  through the lungs.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  infuses the respiratory system
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  and also delivers
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  the silver nanoparticles
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  instantly into the bloodstream
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  of nano-silver products.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  You can now produce pure
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  and endless colloidal silver
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  Our follow-step-by-step instructions are provided,
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  making production fast and simple.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[31:53.000 --> 32:13.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[32:23.000 --> 32:33.000]  www.silverlungs.com
[32:53.000 --> 33:17.000]  www.silverlungs.com
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  We are live
[33:19.000 --> 33:23.000]  in-depth coverage and analysis of the kickoff
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  of White Al Qaeda,
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  the demonization of Christians, conservatives,
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  libertarians,
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  returning veterans.
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  Going back more than a decade,
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  we've gotten secret government training manuals.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  We've published them. They've made national news
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  many times. You remember the Homeland Security
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  and Mayak reports we got
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  now more than two years ago from law enforcement
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  saying the number one threat
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  is gun owners, Christian conservatives,
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  returning veterans.
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  And the Justice Department
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  defended those manuals.
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  They're teaching every police department
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  in Europe, the United States,
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  Canada, New Zealand, Australia
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  that the police will face
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  disgruntled veterans that will attack them.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  I've shown you the New York Times.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  In fact, people will never believe this.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  We'll have to pull it up later.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  We've got a limited crew today, skeleton crew.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Where the New York Times showed
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  two years ago,
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  they were scouts, quote,
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  training to take on disgruntled Iraq
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  war vets and kill them
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  with high-deaf photos
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  of the mock-killing U.S. military.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  You cannot make this up.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  So behind the scenes, it's always been
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  about enemies of the Central Banking Cartel
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  fully taking us over
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  in Europe over.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  The prime minister
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  of Norway also attended
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  Bilderberg Group this year.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  You have the fact that their party
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  can only serve two terms
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  and was set to leave, but the conservatives
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  were set to gain seats.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  So this will now, of course, demonize them.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  We're going to be talking to a gentleman
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  who lives and works, 29-year-old
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  gentleman, Robert Jepestul
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  who was walking
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  into the blast and was knocked back
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  from it only a couple hundred feet away
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  and narrowly survived.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  Gave us a lot of intel that turned out
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  to be true on Friday, that there were drills
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  days before of bombings in the area.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  That's now confirmed.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  Reports of multiple shooters on the island.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  That's now confirmed. CNN Associated Press.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  All of these are the
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  airmarks of an operation.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  Friends of the shooter
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  Anders Gravik
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  report that this isn't how he was acting
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  just a few years ago and quote,
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  we believe he must have been brainwashed.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  I have clips of those international news pieces
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  in English where the Norwegians
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  are talking about it.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  There's a lot of information.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  Immigray is talking about knowing him
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  and not really believing this.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  If you study these
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  false flags, they've had a lot of them
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  where you'll have multiple shooters.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  A lot of times, someone believes they're part of a drill.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  After the event happens,
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  they're basically drugged up, put on trial,
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  never seen again.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  Operation Northwoods, which is declassified
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  ten years ago, describes how the
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Pentagon would stage mass shootings
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  across America as a pretext
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  of the United States and even how to frame
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  patsies.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  People need to grow up and realize
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  that this was coming at perfect timing.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  How was I able to put an article
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  out predicting all of this
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  and to cover this for over two hours on my
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  three-hour show the day before this
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  happened on Thursday? We're about to finish
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  that clip and then go to our guest,
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  the survivor and eyewitness of the bombing.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  I was able to do this because of the hype.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  They think you're dumb.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  Propaganda is targeted at the lowest
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  level.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  I saw this behind the scenes branding
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  of anybody that criticizes government
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  as a terrorist and then I saw them
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  beginning to roll it out.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  They only roll it out
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  when they're getting ready to do it.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  I saw it in Europe, I saw it in England,
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  I saw it in the U.S.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Now they're claiming that
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  Bravik was
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  working with Americans, Brits and others.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  Conservatives need to be on no fly list,
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  no gun by list.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  Homeland Security, Interpol system
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  needs to be used. Oh my gosh.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  The White Al-Qaeda is coming.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Notice all these TV ads about White Al-Qaeda
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  come out last week. Same thing in Europe
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  and now this happens. They're flipping
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  from the Muslim threat
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  to the White Al-Qaeda threat.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  Let's finish up that clip and we'll go to our guest
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  holding from
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Norway. And again, there's over two hours
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  of this. This is just one clip.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  We had time to fair it out. It went on for hours
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  where I lay out every scenario
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  and I tell you it is imminent
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  to be blamed on the right wing
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  and a total flipping because I could see
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  the preconditioning and the public
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  rollout. How do you know when Coke's
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  coming out with a new flavor? They run a bunch of ads
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  telling you it's coming. This stuff is all done
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  like an ad campaign.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  Just like I knew that Perry was going to run
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  for president when he went to Bilderberg
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  and then I have inside sources and I told you
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  he'd break his pledge and he's going to announce
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  coming up in a week and a half. I told you folks
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  because I know how to watch these
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  people. Once you understand it, you'll never
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  believe that you didn't understand it before.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip and then to our guest
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  from Norway. They really execute you.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  Obama's continuing it.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Now the next phase, they've already been
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  beta testing. Behind closed doors
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  with the police and military. Now they're moving
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  it to white al-Qaeda.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  And in this video
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  they cut to, and every one of them were mentally
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  ill-pats. He's just been confirmed, even mainstream
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  news admits, Jihad J and others, blue
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  eyes animating the blue eyes
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  in the video to glow.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  Look, blue, blue, they're al-Qaeda.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  And it shows at the beginning
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  of this Homeland Security 9-minute video
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  a shot of family
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  of
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  of
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  thinking about all that's good
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  in America. Nostalgia
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  on top of the piano
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  and 90-plus percent of the photos
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  of the American family, it's Hispanics,
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  it's Asians, it's black people.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  You see it instantly and there's one white guy
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  that he's blurred in the background.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  So it's like, this is America.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  We are many people.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  And then it cuts to a black guy.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  He's professional, he's good in his suit.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  He's no longer being the stereotypically
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  put down by the same media, same government
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  as a gang manor. He's going out
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  in the parking garage and he sees evil white guys
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  getting ready to blow up the building
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  and he calls it in on him.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  And then the good white guys,
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  the only good white guys in the whole thing,
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  FBI show up
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  and they stop the
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  the white al-Qaeda that's just everywhere.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  They're creating this false perception ahead of
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  the private contractors that run the government
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  staging more terror
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  to take over society even more. So you won't be mad
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  about going into austerity
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  or having your social security taken
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  or everything imploding and all the money going to the
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  offshore banks. Folks,
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  I'm not just saying this for theatrics.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  The bankers have
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  gang-righted us financially. They're imploding the
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  country by design and they've set up
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  an architecture of police state
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  against the American people built around terror.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  And they have
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  to provide that terror
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  as Governor Ridge admitted
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  to get you to politically rally
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  around them. So they're getting
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  ready, okay?
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  They're getting ready to stage terror attacks
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  and blame it on the American people.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  We are the terrorists, okay? I mean
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  in all the internal manuals
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  it is the veterans, the gun owners
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  and it's the veterans of the gun owners going
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  to the suburbs, take their rights away
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  not knowing the whole
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  things always been for them.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  And then I see these conservatives go, well, it's Obama
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  doing this now. No.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Obama Bush, they read off teleprompters.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  They don't run Jack. This is a long-term
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  strategic Pentagon
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  ran corporation, full-spectrum
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  dominance takeover. This is absolute
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  criminal takeover.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  I mean, realize that, but
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  I digress. White al-Qaeda, white al-Qaeda,
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  blue-eyed women, they're going to get you.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  White, white, white, white, white, white.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  And it goes on and on and on and on
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  and on.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Wake up, folks.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  There you go.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  And that's the little vanity
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  card that the YouTuber
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  got when they took those clips out.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  And if you go back to weeks ago, I wanted
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  to do even more detail. I said they're going to have
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  soft targets hit in Europe,
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  school, shot up, parks.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  They love to kill children. That's what
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  the Pentagon did with Operation Gladio
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  now declassified. Their favorite thing
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  was the blow-up school buses. Now, we're going to
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  break here in a moment, but I want to introduce
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  you to Robert
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  Jepistul,
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  and he lives and works in Oslo. He's 29
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  years old, studied political science, history
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  and economics in Norwegian universities and
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  also spent some time at the University of York
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  in England. He now works, again,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  in a local bank and small businesses
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  in Oslo and
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  with a plan for starting a Norwegian equivalent
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  of the American company TTC
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  to help educate people, and he narrowly
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  survived. He was walking towards
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  the bomb when it went off
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  and he was blown back by it, and
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  he joins us from Oslo, Norway.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  We're glad he survived. We're going to break
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  in a moment, sir, but we're going to come back
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  and give you the floor, but just in the minute
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  we have, what is your view now
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  48 hours later? You thought this
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  was false flag on Friday.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  What do you think it is now?
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  Well, first of all, thank you
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  for helping Alice. It's
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  the same point of view.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  I mean, exactly
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  as we talked about
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  on Friday,
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  even more accurate now
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  things that
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  come up.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  It seems to just
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  cement
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  that it was a stage
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  event. All right,
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  stay there. You survived the blast.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  We're going to come back to you
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  because, you know, then we were saying, look at
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  what's going on Muslims.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  And as I was saying Friday, I'm not
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  so sure, folks. This is the White Al Qaeda
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  and now that's confirmed
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  exactly as I've been screaming
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  for several months every day,
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  warning everyone because of the pretty conditioning.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Robert
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Jepp Astool is our guest.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  He'll be joining us after the break from Norway.
[42:59.000 --> 43:09.000]  He's a survivor.

[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  spot savings, opportunity
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  and recognized risk. Saving means
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  to make money. The Calben Pure Soap Company

[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  This documentary exposes
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  how the continuity of government program
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  Police State 4 chronicles

[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  staged terror and cameras on every
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  street corner. It's only the beginning
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Talk to him every day.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  Alright, we're back live.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  Dr. Webster Tarpley coming up.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  He's saying false flag clearly
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  written to detailed treatise
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  up at infowars.com. Doctor of history
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  and of course economics.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  We're going to be talking
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  about Dr. Tarpley coming up.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  And we'll open the phones up later in the next hour.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  But I want to remind you
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  this has the drill
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  two days before, day and a half
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  before. It has the multiple
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  shooters now confirmed.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  We were left dead on Friday
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  talking about that with our witness
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  accounts.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  You've got him with these professional
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  publicity photos, clearly
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  professionally taken by a very professional
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  photographer. You've got this
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  300 page treatise.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  You've got this professionally made video.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  And what this is meant to do
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  is invoke a clash of civilizations.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  Christians
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  against Muslims, while the globalist
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  who are
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  atheistic humanist
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  manipulate us. And that's what Albert Pike wrote about
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  in
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  1877.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  And exactly what we've been predicting.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  So at the end of the day
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  this plays the groups off against each other.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  But at the same time then the government
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  can play the part of the referee, the arbiter
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  and go after both groups
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  and say both groups are bad. So they play
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  the Christians and Muslims off against each other.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  That's the great divide and conquer
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  clash of civilizations,
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  PNAC, Dick Cheney plan,
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  Israeli plan. By the way, and we're going to
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  our guest. This was the
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  anniversary of the King David
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Hotel bombing. It was an attack carried out.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  This is from the encyclopedia
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  by the militant right wing Zionist underground
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  organization Ergun.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  The head of Ergun is
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  the dad of the former White House
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Chief of Staff, Obama Emmanuel, not Chicago
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  Mayor. On the King David Hotel in
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Jerusalem, July 22nd
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  1946, 91 people
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  of various nationalities were killed and 46
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  injured. And they carried out
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  the King David Hotel and tried to blame it on Arabs
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  at first. It's an admitted false flag. You might want
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  to run into it and just check
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  it out. Okay, I'll shut up now. Let's go to
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  Robert Jepestul,
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  a survivor of the bombing.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  You've got the floor, sir. Briefly tell
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  recap what happened to you and then get
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  into the different anomalies
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  and things that have come up. You told us
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  on Friday that there had been a drill
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  days before and that now has been confirmed.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  So tell us more of what's going on.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  Yeah, well
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  first, what happened
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  was that I
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  felt the blast.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  I went
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  towards my office. The bomb exploded.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  I was going a bit back with windows
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  crushing all around and
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  you know, you could see
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  the mushroom cloud
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  going up in front of the
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  government building.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  So
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  you know
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  you certainly get
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  shocked at first
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  but I
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  remember one of my first thoughts
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  after the bomb was this is how
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  our future freedoms
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  were lost.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  I knew what it was because I've been listening
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  to you and the clip you just played
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  I heard it live
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  and I was
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  not surprised.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  So you're saying you were listening to me on
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  Thursday when I said they're
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  going to attack soft targets and blaming
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  on right wing whites.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  You've
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  been talking about white al-Qaeda
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  for a long time and I've also
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  seen it coming.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I just had a castle civilization.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  What about him wearing
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  all this Knights Templar regalia
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  and it turns out he's not even a Christian
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  and then he's got all these
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  handlers and people and other shooters.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  What are folks saying in Norway?
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  You said a lot of your friends you talked to at work
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  they weren't buying it. Are they buying it now?
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  I guess
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  there's just
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  crushing information
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  that they come with
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  so many
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  different experts
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  and analysis.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  So I just
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  get confused.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  I totally see that because
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  nobody knows what to believe.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  What about the police not responding
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  to the shooting
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  for 90 minutes?
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  Now
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  they have on several TV shows
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  tonight. They have gone back
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  and we
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  read the phone log again
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  and we used one hour
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  and one minute
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  but I remember clearly
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  they were reporting shootings on TV
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  90 minutes
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  before.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  Who do you think, just in your gut from looking at this
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  who stands to gain?
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  Norway announced that they were going to pull out of Libya
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  endorse the Palestinian state
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  two days before
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  this island that got attacked
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  did have a group of
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  Palestinians at it in a meeting
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  the day before.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  How did this guy know where the prime minister was going to be?
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  He was reportedly going to the island.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  Your take on that?
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  Yeah, well
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  you know
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  what hasn't been reported
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  I've read your articles
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  Webster Tarpuz article
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  very good. Two hours
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  before the happening
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  on the island
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  is our former prime minister
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  Puhallam Brindam
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  she's also
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  a former leader of the WHO
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  for several years
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  she had a speech on the island
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  and our
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  president PM
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  he has for a long time been a great career in the UN
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  our
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  former PM is now
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  the general secretary
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  of
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  the Parliament in the EU
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  I mean
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  I don't see how
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  they could just
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  attack us and they not know
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  I know the coincidence with them being
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  you know away
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  Look, we know the Russians
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  the Chinese, the US, they've all
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  had attempted coup d'etats
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  where they always grab a patsy
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  and claim it was a lone nut. We know with Kennedy
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  it wasn't just one shooter
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  and 92% of Americans
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  know that the official stories a lie
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  so this fits into that
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  but this have been an attempted coup
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  against the prime minister
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  and now they've just thrown this nut into the mix
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  and have given us this official narrative
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  I mean after all, western governments
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  have been caught issuing fake al-Qaeda videos
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  fake bin Laden videos
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  fake WMD documents
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  so they're not above manufacturing out of
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  whole cloth
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  I mean this is a big deal
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  I mean bottom line, I feel it in my gut
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I see it intellectually
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  that this is the kickoff of something big
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  I'm not sure exactly what
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  other than the introduction of
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  it isn't just al-Qaeda now
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  no one can be trusted, you can only trust the government
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  Yeah, this is the card of playing
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  also, I mean
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  there's so many things involved
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  in this bombing
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  I mean from what I gather
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  what's happening was brilliant
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  in order to shut down free speech
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  censor and police, the web trample
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  and restrict people wanting to
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  control their own food or even questioning
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  the political status quo
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  in fact, yesterday
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  I heard a broadcast on the radio
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  he had a guest on
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I guess somebody
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  hired up and he said something like
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  we like the police patrolling
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  our streets to keep us safe
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  why shouldn't they be patrolling the web
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  so they're just
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  they're using it
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  for...
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  Well I'm glad you mentioned that
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  in the Fox News
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  on 590am
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  and also watching TV this morning
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  and it was, oh my gosh, the national intelligence
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  assessment said radicals are using the web to recruit
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  there's radicalism on the web
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  against the New World Order
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  and the big banks
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  and this is going to cause violence
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  we need to shut down this evil speech
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  because people's speech against the New World Order
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  who do you think they're talking about
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  haven't even gotten into the National Post magazine
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  big paper of
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Canada coming out and attacking yours truly
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  yesterday for dare questioning
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  the official story
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  yes, absolutely
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  it's the free speech
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Robert that's causing all this
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  but you know, I also
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  want to give you some
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  background because with this incident
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  the government and already
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  I think dangerous leaders
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  have effectively torn down
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  today's political environment
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  and have done free trade
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  in the New World without comparison
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  for a long time, Norway has been
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  testing ground for many of things
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  you talk about, I mean
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  almost every week
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  or every fortnight
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  we have
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  news mirroring subjects
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  local subjects from Texas
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  or anywhere else
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  I mean, it's the same thing
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  well, there's so many facets
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  that I've dropped the ball on
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  and that's why it's so frustrating to communicate
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  with these extremely complex issues
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  and just sound bites, but you brought up
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  what I've just seen in literally
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  more than 10,000 news articles
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  on Google, if you type in right wing
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  there's more than 10,000 articles demonizing
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  anybody who's
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  conservative, Christian, libertarian
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  anti-Muslim
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  and I'm not defending folks that hate Muslims
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  out of hand, but that's their free speech
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  right, I mean
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  it is just a full court press
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  we've got to watch and attack
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  after anybody
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  that doesn't like world government
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  that doesn't like open borders
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  who doesn't like gun control
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  notice he's a guy who legally
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  had a gun, which is very hard to have in Norway
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  he was an organic farmer
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  so he could get the fertilizer
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  I mean, this whole thing
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  is so scripted down
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  to the glamor shots
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  of him in bizarre Illuminati
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  Regalia, that's their little sickening
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  calling card they want
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  to get rid of civilizations
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  between Muslims and Christians at one level
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  and then the government will be the referee
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  attacking both groups
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  when they are the real terrorists, we'll be back
[57:45.000 --> 58:13.000]  in a minute

[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  from his Central Texas Command Center
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  deep behind enemy lines
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  the information war continues
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  and the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Robert Jepa Stool is our guest
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  he'll be riding shotgun with us for one segment
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  with Webster Ribbon Tartley
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  coming up looking at this false flag event
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  and what it signifies
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  undoubtedly
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  this was either staged
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  or the government has a crystal ball
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  because they have been telling police
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  the terror attacks are coming
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  it's going to happen
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  and in every case we research these events
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  and they're provocateur
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  or completely staged
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  right wing Muslim it doesn't matter
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  in this case just reeks
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  of staged
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  with the treatise and the guy all dressed up
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  all of it
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  every stereotype he goes after
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  designed to demonize people
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  that don't like world government
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  and don't like losing their national sovereignty
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  and their cultures
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  now Robert a survivor
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  of the attacks
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  narrowly survived the bombing
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  we're very glad this listener did survive
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  and we're very sad for the others
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  a short segment left here
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  but other points you'd like to make
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  well
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  how do you
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  have anything about the manifesto
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  because the media
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  have reported on a
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  1500 page manifesto
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  called the 2083
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  describing
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  ideology and referring to
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  and quoting philosophers
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  who refers to himself as a Templar
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  starting a crusade against Muslims in Europe
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  he describes
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  small things like what to wear
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  the needed equipment to do
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  to organize
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  a terror event
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  and he says the world population
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  needs to be reduced to 2.5 billion
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  within the year 2083
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Ted Kastinsky
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  the Unabomber is also copied
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  in his text
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  only a few paragraphs are changed
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  I guess it was leftist
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  or changed with
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  modern Marxists
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  or something like that
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  the manifesto
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  is written
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  in good English language
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  and they say it was published
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  from London
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  I find it strange
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  considering how he's reportedly
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  uneducated
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  I mean
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  later analysis
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  said that the whole thing is a copy
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  and paste document
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  except the last part where
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  that's sort of a diary
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  of his progress and work
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  the last nine years
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  towards
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  this event
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  you know
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  it seems like
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  a script to
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  make a role
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  you've got the script
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  you've got the glamour photos
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  you've got it all tailored
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  the classic MO of a mind controlled
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Patsy who's only part
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  of the event
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  you've got all the witnesses saying
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  full shooters, not just one
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  but now they're talking about two, three
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  maybe even four
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  other men
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  dressed as policemen at the bombing
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  all of this starting to come out
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  and you see the clash of civilizations
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  the globalists want to play Christians and Muslims
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Westerners and the East off against each other
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  while the government opens
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  the borders up
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  to allow the clash to happen
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  then it plays the part of the arbiter
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  but just like the West created Al Qaeda
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  this manifesto
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  will now generate real copycats
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  who will take up
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  the crusade or jihad
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  and so the government
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  and the social engineers won't even have to
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  provocateur some of this
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  it will create a whole new movement
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  by the attention it's getting
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  do you see the genius of the globalists
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  how they set things in motion
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  yeah I mean
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  it follows the perfect script
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  there's
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  a few things diluting
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  nothing original
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  they're following
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  what's been done before
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  and taking
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  what was successful
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  and just making this event
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  as it was
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  scripted as a movie
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  if it ain't broke don't fix it
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  but there's a weakness in that stratagem
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  those of us that study these people
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  see them do the exact same thing
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  the drills
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  are being run
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  in the days before
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  the multiple gunmen
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  or attackers
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  the prescripting running up to it
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  the media hype
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  will be right back with the survivor
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  of the Oslo bombing
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  and the globalist terror attack
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  with Dr. Webstergryff
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  straight ahead stay with us
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  you should consider buying a solar powered generator
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  number 1
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  our new energy czar
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  wants to control how much power
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  your electric company allows you to have
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  it's true total government control
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  technology is coming
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  number 3 in some areas of the country
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  and now new socialist legislation
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  is only compounding the problem
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  number 4 dangerous weather
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  is always a threat to local grids
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  from weather related onages
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  a solar powered generator
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  provides powerful backup insurance
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  and peace of mind
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  folks i really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from science
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  one of my old sponsors
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  you can get more information at
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  remember the government doesn't own the sun
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  1-877-327-0365
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  this is a big deal
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  i could analyze the media
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  and predict massive
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  stage terror attacks starting in europe
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  moving into the united states of north america
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  off of mainstream media
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  pre-programming in the last
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  6 months or so and i've been saying
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  they're going to stage these events
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  the day before i said the attack
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  is imminent within days or weeks
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  we played that clip earlier
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  so the day before i was able
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  to look at the pre-programming
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  and how they get all their people
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  lined up ahead of time because
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  the government's compartmentalized
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  media's compartmentalized
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  99% of people in government
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  are not involved in these criminal activities
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  but when you get into black ops
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  cia you name it they are
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  that's why Dr. Steve Pacenek
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  who wrote the book for the cia on black ops
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  former deputy
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  head of the state department
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  will be joining us tomorrow
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Dr. Webster griffin tarpley
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  is waiting in the wings right now
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  he'll be with us for at least
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  two segments will also take calls
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  in the last two segments the phones are now open
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  on this live sunday
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  transmission 877789
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  alex 877789
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  2539
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  if you'd like to join us
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  that's a different number than the weekday number
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  because we run this sunday show completely out of my studio
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  877789
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  alex
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  on government sponsored terror
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  and did i call it or did i not call it
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  and if you disagree with me
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  you think this guy acted alone great
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  the witnesses all say multiple
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  shooters the witnesses say
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  drills now confirmed
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  all the same airmarks
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  of a staged event the
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  glamour shots of him and his regalia
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  the fact they're trying to launch a clash
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  of civilizations that the
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  pentagon others have wanted between christians
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  and muslims so the government
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  can play the part of the arbiter
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  the referee all of this
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  is
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  incredibly transparent
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  when you're awake and aware if you're halfway
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  paying attention well then it's a different
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  story and there's a lot of big
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  national media coverage
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  fox news bright bar
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  the daily mail they're all reporting on our
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  reportage of this
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  and our prediction thursday
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  that they were going to roll out that white al-qaeda
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  is now the threat white christian
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  terrorist gun owners libertarians
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  military
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  a former military
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  and so folks are giving us our do
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  right now and our stories are being carried
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  folks are really realizing how serious
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  this is that the
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  global oligarchs are getting ready to use
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  the police state that they sold
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  in the name of going after muslims
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  which was more politically popular
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  is now going to be flipped on
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  the very people that don't want world government
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  but here's the national post the big paper of
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  canada already
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  the norway conspiracy theories have begun
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  well that didn't take long
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  less than 24 hours up for norway killings
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  alex jones massively
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  surfed info war site they got something
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  right already is fronting
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  with the theory that the tragedy
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  was all part of a conspiracy
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  by european elites to deflect populace
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  discussed and bailouts yes
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  by friday afternoon curtain memo did
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  write and he does quote in the paper
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  three big paragraphs for article
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  that this would be meant to energize a
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  clash of civilizations christendom
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  against islam
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  and be used as a pretext
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  comparing to the mcvee
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  attacks which they now have
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  done
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  we're conspiracy theorists because we had total
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  precision and that we're
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  questioning an elite who's been caught
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  lying 99% of
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  the time and staging all sorts of terror attacks
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  and fake wmds
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  so i wanted to have
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  doctor webster griffin tarpley
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  have any questions or comments that will come
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  back with just doctor tarpley
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  for our guest
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  robert
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  jeppestool
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  who was
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  walking towards
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  the blast when it happened
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  he's in norway was blown back by it
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  in day one he said a lot of
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  folks in norway do not think the official
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  story is true he told us about
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  the drills before it was even in the news
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  doctor tarpley
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  any questions for our guest
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  before we let him go
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  the two things that i think
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  would be interesting to know more about
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  how about the explosions that went off
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  in oxlo
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  on wednesday, tuesday to wednesday
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  according to what i'm reading in the
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  often post and that would be one
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  did you hear any of that? no no there were drills
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  we've been reporting on that since friday
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  there were actual explosions that people heard
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  no no we have video of it
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  on infowords.com
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  people found out according to what i've read at least
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  people found out about the
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  the drills through the explosions
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  did you hear any of those? secondly
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  what's the story
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  what did the norwegian
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  media say about the second shooter on the island
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  because this is the other big thing
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  well firstly
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  the
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  i did not hear about the
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  incident on wednesday
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  i don't know what this is
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  but i'm not surprised but i don't know
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  where that comes from
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  often post
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  tarply
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  we have articles on info wars
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  we had it friday
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  no no
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  we have the explosions coming out of the building
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  with men in black uniforms repelling down
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  yes that did happen i can confirm
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  what do people know over there
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  what's the word on the street
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  as i said i don't know
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  of this incident i wouldn't be surprised
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  i don't read often post
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  it's
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  a big newspaper but i don't read it
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  none of the other big newspapers
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  reported on it
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  let me just answer the question since tarply asked it
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  you're not aware
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  a cnn is now reporting
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  that they are looking at a second shooter
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  and quote cnn
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  nrt are reporting
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  norwegian special forces today
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  rated and arrested
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  who they believe may be an
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  accomplice and a second
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  shooter and yes there were drills
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  two days before and the day before
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  and we have video webster of the men
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  in black uniforms repelling down
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  in the same area of the city blowing
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  the windows out with explosions
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  in the drill so webster what does that mean
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  to you well as soon as
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  you have two people that's a conspiracy
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  under anybody's definition
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  so people who are
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  upset about conspiracy i'm afraid we'll have to
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  go to the showers at that point
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  and of course the
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  really big thing is the drill
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  you can easily imagine
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  since we know that there was a very
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  ambitious us
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  program this cmas
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  s i m a s
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  to penetrate to recruit
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  a network basically of intelligence assets
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  among retired policemen
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  of norway you could easily imagine
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  the bootlegging
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  of a real bomb in among
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  the practice bombs although those were also
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  real up to a point
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  you could bootleg in the
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  real bomb with the practice bombs
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  get that through the security screens
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  and get that very close to the
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  prime minister's office
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  let me just ask your
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  contact there in norway we understand
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  that the explosions went off
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  near the opera house what is
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  the distance from the opera house to the
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  prime minister's office
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  well it is not very far
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  i would guess less than
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  a kilometer
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  less than a mile
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  say six seven hundred meters
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  i would guess
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  let me elaborate on what happened today
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  because six men were
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  arrested after tips
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  from the interrogation so
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  a third apartment
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  he said to have used
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  then soon after
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  they said the six men were released and checked out
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  immediately nothing else was mentioned
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  about this just that the police had
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  an armed raid
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  of a third building
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  that he allegedly
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  had been using
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  also he bought six tons
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  of this
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  fertilizer they
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  say the bomb was
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  maybe six seven hundred kilos
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  and they only found
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  three tons at
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  his barn
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  or farm so
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  you know
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  things are still going on
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  well it's like Michigan said
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  you can't have gardens at your house
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  and this proves that you could be a terrorist
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  if you have a garden i mean you could see
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  the scripting evil organic farmer
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  nationalists didn't like open borders
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  incredible well i want
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  to thank you Robert for joining us
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  and hopefully you can check back in with us

[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  come back with Webster and get into the
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  technicals of why he says this points
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  towards a false flag and who would be behind
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  it key bono who stands to gain
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  anything else you'd like to add Robert
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  from Oslo Norway
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  well there's the last comment
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  to my fellow Norwegians and others
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  in Scandinavia i would
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  ask your bird you to read
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  writings by Per Osloch
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  after work he has written books like
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  echoes of the future the power behind
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  the power latest
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  sleep my little Norway
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  touching on themes like Bilderberg the political
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  two-party paradigm fraud
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  international banking war as a social
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  necessity for addition of water and poisoning
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  foods like a very
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  good Norwegian author on this point
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  he has a

[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Norway perspective
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  system with your self produced colloidal
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  silver solutions yet many are
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  unaware of the entire function of the silver
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  system and how it has been designed to
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  in or on the body
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  developer of the silver lungs generator
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  not only does the silver lung system produce
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  it also comes equipped with
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  the proper applicators and devices
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  needed to deliver your silver solutions
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  directly to key target areas
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  this includes the eyes
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  ears nose
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  lungs topically to the skin
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  and orally for the digestive system

[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:22.320]  areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:26.320]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:27.320]  Number 4.
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:29.840]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:33.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:34.520]  Number 5.
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:38.280]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:42.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:43.440]  one of my old sponsors.
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:47.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:59.040]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:02.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:16.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.720]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:24.960]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:28.200]  I won't have time to get into this now because I want to take a bunch of your calls.
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:32.920]  We'll take more calls than just one segment tomorrow, my weekday broadcast.
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:37.800]  But Norwegian and other European papers are reporting that he was involved with the modern
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:39.520]  night's Templar.
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:45.080]  They're planning terror attacks against Muslim lovers, basically, and he's one of their terms
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.440]  in the United States as well.
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:49.240]  The globalists have really gotten a little obvious.
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:51.760]  The night's Templar is their Illuminati group.
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:58.000]  Now it's fighting the Muslims when the government's actually opening the borders wide up.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.320]  This is wide al-Qaeda.
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:04.520]  How the government's going to have an excuse to shut down free speech, the internet, track
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:10.280]  people, chilling effect, shut down the Tea Party, it's not going to work.
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:13.600]  It's as phony as a $3 bill.
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:18.340]  It's as phony as Rick Perry being a conservative when he was Al Gore's chief of staff for
[1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:21.200]  president in Texas, if you look it up.
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:24.600]  Let's go to Scott in Oklahoma, Frank, Robert, Beth, and many others.
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  Thanks for holding guys.
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  Scott in Oklahoma.
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:27.600]  Go ahead.
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:28.600]  We've got to move quick.
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:33.320]  Alex, thank you for your spot on analysis and thank you to Webster G. Tarpley, a.k.a.
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:34.320]  The Brain.
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:39.000]  This does appear to be more than NATO, but mainly CIA, DHS, and Mossad.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.680]  The drills and the level of sophistication of the bomb make me curious as to why the
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:45.040]  terrorists chose the national holiday.
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:48.640]  How much of a hand do you believe that the CIA and the Assad have played?
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:56.080]  Well, I mean, I know that UPI, Jerusalem Post, just search Israel-founded Hamas.
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:58.320]  Israel runs, quote, fake al-Qaeda.
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:02.600]  I mean, that's Israeli newspapers are saying that.
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:07.200]  They credit Hamas to be a counterbalance to Hezbollah.
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:12.000]  And I know the CIA has been caught staging countless terror attacks on record.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.800]  And so the point is, if we have governments and agencies that stand to gain in wars and
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:22.120]  police state and weapons contracts and surveillance contracts from terror, if they don't have
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:23.960]  terror, they're out of business.
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:26.720]  So yes, this thing stinks to high heaven.
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:31.160]  And the system wants to go after the Tea Party, the real Tea Party, not the Republican-oid
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:32.160]  one.
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:33.160]  So I appreciate your call, Scott.
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:34.160]  Good points.
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:37.240]  Frank and Louisiana, Frank, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:42.200]  Yes, Alex, you know, this whole thing is, you could see it coming.
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:47.840]  The international diabolical bankers, they know they're in trouble with all of this tarp,
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:50.560]  the trillions upon tens of trillions.
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:56.560]  And it's not going to bail them out of their hundreds of trillions of dollars of these worthless
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:58.200]  bombs that they put out there.
[1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:01.360]  And so now they're trying to get the Muslims and Christians to start killing each other.
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:06.880]  They need a war, Alex, and if you recall, the mysterious thing was when they were taken
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:12.800]  out in Mubarak, Kissinger comes on and he states, this is just the beginning of a series
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:13.800]  of events.
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:21.160]  Then it was about two or three weeks after that, they go after Qaddafi that was a non-beligerent.
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:22.160]  And the reason-
[1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:23.160]  Exactly.
[1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:24.160]  No, no.
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:27.160]  And now this guy puts a manifesto out, being read by millions of people, you know, that's
[1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:32.840]  very professionally produced, meant to invoke Europeans, whites, Christians, to wage war
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:37.760]  against Muslims, to get the fight going as a political diversion.
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:38.760]  Sorry.
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:43.440]  I mean, it's just like CIA-connected groups published the Mohammed with a bomb on his
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:45.560]  head things to get riots going.
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:50.160]  I mean, this is the oldest distraction in the book and there's going to be copycats
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:53.000]  that carry out attacks that aren't government from this.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:54.160]  You better believe it.
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:51:01.160]  Well, the scary thing is that right now they're talking about going against Iran and I think
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:05.160]  they need a war to take the pressure off them because people are looking at the international
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:07.840]  bankers, they're a diabolical elite.
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:12.240]  And the only thing I can figure that they might have gone after Qaddafi was because
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:18.360]  he was trying to start the North African Union of Nations and remember Kissinger came out
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:24.440]  with that State Department number 200 that was targeting places like Africa for the genocide
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:25.440]  of Third World...
[1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:28.640]  No, he said we can't let them develop, we got to get wars going between them to reduce
[1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:29.640]  their population.
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:30.640]  Absolutely.
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:35.440]  Qaddafi was coming out with an African currency and that wasn't about to be put up with.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:39.160]  Oh, yeah, that's the same thing that they took the Shah of Iran out for.
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:41.240]  He wouldn't take the American dollar.
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:42.240]  Absolutely, Frank.
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:43.240]  I appreciate your call.
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:44.240]  Great points.
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:45.240]  Wish I could talk to you for 10 hours.
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:48.520]  Robert, in California, Robert, you're on the air, welcome.
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:50.800]  Hey, how are you?
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:51.800]  Good.
[1:51:51.800 --> 1:51:57.000]  Well, yeah, just the whole thing makes me think back to 9-11, I remember Bush, you know,
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:01.400]  I'd just been selected and I was just not easily thinking, well, he's a lame duck, you
[1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:05.840]  know, he's not going to be super aggressive and I was really surprised that he...
[1:52:05.840 --> 1:52:09.040]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:13.320]  The question who really carried out 9-11, remember that two days after 9-11, he said
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:15.440]  don't question who did this?
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:22.000]  Right, but my point is, like, I knew that day it was a false flag, like my landlord woke
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:25.800]  me up and, you know, we turned on, you know, he showed me the TV and it's like a plane
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:26.800]  hit the building.
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:27.800]  I was just waking up.
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:28.800]  I didn't know what was going on.
[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:32.080]  When the second plane hit, we just looked at each other and were like, this is Bush,
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:33.080]  you know.
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:34.200]  We know that it's a false flag.
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:35.680]  We know about false flags, right?
[1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:38.320]  So you're anticipating it, you know, at a time.
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:41.840]  Exactly, and I don't know if you listen to the show often, but have I not been screaming
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:45.920]  bloody murder, that they're running a public script, that now the white Christians are
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:46.920]  going to attack?
[1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:48.560]  I mean, who really believes this?
[1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.120]  I mean, come on.
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:51.680]  One guy killed 93 people.
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:56.720]  It's like you don't have to wonder, is it a Psyop, if it's being presented to you?
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:57.720]  It's a Psyop.
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:01.480]  That's, you know, I mean, people need to wake up that everything is a Psyop.
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:06.080]  I mean, everything you experienced in public school, like Charlotte Husserby was saying
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.480]  on your program, is a Psyop.
[1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:11.960]  I mean, everything you experienced in school is a Psyop until people realize that.
[1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:13.160]  Well, I agree.
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:17.160]  Even if something isn't a Psyop to begin with, they will spin it that direction.
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:21.680]  Like the White House Chief of Staff said, he said, you know, don't let a good crisis
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:22.680]  go to waste.
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:24.280]  They certainly do do that.
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:26.280]  Beth in Texas, Beth, you're on the air.
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:27.280]  Thanks for holding.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:28.280]  Yes, Alex.
[1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:33.920]  You talked just briefly the other day about how after this Norway attack, that the next
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:38.440]  attacks would be probably in the States, and you specifically really didn't go into
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:39.440]  it.
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:42.000]  But you just mentioned Austin and Dallas and being that I'm in Austin also.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:48.800]  I was just curious what you're, why you specifically mentioned Texas as being a high possibility
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:49.800]  for one.
[1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:53.840]  The Council on Foreign Relations likes to brag.
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:54:00.240]  They'll publicly admit they're going to stage a terror attack with almost no veil of denial.
[1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:05.560]  You can just look up Gary Hart, Hart Rubin Commission, Council on Foreign Relations Steering
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:09.440]  Committee, and he wrote a letter to Iran saying, we stage Gulf of Tonkin.
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:15.200]  We staged, you know, these other events of the main, you better back off, we'll stage
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:17.880]  something and attack you.
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:25.880]  And the CFR, same guys said, Dallas, Cleveland, Denver, one other, and then another report
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:30.680]  they said Austin, and they want to hit Austin because this is now the capital of resistance.
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:35.280]  I mean, there's more, everybody's moving here because I was here first and people somehow
[1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:38.880]  think geographically, and plus it's a great place to live, that this is where the resistance
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:39.880]  is.
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:44.880]  And so due to people's error, believing it was because I was here, it now has become
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:45.880]  the center of the resistance.
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:46.880]  Let me tell you something.
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:52.000]  I went out yesterday to the mall and the restaurants and was mobbed everywhere.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:53.840]  My wife was like, this is getting scary.
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:54.840]  I mean, everywhere.
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:58.360]  I mean, I'm not talking about walking down the street, a few folks talk to me.
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:03.520]  I mean, I had groups of people around me everywhere and I'm just one person.
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:06.200]  And so that's an illustration of how many people are awake.
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:07.200]  So they would love.
[1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:11.360]  I mean, I'm telling you, you put all the pieces together, the establishment would love to
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:17.520]  hit Austin so they can really bring in some police state-loving and try to scare folks
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:19.520]  into submission, Beth.
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:20.520]  Hello?
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:26.440]  Yes, ma'am, but you've still got a much better chance being killed in a car wreck in Austin
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:28.200]  than you do being killed by terrorists.
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.320]  Yeah, I mean, I understand.
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:34.080]  And also the other thing is I think Texas is known, it's one of the two states that
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:39.320]  you can actually homeschool your children in without a lot of government interference.
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:40.320]  Exactly.
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:43.480]  Texas is leading the way resisting tyranny.
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:46.520]  It's like Oklahoma was leading the way against Clinton.
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:52.240]  They had a 10th Amendment resolution to nullify Clinton's activity so they hit him with Oklahoma
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:53.240]  City.
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:55.600]  And folks, I could spend five hours just on OKC.
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:58.000]  I'm not just saying that was an inside job.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.160]  Watch my film for free online, Road to Tyranny, and we have the local newscast and everything
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:08.000]  with the admissions, the police talking about it, the bombs being removed, Southern Poverty
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:09.960]  Law Center running Elohim City.
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:12.280]  I mean, really chilling, hardcore stuff.
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:13.720]  Thank you so much, Beth.
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:18.600]  You know, those were great calls, and I've got like 10 other callers to get to, and I
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:20.200]  don't think I'll be able to.
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:23.040]  Real quick, Chris in Canada, you're on the air.
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:24.040]  Go ahead.
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:25.040]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:26.040]  Good.
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:27.040]  Only got about a minute.
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:28.040]  Great.
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:32.920]  Well, I just, I was reading on Al Jazeera today, and I found an interesting article.
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:37.440]  The title is, Nationalists pose bigger threat than Al Qaeda.
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:41.200]  Contrary to popular belief, most terrorists attacks in Europe are the work of extremist
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:42.200]  nationalists.
[1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:43.560]  Yeah, I'm glad you raised that.
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:49.320]  The Arab press is going nuts because they're mainly British intel run, blaming Christians
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:54.640]  really using this right now, saying, yes, the Christians are the devils, lock them up.
[1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:55.960]  I did see that article.
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:58.720]  It is just an orgy of disinformation.
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:56:59.720]  Yeah.
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:05.960]  Tell me about, please, talks about a lot of, quote, nationalist terror plots in the UK.
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:11.760]  There's Robert Cottage, Nathan Warrell, and of course, Timothy McVeigh himself comes up
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:12.760]  a lot in this article.
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:13.760]  Oh, yeah.
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:14.760]  No, they are hyping.
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:15.760]  Get ready.
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:18.680]  The whitey, the white Al Qaeda is going to attack, give all your rights up.
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:21.240]  Trust no one, but don't worry right on time at Walmart.
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:24.000]  The telescreens are going in, saying only trust government.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.640]  See, government wants us all fighting with each other, all of each other's throats.
[1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:31.360]  The new Homeland Security video said, why do Al Qaeda is going to get you?
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:33.320]  Are they talking on cell phones?
[1:57:33.320 --> 1:57:35.320]  Are they writing on paper?
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:36.840]  Do they have vans?
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:37.840]  Are they white?
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:39.360]  Look out, they're going to get you.
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:40.880]  Only Obama will save you.
[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:41.880]  God bless you all.
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:42.880]  Great job, crew.
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:43.880]  Infowars.com.
[1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:49.760]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central, live.
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:53.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:56.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:00.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:01.960]  at home.
[1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:06.600]  I have determined the most influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:07.720]  calling the shots.
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:12.960]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:16.280]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:22.120]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  world government.
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:27.440]  Jim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:29.600]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.520]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:36.840]  of the republic.
