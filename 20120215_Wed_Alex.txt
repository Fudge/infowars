[08:51.220 --> 08:55.260]  confirm that she knows exactly what she's talking about and is an exciting
[08:55.260 --> 09:00.580]  voice you know added to the mix with her experiences as a forensic realtor that

[09:14.740 --> 09:18.940]  as long he's younger of course now he survived a plane crash and almost died
[09:18.940 --> 09:24.340]  a year and a half ago but he's back and really having a big effect the fastest
[09:24.340 --> 09:29.660]  growing party in the UK and it's spreading to the European Union he's
[09:29.660 --> 09:33.300]  fighting the open announcements of world government he's gonna be joining us
[09:33.300 --> 09:37.340]  coming up in the last 30 months the show today best-selling author James Wesley
[09:37.340 --> 09:42.860]  Rawls of the new novel survivors is gonna be joining us first time I've ever

[09:50.340 --> 09:57.380]  we've got new fast and furious news giant news on the terror front in fact
[09:57.380 --> 10:03.620]  when I read this type of news I've got a really really try to just ask her by to
[10:03.620 --> 10:10.020]  take a deep breath and listen to me carefully on this information when you
[10:10.020 --> 10:15.980]  see media hype when you see government hype about imminent Iranian attacks in
[10:15.980 --> 10:23.540]  America and the fact that the US Israel and NATO in England are staging bombings
[10:23.540 --> 10:27.620]  and attacks inside Iran and you've got the head of National Security Council
[10:27.620 --> 10:33.180]  clapper calling for provocations with Iran you've got the history of Cheney
[10:33.180 --> 10:37.340]  Pulitzer Prize winner Cy Hurst exposed wanting to paint up US boats like
[10:37.340 --> 10:42.860]  Iranian speed boats and have Navy SEALs attack US ships five years ago then that
[10:42.860 --> 10:46.700]  came out about three and a half years ago once Cheney left office Cy Hurst was
[10:46.700 --> 10:51.100]  too scared to publish it until he'd left office I understand why he's the guy
[10:51.100 --> 10:54.260]  that broke the Milan massacre everything else again two-time Pulitzer Prize winner
[10:54.260 --> 10:58.340]  you can't get any more credible than Cy Hurst you've got that going on and now
[10:58.340 --> 11:03.820]  you've got him hyping get ready for the Iranian attack in ABC news in
[11:03.820 --> 11:09.060]  Associated Press heightened security in US over Iran threat and you add to that
[11:09.060 --> 11:15.620]  the US troops massing the NATO troops massing all of this going on all of this
[11:15.620 --> 11:21.780]  unfolding all of this happening and then you have the Navy SEALs with Ed
[11:21.780 --> 11:29.340]  Asner telling him that a attack is imminent a false flag attack that Navy
[11:29.340 --> 11:33.460]  SEALs are telling him is about to happen and then off record he even gave me the
[11:33.460 --> 11:38.500]  sources names and information and I've called him playing phone tag right now
[11:38.500 --> 11:44.260]  you've got all of this going on all of this happening I mean this is the season
[11:44.260 --> 11:49.020]  of false flag like I said two weeks ago with that big emergency alert and I
[11:49.020 --> 11:53.100]  said look for him to start hyping Iranians are gonna hit the US look for
[11:53.100 --> 11:58.260]  him to start hyping this ahead of a new war they could easily pull off a new 9-11
[11:58.260 --> 12:03.700]  say Iran did it clamp down on domestic freedoms deploy the TSA and regular
[12:03.700 --> 12:07.020]  army on the streets it's all been announced that they're in preparation for
[12:07.020 --> 12:11.860]  start shutting down the media suspending elections anything could happen
[12:11.860 --> 12:15.700]  now to be clear I'm not saying this is going to happen but we're in the sights
[12:15.700 --> 12:22.540]  we're in the crosshairs we're in the danger zone this is big time so I'm
[12:22.540 --> 12:29.340]  gonna be breaking that down it's all unfolding and so this is certainly
[12:29.340 --> 12:34.980]  white-knuckle time right now let's go ahead and go to a clip from last night's
[12:34.980 --> 12:40.380]  nightly news with Greg Paulist where I was bringing up the fact that so much of
[12:40.380 --> 12:44.420]  what he's talked about has now come true I mean he was the one saying news core
[12:44.420 --> 12:48.820]  was a mafia spying on people and influence peddling and giving sources
[12:48.820 --> 12:55.020]  to the police police sources that the system could then basically go out and
[12:55.020 --> 13:01.500]  go after whistleblowers all of it he was a guy who broke down 2002 the plan by
[13:01.500 --> 13:06.020]  the big banks to implode Europe and then the United States just like they've done
[13:06.020 --> 13:13.100]  third world countries he said Argentina its destruction in 2001 2000 is the
[13:13.100 --> 13:17.380]  model of what they're gonna do here and it all happened so I brought this up to
[13:17.380 --> 13:22.180]  him and this was his response to that last night thing of saying yeah I told
[13:22.180 --> 13:25.860]  you so I think it is worthwhile because it gives credibility to the material that
[13:25.860 --> 13:30.340]  we did put on before I should know that I I'm a lucky guy in one way you might
[13:30.340 --> 13:34.780]  not see me on US TV except you know bless you Alex especially on Valentine's
[13:34.780 --> 13:42.100]  they then kiss you but but I do have the world's largest news network behind me
[13:42.100 --> 13:47.780]  putting me on a prime time BBC television now it do understand that BBC when
[13:47.780 --> 13:53.380]  I got the documents from inside the IMF and now we do see grease on fire there's
[13:53.380 --> 13:58.220]  a chapter in vultures picnic called the generalism of globalization where I
[13:58.220 --> 14:03.340]  actually have these documents from inside the IMF World Bank because of my
[14:03.340 --> 14:10.180]  position in journalism in Europe I was actually able to confront personally the
[14:10.180 --> 14:13.900]  director general of the World Trade Organization and put these inside
[14:13.900 --> 14:18.300]  confidential documents and cables in front of him that was his opportunity
[14:18.300 --> 14:22.340]  to say oh it's all made up it's a bunch of conspiracy junk he verified
[14:22.340 --> 14:25.900]  everything he tried to talk away their meaning but he verified everything that
[14:25.900 --> 14:31.380]  I had all the documents I had when you see grease on fire I saw those documents
[14:31.380 --> 14:37.700]  I also spoke to the inventor of the Euro Bob Mundell and who said you
[14:37.700 --> 14:43.340]  basically is saying this was in the plan the idea was to he wanted to end he
[14:43.340 --> 14:46.180]  wanted to make sure that there was a sell-off of all the government properties
[14:46.180 --> 14:50.940]  and grease etc you have to set a fire if you're gonna have a fire sale he thought
[14:50.940 --> 14:55.260]  that this is the best thing that's ever happened these guys this was the purpose
[14:55.260 --> 15:02.180]  of the euro he said he was very upset he told me that that democracies get to
[15:02.180 --> 15:07.200]  kind of vote on their fiscal and monetary have fiscal monetary control he
[15:07.200 --> 15:14.340]  wanted to create a mechanism the euro which would be which would make elected
[15:14.340 --> 15:19.860]  parliaments and congresses and presidents subservient to an economic
[15:19.860 --> 15:27.900]  formula and the economic formula is called the is called the 3% rule there
[15:27.900 --> 15:32.660]  it's a there's a German word which I can't pronounce that they use but that
[15:32.660 --> 15:36.460]  was the purpose was to basically create something that would replace that would
[15:36.460 --> 15:40.020]  replace democracy in fact by the way I spoke with you know I'm because again
[15:40.020 --> 15:43.540]  because of my position I get to meet all these heads of state etc and I've met
[15:43.540 --> 15:50.380]  with Carlo Monti the new the new prime minister of Italy the new chief Italy and
[15:50.380 --> 15:56.340]  Monti you know he's not been elected he's just a banker that's you know you
[15:56.340 --> 15:59.660]  don't get to choose they call him a technocrat I mean even the economist
[15:59.660 --> 16:03.660]  says it's good to not have countries run themselves we the technocrats will run
[16:03.660 --> 16:07.180]  it now and as you said years ago when you got to meet you know with the head of
[16:07.180 --> 16:10.300]  the organization the World Trade Organization they admitted this is how
[16:10.300 --> 16:13.860]  we were going to take over but then it's there are the ones that sold the
[16:13.860 --> 16:18.460]  fraudulent debt and got the governments to sign on they're the ones that actually
[16:18.460 --> 16:24.020]  have most the debt and so they do this fin golly judo move where they're set up
[16:24.020 --> 16:28.980]  as our bosses even though they're the progenitors of it it's it's insane yeah
[16:28.980 --> 16:36.700]  well in fact in the case of like Greece I call it a crime scene in particular the
[16:36.700 --> 16:43.500]  Greek government to stay within the euro both the so-called socialists and the
[16:43.500 --> 16:51.660]  so-called conservatives there had cut a private deal with Goldman Sachs to hide
[16:51.660 --> 16:56.300]  to hide their true deficits and this is true most of the countries but if this
[16:56.300 --> 17:00.220]  was particularly done with Goldman Sachs and had to do it with trading euros
[17:00.220 --> 17:06.780]  into yen and dollars and back technically on paper it looked like Goldman Sachs
[17:06.780 --> 17:09.860]  took a multi-billion dollar loss well Goldman Sachs never takes them
[17:09.860 --> 17:15.420]  deliberate multi-million billion dollar loss that's nonsense in fact it was
[17:15.420 --> 17:20.300]  covered up by secret agreement to pay them back and massive charges with massive
[17:20.300 --> 17:24.660]  you serious charges I mean you couldn't call it anything anything else plus a
[17:24.660 --> 17:29.220]  half billion dollar fee on top of the massive interest rates that they were
[17:29.220 --> 17:35.220]  collecting all done in secret when this came out of course then the Greek bond
[17:35.220 --> 17:39.820]  market the market for Greek bonds completely collapsed and people rightly
[17:39.820 --> 17:47.380]  in a way asked for massive massively high interest because you know they say
[17:47.380 --> 17:54.780]  we're victims of a fraud now why you know someone asked me actually actually
[17:54.780 --> 18:00.700]  one of the band members from if you remember Dire Straits how come they
[18:00.700 --> 18:04.940]  weren't arrested well you the United States what the securities exchange
[18:04.940 --> 18:08.900]  commission supposed to arrest the the government of Greece because after all
[18:08.900 --> 18:14.260]  there's a conspiracy between two governments and Goldman Sachs and here's
[18:14.260 --> 18:18.540]  the deal instead of Goldman being busted they get they get money from the
[18:18.540 --> 18:24.540]  European Central Bank they get totally bailed out they get fees for handling the
[18:24.540 --> 18:28.300]  bailout and then their guys take over the country and they buy up the assets of
[18:28.300 --> 18:34.900]  the country the shipping the beaches you know the island I've seen cases in the
[18:34.900 --> 18:39.780]  news where they owe a brokerage firm that sold them crap three billion dollars
[18:39.780 --> 18:42.700]  so the head of the company goes I'll take an island personally for three
[18:42.700 --> 18:47.140]  billion I mean and it's all through fraud so I guess Madoff's problem and
[18:47.140 --> 18:53.140]  Kinley's problem was the frauds weren't big enough and weren't so giant that it
[18:53.140 --> 18:56.260]  bring down the whole system here's my question for you and then I want to go
[18:56.260 --> 18:59.420]  back to the news court then because people say hey you cut him off when you
[18:59.420 --> 19:04.220]  got to the part about seeing an end where is it all headed now with MF
[19:04.220 --> 19:08.940]  global whereas you know the head of the commodities board was the former
[19:08.940 --> 19:13.980]  minion of Corzine Corzine gets caught in Congress lying of course he ordered
[19:13.980 --> 19:18.940]  the now 1.6 billion transferred to London and then he doesn't get in
[19:18.940 --> 19:22.940]  trouble and I was talking to Max Kaiser today he said look this is just gonna
[19:22.940 --> 19:27.860]  signal a new level of stealing going after segregated accounts so a where is
[19:27.860 --> 19:32.700]  it all headed and then be going back what is news core from your deep research
[19:32.700 --> 19:37.900]  understanding what he is yet and more of a mafia organization and then tie it in
[19:37.900 --> 19:42.940]  to the host that took over Larry King's plot that you were trying to get to and
[19:42.940 --> 19:48.420]  I interrupted okay that's quite a tall order first Corzine who was governor of
[19:48.420 --> 19:53.140]  New Jersey but he was also you have to understand he was the CEO of Goldman Sachs
[19:53.140 --> 19:58.820]  before he became governor of New Jersey now why don't they go after Corzine
[19:58.820 --> 20:02.820]  why isn't he read his right I've seen the Injevity products work for many others
[20:02.820 --> 20:06.260]  and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results
[20:06.260 --> 20:11.420]  but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and
[20:11.420 --> 20:16.140]  lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said I better follow my
[20:16.140 --> 20:21.300]  own advice started taking the Injevity products and it's been incredible 37

[24:26.620 --> 24:30.460]  last night on info wars nightly news with Greg Palast I mean this is such an
[24:30.460 --> 24:35.480]  incredible show the radio show with all the guests the callers the news but the
[24:35.480 --> 24:41.140]  TV show I mean it is just amazing what we do every single night the guests the
[24:41.140 --> 24:45.620]  news the video reports I know they're working on a whole bunch of really
[24:45.620 --> 24:49.980]  special stuff for tomorrow night and some surprises but let's go ahead and go
[24:49.980 --> 24:57.300]  back to the point of Corzine why he's untouchable listen carefully why don't
[24:57.300 --> 25:02.300]  they go after Corzine why isn't he read his rights I mean if you shoplift you
[25:02.300 --> 25:05.740]  know if you shoplift a screwdriver hardware store they're gonna they're
[25:05.740 --> 25:11.500]  gonna read you your rights you shoplift $1.6 billion and and they invite you to
[25:11.500 --> 25:17.460]  Congress to just to give a chat why what the answer is what he has on these
[25:17.460 --> 25:22.980]  guys and who else is in on this stuff now I got a glimpse of it I can't get it
[25:22.980 --> 25:27.260]  all you know because that I just don't have all the roots in but I did have a
[25:27.260 --> 25:32.980]  document Mark confidential from Tim Geithner who is our secretary of
[25:32.980 --> 25:37.620]  Treasury to Larry Summers it's in the book vultures picnic in fact you can see
[25:37.620 --> 25:44.540]  it at the my site vultures picnic.org it was a cable written by Geithner to
[25:44.540 --> 25:49.420]  Summers talking about how they were going to use the World Trade Organization
[25:49.420 --> 25:54.500]  to squeeze any nation that got in the way of our banks and didn't join in the
[25:54.500 --> 26:01.340]  deregulation fest that was going on so they were how they're gonna punish
[26:01.340 --> 26:05.420]  nations in particular Brazil now why is that important that this discussion the
[26:05.420 --> 26:11.660]  answer is that Geithner told Summers who was at that time secretary of Treasury
[26:11.660 --> 26:18.260]  now and then until recently was Obama's economics are why did Geithner are now
[26:18.260 --> 26:23.700]  secretary of Treasury right to Summers he was telling him to call the top five
[26:23.700 --> 26:27.140]  bankers in America before they pulled the trigger at the World Trade
[26:27.140 --> 26:31.020]  Organization because I bring down and did bring down the world and then he goes
[26:31.020 --> 26:36.380]  on to list those five bankers the full videos at prisonplanet.tv and how they
[26:36.380 --> 26:39.660]  basically give orders because they control the private shares and the
[26:39.660 --> 26:43.980]  private fellow deserve just like in Europe they're going under total banker
[26:43.980 --> 26:48.140]  occupation and you just heard Paulist who actually has the video of the
[26:48.140 --> 26:52.580]  interview on the BBC it was like three years ago with the head of the World
[26:52.580 --> 26:56.660]  Trade Organization admitting that the euro was meant to take over what was
[26:56.660 --> 27:02.660]  left of sovereignty in Europe and impoverished them economically and I
[27:02.660 --> 27:06.140]  was on IMDB last night because I was trying to remember the year I put out a
[27:06.140 --> 27:13.420]  film so I had to go there to remember and they had trivia of Alex Jones and in
[27:13.420 --> 27:16.780]  the trivia section was quotes and I did look at the quotes they are some of my
[27:16.780 --> 27:22.860]  quotes and one of them is it's all out in the open and then I did a search on
[27:22.860 --> 27:26.740]  that and saw that it's like a joke that I say it's all out in the open no it's all
[27:26.740 --> 27:30.900]  out in the open and that's why I'm basically the point of tearing my own
[27:30.900 --> 27:36.780]  hair out not that there's much of it left I mean it's all out in the open they
[27:36.780 --> 27:45.220]  put poison in our water poison in our food I was reading a Washington Post
[27:45.220 --> 27:49.860]  article last night on the nightly news and I actually kind of flipped out just
[27:49.860 --> 27:53.460]  in the dark satirical humor of it in fact I'm gonna go get it out of the TV
[27:53.460 --> 28:06.100]  studio here during the break and cover it when we come back I I'm sitting there
[28:06.100 --> 28:11.220]  and I'm reading this Washington Post article and I think the reason I flipped
[28:11.220 --> 28:15.900]  out on air a little bit last night was because I had never read the article
[28:15.900 --> 28:19.860]  usually I've read everything two or three times or at least looked at it a
[28:19.860 --> 28:24.980]  few times before I get on air with it but in my stack I tell the guys some of
[28:24.980 --> 28:28.940]  the news I want to cover they bring up some news I had said yeah I put that in
[28:28.940 --> 28:34.700]  the news but hadn't really looked at it so I'm reading the article on air and
[28:34.700 --> 28:40.820]  hidden in plain view it says and of course already knew about this but it
[28:40.820 --> 28:44.900]  was just the reading it the way they dryly reported on it it was a headline
[28:44.900 --> 28:52.420]  about Monsanto matted farmers because they're not planting enough non GMO
[28:52.420 --> 28:57.740]  crops and it was a factoid I'd known for over a decade but I just kind of
[28:57.740 --> 29:03.260]  forgotten it or hadn't consciously taken the meaning myself and it hit me like a
[29:03.260 --> 29:06.900]  ton of bricks while I was reading the article how huge it was and you're like
[29:06.900 --> 29:10.580]  okay well what is it that's so huge we come back from break I'm gonna go get
[29:10.580 --> 29:14.540]  the article and I'll cover that and get into the big Iran terror threat we're
[29:14.540 --> 29:20.620]  being told about a repeat of 2003 with the Iraq invasion but they could kick
[29:20.620 --> 29:31.460]  off a new 9-11 so I'm gonna come back and cover just just what hit me like a
[29:31.460 --> 29:35.700]  ton of bricks on air and see that's when I tend to have those electric thoughts
[29:35.700 --> 29:39.220]  and understanding and anger is when I'm reading something for the first time or
[29:39.220 --> 29:42.260]  seeing it for the first time and then those connections remain that happened
[29:42.260 --> 29:47.860]  on air last night that's why I started just literally going wild on air we'll
[29:47.860 --> 29:54.320]  cover when we get back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:54.320 --> 30:03.060]  and the GCN radio network a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of
[30:03.060 --> 30:06.980]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[30:06.980 --> 30:11.420]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[30:11.420 --> 30:14.360]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[30:14.360 --> 30:18.660]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[34:20.460 --> 34:26.460]  documentary and I haven't even decided the name of this documentary yet Aaron
[34:26.460 --> 34:31.700]  as usual we always end up adding more and so he's been up here sleepless trying
[34:31.700 --> 34:38.540]  to edit all this together and I just love surprises I can never wait till
[34:38.540 --> 34:44.100]  Christmas you know I'd always try to sneak and secretly forensically open
[34:44.100 --> 34:48.180]  the packages to look at him when I was a little kid so I'm gonna premiere tonight
[34:48.180 --> 34:56.340]  on the nightly news the first six minutes or so and I'm just gonna say
[34:56.340 --> 35:01.060]  it's it's comical and it's the funniest thing we've probably ever done and I
[35:01.060 --> 35:04.340]  just thought of it the other day because we already pretty much made the film and
[35:04.340 --> 35:08.700]  the film is about the greatest threats that actually face humanity not all the
[35:08.700 --> 35:17.180]  fake threats that the social engineers dangle in front of us all of that so
[35:17.180 --> 35:21.100]  we're going to be premiering that on the nightly news and it'll be posted for
[35:21.100 --> 35:24.860]  everybody at prison planet TV and then info wars comm will have it tomorrow for
[35:24.860 --> 35:27.340]  everybody even if you're not a subscriber and then and then when the
[35:27.340 --> 35:31.660]  documentary is done after I've premiered the whole thing in Dallas this weekend
[35:31.660 --> 35:35.380]  and then next Sunday in Orlando we'll post the whole thing on prison planet
[35:35.380 --> 35:39.140]  TV for members first that Monday and then by the Tuesday it'll be on the
[35:39.140 --> 35:42.140]  YouTube channel while we've still got that we're they're trying to shut our
[35:42.140 --> 35:46.740]  YouTube channel down again right now behind the scenes with letters and stuff
[35:46.740 --> 35:52.540]  I've been hit with four letters in the last week with people trying to shut
[35:52.540 --> 35:56.220]  down our operation and all sorts of other chicanery going on behind the
[35:56.220 --> 36:03.260]  scenes and I take it as a real mark that we are doing really really good as the
[36:03.260 --> 36:09.540]  attacks intensify as the craziness basically intensifies we are certainly
[36:09.540 --> 36:13.940]  starting to have an effect now what happened is this is one reason I can't
[36:13.940 --> 36:19.060]  focus on the show it's nobody's fault what happened is I tried to make it out
[36:19.060 --> 36:23.660]  of the studio to get down the hall to my broadcast studio and then I looked up
[36:23.660 --> 36:26.580]  and three minutes have gone by because three four people talked to me and then
[36:26.580 --> 36:30.020]  my wife called and I went wait a minute I'm supposed to have them on Santo
[36:30.020 --> 36:33.900]  article and then I said it's the Monsanto article Washington Post on my
[36:33.900 --> 36:38.340]  desk in the broadcast studio and that was three minutes four minutes ago so
[36:38.340 --> 36:42.380]  obviously I'm gonna have to go to some tape here to be able to cover this for
[36:42.380 --> 36:47.660]  you and then go out and get it we have it because I was needing it on air and
[36:47.660 --> 36:50.700]  that's why I was saying I'm waiting to cover it great so we're gonna be able
[36:50.700 --> 36:54.500]  to have that up in just a minute listen here's the deal folks this is
[36:54.500 --> 37:01.820]  teleprompter free this is the real deal this is not entertainment and this is
[37:01.820 --> 37:06.380]  not about the celebrity of Alex Jones I hate the celebrity of Alex Jones I want
[37:06.380 --> 37:12.820]  to hide under a rock I want to be left alone I don't like being recognized I
[37:12.820 --> 37:21.900]  don't like having to run this operation I don't like all of it but it is
[37:21.900 --> 37:25.500]  something I have to do to defeat the globalist and I know you don't want to
[37:25.500 --> 37:28.260]  be public you don't want to have to talk to your neighbors you don't want to have
[37:28.260 --> 37:33.260]  to go to city council but you've got to do it you've got to get aggressive in the
[37:33.260 --> 37:38.860]  fight for liberty but I look at all of these people that are so worldly that
[37:38.860 --> 37:43.540]  are so into how they look and how people perceive them and and and being
[37:43.540 --> 37:47.460]  trendy and then the system can just put out what they say is fashionable what
[37:47.460 --> 37:55.020]  they say is the kosher you know cause celeb of the day and to see people not
[37:55.020 --> 37:58.820]  even being conscious but being programmed by the television and the
[37:58.820 --> 38:04.380]  culture and all the rest of it I mean here's another example I can't even
[38:04.380 --> 38:07.700]  keep this office clean to keep the fruit flies out of here I got them
[38:07.700 --> 38:10.860]  landing on my face right now I'm gonna go deal with the fruit flies right now
[38:10.860 --> 38:30.060]  run some music I'm not dealing with it anymore man
[39:40.860 --> 40:06.740]  thousands of popular diet and sugar-free foods and beverages contain an
[40:06.740 --> 40:11.900]  artificial sweetener that researchers say may cause cancer the ingredient is
[40:11.900 --> 40:16.780]  aspartame and it is by far the most dangerous substance on the market that
[40:16.780 --> 40:22.380]  is added to our foods aspartame is an artificial sweetener found in thousands
[40:22.380 --> 40:28.460]  of products worldwide and chances are you are consuming it it's added to sugar-free
[40:28.460 --> 40:33.500]  gum juice beverages tabletop sweeteners like equal and nutritious wheat it's in
[40:33.500 --> 40:38.500]  cereals soft drinks yogurt breath mints multivitamins wine coolers and even
[40:38.500 --> 40:43.740]  over-the-counter medicines the toxic long-term effects of aspartame are often
[40:43.740 --> 40:48.420]  dismissed as a hoax by the sweetener industry however numerous independent
[40:48.420 --> 40:53.980]  controlled studies using human subjects have concluded that aspartame is deadly
[40:53.980 --> 40:58.420]  now there's a number of studies that claim that aspartame is completely safe
[40:58.420 --> 41:02.980]  to consume but the vast majority of those studies were conducted by well you
[41:02.980 --> 41:09.300]  guessed it the aspartame industry in fact groups like Monsanto JD Searle and ILSI
[41:09.300 --> 41:14.260]  concluded that aspartame posed no health risk but that's about as credible as
[41:14.260 --> 41:18.780]  Marlboro Camel and Winston dismissing the link between cigarette smoking and
[41:18.780 --> 41:21.620]  cancer
[41:24.620 --> 41:28.940]  have you heard of aspartame yes I've heard of it before you heard good things
[41:28.940 --> 41:33.780]  are bad things I hear mostly bad things about it I'm just like it's an
[41:33.780 --> 41:36.540]  artificial sweetener and it's bad for your health and you should try to stay
[41:36.540 --> 41:40.220]  away I've heard it's an artificial sweetener and I'm guilty of drinking
[41:40.220 --> 41:45.540]  beverages sweetened with it however it degenerates and it does harmful things
[41:45.540 --> 41:50.340]  what do you think about aspartame I don't like it it gives me headaches they did
[41:50.340 --> 41:56.900]  studies on on rats it supposedly causes cancer even Fox News recently reported
[41:56.900 --> 42:02.020]  in 2005 that artificial sweeteners had been linked to a wide range of cancers
[42:02.020 --> 42:07.260]  after studying involving rats so these rats actually had tumors the size of
[42:07.260 --> 42:11.500]  golf balls so does that concern you when you hear stuff like that greatly yes and
[42:11.500 --> 42:15.020]  the FDA is supposed to be protecting us from things like cancer not giving it to
[42:15.020 --> 42:19.660]  us and telling us it's safe you cannot go to the grocery store now and by any
[42:19.660 --> 42:25.180]  type of even regular sugar gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it in the
[42:25.180 --> 42:29.860]  1970s Searle tried to get it approved and they couldn't it took them three
[42:29.860 --> 42:34.060]  separate times because in their own studies with monkeys large portions of
[42:34.060 --> 42:39.140]  them that were fed it died and contracted cancer now we have mainstream news
[42:39.140 --> 42:44.020]  articles in the EU has done a major study finding lower birth weights early
[42:44.020 --> 42:50.620]  birth and yes miscarriages from women that drink aspartame laden soft drinks
[42:50.620 --> 42:59.300]  like coke zero why not because it hasn't been
[42:59.300 --> 43:05.420]  demonstrated to be safe the FDA looked at the research and in 1975 put
[43:05.420 --> 43:09.460]  aspartame's approval on hold it set up an independent panel of doctors to study
[43:09.460 --> 43:14.940]  aspartame in 1980 that public board of inquiry unanimously ruled aspartame
[43:14.940 --> 43:19.460]  should not go on the market he just was drinking a cup of low-calorie hot chocolate
[43:19.460 --> 43:24.500]  that night aspartame made it sweet and Johnson says aspartame made her sick
[43:24.500 --> 43:28.580]  all of a sudden I couldn't see on my eyes went out of focus and it was like
[43:28.580 --> 43:32.860]  my vision became quite blurred and you think it's because of aspartame I think
[43:32.860 --> 43:37.660]  it's very deliberately because of aspartame yes it was terrifying Kate Randall
[43:37.660 --> 43:41.740]  thought she was going crazy I started popping in my hands and twitching in my
[43:41.740 --> 43:47.820]  feet my legs my knees my upper legs and shoulders and arms and everywhere many of
[43:47.820 --> 43:53.580]  these individuals have been aspartame reactors have tested themselves five
[43:53.580 --> 44:01.580]  10 20 times every time getting the same response and they realized that this was
[44:01.580 --> 44:05.820]  a legitimate cause-and-effect relationship what is aspartame it is the
[44:05.820 --> 44:10.660]  fecal matter all right if you want to watch that full report it's all over
[44:10.660 --> 44:16.140]  the web for free just type in the FDA is killing you Alex Jones or Alex Jones
[44:16.140 --> 44:19.620]  report on aspartame you'll probably get one of a hundred plus reports we've done
[44:19.620 --> 44:23.940]  but that's the report it's all posted in high quality at prison planet TV along
[44:23.940 --> 44:29.980]  with thousands of other reports we've done documenting all this okay again this
[44:29.980 --> 44:34.020]  this radio show more and more is controlled rage I may just have to go
[44:34.020 --> 44:38.940]  back to eating like a pig and not running eight miles a day because because
[44:38.940 --> 44:42.740]  just the new world order all the stuff that's going on the urgency the
[44:42.740 --> 44:49.060]  frustration the irons I've gotten the fire I am on the verge of just
[44:49.060 --> 44:56.620]  absolutely getting angry every five seconds now because I know they're
[44:56.620 --> 45:00.260]  getting ready to stage terror attacks and start big giant wars and then I'll
[45:00.260 --> 45:03.260]  have to watch the terrorist social engineers that think they're smarter
[45:03.260 --> 45:07.180]  than everybody prance around as our saviors on television and I just can't
[45:07.180 --> 45:12.260]  handle it man these murdering gun-running narcotics trafficking criminals who've
[45:12.260 --> 45:15.740]  been caught red-handed a thousand different times up one side and down the
[45:15.740 --> 45:20.460]  other destroying our society and our country is good our world is good but
[45:20.460 --> 45:25.020]  good people are allowing able to take over because we sit here on our hind
[45:25.020 --> 45:30.380]  ends and I'm not doing anymore now I got all this news I got the big terror
[45:30.380 --> 45:36.940]  threat alert news I got guests coming up but here's the report last night that
[45:36.940 --> 45:41.180]  got me to kind of go off into a dark satire rant that people seem to really
[45:41.180 --> 45:45.660]  like I was noticing on the comments on the websites they're like my gosh this
[45:45.660 --> 45:50.660]  is comic genius what it is is somebody in a comedic rage I don't know how to
[45:50.660 --> 45:58.340]  just just because the reality of this is so ridiculously over the top that I
[45:58.340 --> 46:05.940]  either get super angry or super smart mouth or
[46:05.940 --> 46:14.820]  depressed and sometimes is totally turbo focused but then I can hardly ever
[46:14.820 --> 46:18.300]  get focused because there's just so much going on and that's what the globalists
[46:18.300 --> 46:21.900]  want to do they want to just rush us with all this stuff until we just just
[46:21.900 --> 46:29.180]  give into it I mean I read this last night and it just blew me away it's the
[46:29.180 --> 46:33.860]  Washington Post makers of genetically modified seeds say more farmers evading
[46:33.860 --> 46:38.780]  EPA rules and I'd seen the article but hadn't read it and I said Marcos is like
[46:38.780 --> 46:42.260]  this is really wild can I put this in the news tonight and I said yeah yeah put
[46:42.260 --> 46:46.540]  it on the list we'll cover it but it rarely have I not read an article when
[46:46.540 --> 46:50.340]  I come to it in the news usually media people having been read the article they
[46:50.340 --> 46:55.060]  just read off a teleprompter so I kind of had a teleprompter response to this
[46:55.060 --> 46:59.780]  because I'd never read it I just seen the headline I was aware of everything in
[46:59.780 --> 47:04.700]  the article separately but I hadn't read this so I'm on air and I start reading
[47:04.700 --> 47:10.340]  the article and and I'm having that first look effect I talk about because I
[47:10.340 --> 47:14.500]  tend to read news a couple times where I'm on air and then I get angry and then
[47:14.500 --> 47:16.700]  I get on air I've already read it and it's kind of like I don't want to look
[47:16.700 --> 47:20.580]  at that monstrosity again and I tend to not cover the news because it's old to
[47:20.580 --> 47:26.020]  me see what I'm saying but this I read for the first time and and it just
[47:26.020 --> 47:32.740]  flipped me out because it's so hidden in plain view like this headline should be
[47:32.740 --> 47:41.340]  Monsanto wants you to eat the corn not the bees or something like that makers
[47:41.340 --> 47:47.340]  of genetically modified seeds say more farmers evading EPA rules Monsanto co
[47:47.340 --> 47:51.620]  and other seed makers reported a three-fold increase last year and US
[47:51.620 --> 47:55.860]  farmers caught violating rules intended to stop insects from developing
[47:55.860 --> 48:03.260]  resistance to genetically modified corn caught violating rules intended to stop
[48:03.260 --> 48:07.140]  insects from developing resistance here like what are those rules the rules
[48:07.140 --> 48:12.140]  affect farmers planting seeds modified to produce a toxin derived from
[48:12.140 --> 48:17.580]  bacillus thrown in Genesis which is like a bacteria I was saying a fungus
[48:17.580 --> 48:24.020]  there's another fungus variant they've got as well or BT a natural insecticide
[48:24.020 --> 48:28.180]  kind of like nightshades natural the Environmental Protection Agency requires
[48:28.180 --> 48:33.980]  those growers to also plant an adjacent area a so-called refuge of non-BT corn
[48:33.980 --> 48:38.060]  so that bugs feed on both types of corn and don't become immune to the toxin
[48:38.060 --> 48:42.420]  actually it's so they all the bugs don't die so all the bees eat napal and don't
[48:42.420 --> 48:46.540]  die that's actually we've had the experts on read their documents gone over it
[48:46.540 --> 48:50.300]  so so there's some deception there but here it is in plain view oh you got to
[48:50.300 --> 48:55.260]  have a refuge for the bees to eat something that doesn't make them sick or
[48:55.260 --> 49:00.620]  kill them don't eat that pollen don't eat that corn or don't eat those other
[49:00.620 --> 49:05.900]  crops that'll kill the bee because it does it kills the bugs and they argue
[49:05.900 --> 49:09.500]  with this bacteria and also some other companies have some fungus variant
[49:09.500 --> 49:13.900]  producing ones that well you know this fungus or the toxin put off by the
[49:13.900 --> 49:18.900]  bacteria or the fungus with different types you know it it's it's already in
[49:18.900 --> 49:24.900]  there yeah at 500 a thousand some cases 2,000 plus times stronger and you've got
[49:24.900 --> 49:29.180]  all these gut disorders and all this Crohn's popping up and and an irritable
[49:29.180 --> 49:33.180]  bowel I mean it's just everywhere all these health problems exploding studies
[49:33.180 --> 49:38.020]  linking it to this not in humans because they never allow that in Monsanto
[49:38.020 --> 49:45.460]  and others fight so there won't be human trials what you've got here in this
[49:45.460 --> 49:50.820]  whole situation is the thousands of studies with guinea pigs rats mice just
[49:50.820 --> 49:57.220]  type it into a search engine BT corn cause total sterility in three
[49:57.220 --> 50:04.420]  generations of rats or guinea pigs or BT corn linked to organ failure I mean
[50:04.420 --> 50:08.740]  just read it oh really you feed it to a rat and you test upon rats because that's
[50:08.740 --> 50:13.500]  similar metabolism to a human they test them on pigs as well and it's killing
[50:13.500 --> 50:17.220]  them but let's let the humans eat it and say it's fine and then Aaron ran in
[50:17.220 --> 50:19.580]  here during the break that's what distracted me I'm not mad that he did
[50:19.580 --> 50:23.380]  he's like we found it we found it that's you were right you know Bill Gates's dad
[50:23.380 --> 50:26.900]  had a bland parenthood here he is in a eugenics group and here he is funding
[50:26.900 --> 50:31.300]  the first you know GMO trials that were then bought by Monsanto and it's a
[50:31.300 --> 50:36.340]  program to reduce fertility here's these other documents and he's like more
[50:36.340 --> 50:39.540]  proof of it and I understand it's like we're in a cop shop going more proof of
[50:39.540 --> 50:43.580]  their criminal action and I'm just like being hit from every angle and I mean
[50:43.580 --> 50:46.540]  it's just like how do you stop them how do you how do you even deal with it and
[50:46.540 --> 50:50.380]  Bill Gates is prancing around you know what they're saying anyone's to reduce
[50:50.380 --> 50:53.860]  population he's got some corny once you eat and he's the biggest owner now in
[50:53.860 --> 50:58.140]  Monsanto I mean I've just reached total twilight zone level here the general
[50:58.140 --> 51:01.380]  public's like you're back if you don't like organ failure a little over a year
[51:01.380 --> 51:05.860]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[51:05.860 --> 51:09.820]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[51:09.820 --> 51:13.860]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[51:13.860 --> 51:17.860]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[51:17.860 --> 51:22.620]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[51:22.620 --> 51:26.980]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched down the best
[51:26.980 --> 51:31.700]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young Jeviti the young
[51:31.700 --> 51:35.860]  Jeviti products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once
[51:35.860 --> 51:41.380]  you've got that you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied I've lost 37 pounds

[56:45.460 --> 56:48.620]  they sit there with a straight face going you're supposed to plant corn for
[56:48.620 --> 56:52.780]  the insects so they don't all die all your farmers are doing is planting our
[56:52.780 --> 56:57.900]  corn you bought from us and it's causing too many the insects to die and
[56:57.900 --> 57:03.060]  too many of them to get an immunity to the poison it's just hidden in plain
[57:03.060 --> 57:08.380]  view those dirty thymers planting Monsanto are planting the refuge for

[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.900]  years later now and don't say al-Qaeda was working for him on 9-11 even though
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.740]  there's evidence you're still not supposed to talk like that yeah I'm

[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:19.140]  and don't like people openly saying they're gonna modify food to covertly

[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:30.940]  prance around laughing about it and I try to tell bureaucrats and people when I

[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.580]  just laugh at me they're being killed by it too but still funny I mean look at
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.820]  this Washington Post article you think they were talking about how the farmers
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.660]  are bad here and and then oh yeah you know that they need to have a refuge so
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:48.180]  the so the bugs don't die eating this stuff and then it goes on admit the seed
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.820]  companies are surveilling their farmers see now farming is about being surveilled
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.260]  like you're a criminal seed companies use sales data to identify farmers who may
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.220]  not have purchased enough seed for a refuge oh yeah they have to go here
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:04.940]  buying our GMO seed that kills the bugs but you're gonna humans are gonna eat it
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.900]  now you got to have that other seed for the buggies and then oh we're
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:14.580]  surveilling you and you didn't have a refuge of the stuff that doesn't kill
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:24.720]  the bugs can I have the stuff the bugs are getting oh I'm an extremist and I
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.540]  said Washington Post this is in the Washington Post sexy from Bloomberg so
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.700]  many of these news agencies now it's all mixed together it's seed companies use
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.020]  sales data to identify farmers who may not have purchased enough seed for
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:41.340]  refuge said Nick Storer global science policy leader for Dow Chemical Co
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.900]  another maker of modified seeds the whole purpose of doing that was to try
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:51.020]  to increase the frequency with which we identified non-compliant growers Storer
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:59.900]  said in an interview farmers who violate the requirements are now revisited at
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:04.820]  least twice over five years so you get the EPA visits because the government
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:11.100]  pushes and stuff that's like a bio weapon on you not food and because it's so
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:15.380]  deadly the environment you've got to have emergency refuge for the other
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:25.700]  buggies see because this is for you not for them this is for you not for them
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:30.740]  farmers who violate the requirements are now revisited at least twice over five

[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:48.820]  technology that infects all the other species around it oh yes we now know
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:53.180]  that animals are breathing the GMO pollen and it's going into the DNA the
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:59.220]  major studies out on that it's jumping into other plant species and it's jumping
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:05.380]  into the same family to an even greater extent maize soybean corn sugar beet
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:13.140]  whatever the case is and I just watched the cancer rates and then all the other
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:18.620]  diseases accelerate as they put poison in our water and food and and it's just

[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:22.940]  mind
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:28.940]  okay for the rest of the hour we are going to be joined by James Wesley Rawls
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.940]  we're carrying his new novel which is a sequel to the best-selling book
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.340]  Patriots that's like set with real Patriots that have marked like Mark
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.580]  Kornke and others in it but in the future globalist economic collapse
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.980]  scenario with UN troops rolling around whenever that book came out I don't know
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:52.740]  over a decade ago I remember people going that's ridiculous now officially the
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:59.900]  government and the media and everybody are pushing all these different plans
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:06.140]  and programs to to have foreign troops here they've said during emergencies
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:10.180]  during economic collapse will have Mexican and Canadian troops dealing with
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:14.620]  the American terrorist that's associated press it was a headline a few years ago
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:19.220]  top generals questioned by Congress over foreign troop plan US troops for the
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.060]  Olympics were up in Canada patrolling the streets they had Mexican troops in
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.980]  the US during Katrina CBS News all of this is part of an acclimation process
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.540]  and I've been to urban warfare drills in 98 99 2000 and more since then where
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.340]  they have foreign troops training to take on Americans last year I sent Rob
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:40.460]  dude to Chicago and we have footage of them training for gun confiscation
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:46.900]  checkpoints with Czech Republic Polish Ukrainian troops and then with American
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:52.300]  roleplayers and then practicing putting people in the sports stadium now he has
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.700]  another book that's been a best-seller on the New York Times top 10 it's been as
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:01.020]  high as number three how to survive the end of the world as we know it in fact
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.340]  we should probably carry that book too I haven't read that when I've read
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.420]  survivors but the issue is how did James Wesley Rawls I think I know the
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.180]  answer he's into liberty into freedom never talked to him before but I'm
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.620]  guessing he's a patriot and to be right you know writes a book about collapse
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.140]  because of economics and you know foreign troops and everything and it's
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:22.060]  got you know old-line Patriot talk show hosts you know mentioned in the book it
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.180]  shows he's got a great understanding of things but again the book survivors
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.460]  available everywhere but also available at info wars dot com if you want to
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:33.340]  support us as well Weldon Henson read it the publisher sent us a copy and so
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.820]  this is a really good book you ought to read it and I read it and I think it's
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:42.340]  even better than the Patriots but we've got him on with us to really get some of
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:48.900]  the novel but also into what he means by the end of the world as we know it now
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.060]  the IMF and World Bank say this is a controlled designed implosion to bring
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.580]  in the world government and as you know Ban Ki-moon called for global government
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:03.220]  last week the White House economic council head called for a global tax we
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:08.060]  played yesterday on C-SPAN it's all out in the open but the ADL Southern
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.780]  Poverty Law Center reports say if you're talking about this you're a lying
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:16.260]  crazy terrorist basically and if you like Ron Paul you're bad as well and if
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:21.380]  you like Alex Jones you're bad as well so James Wesley Rawls joins us to talk
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.860]  about this we have the demonization with shows like you know preppers one of
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.980]  the prepper guys refused a procedure by a doctor that that's an article in
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:34.300]  info wars dot com had all his guns taken they said by not taking the procedure
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.780]  it means you don't care about your life prima facie evidence that you're
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:42.460]  suicidal the guys like no I just don't want tubes stuck in my chest and so he's
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.900]  home healthy and they just say no guns ever again no judge no jury you got to
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.780]  know most your doctors are spying on you now that's on record most the preachers
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:55.300]  are we're living in the transition from a free republic into the Soviet
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:59.460]  globalist model and I say Soviet because that's what they call it it's not even
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.940]  communist it's a corporate fascist system through Soviet boards Soviet just
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.980]  means boards or committees gen 21 that's what the UN model is the EU's bit based
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:14.620]  on the Soviet model the bankers gave the commies and our government funded the
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:19.380]  commies in 1917 on record now here's the article prepper declared mentally
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.660]  defective put on FBI list there's that report David Sardi barred from purchasing
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.660]  guns after doctor reported him to authorities now we go now to James
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:33.740]  Wesley Rawls James I'm kind of ranting here as I introduce you but what woke
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.820]  you up what makes you tick who is the man best-selling author James Wesley
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.020]  Rawls and you know how did you write a book I didn't check today was it a
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:48.060]  decade ago or so Patriots that literally reads now like a history book
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:52.860]  because so much of it has happened well Alex I'm a former army intelligence
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:57.620]  officer and I actually roast wrote the first draft of Patriots back in the
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:04.460]  winter of 1990 1991 and it's a classic socio-economic collapse novel about
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:11.260]  hyperinflation followed by a total collapse of society where the power
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.020]  grid goes down and the mate there's massive depopulation of the major
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:23.740]  cities and lawlessness all over the country I wrote that because I see it's
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:28.500]  actually a possibility we live in a very fragile society with very long chains
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:35.300]  of supply great dependence on technology tremendous dependence upon power grid
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.660]  and if the grid were to go down for any number of different reasons all bets are
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:46.660]  off Wow so again it's been so many years since I read that first book and I'm
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:50.100]  one of these talk shows that just gets somebody on and does my does my research
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.460]  live but but I'd forgotten yeah you were army intelligence so even back in
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.980]  1991 you recognize this new world order threat and you wrote about it how did
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.500]  you discover this I mean did you discover this when you were an army
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:06.660]  intelligence or what woke you up yes what woke me up but well to begin with my
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:12.060]  upbringing was preparedness minded from the very beginning because I came from a
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:18.060]  pioneer family that had come out west I covered wagon in the 1850s so I still
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:23.740]  had that spirit alive in me I also grew up in Livermore, California the son of a
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.340]  physicist that worked at Lawrence laboratories and Livermore has one of
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.300]  the highest per capita number of bomb shelters in the country there's a very
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:38.100]  high recognition of the nuclear threat there because they design nuclear
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:43.780]  weapons in Livermore so between the two of those I was already pretty well
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:49.100]  primed for the preparedness mindset and then going into army intelligence I was
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:54.700]  involved with among other things some country studies looking at the fragility
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:59.540]  of some nations and I came to realize that our own nation was even more
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:05.020]  fragile because we're we have a higher level of technological dependence we have
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:11.140]  tremendously long chains of supply and in recent years we've adopted the
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:17.260]  Japanese Kanban school of inventory control what they call just in time
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:23.940]  inventory or lean inventory control where there's very little in the pipeline at
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:28.900]  any given time and what you see on your super supermarket shelves is basically
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.740]  all they have there is no longer a back room with extra stock what you see is
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:39.460]  what you get and if the inventory control system breaks down for any number of
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:42.900]  different reasons whether it's a transportation problem or communications
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:50.980]  problem just an internet problem you're out of luck so we're three days from no
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.380]  food on the shelves in the studies I've seen from the army which I guess you were
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:16:00.300]  probably involved in you can elaborate ten days from anarchy 15 days from
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:06.140]  cannibalism about that yeah in fact there's a bit of cannibalism described
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:12.500]  in in my first novel and when you come right down to a human nature is pretty
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:19.380]  ugly if you remove the trappings of modern society and law and order there's
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:23.740]  just a thin veneer of civilization and when you peel that back what's
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:29.100]  underneath is kind of ugly it's it doesn't take long at all before people
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:34.300]  revert to savagery and that's one of the central themes of all of my writings so
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.020]  that's why I encourage people to move to lightly populated areas and to team up
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:45.140]  with like-minded folks and to stock up in depth well you know the media the
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:48.700]  controlled corporate media and the globalist media the occupied America
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:52.620]  media they always demonize being prepared but as you were pointing out
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:58.220]  government itself and people that work in intelligence are obsessed with it now
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.180]  more than ever and all the big money I know is leaving the United States racing
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:09.020]  to mountainous areas racing to islands and even the news is reporting that but
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.260]  we're still bad for being concerned right in fact our government is
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.300]  essentially schizophrenic on the issue of preparedness because on the one hand
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:25.740]  you've got the Department of Homeland Security labeling people who prepare as
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:30.820]  potential terrorists at the same time you've got FEMA encouraging everyone to
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:37.860]  stock up so who do you listen to oh man now I mean you talk about the new world
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.780]  order in your book that you're now seeing he wrote 20 years ago I guess I'd
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:45.540]  read it when it was republished you know 11 years ago or so now world
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.420]  government is out in the open I mean you just type world government into a
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:55.260]  search engine it's being announced by them every day by the very mega banks how
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.300]  did you wake up to the whole global government system what's your political
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:05.500]  views on that well I've always been a conservative I was a John Berger in the
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:10.500]  1970s late 70s is when I got involved with the John Berge society and woke up
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:16.820]  to the whole globalist threat and I still although I don't have a a really
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:24.180]  strongly conspiratorial view like some others I do believe that we do have the
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:31.100]  threat of global governance and the natural reaction of governments when
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:38.780]  there is a power vacuum or disruption is to clamp the lid down and institute total
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:44.180]  government that's the very nature of government and if there are risks out
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:50.820]  there that would cause major disruption people have to be prepared not just for
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.620]  defending their own family home and providing for themselves but also the
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:00.340]  prospect of waking up some morning and finding yourself under martial law and
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.020]  the other thing that I stress in my writings is it's only the people that
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.100]  are well prepared that are going to be in a position to do anything about it
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.620]  everybody else is going to be worried about where they're going to find their
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:17.180]  next meal so by stocking up you can be part of the solution well James people
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:21.060]  ask me Alex do you really believe all this you're talking about I've moved to
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:26.460]  the country I got an eight-foot stone wall and around the back of the farm
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:31.900]  property I got a big game fence with barbed wire on it and I've got food and
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.460]  I got guns and if stuff does start unraveling and unfolding anybody trying
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:40.820]  to take what I got is dead and people like who that's radical no that's just
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.180]  normal human nature you talk about frontiers that's you know where I come
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:49.180]  from most Americans I feel sorry you know I have that in their roots but but
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:55.460]  most Americans now 90% as you know live in cities and are not self-sufficient of
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:59.820]  the 10% that are rural I've seen numbers of only half being sufficient that's
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:04.140]  right and this is totally creepy because I've seen university numbers of 7
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.380]  million dying of illnesses or malnutrition associated with the
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:16.140]  depression 7 million in a decade and that 90% were rural then or about 87% and
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.740]  about half of those were self-sufficient so we're looking at 45% that
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.660]  were self-sufficient then 7 million dead I'm imagine what's gonna happen this
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.100]  time and that's with the power grid staying up if again if the power grid
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:35.060]  goes down all bets are off if you look back at the depression of the 1930s you
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:39.780]  had a lot more people that were more closely connected to the land now we've
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:45.700]  got two percent of the population feeding the other 98% literally so if we
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:50.540]  were to see a grid down societal collapse most people don't have country
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:55.060]  cousins that they can depend on anymore and the chains of supply are so long
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:21:01.420]  that we could see a massive depopulation and if this were to happen say in the
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:06.580]  fall of the year with power grid going down if the grid didn't come back up
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:11.340]  quickly by the next spring we could see half of the population in the United
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:18.460]  States dead I want to go over those numbers with you bestselling author of
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.780]  fiction and nonfiction books James Wesley Rawls is our guest survivors a novel
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:26.700]  of the coming collapse is available at info wars.com and then this book that
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.180]  we've got to carry James Wesley Rawls how to survive into the world as we know it
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:35.780]  available everywhere tactics techniques and technologies for uncertain times but
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:39.380]  I think more than just having food and guns and water you need to be around like
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:44.780]  you said neighbors that are ready as well for mutual defense because I mean
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:49.020]  we're talking about I'm sure you've seen the Rockefeller Foundation award-winning
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:55.780]  a movie based on the novel The Road which for my study is very accurate with
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:01.380]  how humans would act within 15 days yeah it's kind of a bleak outlook but yes that
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:04.780]  that is human nature at its core when you come right down to it and that's why
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.940]  it is important that people team up you need to form a neighborhood watch on
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:14.180]  steroids you need to team up with your neighbors like-minded friends fellow
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:19.860]  congregants of your church and plan figure out what skills exist within your
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:24.180]  group cross train each other and for any skills that are missing people need to go
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:27.740]  out and get that training and then come back and cross train everyone else they
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:32.900]  need to go to places like gun site and front site for firearms courses and come
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.820]  back and cross train everyone else you need to have at least one member of
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:42.340]  your very local community I'm talking a cluster of houses that is trained as an
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:48.260]  EMT or paramedic and that's as simple as not this joining a local volunteer
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.020]  fire department and they'll give you the training free yeah even swim teams give
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.820]  you that I mean you can go to the fire department there to join usually and
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:02.620]  they'll give free free clinics on it sure yeah they do CPR classes and
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.660]  everything else it's important that people get the training to go with all
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:11.820]  this gear I I try to stress in my blog I do a blog every day called survival
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:17.300]  blog calm I try to run stress in my writings every day that you need more
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:20.620]  than just the gear you need the training that goes with it because owning a gun
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.700]  doesn't make you a shooter anymore than owning a surfboard makes you a surfer
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:30.940]  there's a lot of skill that you need to acquire and those are perishable skills
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:35.100]  well that's a good point about perishable I when I was 12 years old
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:39.380]  literally could shoot to the same hole at 200 yards with a rifle now I'm lucky
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.980]  at 200 yards be able to hit bullseye just because I don't have time to be
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.580]  shooting I've only shoot three four times a year now and you're right we've all
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:50.820]  need to constantly stay ready and also be mentally prepared you know think
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:54.860]  through scenarios and and have defaults of what you're gonna do in certain
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.500]  scenarios so you're not thinking what am I gonna do as guys come climbing over
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:03.580]  your fence you're gonna have to open up on them if you're thinking through those
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:08.900]  problems as they happen you're behind the power curve you really need to plan
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:14.900]  ahead and train prepare lay in the logistics and in terms of things like
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.620]  retreat security you need to buy things like night vision here and buy a
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:22.660]  Dakota alert which is a infrared intrusion detection system you need to
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:27.140]  do that now because if you wait until after a societal collapse you think
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:31.020]  you'll be able to buy a starlight scope on the open market it would cost a king's
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:36.020]  ransom well there was an article yesterday I meant to get to guys will you
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:40.940]  print it I think the headlines like 40 things that Detroit's collapse tells us
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:47.140]  about our collapse because I want to go over some of those with our guests
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.860]  because if you look at Detroit they had what a 79 percent increase in just the
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:55.940]  last year and justifiable homicides I mean this this is already happening in
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:01.300]  major US cities yeah if you look at Detroit as kind of a bellweather for
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:05.500]  at least urban areas that's that's kind of indicative of the path that our
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:09.140]  nation is on and that's yet another reason why I recommend moving to
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:13.700]  slightly populated farming areas you want to be away from the metropolitan
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:17.380]  areas because that's where 99% of the problems are gonna exist there won't be
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:23.340]  rioting in small towns there won't be looting in small towns to speak of even
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:28.500]  if the grid goes down but if you're in an urban or even a suburban area watch
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.700]  out because you're kind of at ground zero well don't the studies show though
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.460]  that because most people even in rural areas aren't sufficient that within three
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:41.700]  to four to six months there will start being criminal groups but sometimes
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:46.700]  there will be but the chances of them coming to your door are statistically
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:51.940]  so much smaller out the country then you know if you stay in the city or you
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:58.940]  stay in the suburbs you're just another another notch on the food chain at
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:04.340]  least in the countryside you'll have some delay you'll have some time to team up
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.980]  with neighbors establish good security before trouble comes your way in the
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.420]  big city the trouble will be there within two or three days you won't have
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:19.860]  time to organize and prepare yeah this is from the coming collapse blog and it's
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:25.340]  got the numbers and links to the Detroit Free Press and others but when the
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.380]  economy falls apart desperate people will do desperate things and many
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:32.340]  homeowners will fight back justifiable homicide in Detroit rose a staggering
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:38.140]  79% just last year alone and now in some of these areas the police are saying
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.220]  get guns protect yourself but I've seen other areas where they're saying don't
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:45.100]  get guns yeah we're laying half the cops off the other half are just gonna do
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.740]  revenue generating so you're on your own we're not gonna respond to these 35
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.500]  crimes in Oakland but don't you dare have a gun and defend yourself what an
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:57.860]  immoral sick position of the liberals yeah that's unfortunately that's the
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.220]  whole status mindset which is they they make everyone dependent but then they
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:06.540]  don't have any guarantee of government services you look at places like
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:13.380]  Detroit the response times even for violent crimes that stretch out into
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:20.300]  hours well if you if you if you have to wait hours before the police arrive all
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:24.580]  they're basically good for is filling out paperwork and toting off the body
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:29.220]  bags you have to depend on yourself it's essentially yo-yo time you're on your
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:37.700]  own now obviously if a solar flare hit us directly that could blow out a lot of
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.580]  the power grid we've gone over the transformers and the rest of it there
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:44.380]  could be a nuclear war they're trying to start war with Iran right now Russia and
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:48.700]  China are threatening but for me it's just the economic collapse that if we
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:53.420]  did have another depression that that I mean we're already seeing a lot of stuff
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.940]  unravel and we saw the government couldn't take care of Katrina I mean are
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.860]  you saying this collapse is going to happen or the probabilities gone up what
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:04.100]  in you I can't say that I can't say with any certainty all I can say is that
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:08.660]  there is a risk and if if I was an actuarial accountant in the insurance
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:13.980]  business I wouldn't be I wouldn't want to be issuing policies for governments
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:18.860]  how's that now you mentioned that the power grid going down he mentioned EMP
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.940]  and you mentioned solar flares but there's one other way the power grid could
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:25.860]  go down that most people don't realize and that is a malicious hacker attack
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:30.420]  could get into the SCADA software which is the system control and data
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:36.140]  acquisition software that controls the power grid all the way from the power
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:41.860]  plants and the hydroelectric dams all the way to your home power meter there's
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:47.980]  SCADA software all the way in between now and that's at risk so yes if the grid
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:55.500]  goes down we're in big big trouble well couldn't something like Stuxnet travel
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:58.580]  around the world and come back and do the same thing because I mean they've
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.940]  said they want to have the government take over the internet to protect power
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:06.460]  grids but doesn't that stuff have to be injected directly in you know to the
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:11.820]  computers at a power plant well the thing is is that when all the SCADA
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:16.940]  software was originally designed in the 1960s the 1970s it was before the days
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:22.820]  of hacking so they left huge vulnerabilities in the code and now in
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:28.700]  recent times they've created other portals into all of these software
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:34.340]  systems so that now someone could literally just dial in or log in by any
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:40.060]  IP address and go about their nefarious business incredible James Wesley Rawls
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:46.460]  stay there more with him straight ahead because remember 20 years ago he wrote
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:51.500]  about what's now happening I want to know how he knew we're on the march the
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:58.700]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.940]  you've heard Alex explaining how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:08.100]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:11.900]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:15.700]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:20.140]  body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:24.540]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.860]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:33.740]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:40.900]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:44.780]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the

[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:17.980]  that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:33.860]  Wesley Rawls back on with us Friday for an extended interview on info wars
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:38.540]  nightly news and we're gonna get more into solutions and ways from his research
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:42.620]  he thinks that you can protect yourself and prepare for this if there's a 10%
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:47.500]  chance society is going to collapse then we should all get prepared and I gotta
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:51.700]  say it's 50-50 right now and governments are saying that the head of the IMF
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.820]  said that last month I mean they're talking about a road warrior scenario
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:34:00.780]  we'll be talking to our guests more in just a moment and then if we avert all
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.380]  these new wars and this depression then it's like oh it didn't happen well
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:10.620]  that's what we hope we hope that that's the case speaking of preparedness I put
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:14.820]  my money where my mouth is I've lost now almost 40 pounds you can you can see it
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:20.820]  you're watching on prisonplanet.tv in just about two and a half months I have
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:25.140]  moved to the country I have built a fence and a wall and I've started getting
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:29.300]  my firearms out trying to practice with them more I got my storeable food I got
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:34.260]  my rifle shotgun four-wheel drive I got my dogs and I live back in the woods you
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:40.860]  see so all the kids the dogs in me and the only thing I've done is gotten to
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:43.740]  know my neighbors because I just am super private but I need to get to know
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:47.900]  them but it is nice to hear firearms going off every weekend some of them
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.780]  fully auto so sounds like I've got some good neighbors sounds like World War
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.540]  3 actually next door but I've got a character living next door I haven't
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:00.060]  met him but everybody knows who he is if I said his name sounds like the
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.780]  terminators next door but sounds like they've got artillery simulators going
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:10.940]  off too but I live out in the country now not not far enough you know it takes
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:14.900]  me an extra 25 30 minutes to get to work now just because I do live outside
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:21.380]  town but side issue health wise I've I've learned that if you take a good
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:27.940]  vitamin mineral powder supplement that's from organic sources that you can
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:32.020]  actually absorb then you're not as hungry because you're not eating empty
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:35.220]  calories trying to get the nutrients and the best products I found and when
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:38.340]  you purchase them from us it also supports the broadcast is info wars
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:41.140]  team.com and that's where the best well all the
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:45.940]  longevity products are there but beyond Tangierine it's got the mighty 90

[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.140]  gotten this guy on it's so great to have him here with us one of the leading
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:33.420]  survivalist expert writers out there but I know you don't like to toot your horn
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:38.180]  but let's go back then to Patriots 1991 you're writing it how did you write
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:45.500]  about global governance coming via economic collapse because reading you
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:50.340]  know the Patriot now the sequel survivors or Patriots there it is I mean
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:54.860]  how did you know in 1991 and then I was asking you you believe in the global
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:57.860]  government threat but not that it's conspiratorial and you were making the
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:01.780]  point that no it's just a system it's not that it's in total control and under
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:05.860]  every rock and I agree with you it's that it's from the top the compartmentalized
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.340]  system they're trying to get control they're trying to establish global
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.660]  government it's not here yet we can still reverse it please please get into
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:18.540]  how you knew all this how you broke it down and then all the other facets of
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:23.020]  of how you see these threats unfolding including the like where they try to
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.260]  crash the economy we're saying during the break and then that backfires on them
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:32.380]  please continue well I just see it as a logical progression we live in a very
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:42.500]  fragile society we have a system where our our constitutional government is at
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:47.740]  at risk anytime there's a major disruption there's always the possibility
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:53.180]  that someone may try to step in to quote restore order unquote and you end up
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.140]  with a government that's far far worse that you end up with total government
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:02.740]  and I think people need to be vigilant and if they're they're vigilant and
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:07.660]  well-prepared they'll be in a position to hopefully speak up and do something
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:12.100]  about it in a worst case we could end up with a situation like I described in
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:16.940]  Patriots and in survivors we ended up with with a power vacuum that's created
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:24.180]  by economic collapse and a foreign occupying army comes in to restore order
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:31.260]  and then you end up as I described in Patriots in a war of resistance a a
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:34.820]  guerrilla warfare situation where you're trying to restore constitutional
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:38.780]  government God forbid we ever get to that point but I think people need to be
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.340]  prepared even for that all right let me stop you there you know my frustration
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.460]  with great guests like yourself that are telling the truth is that everything
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:50.740]  you say there's 50 points I want to make backing you up but people can pull this
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:57.380]  up the Banff Canada 2006 North American Union SPP meeting judicial watch suit
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:00.780]  got thousands of pages of documents are right about a thousand pages actually
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:05.060]  and in there the first thing they say in the meeting is this is my film in-game
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:10.220]  screenshots of it a keep this secret we're gonna have North American Union
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:15.420]  integration by stealth we're gonna use military crises drug crises flu crises
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:20.300]  economic crises to merge the governments and now they're already doing
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:24.140]  that with cross regions with the drug war and that's being announced and they
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:28.740]  say we'll use each other's foreign troops in each other's nations and now it
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.060]  was always you know oh I was at a military base and the general said get
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:35.260]  ready for the new world order to now we have the videos we have the news
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:39.140]  articles where you know generals questioned by Congress about plan for I
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:44.020]  for troops during crises or Mexican troops to be used to fight US terrorist
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:51.340]  or in L. E. O. 9 FEMA press release 14 countries working with FEMA to drill on
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:55.180]  suppressing uprisings John War Defense Authorization Act saying it's to
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:58.940]  suppress the states the governor's councils the rural councils right out
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:03.060]  of red dawn the tattletale squads the clergy response teams I mean they're
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:08.860]  setting up for a suppression of civil war and it looks like the globalist want
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:12.780]  to have that civil war with the American people and they're gonna call us the
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:18.060]  terrorist when they come arrest Alex Jones or John Wesley Rawls or James
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.660]  Wesley Rawls when they do things like this well we're just the terrorist and
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:27.860]  I mean they're the ones gearing up for it your comments on that rant well it
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:34.140]  very well could be a big setup I think though that the status and globalists
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:41.140]  may be setting up a situation that's gonna get out of their control if they
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:50.020]  attempt to orchestrate a stock market collapse or a banking panic or or
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:55.140]  something along that line it could very well get away from them they could end
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:58.380]  up with a situation where the rioting and looting gets completely out of
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:04.900]  control government agencies are unable or unwilling to respond you could end up
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:09.380]  with individual police officers environment afraid to literally leave
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.260]  their home leave their families unprotected so they won't show up for
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:16.340]  work that was what I described in Patriots that happened in New Orleans
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:22.180]  yeah and you also ended up with police officers looting literally I mean they
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:26.100]  were caught on let's face it our police are not as moral as they were and the
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:30.620]  studies are there 50 years ago in the old days people were not even they were
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:34.020]  such tough guys but it's like hey this is combat we're going in nowadays the
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:37.740]  whole culture at these mass shootings everywhere is sick there for four hours
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.820]  while you're told what to do by the feds so now there's like this culture of
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:48.820]  being paralyzed well we we could see a situation where whether it's orchestrated
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:53.060]  or not we could have a a societal collapse we could have things come
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:57.860]  completely unraveled again the lynchkin is the power grid things come unraveled
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:03.420]  to the point where even someone who was hoping to be the one to come in and
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:09.140]  restore order and instituted their brand of government the situation could get
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:16.500]  completely out of their control and we could see a complete unraveling where
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:22.460]  the cities become uninhabitable once the the power grid goes down there's
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:28.260]  about a two or three days supply of water in most civic water systems that
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:32.900]  gravity fed from tanks but there are very few cities that have end-to-end
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:37.820]  gravity-fed water they're all almost all dependent upon the power grid but the
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:42.500]  grid goes down the water stops flowing the toilets stop flushing and then
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:47.420]  suddenly you have a huge public health crisis on your hands the cities become
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:53.220]  uninhabitable commerce comes to a halt you have this mass exodus of people from
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:57.700]  the big cities what I refer to as the Golden Horde pouring out of the cities
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:07.940]  and it's a situation where it's difficult to get the apple court cart back on
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:13.100]  its wheels yes so much time has gone into building the infrastructure that it
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:17.140]  works really well but it's super delicate and expanding on that it was like
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:20.340]  five years ago a hurricane hit Texas I forget which one they hit all the time
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:26.180]  in Houston flooded with about five feet of water and we have a ranch in in
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:30.780]  East Texas family land about 130 miles north of Houston it's about a hundred
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:35.700]  miles south of Dallas well Buffalo Texas is outside Buffalo Texas and Fairfield
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:40.900]  and I just happened to be there hunting and doing some shooting when the
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.620]  hurricane hit and I thought well I'll just go have fun and go hunting there in
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:46.140]  the hurricane I don't care because it was just rainstorm at the time it hit
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:51.660]  there and I was in the small towns they were reporting on robberies people
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:55.700]  getting shot and there were hordes of people and I'm saying it's illegal
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.100]  aliens that was the main group because there's a lot something like five
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:02.820]  million legal aliens in the in the in the Houston area just everywhere the
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:06.380]  illegal aliens were driven out because that's all I saw and we're and we're
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:10.180]  robbing and stuff because because they were pushed into the countryside and
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:13.780]  they were getting shot and stuff and the news didn't report on it but I saw
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:17.180]  blurbs I mean they were getting shot and and there were also some other folks
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.460]  running around but it was mainly the illegals because they were driven out of
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.940]  the city I mean can you so that scenario I saw that happen same thing
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:29.100]  happened in New Orleans in the in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina there
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:33.860]  were refugees as far as four or five hundred miles away and they created they
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:38.780]  brought this whole wake of a high crime rate with them and that was just one
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:45.620]  localized area essentially one big city that was badly affected imagine if
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:50.300]  every major city in the country simultaneously went through a major
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.100]  economic collapse and power grid failure there's actually three power grids in
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:59.180]  the country a western grid an eastern grid and the Texas grid if the power
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:05.460]  grids go down we could see major rioting and looting going on in virtually
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:12.380]  every urban area and yes there will be some pretty large ripple effects that
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:18.820]  come come from that I just pray that the majority of your listeners team up and
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:25.140]  be ready to hunker down it means having a deep larder being very well stocked up
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:31.060]  very well trained and having you know keeping your radar up basically keeping
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:39.460]  a well an eye on the big picture and being ready to at least rebuild you know
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:44.980]  from the ground up from your local area to reestablish commerce reestablish
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:52.780]  reestablish law and order and I mean constitutional law and order well I know
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:56.700]  that from previous events when things get really bad the police and others
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:47:01.740]  don't show up and I cannot imagine what'll happen if the welfare checks
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:07.620]  didn't show up for a month it would be burning cities and and then what's
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:11.380]  going to happen after the welfare class does burn down the city then there'll
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:17.140]  be even less infrastructure it is going to be hellish yes we could if you look
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:21.420]  at what's going on in Detroit right now for example where you have they're
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:25.100]  actually turning off street lights because the some of the suburbs of
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:30.260]  Detroit can't even afford to run street lights then you end up with this
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:37.220]  cascade of events you end up with a lack of police protection a no response
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:46.180]  from from burglar alarm companies for example and then after people have you
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:51.020]  know cleaned out these abandoned houses then they resort to stripping out the
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:55.620]  copper wiring so they're literally destroying the infrastructure so even
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:00.780]  if the power grid were to come back up you know it the infrastructure be so
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:06.220]  destroyed that it would be months or years or even you know conceivably even
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:11.500]  generations humans without a job who aren't self-sufficient are like locust
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:17.900]  yeah it's a cloud of grasshoppers in essence you're right Alex because
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:22.340]  that's human nature right you know I'm a Christian and I look at the that the
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:28.180]  human heart is desperately wicked at its core and it's only because of the
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:33.300]  restraint of things like Christian faith and the restraint that non-christians
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:39.980]  are under because of civil government that keeps them from acting like locusts
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:49.660]  I just dread seeing a situation where there is a vacuum of restraint where
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:54.620]  there's no control well that's another thing when modern modern morals or lack
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:49:02.100]  thereof we could see a tremendous period of lawlessness let me raise I agree let
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:06.020]  me raise the next point with you what about what we see in every government
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.900]  and and what we've seen in Katrina and other cases where they don't help all
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.780]  the people that are in the Superdome the military comes with the police under
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:18.780]  federal orders to go into five million dollar houses and blows safe doors off
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:23.540]  the wall and take people's guns who were there with generators and food what
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:29.660]  happens when the system comes to commandeer our food and guns what happens
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:33.700]  when the armored vehicle with the police comes down your road to commandeer
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:38.900]  your storable food well statistically the chances of that happening to any one
[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:42.380]  of your listeners is pretty small but it is a it is a risk but people need to
[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:46.780]  have a contingency plan to bug out everybody even if you have the very
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:51.140]  best retreat in North America and you're completely hunkered in your
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:55.420]  hunkered down in your bunker you still need to have a plan B you need to keep
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:50:00.780]  your bug out bag ready and be ready to get out of dodge because you the last

[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:27.300]  wasn't true and I'm so busy on air and doing the nightly news and trying to make
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:33.020]  films and trying to travel and all this stuff that well I'm gonna be honest I
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:38.780]  was planning to visit radio stations all over the country this year and I'm
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:43.300]  gonna go to Dallas to visit an affiliate and speak this Sunday find out more at
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.620]  infowords.com forward slash events for the ticket sell out I was gonna I'm going
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:53.380]  to Orlando for a big 810 where we're number one is to speak to 26 and that
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:56.780]  those tickets are gonna be sold out probably even before the event you want
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:55:02.540]  those it's a side issue I'm pretty much looking at maybe not traveling any
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:07.940]  after that because the collapse is so imminent if it's going to happen and I
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:11.180]  was talking to James I said James when do you think it could happen with the
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:14.740]  whole financial thing and and he gave me his answer and this is a guy who
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:19.940]  predicted this with incredible accuracy 20 years ago and how it would start
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:25.900]  happening and and repeat to me James what you said well Alex I think that
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:32.180]  there's a possibility that we could see a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis in
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:38.020]  the next few months as things come unraveled with the periphery of the EU
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:45.100]  that's the the Greek tragedy as they're referring to it could get out of control
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:52.980]  we could see a banking crisis and a credit collapse that could go global and
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:56:00.500]  if that happens we could see virtually all the Western countries go down like
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:07.660]  dominoes we could see a banking crisis stock market collapses collapse of bond
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:14.300]  markets it could get very very ugly there's a huge number of derivatives in
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:19.420]  play that's a huge imponderable because that derivatives market didn't even
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:25.980]  exist ten years ago now it's measured in the scale of hundreds of trillions of
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:31.380]  dollars notionally in derivatives in play at it on an editing given time and a
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:35.820]  counterparty risk is huge what happens if one of those counterparties is a
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:41.900]  national government and that counterparty goes away it's just
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:52.020]  unfathomable to know what could happen and the risk is tremendous and again the
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:55.780]  head of the IMF said something similar a month or so ago but but they're too good
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:59.620]  at what they're doing they create the crisis on record they sell the fraud
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:04.060]  then they say give us more power give up your sovereignty you're up America and
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:08.940]  we'll fix it but then it only implodes faster they make bigger bonuses but
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:12.700]  they're destroying their own golden goose they're hacking it open greedily
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:17.260]  when it's given them a golden egg every morning they think there's eggs inside I
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:20.940]  think the point you made of that because their own record creating this to
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:25.180]  consolidate power they've bragged about it those memos have been made public by
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:29.180]  Goldman Sachs and others but they're gonna fry things so badly the bankers
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:34.140]  are all running to private islands with their own security teams I mean like
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:38.820]  they want to rule everything so much and have just so many digits in their bank
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:42.340]  accounts that they're going to devalue the value of the digits through their
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:48.060]  sheer greed that is possibility and if you look at the Hegelian dialectic if
[01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:53.940]  that that crisis at the beginning spins out of control they lose the tail end of
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:58.820]  the dialectic don't they there will be no synthesis at the end they'll be lucky
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:05.780]  if they survive they're nuts they're absolutely out of their minds but I
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:08.700]  guess that's what happens with megalomania they just feel invincible
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:13.980]  and it's the and the power grabbing they just can't stop it well when you have
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:18.780]  all the money in the world what is there but power and yes I think you may be
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:24.900]  right the lust for power may be their own undoing and ours as well because when
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:28.540]  this thing falls it's like the Parthenon coming down on your head or the
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:34.220]  ton of bricks back in 60 seconds third hour straight ahead the book survivor

[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.420]  there at the deathbed and you're you know that and they're dying in front of
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.140]  you or hey your buddy's in the hospital he's you know they're in a car wreck he's
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:00.580]  probably not gonna make it you show up five minutes after you're there the
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:05.340]  person dies in front of you or you see a car running a red light and it seems like
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:09.780]  five minutes in those three seconds for it hits you and you know your you know your
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:14.060]  collarbones broken it's like it's like that it's the slow motion of the new
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:18.580]  world order and and the twilight zone this of a world government being
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:22.540]  announced and coffee shop owners being sick all homeland security of somebody
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:29.260]  pays cash and TSA groping women and saying they're not James I mean do you
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:33.140]  not ever pinch yourself at how twilight zoning this has gotten and then think my
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:37.540]  gosh we aren't even into this yet our hand isn't even all the way we've kind
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:41.980]  of stuck our arm in the badger hole and now we hear him growling but he hasn't
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:45.780]  even bitten into our fingers yet you see what I'm saying yeah I see your point
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:53.900]  Alex so we we are kind of been a stage now but I look at that of uncertainty but
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:58.700]  I look at that as a period of opportunity where people can reorder their
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:03.300]  finances you know get out of dollar denominated assets and get into precious
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:09.620]  metals where people can still go to a local gun show and buy a fully capable
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:14.060]  gun with no paperwork if they buy it from a fellow private party in most
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:19.780]  states the window offer of opportunity for preparedness still exists and the
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:25.580]  window of opportunity to warn others with venues like yours still exists I
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:29.700]  think people should take full full advantage of these opportunities while
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:35.100]  they can you know we were talking earlier about what's your chances of
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:39.420]  finding something sophisticated like a night vision scope after everything
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:45.420]  falls apart they're just not going to be available so people should thank God
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:51.100]  that they have those opportunities to get prepared now now is the time to sell
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:57.820]  that flat-panel television and sell your jet ski and and go out and buy
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:04.580]  yourself an M1A buy yourself six months or a years worth of food you have the
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:09.820]  opportunity now grab the bull by the horns because a couple of years from
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:13.060]  now you'll be thanking yourself in fact your children will be thanking you and
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:19.980]  if you don't your children will be asking why didn't you yeah folks go to
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:23.860]  twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones you can shoot see me shooting my
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:29.700]  M1 just awesome firearm incredibly accurate with open sights a lot better
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:35.060]  than you know many 14 with open sights or even even a Winchester 30-30 or
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:39.380]  something like that it is a heavy gun you know we'll talk about your favorite
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:43.260]  type of firearms what's a good really you know light little rifle something like
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:51.180]  a range rifle or something 223 well I'm I barely fond of the M4 or M4 jewelry
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:56.380]  the civilian equivalents but it's not a very potent caliber for anybody who's
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:01.380]  five foot ten or taller they should be carrying a 308 battle rifle 308's got
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:07.020]  more penetration and absolutely a much longer range much more power much more
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:11.580]  sure stopper and it is also a big game rifle so it doubles as a hunting
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:19.340]  rifle 223 isn't even legal to hunt deer in most states yes you know I personally
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:24.500]  have the 308 and in seven mag and lapua and 50 cowl and all that I'm just
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:29.620]  thinking for average folks because I mean I know people wait 308 rules and the
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:35.180]  ones that I like the best right now would be the HK 91 clones because the
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:40.260]  magazines for those are dirt sheet I do like fouls and m1a's but the magazines
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:44.660]  their parts are getting very very expensive yeah I had an HK 91 and then
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:47.980]  it burned up in a house stay there we're gonna come right back yeah I need to get
[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:51.980]  an HK 91 that was an awesome rifle actually had the HK 91 not one of the
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:55.660]  clones but I want to hear your favorite clone of it it's a lot less expensive on
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:05:02.620]  the other side long segment coming up with our guest amazing info hi folks this

[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:05.620]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:09.180]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:13.260]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:16.620]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:21.460]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:25.940]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:30.740]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:23.220]  to survive the end of the world as we know it not the end of the world the
[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:27.260]  end of the world as we know it World War two killed over a hundred million
[02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:31.540]  people including 20 million Germans in that collapse demo side governments
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:36.780]  killed over 260 million people in the last century government is the number
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:40.500]  one cause of death and government collapse is well the biggest for the
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:44.060]  Ukrainians and others all right the 12 minutes we've got left you got the floor
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:48.700]  you want to get into preparedness let's get into the best firearms training
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:53.540]  areas and then basics for people that do live in cities if somebody can get to
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:58.980]  the country you know give us the top ten list of what to do to get ready mr.
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:04.020]  Rawls well I'd say even ahead of firearms it's important to have a good
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:08.900]  quality water filter like either compact catterdine filter or for your house a
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:13.820]  big ceramic filter like a big burky water filtration has to be the very
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:17.620]  topic of this followed by food storage but then yes you have to be ready to
[02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:22.060]  defend what you have and I'm a big believer in 308 battle rifles I like
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:27.860]  the HK 91 clones like that either like the Vector or the PQR 91 are both quite
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:32.860]  good they use original G3 part sets it's just an all built on an American
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:37.460]  receiver because the import restrictions and they the original guns were full
[02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:43.420]  auto these are semi-auto only I think the HK is probably the way to go now the
[02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:48.180]  HK clones because the magazines the spare parts for so many the other 308
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:53.420]  battle rifles have gotten prohibitively expensive spare parts set for an M1a is
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:58.940]  now a six or seven hundred dollar proposition but with an HK clone the
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:03.140]  parts are readily available and the magazines are just plain dirt cheap you
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:07.820]  can get them for as low as a dollar a piece but you go buying magazines for an
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:14.020]  M1a you're talking 20 bucks for a foul you're talking 25 bucks and for an AR 10
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:23.460]  as much as $30 so I like the HK clones in terms of handguns I'm a big believer
[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:29.180]  in 45 automatics and even though I was a real diehard 1911 shooter for many many
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:33.340]  years I finally made the transition and I'm now recommending either the Glock
[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:41.100]  model 21 which is 45 automatic or the Springfield Armory XD 45 both of those
[02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:47.460]  are high capacity 13 round 45 automatic pistols that are very very reliable
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:52.140]  beyond that of course communications equipment first aid gear and all the
[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:56.500]  training to go with it for all this stuff don't think just because you bought
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.980]  the gear that you're ready you really need to train with it practice with it
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:06.460]  know it inside and out get the best quality training you can go get training
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:12.300]  at places like Gunsight in Arizona or Front Sight in Nevada or Thunder Ranch
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:16.340]  in Oregon that there's some really good training out there or work with one of
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:23.980]  the mobile trainers it's really important that you get the training to go
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:32.980]  with this gear I agree with you expanding on that what about the
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:36.700]  component of waking people up in your area so that they're aware of this
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:41.620]  threat even if they laugh at you up front then once things unravel they'll
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:45.060]  start listening to you but then there's the catch 22 if they didn't get ready
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:48.540]  they're not going to be prepared they're going to be demanding you take care of
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:54.580]  them well that's why back a minute people keep a low profile I'm all for
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:57.540]  charity and I think it's really important that people stock up I have a
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:00.780]  three-year supply for my family here at the ranch but I don't look at that as a
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:04.380]  three-year supply for one family I look at that as a one-year supply for three
[02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:09.300]  families be ready to dispense charity but be ready to do so through an
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:12.580]  intermediary so you can keep a low profile you want to dispense that
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:14.860]  charity through your local church for example
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:19.060]  quietly you just get together with church elders and say okay I've got some
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:23.140]  extra food I want to make it available I don't want my name to ever be
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:27.660]  mentioned that's that's my take on charity because you know the old
[02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:33.060]  African saying no good deed goes unpunished yes and the old Japanese
[02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:38.540]  proverb the nail that sticks up gets hammered down so it it's important that
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:45.740]  people do stock up in-depth and be prepared and you know you might want to
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:51.180]  get set up with a good old-fashioned hand cranked mimeograph machine and a
[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:55.220]  couple of good old-fashioned manual typewriters because you may have to make
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:13:00.660]  a local newspaper with no power grid out there to support you but you want to be
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:06.940]  able to to distribute information in your local community and be ready to do
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:12.180]  that at the drop of the hat it's old-school
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:18.060]  what's your gut on different variants of collapses you know running from bad to
[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:20.700]  worse I mean obviously one of the depression and it's gonna get a lot
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:24.700]  worse this is on the beginning but I mean is a 50% chance this stuff's gonna
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:29.180]  unfold 80% I don't like to put percentage chances on things Alex all I can
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:33.660]  say is there's definitely the chance for the worst case which it would be a
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:38.780]  grid-down collapse but there's a very high likelihood that we're at least at
[02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:43.900]  the minimum going to see a decades-long depression that'll start out
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:48.380]  deflationary and then flip over into the nastiest hyperinflation you could
[02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:54.740]  imagine so we're going to get whipsawed by first deflation and then mass
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:14:01.460]  inflation that's that's probably the most likely course of events but that
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:07.300]  outside chance that outlier that lacks lawn is the possibility of a grid-down
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:12.540]  collapse and if you're prepared for the absolute worst case or a grid-down
[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.940]  collapse then you could take anything lesser in stride
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:23.420]  don't let me interrupt continue with how people get ready well I suggest that
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:28.980]  people study up as best they can yeah I like selling copies of my book but
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:33.260]  people can get to my blog and dig in through the archives free of charge
[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:38.020]  again at survivalblog.com there's thousands and thousands of articles
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:42.700]  all available free of charge dig in you have no excuse I mean even if you're
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:47.540]  unemployed and have to use a library computer you can get on the internet and
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:53.020]  dig in and research this stuff stock up to the best of your ability as best as
[02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:58.900]  your budget will allow team up with like-minded people in your church in
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:05.260]  your your neighbors you family members whoever do so quietly you don't want to
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:10.180]  start some enormous local organization then put a target on your back but very
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:15.700]  quietly team up with your neighbors stock up train cross-train with the
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:20.980]  skills that are available within your group that there's probably someone who's
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:26.740]  prior service military they can teach you know small unit tactics and things
[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:31.940]  like NBC you probably have people that are firefighters or former firefighters
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:37.340]  that can teach everything from CPR to you know how to save a house from
[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:45.060]  burning down even the the oldest member of your of your local community that's
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:51.260]  in your group probably knows how to do home canning and all those old-fashioned
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:55.900]  skills and they again can cross-train everyone else it's all a matter of
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:16:01.540]  teamwork and it's a matter that you need to start with prayer sit down and pray
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:06.620]  about it if you feel convicted get prepared study out take full advantage
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:10.860]  of the free resources that are out there and do the very best you can to
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.860]  prepare for your family's
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:20.940]  author of survivors James Wesley Rawls is our guest here for just a few more
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:25.860]  minutes I'll be back with us on the info works nightly news Friday I would
[02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:29.900]  add I've done deep research on the very best gravity-fed stainless steel water
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:35.500]  filters out there and I have chosen the propure as the best for my family the
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:39.260]  others are great as well but it's its heads above and by the way we do sell
[02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:44.620]  those and then also supports our news operation when you buy the propure
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:49.860]  filters at info wars.com that's in the prepare in the section I never even
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:53.980]  talk about those I should more because they're they're amazing they're bigger
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:59.140]  they're better they're impregnated with the little silver propure water filters
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:06.220]  at info wars.com and in the few minutes we've got left obviously Friday we'll
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:12.260]  go through your blog and go through some other areas it's just that you're
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:18.580]  looking at this with the whole depression we're seeing it's good to just
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:22.220]  have storable food in case things continue to collapse because because you'll
[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:27.540]  at least have food. Sure I often like to say that storage food is not just for
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:31.540]  the worst case not just for a disaster it's also for personal disasters what if
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:36.660]  you get laid off you're out of work for six months well food is one item you're
[02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:40.180]  not gonna have to worry about you'll always have food on the table also by
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:45.340]  buying in bulk when you buy your storage food you're eating cheap if you buy
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:48.860]  rice and little one-pound packages at the store you're paying five times the
[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:54.500]  price you would pay if you buy it the 50 pound sacks so buy the six pound sacks
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:59.900]  get some five gallon food grade plastic buckets and bucket it up yourself it's
[02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:04.620]  it's common sense it's a good old-fashioned skill and it saves money. I
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:08.500]  have one last question it is a win-win-win I have one last question for you
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:12.580]  I'm seeing a huge awakening especially in the military and police 70 plus
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:16.420]  percent of donations for all the candidates are to Ron Paul do you see
[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:21.860]  the same awakening that I'm seeing and how does that factor in in one minute?
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:26.780]  Oh absolutely if you look at the growth of the preparedness movement it's
[02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:29.860]  basically just doubling each year ever since Hurricane Katrina it's been
[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:34.300]  doubling and there's a larger and larger percentage of our population that's
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:38.980]  catching on it's waking up and it's getting off their tails and doing
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:44.740]  something about it all I can say is keep it up and spread the word get people
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:52.300]  listening to Patriot Radio get people teamed up locally trained together and
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:56.580]  stock up the best you can that's the bottom line because you really can't do
[02:18:56.580 --> 02:19:02.220]  too much more. And I think that's why God's given us time so the people like
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:05.260]  yourself and myself and many others who did have it put on our heart to get
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.060]  ready for this new world order and get laughed at now it's all happening now
[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:12.460]  people are finally listening because unfortunately we've been proven right

[02:24:55.180 --> 02:25:00.180]  for that don't get me wrong I'm saying this is a big deal what you're hearing
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:07.700]  I mean this it took a blood sweat tears crawling up from nowhere to build this
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:17.260]  platform I've got today from nowhere access television 1995 and it's because
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:20.220]  of the grace of God and it's because of you the supporters over the years
[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:28.340]  spreading the word about our work and I mean go back to people in 1997 I still
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:34.300]  had two jobs two part-time jobs I couldn't get a full-time job I had two
[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:39.940]  part-time jobs and I was doing a radio show by then five nights a week and
[02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:44.100]  getting paid almost nothing and I was doing the access TV show so I was
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:48.940]  working about 16 hours a day then and loving every minute of it but but
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:53.980]  crawling and and scraping just to be able to reach people anyway I could and
[02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:59.900]  then I made that film America destroyed by design and I had a computer phone line
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:03.460]  to my computer or people could call and make credit card orders and then I'd
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:06.460]  have to get my dad a couple nights week to come over because I wasn't good at
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:12.940]  computers to help process the computer orders you know maybe like five six seven
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:18.580]  eight ten a day and then build up enough money to stop doing the jobs so I could
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:22.780]  do media full-time it's funny though we're never good at tooting our horn
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:26.940]  about how big we are and until a few years ago people would still say what's
[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:31.820]  your day job oh I don't know a few years ago I was on about 70 AM and FM stations
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:36.460]  XM number one alternative news site in the world I don't know what my day job is
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:42.140]  what's yours but but but again I I realized in this world it's all bling
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:47.420]  and all that is about people knowing hey this is a success because that's what's
[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:52.580]  respected we should tell you more the new listers are successes where we've
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:56.020]  been right but it is I'm always too busy covering the next thing to tell you how
[02:26:56.020 --> 02:27:00.220]  right we are like I saw the Young Turks website last night I was looking at some
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:04.260]  YouTube videos of course our YouTube channel has many times more views than
[02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:10.740]  they do my radio show dwarfs their XM show we're on XM2 but but that's not
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:14.620]  what irritated me it was the statement of the number one news show on the web
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:19.980]  well that's pure baloney I am the number one news show bar none by by Google
[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:27.100]  analytics Alexa YouTube every every no one is close no one no one is close and
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:32.900]  it's irritating to watch some guy posing as an anti-establishment person he has
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:37.180]  promo videos worth with Al Gore telling him how great he is with current TV with
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:43.540]  like 5,000 viewers at any one time just just total paper tiger facade and in the
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:48.260]  whole site is how their number one and all this in the alternative media when
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:53.020]  they're not alternative media you're on Al Gore the criminals stinking network a
[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:59.740]  disgusting piece of eugenics trash owns oil companies in the rainforest and then
[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:04.820]  is lecturing us about the environment when he's a Larson is crook Al Gore is
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:10.300]  but then I realized that young turd guy I mean it's like the young turds that
[02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:15.580]  that's what it is he is just an idiot probably does think he's a number one
[02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:19.300]  thing again I don't care about being number one except that I am and I'm sick
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:23.980]  of fakes saying they're number one we're number one and then some okay number
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:28.820]  one and then some number one and then some but then I realized he attacked me
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:33.980]  a few years ago for saying CPS is taking children that's communist pedophile
[02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:39.700]  services you know it is child protective services and I was going over how
[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:43.140]  they take people's kids and how they have record numbers of raping them and
[02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:45.900]  all this which is all the just departments own numbers five times more
[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:49.980]  likely than any other group and he made a joke on his show and then the next and
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:53.400]  said I was lying and no such thing as CPS in the next show he goes oh I got a
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:58.620]  lot of emails and calls CPS oh that's what my wife is we just call it
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:05.820]  something else in New York I mean here he is he doesn't even know what CPS is
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:10.100]  and his wife's one I mean that's what I mean just they're just people that don't
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:14.780]  know about the real world are like children they're like children and they
[02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:20.780]  make me want to throw up so maybe I should wear a suit and have a fancy set
[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:24.780]  and be real arrogant and pull up in a limousine and have bling and all this
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:28.540]  stuff just so the sheep will pay attention because I just want to wake
[02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:31.860]  them up to the New World Order eugenics program and poison in their food and
[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:35.660]  water and you know they're having to plant separate crops for the honeybees
[02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:40.580]  of regular non-gmo because it's killing them all you know I'm into the real
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:46.580]  world mega-level stuff and I see this fake alternative media run by Al Gore
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:52.780]  prancing around it makes me want to throw up we're on the march the empires on
[02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:59.020]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:24.780]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:30:24.780 --> 02:30:28.940]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:33.260]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:36.940]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:17.820]  the other scallywags there in the EU dictatorship he's elected out of England
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:22.060]  there to the EU parliament which has no authority upwards of 80% of their laws
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:26.580]  are made by the dictatorship Greece is in flames the heads of the EU admit it's
[02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:31.620]  a takeover he's got breaking news with a member of the Greek government that told
[02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:35.760]  him something that he's gonna break here it'll also give us his take on Ron Paul
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:42.180]  Nigel Farage joins us from UKIP.org from England thank you so much for
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:51.180]  giving us time sir good to have you there with us. There is you've got the floor
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:55.220]  tell us what's going on in Greece. Well as you all know we've got this project
[02:34:55.220 --> 02:34:58.820]  called the Euro where a whole series of different economies were forced together
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:03.140]  and the ambition was that once you had a single currency you would be able to
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:07.500]  forge a new state a new state of Europe regardless of the fact that we all speak
[02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:11.860]  different languages and have different cultures but this was the plan many of
[02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:16.780]  us from the start warned that this simply economically could not work because
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:20.580]  there wasn't actually a government for Europe and what is happening inevitably
[02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:24.140]  is that the North and the South of Europe are dividing into two because of
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:28.860]  their different economies and now what we've got is a European Union which is
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:34.380]  behaving not in an undemocratic way but in a deliberately a democratic way they
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:38.220]  have removed the elected Prime Minister of Greece and replaced him with one of
[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:43.020]  their own puppets and even a country the size of Italy their Prime Minister has
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:48.260]  gone and been replaced by a former EU commissioner and now what's happening is
[02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:53.460]  we're pushing upon these people austerity measures that are driving them into
[02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:56.820]  deep action you know I know that the economy is in the states and in England
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:36:00.460]  haven't been great for the last couple of years if I tell you now that in Greece
[02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:05.620]  we have had five consecutive years of the economy contracting and the fourth
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:09.980]  quarter figures for 2011 have just come through to show that that decline is now
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:15.540]  accelerating it is now running at seven per annum that is the shrinkage in the
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:19.860]  Greek economy and the people are getting to the state where frankly about a
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:23.460]  quarter of the population in Greece can barely afford to feed themselves and
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:29.500]  people are now taking to the streets and on Sunday 80,000 people in Athens
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:34.740]  tried to storm the parliament there were 5,000 police that were put in
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:39.940]  position using CF gas and everything else to stop them and to keep them out of
[02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:45.980]  the parliament but ten major buildings in the center of Athens but this is getting
[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:51.820]  very very serious and my fear my great fear is that if we go on treating Greece
[02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:57.180]  like a colony with its pride strip its democracy gone with it being run by
[02:36:57.180 --> 02:37:01.860]  unelected bureaucrats I think the result of this will be a revolution and I
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:08.860]  really mean that I mean how much more obvious sir does
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:13.860]  it have to get until we realize the the euro is run by these big megabanks and
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:17.540]  admits it's trying to take over people's sovereignty and no matter how many
[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:21.900]  bailouts there are the countries only go deeper into debt and that now these
[02:37:21.900 --> 02:37:25.460]  technocrats are being put in charge over all these countries I mean how much
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:32.220]  will Europe put up with what we talk about the bailouts remember that all
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:36.340]  we're doing is we're giving the Greek government money so that it can pay it
[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:40.020]  back to the bank but stupidly lend them the money in the first place and none of
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:44.260]  this bailout money is actually helping the Greek people at all and despite this
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:49.340]  dramatic fall in living standards the current term that I have to say these
[02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:53.620]  are German dominated terms whether I like it or not that's the truth and the
[02:37:53.620 --> 02:38:00.580]  current terms are a cut of another 22% of all the public sector employees we
[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:05.780]  saw the 80,000 people in Athens that were all going on in every single
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:11.620]  major Greek city and town and and you know you get to a point you get to a
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:17.260]  point where you say you know what else can people do I mean if you can't change
[02:38:17.260 --> 02:38:20.900]  your future through the ballot box violence is the only resort you have
[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:26.180]  left now they deployed 5,000 police as I just mentioned on Sunday the Greek
[02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:30.460]  Prime Minister said we will not tolerate this behavior but there is one
[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:34.700]  encouraging sign that has come out and that is a statement that was issued
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:38.580]  earlier on today by the Greek Police Federation and who said they were
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:44.700]  unhappy about some of the tactics being used so you see the point is this if the
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:49.500]  Greek police force in the end refused to take these orders then there will be a
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:54.420]  revolution that will tear down the very fabric of this whole elected puppet
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:58.580]  government the trouble is Alex that you know when these things happen it tends
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:04.220]  to result in a heavy loss of life as well so I'm not I'm not pessimistic in
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:09.940]  the sense that I I think these plans for you know this sort of new order of
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:14.180]  government where bureaucrats take over from Democrats I think in the end the
[02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:17.540]  people are going to rebel and bring it down but it may happen at a terrible
[02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:23.260]  terrible time now you of course helped found the UK party and now it's the
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:28.660]  fastest-growing party in the UK your ideas of basic liberty pretty much
[02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:35.460]  libertarian you know school of thought basic freedom Magna Carta really 1776
[02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:40.780]  type ideas is now spreading over Europe and when I say you are now the Ron Paul
[02:39:40.780 --> 02:39:48.700]  not just of England or the UK but you're seeing now more and more in in Europe
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:54.220]  itself as a focal point because you boldly have accurately called exactly
[02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:59.580]  what the EU bureaucracy was going to do but now the EU bureaucracy themselves
[02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:03.340]  are saying we've got to have a carbon tax on all aircraft for a global
[02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:07.540]  government new world order now mankind moon is saying global tax world
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:12.460]  government now Germany saying yes no single family dwellings now to be built
[02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:18.820]  under carbon taxes I mean these are real authoritarians I see articles out of
[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:21.980]  England where they're saying the state will take control of all children at
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:27.180]  birth and to keep your children will be probationary I mean it's like 1984 how
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:33.420]  much more obvious does this EU world government tyranny have to get what's
[02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:38.540]  your prognosis on on on how long they can keep going because it's just naked
[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:44.380]  naked control freak tyranny at a cartoon level well there were two things that
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:48.060]  are going to break it as I say in those Mediterranean countries and then just
[02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:52.860]  have a think about this statistic youth unemployment in those Mediterranean
[02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:59.380]  countries is now 50% of young people unemployed the deflationary death
[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:04.380]  spiral of 7% contractions annually in the economies of these countries so I
[02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:09.380]  you know the cat's out of the bag I think people are waking up what we're
[02:41:09.380 --> 02:41:13.220]  really waiting for I think in many of these countries we need some more
[02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:16.940]  strong leaders to emerge we need some people with clear thinking we need some
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:20.620]  people that understand that democracy and liberty are things that are so vital
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:24.620]  and important in the free country but indeed our grandparents actually went to
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:29.180]  war to defend those very principles that are now being surrendered and the other
[02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:33.540]  thing in the end I think that might break it too are the markets because
[02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:37.860]  what I'm doing Europe and they say oh well it's all the speculators it's all
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:42.660]  the speculators but what the bomb markets reflect is that investors realize
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:47.300]  that these countries are basically going bankrupt and it's all well and good they
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:51.860]  can bail out Greece they can turn Greece into a colony they can do the same with
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:56.980]  Portugal small countries but remember the question that is now being asked is
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:01.620]  what about Italy too Italy is a big country in European terms with 62
[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:05.340]  million people it's one of the biggest countries in Europe and it seems to me
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:09.980]  that when the bomb markets take flight in Italy and I I confidently predict that
[02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:15.260]  will happen then you know how much money they print whatever kind of policy
[02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:19.900]  scheme they try and come up with I think the Italian problem may prove to be just
[02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:24.540]  too big to them so it couldn't it could end in financial chaos as well all right
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:29.580]  now again I'm not just you know here praising you for no reason your debates
[02:42:29.580 --> 02:42:34.060]  your discussions the articles you've written going back years are all there
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:39.300]  on record you accurately predicted what is now happening in Spain and Portugal
[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:43.700]  and Italy you predict what would happen in Ireland everybody's seeing that
[02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:48.420]  globalism is is is death to a country but we're also learning that most of this
[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:54.900]  debt is the government signing on to the big mega banks debt and the mega banks
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:59.220]  are using the crisis to try to shut down all their competition they're trying to
[02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:04.020]  to to to move the power to Frankfurt as you've exposed so there's this major
[02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:09.100]  internal power struggle going on in the elites we saw your own Prime Minister
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:13.860]  go for being a cheerleader for the euro takeover of what's left of the UK to now
[02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:21.540]  having to reverse himself I want to ask you why he did that and and what does
[02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:28.180]  that move signify well David Cameron went to a summit before Christmas and if
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:32.780]  you remember he was supposedly to get a veto this new European Treaty that's
[02:43:32.780 --> 02:43:39.740]  fiscal union treaty but the truth of it is he was a reluctant hero he didn't
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:43.460]  really want to do that but the financial transaction tax that was being
[02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:47.820]  proposed would have meant Britain paying 80% of the bill and it would have
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:52.700]  closed down our biggest single industry and you know what that in Britain we do
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:56.700]  the financial services I don't mean mega banks I mean the insurance industry I
[02:43:56.700 --> 02:44:01.900]  mean the investment fund industry I mean the foreign exchange industry was a
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:06.500]  reluctant hero but they managed to drop that proposal and he is now he has now
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:11.780]  collapsed and he is now supporting openly the plan for democracy to be
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:15.500]  abolished across the whole of Europe and people like my old friend Herman Van
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:20.460]  Rumpuy to the color effectively unelected dictators Cameron believe you me
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:25.140]  guys Cameron is part of the problem not part of the solution he supports
[02:44:25.140 --> 02:44:31.140]  carbon taxes he's a total believer that we need super national organizations to
[02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:37.340]  you know control our industries and our output and Cameron Cameron is in fact
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:41.740]  disappointing now I think millions of right-minded conservative
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:45.540]  Euro skeptic patriotic voters in Britain and the conservative party in
[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:51.300]  Britain is in real crisis now all right expanding on the mood in Britain the
[02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:54.100]  mood in the United States the mood in Europe people are waking up to the New
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:45:00.100]  World Order but these these these bureaucrats are not even disagreeing with
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:04.420]  you they're saying in the Economist magazine and Rumpuy and the new head of
[02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:09.300]  the EU are all saying yes we're gonna set the rules and you can't vote on it
[02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:13.900]  yes we're gonna send tax collectors into your country yes we're going to do
[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:19.980]  whatever we want and yes so so instead of denying it they're just giggling
[02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:25.060]  wildly when I watch these debates on c-span or on YouTube and and laughing at
[02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:30.340]  you and and and looking like you're miscreant villains out of a bond movie
[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:37.060]  why why are they so arrogant and will it backfire on them because they hold the
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:41.340]  cards at the moment you know they they are in possession of the status quo it
[02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:45.380]  is the tyranny of the status quo but you're quite right about that arrogant
[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:51.540]  by this afternoon I met Mr. Monty who is now the appointed Prime Minister
[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:55.580]  of Italy and he was effectively just sticking to his fingers up to us and
[02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:59.300]  saying look I'm in charge whether you like it or not this is the way that it's
[02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:05.420]  going to be so there is sort of a a mood of hubris amongst these people going
[02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:10.420]  around at the moment but I still believe that Nemesis will follow because the
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:14.940]  markets the markets will break them and the peoples of Europe the peoples of
[02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:20.460]  particularly the Mediterranean you go to see revolutions Alex I mean it I mean it
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:24.940]  you're going to see mass movements that bring these governments down you cannot
[02:46:24.940 --> 02:46:30.180]  drive people into hopeless poverty you cannot remove them of their pride and
[02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:34.260]  self-respect and not get a massive reaction and I think what we saw in
[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:37.500]  Athens on Sunday with those with those but if you know anyone that's seen the
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:42.460]  TV pictures they're incredible pictures but here is this ancient capital of
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:47.020]  Greece you know the country that invented democracy and much of it going up in
[02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:51.220]  flames as far as I'm concerned you ain't seen nothing yet because these new
[02:46:51.220 --> 02:46:57.420]  proposals are so bad but you know you push people too far they will respond
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:47:01.740]  and react I would rather this didn't have to happen I would rather we have
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:05.580]  proper democratic solutions but I'm afraid the bad guys have possibly just
[02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:11.580]  got too much power now for anything other than some massive social upheaval
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:15.500]  bringing it down well everybody uses Hitler as an analogy but you've got to
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:20.220]  use it if it fits you talked about Europe militarily trying to take over
[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:26.420]  Russia and England Britain and you know Hitler turning east like Napoleon now
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:30.620]  these bureaucrats have that same megalomania power mad hubris and
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:34.820]  they're going wild and they're you know they're telling Greece we're going to
[02:47:34.820 --> 02:47:38.460]  take even private pension funds they're now announcing that here take part of
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:42.500]  them they're telling Portugal that now your own pension fund is supposedly
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:47.620]  welfare while saying you know you have to live under austerity but then the
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:50.660]  governments themselves are stealing trillions of dollars to give it to their
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:56.220]  friends they're the ones that are really on corporate welfare and so it's just
[02:47:56.220 --> 02:48:00.180]  all coming to a head and you mentioned that you met with a member of the Greek
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:05.380]  government and tell folks that story yeah well let me tell you the story last
[02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:13.860]  week I was in Brussels and I got a request from a guy could he come and see me an elderly man in his middle eight seventies with a very
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:17.940]  distinguished career behind him this guy had been a Greek ambassador to several
[02:48:17.940 --> 02:48:21.980]  major countries around the world and he'd even on behalf of the Greek government
[02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:26.940]  negotiated back in the early 1980s Greece's membership of the European
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:31.460]  community so I'm talking about somebody here who is a real establishment
[02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:36.740]  figure in Greece and a very charming and a very nice man in many ways and what he
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:41.840]  told me frightened the life out of me he said to me Nigel I got to tell you that
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:45.860]  the weekend I went down to the back streets of Athens and I bought myself a
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:50.980]  Kalashnikov and I looked at him and I sort of blinked a bit and thought did I hear
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:56.380]  that right he said yes he said I got to tell you that myself and my friends those
[02:48:56.380 --> 02:49:00.220]  of us that are compelled to be well off we live in the on the outskirts of that
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:05.060]  big detached houses and we're all going down and for a hundred euros buying
[02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:09.020]  Kalashnikovs because we believe the time is close when we're going to have to
[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:12.700]  defend our property so desperate are the ordinary poor people for food and
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:17.220]  possession and when you think about you know somebody somebody of that social
[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:22.180]  status who is so scared he's buying a Kalashnikov to defend his family you
[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:26.860]  realize that we've actually got in some of these countries we are on the edge we
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:33.700]  are literally on the edge of a total breakdown in society and you know I'm
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:37.220]  sure there are some big banks and big industrialists who perhaps are rubbing
[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:40.700]  their hands and saying well the sooner Greece goes bankrupt the better because
[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:45.380]  we can buy up the shipyard and buy up the islands and buy up the land but the
[02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:52.100]  sheer price in human suffering and I don't think that frankly the world's
[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:57.140]  normal formal media is not giving the right level of attention to well the
[02:49:57.140 --> 02:50:00.340]  globalists are gonna have a lot of trouble ever getting away with this I
[02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:03.140]  mean that's the problem they're committing such huge crimes look what
[02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:07.220]  they did in Argentina 12 years ago they've done this over and over again
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:11.860]  and the worst part is they then scapegoat capitalism and blame it when
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:17.940]  this is not capitalism doing this this is a bureaucratic crony insiders robbing
[02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:26.420]  everyone you know if you think about it and it is it is the state and the big
[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:30.540]  banks wanting to control absolutely everybody's lives they couldn't give a
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:34.460]  damn about how much human suffering and misery they cause they're stripping away
[02:50:34.460 --> 02:50:39.620]  that's the the basic fundamental liberty of democracy of all all the things that
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:45.820]  we in the West have held dear for years and I have to say that for many many
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:50.860]  years over here I was a very lonely voice but I'm hearing more voices now
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:54.700]  there are more people even amongst the political class who are now having the
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:58.860]  courage to stand up and say amazing Nigel Farage one last segment with you

[02:54:04.140 --> 02:54:08.060]  all right final segment I could talk to this guy for 10 hours he's a hard guy
[02:54:08.060 --> 02:54:12.300]  to get on with it he was just meeting with the with the new appointed
[02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:17.500]  dictator of Italy right before he got on the show but here he is with us the
[02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:23.020]  Ron Paul of Britain and now of Europe I mean really emerging as the main focal
[02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:27.060]  point leader along with the UKIP UKIP.org if folks want to get involved with a
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:31.140]  true group fighting for a sovereignty against this global tyranny we were
[02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:34.980]  talking here in the break about him surviving a horrible freak plane crash
[02:54:34.980 --> 02:54:39.020]  that the pilots still in really bad shape from and how suspicious that was
[02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:41.780]  but hopefully they won't have a second one because then it will really be
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:45.100]  obvious we were talking about getting out of the Euro but you were pointing
[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:49.300]  out during the break it's designed as a fraud and and and so it's like
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:57.900]  impossible to get out of unless people just wake up to the fraud yeah I mean these guys that set this European project up were very very clever very very
[02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:02.060]  devious people and they wrote the treaties in such a way that you were
[02:55:02.060 --> 02:55:06.420]  designed to get into the thing but never ever to be able to get out of the thing
[02:55:06.420 --> 02:55:10.180]  it's rather like a lobster pot or a crab pot with a nice juicy bait and you can
[02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:13.580]  get into the parties they'd be getting out impossible so that there are no
[02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:19.420]  provisions in the Europe in the European treaties for any country ever leaving the euro
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:23.940]  that is how they set this whole thing up these are bad people and as far as I'm
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:28.020]  concerned these treaties should be declared null and void because you know
[02:55:28.020 --> 02:55:31.620]  the most massive fraud has been perpetrated upon the people of Europe
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:36.780]  and and I think I think the great public you know in France and in Germany
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:44.020]  people are beginning to wake up to what's been done in their names Ron Paul what's
[02:55:44.020 --> 02:55:48.060]  your perspective on how the the media has been ignoring him and demonizing him
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:53.300]  it's fascinating I must say the more I listen to and the more I read what
[02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:57.500]  Ron Paul has to say the more fascinated and the more respect I have for this guy
[02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:01.180]  because this guy's got courage he understands that people want to be set
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:05.780]  free from the government and he's not you know he's he's not scared of taking on
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:09.460]  any issue at all and you know I watch him there was a there was one of the
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:15.020]  primaries the other day where Ron Paul got 27% an amazing figure and yet the BBC
[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:20.700]  virtually refused to even admit the fact that he's actually contesting the race
[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:25.420]  and I understand that many conventional parts of the US media have been the same
[02:56:25.420 --> 02:56:28.860]  and it's kind of you've got a Ron Paul figure that comes along and challenges
[02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:32.500]  basic assumptions and perhaps to some extent I've tried to do some of the same
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:37.780]  things over on this side of the Atlantic and it's like a media blackout I just
[02:56:37.780 --> 02:56:41.700]  admire Ron Paul he's worked hard at this for years and whilst he's not going to
[02:56:41.700 --> 02:56:46.060]  become the president I think the ideas that he's sowing in America and
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:49.900]  particularly amongst the younger generation those ideas will survive long
[02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:54.020]  after Ron Paul. All right in closing sir I'm again
[02:56:54.020 --> 02:56:57.820]  an honor to have you with us right after your meeting with the dictator of
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:04.260]  Italy is the tide turning has it turned or are we close to turning it I mean
[02:57:04.260 --> 02:57:08.420]  where would you put us on a timeline because I I mean now you can see the
[02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:12.060]  euro collapsing it's being talked about more or will it just collapse into
[02:57:12.060 --> 02:57:16.780]  something even worse. We are now entering in Europe the single most dangerous
[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:21.820]  period that we've been in since 1945 and I don't say that lightly this is because
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:26.620]  as the project fails the determination of its authors to maintain the project
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:30.140]  become greater. We've already seen them do things that nobody could have believed
[02:57:30.140 --> 02:57:34.580]  the removal of elected prime ministers in Greece and Italy perhaps being the
[02:57:34.580 --> 02:57:40.060]  best example of that. I even wonder you know I even wonder if in the end the
[02:57:40.060 --> 02:57:44.500]  Greek police force won't put down their own citizens whether the EU itself might
[02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:48.900]  even move the force in. These people are bad people they are capable of virtually
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:53.540]  anything but however strong their determination to keep this thing going
[02:57:53.540 --> 02:57:57.820]  the fact is that the fundamentals the economic fundamentals say that in the
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:58:01.420]  end the global markets are going to break it and there is going to be the most
[02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:05.700]  massive rebellion across Europe. In some countries it will manifest itself in the
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:10.540]  ballot box in others it will manifest itself as I've said already tonight in
[02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:15.540]  some kind of revolution that will take place. I think I have to say all the years
[02:58:15.540 --> 02:58:20.220]  I've been in politics I think in terms of Europe and its future 2012 is the key
[02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:25.740]  crucial year. I believe if I have to make a prediction I believe however hard they
[02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:30.180]  try that Greece will leave the euro this year. She will go back to the drachma
[02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:33.460]  she'll have a devaluation her economy will start recovering and then the
[02:58:33.460 --> 02:58:39.420]  Portuguese will say we want out too with the Spanish will say. Incredible! Incredible!
[02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:54.980]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[02:58:54.980 --> 02:58:58.700]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know
[02:58:58.700 --> 02:59:02.060]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:05.820]  silver or gold? It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[02:59:05.820 --> 02:59:09.700]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at

[02:59:19.180 --> 02:59:22.900]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[02:59:22.900 --> 02:59:26.700]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:31.740]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:51.460]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[02:59:51.460 --> 02:59:57.500]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:14.980]  broadcasting network okay we've gone into overdrive with Nigel Farage of
[03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:20.180]  course a member of the European Union Parliament the main leader of the UK
[03:00:20.180 --> 03:00:24.700]  Independence Party and just an amazing individual who if you haven't the reason
[03:00:24.700 --> 03:00:28.780]  I'm a big fan and I'm talking about big fan my people are soccer fans or football
[03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:34.220]  fans I'm a fan of people kicking globalists hind in and they hate him
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:38.780]  when he gets up there to those sniveling slime bags like Rupi he's been
[03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:43.020]  censured or threatened with censure as well but but he was finishing up with
[03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:49.900]  his prediction so recap that and finish up sir yeah what I think 2012 is gonna
[03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:54.060]  be the single most important year that we've seen in Europe certainly in the
[03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:57.620]  time that I've been involved in politics everything is coming to a head these
[03:00:57.620 --> 03:01:02.340]  guys will do everything they can to try and defend their euro project to keep
[03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:06.980]  their big government project going but they're having trouble with the markets
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:10.420]  they're having trouble with the people of Europe as they were in Athens standing
[03:01:10.420 --> 03:01:16.660]  up and remember but in 2012 Greece will leave the euro and once one country is
[03:01:16.660 --> 03:01:21.660]  left the euro had a devaluation and other countries see that suddenly with a
[03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:25.420]  currency at the right level suddenly investment starts to come in people start
[03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:29.180]  going on holidays to their country I think then we'll see countries like
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:35.100]  Portugal Ireland Spain and possibly even Italy saying to themselves hey we've
[03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:38.780]  been sold apart here this thing that come we've got to get our currencies back
[03:01:38.780 --> 03:01:43.420]  we've got to get our democracies back I am confident that 2012 will mark the
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:48.140]  beginning of the end of this appalling disgusting project wow so when you met
[03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:53.020]  just briefly when you met with Mario today the the technocrat installed by
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:58.460]  the EU weasels I mean what did he say to you what what did you ask him I said
[03:01:58.460 --> 03:02:03.100]  he had no legitimacy at all that he was an appointee he spent his life as a
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:07.420]  European commissioner and working for Goldman Sachs and that he represented all
[03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:12.500]  that was worth in his whole new global government movement that you talk about
[03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:18.460]  so often on your program and his response is that the crisis is so serious but
[03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:23.060]  democracy has to be suspended just for a short while so that we can sort everything
[03:02:23.060 --> 03:02:27.460]  out you know we've seen haven't we in the past countries that claim emergency
[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:31.860]  powers hit the city in Germany suspended democracy because of an emergency and
[03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:36.020]  never ever gave it back and I don't think these guys have any intention of giving
[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:40.020]  democracy back and so we the people have got to take it from them it could be
[03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:44.060]  turbulent it could be difficult some of it could be unpleasant but it's a fight
[03:02:44.060 --> 03:02:47.660]  we've got a fight and I think we got to remember that those that went before us
[03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:53.340]  who actually created democracy liberty and freedom of the individual these guys
[03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:57.380]  were actually prepared to go to war to fight to defend these things we are
[03:02:57.380 --> 03:03:00.900]  afraid I'm gonna have to do much the same kind of thing all right we only got a
[03:03:00.900 --> 03:03:06.860]  minute left again we appreciate your time was this on the floor it was this
[03:03:06.860 --> 03:03:10.300]  video because I know they're admitting we're getting rid of freedom but but I
[03:03:10.300 --> 03:03:13.540]  mean that you know to have them publicly admitting it to you or was this
[03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:17.820]  privately no this is privately and it's only the combination here you know you
[03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:22.340]  get the chance on the floor to speak to these people but sometimes meeting them
[03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:25.220]  in private is more interesting and I had a very interesting meeting with Angela
[03:03:25.220 --> 03:03:29.740]  Merkel in November I said Chancellor Merkel isn't working the German taxpayer
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:34.020]  that could put a huge amount of money in to bail out the banks through through
[03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:37.820]  the Greek government would be better for everybody to admit that the euro is a
[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:41.740]  failure and to let Greece leave she said Mr. Baraj we can't do that because if
[03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:45.820]  Greece leaves all the others will leave and if they will leave the European
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:50.820]  project will fail and then we'll just go back to being nation states from their
[03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:57.020]  own mouth unbelievable and choice and sovereignty and honor incredible is so so
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:04:01.820]  is the arrogance a act like with Al Gore or do you think they're still
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:06.980]  delusional I mean are you seeing a change in their spirit as they lose momentum
[03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:11.660]  interestingly six months ago there was a sort of feeling of blind panic over here
[03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:14.940]  everything was going wrong they were terrified and then you could see the
[03:04:14.940 --> 03:04:19.260]  fear on their faces I'm not seeing any fear at all now it's as if perpetual
[03:04:19.260 --> 03:04:23.100]  crisis has become a new form of government and they now realize they
[03:04:23.100 --> 03:04:26.100]  could but they can actually get away with almost anything at least they think
[03:04:26.100 --> 03:04:30.420]  they can get away with anything for a country the size of history to have
[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:34.020]  somebody like this man mom to your point you to take it over but that to have
[03:04:34.020 --> 03:04:38.020]  happened they are completely out of control well it's not the first time
