[00:00.000 --> 00:11.240]  It is Friday, June 10th, 2016, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:11.240 --> 00:14.160]  This will be another extremely important global broadcast.
[00:14.160 --> 00:15.920]  We've got earthquake out in California.
[00:15.920 --> 00:22.200]  We've got other huge developments, geopolitically, with the 2016 campaign, ISIS developments
[00:22.200 --> 00:23.280]  and so much more.
[00:23.280 --> 00:28.560]  But I'm really seeing a trend of society unraveling and degenerating.
[00:28.560 --> 00:33.040]  And on top of that, you've got more and more financial systems that are basically electronic
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.040]  soup kitchens starting to degenerate, so I want to start this broadcast with another
[00:38.040 --> 00:41.680]  very special report that John Bowne's done.
[00:41.680 --> 00:45.240]  Could food stamp riots start triggering within days?
[00:45.240 --> 00:48.120]  The perfect storm is brewing.
[00:48.120 --> 00:54.720]  Obama's last stand as the Salinskyite community organizer-in-chief has a finger on the trigger
[00:54.720 --> 00:56.880]  of mass unrest.
[00:56.880 --> 01:04.760]  When Obama took office in 2008, 28.2 million Americans were receiving welfare benefits.
[01:04.760 --> 01:10.120]  That number has grown to roughly 45 million under the only president in history to not
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.560]  see one year of 3% GDP growth.
[01:13.560 --> 01:17.400]  And there's millions of others that are on state different food assistance programs,
[01:17.400 --> 01:25.760]  so it's 101 million, 101 million get food aid from federal government, outnumber full-time
[01:25.760 --> 01:29.480]  private sector workers.
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.160]  And that's the Department of Agriculture estimate that CNS has reported on.
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.160]  How's that sound?
[01:34.160 --> 01:36.760]  Boy, that sounds like land of the free home of the brave to me.
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.680]  And all these people are being taught, a guy driving a nice car or somebody that has a
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.440]  nice house, they're rich and they stole it from you.
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.000]  Earlier this year, it was widely reported that possibly up to a million of the country's
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  poorest welfare recipients would lose their benefits.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.880]  Here a welfare policy signed, sealed and delivered by none other than Bill Clinton.
[01:57.880 --> 02:04.640]  The Fiscal Times reports, those affected are people aged 18 to 49 who aren't disabled
[02:04.640 --> 02:06.760]  or raising minor children.
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.880]  Most of them live a subsistence existence, scraping by with the help of government and
[02:11.880 --> 02:17.880]  charitable organizations and low-income jobs, although college students are also eligible.
[02:17.880 --> 02:24.600]  The landmark 1996 bipartisan welfare reform law, crafted by a Republican Congress and
[02:24.600 --> 02:31.440]  signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, limited benefits for this group to just three
[02:31.440 --> 02:38.120]  months in any 36-month period unless they were employed or in a work training program.
[02:38.120 --> 02:41.840]  Of course, that was pre-Obama phone Obamacare.
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.080]  Here we are, 20 years later and those chickens have come home to roost, as the government
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.280]  has reportedly neglected to pay the EBT benefits for eight days.
[02:52.280 --> 02:57.840]  Michael Snyder of the Economic Blog reports, widespread reports continue to pour in from
[02:57.840 --> 03:01.440]  all over the nation of glitches with the food stamp system.
[03:01.440 --> 03:05.960]  It is eight days into the month and large numbers of people still have not received
[03:05.960 --> 03:07.200]  their benefits.
[03:07.200 --> 03:13.000]  And in other instances, it is being reported that EBT cards are simply not working correctly.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.480]  Michael Snyder continues, on DownDetector.com there are scores of reports of problems with
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.720]  the EBT system from people all over the nation.
[03:21.720 --> 03:27.320]  Could this simply be another example of government incompetence or is something else at work
[03:27.320 --> 03:28.320]  here?
[03:28.320 --> 03:30.160]  Many things are at work here.
[03:30.160 --> 03:37.040]  The cultural poison George Soros has unleashed on America via Black Lives Matter and MoveOn.org,
[03:37.040 --> 03:42.880]  along with the recently legalized propaganda spewed out by globalist-owned mainstream media
[03:42.880 --> 03:48.080]  taking the side of anti-constitutionalists, fueling violent riots.
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.440]  The Obama administration, the Department of Justice and the United Nations' maneuvering
[03:52.440 --> 03:58.160]  of the Strong Cities Network, a real-time martial law initiative that needs a concrete
[03:58.160 --> 04:02.320]  reason to expand federal control over local police.
[04:02.320 --> 04:07.080]  Not to mention, roughly 11 million illegal immigrants were encouraged by the USDA to
[04:07.080 --> 04:10.720]  take advantage of the United States' federal welfare system.
[04:10.720 --> 04:16.840]  As the national debt approaches a hallmark of 20 trillion, Obama has overseen the exponential
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.960]  formation of a class of unemployed welfare recipients who expect to be taken care of
[04:22.960 --> 04:24.160]  or else.
[04:24.160 --> 04:29.440]  It was reported during the Ferguson writing that two new Black Panther members were planning
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.200]  a bombing of the famous St. Louis Gateway Arch and the murder of the prosecuting attorney
[04:34.200 --> 04:37.640]  in the Michael Brown case along with the Ferguson police chief.
[04:37.640 --> 04:43.200]  The plan fell apart after one of the accused bomber's girlfriend's EBT card ran out of
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.200]  money.
[04:44.200 --> 04:49.120]  This isn't all happening by accident or by powers beyond Obama's control.
[04:49.120 --> 04:54.800]  Mass food riots are par for the course as a last-ditch effort to install martial law
[04:54.800 --> 04:58.920]  and place the United States under New World Order domination.
[04:58.920 --> 05:08.080]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the preceding
[05:08.080 --> 05:11.960]  citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed
[05:11.960 --> 05:12.960]  doors.
[05:12.960 --> 05:16.360]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, well doctor, what have we
[05:16.360 --> 05:17.360]  got?
[05:17.360 --> 05:18.480]  A republic or a monarchy?
[05:18.480 --> 05:21.480]  To which he responded, a republic if you can keep it.
[05:21.480 --> 05:25.360]  But today not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic
[05:25.360 --> 05:26.360]  even is.
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.480]  One thing a republic is not a democracy, where a republic operates under the rule of law
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.160]  which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of
[05:34.160 --> 05:35.160]  the minority.
[05:35.160 --> 05:39.000]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.320]  power or lack thereof.
[05:40.320 --> 05:43.960]  A democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims
[05:43.960 --> 05:44.960]  of the public.
[05:44.960 --> 05:48.720]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have
[05:48.720 --> 05:52.560]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority, it is a case of majority
[05:52.560 --> 05:53.560]  over man.
[05:53.560 --> 05:57.040]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner, but
[05:57.040 --> 06:00.440]  under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[06:00.440 --> 06:03.240]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[06:03.240 --> 06:07.480]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfoWarsLife.com.

[07:53.280 --> 07:56.080]  Now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back.
[07:56.080 --> 08:13.760]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Metal Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com and I salute you, our supporters.
[08:13.760 --> 08:26.640]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in Occupied Texas and broadcasting
[08:26.640 --> 08:29.080]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[08:29.080 --> 08:30.080]  technocracy takeover.
[08:30.080 --> 08:40.880]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[08:40.880 --> 08:44.040]  I am burning inside.
[08:44.040 --> 08:50.360]  Every fiber of my being wants to raise the alarm.
[08:50.360 --> 09:03.440]  We are facing a scientific takeover, a planned program of dehumanization, the globalist world
[09:03.440 --> 09:09.880]  government is just the beginning.
[09:09.880 --> 09:17.600]  Once the planetary system is established, the orderly rendering down of humanity will
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.280]  go into high gear.
[09:20.280 --> 09:26.760]  All the wars, all the secret testing, all the cultural destruction, all the attacks on
[09:26.760 --> 09:34.080]  independence and health is only a beta test.
[09:34.080 --> 09:40.400]  When the enemy rolls out, it's final offensive, it will be the likes of which this planet
[09:40.400 --> 09:47.280]  has never seen and will never see again.
[09:47.280 --> 09:53.000]  We have Tim Kennedy coming in, known as a UFC fighter, but really he's obviously worked
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.480]  in continental government in other areas in some of the most secretive army units.
[09:58.480 --> 10:01.920]  He won't be getting into any of that, but he'll be talking about, with his expertise,
[10:01.920 --> 10:06.280]  the clear plan that he stabilized this country and the world.
[10:06.280 --> 10:09.600]  We just aired in that first little segment that some stations don't carry a powerful
[10:09.600 --> 10:16.640]  report, food stamp riots within days, question mark, John Bowne.
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.360]  We'll tweet that out right now at Real Alex Jones and post it to Facebook because it's
[10:20.360 --> 10:21.360]  so important.
[10:21.360 --> 10:25.400]  Peter Schiff has accurately predicted in the last year that Gold would start going back
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.280]  up and he has been proven correct.
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.280]  He will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the third hour.
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.680]  We have Rob Dew and our other reporters like Paul Joseph Watson and Josh Owens reporting
[10:39.680 --> 10:47.560]  from Dresden, Germany, where the super secret Bilderberg group is being exposed right now.
[10:47.560 --> 10:53.360]  They have spent decades trying to keep their, close to 60 years trying to keep their existence
[10:53.360 --> 10:54.360]  secret.
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.800]  That has now failed and David Knight will be hosting the fourth hour with all the latest
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.800]  news that breaks them as well.
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.360]  And I will be in studio this Sunday, four to six PM.
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.800]  I've been doing kind of a mixed Sunday show where I'm live part of it, but I have a lot
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.880]  of tape, special reports and then mixed in with David Knight live in studio, but I'll
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.280]  be in studio Lord willing this Sunday for the full two hours, four to six PM central
[11:19.280 --> 11:20.280]  as well.
[11:20.280 --> 11:21.280]  Don't forget him.
[11:21.280 --> 11:24.360]  Four hours, nightly news, seven o'clock central.
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.320]  Let me do this because I don't want to get lost in the minutia.
[11:28.320 --> 11:38.240]  I don't want to miss the forest for the trees as they say.
[11:38.240 --> 11:41.920]  Let me just state this very calmly up front.
[11:41.920 --> 11:54.240]  This is an unequivocal, incontrovertible, undisputed, absolute admitted fact for anyone
[11:54.240 --> 11:57.160]  who is even halfway informed.
[11:57.160 --> 12:05.640]  In science, within intelligentsia, within all known studies, it is absolutely prima
[12:05.640 --> 12:11.060]  facie on its face, true, not debated.
[12:11.060 --> 12:14.000]  We are dying as a species.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.320]  You could say that, well, we are growing in numbers and generally that that signifies
[12:19.320 --> 12:26.760]  the species is successful until it reaches carrying capacity and many times collapses.
[12:26.760 --> 12:33.040]  And in a lot of cases historically with tens of thousands of species that have gone extinct,
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.240]  it triggers an extinction event.
[12:38.240 --> 12:46.360]  There is a planned extinction of humanity planned by the controllers of the planet.
[12:46.360 --> 12:54.800]  That is the world government projects end game.
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.360]  Now I want that to sink in because I'm not making this up.
[12:59.360 --> 13:02.800]  We were the first people to tell you our government was running al-Qaeda.
[13:02.800 --> 13:07.280]  The first to tell you they were running the operation to overthrow Libya and Syria to
[13:07.280 --> 13:09.520]  install the hobbyist.
[13:09.520 --> 13:12.680]  The first to tell you what was really in Clinton's emails.
[13:12.680 --> 13:19.800]  The first to tell you hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of huge, super-secret
[13:19.800 --> 13:26.560]  things that no one else is able to break or understand and it's because I've reverse
[13:26.560 --> 13:28.800]  engineered their operation.
[13:28.800 --> 13:31.320]  I am immersed in this 18 hours a day.
[13:31.320 --> 13:40.800]  I have a giant spectrum of top experts around the world.
[13:40.800 --> 13:45.680]  From the highest level of foreign governments to the highest level of the military to the
[13:45.680 --> 13:52.920]  highest level of academia, we have the intel.
[13:52.920 --> 14:04.120]  We know the plan and anyone that just sits there and makes a joke out of this is tempting
[14:04.120 --> 14:07.280]  fate in a big way.
[14:07.280 --> 14:12.280]  But I'm not talking to the folks that are in arrested development mode and wouldn't
[14:12.280 --> 14:14.920]  know the truth if it ran over them like a greyhound bus.
[14:14.920 --> 14:22.080]  I'm talking to people that are awake and I just want to point out that you were correct.
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.600]  You were on target.
[14:23.600 --> 14:25.040]  You took a lot of ridicule.
[14:25.040 --> 14:38.000]  You got attacked because you had a basic instinct and a spirit that was pro-human, pro-justice
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.760]  and your life force hasn't been basically sucked out of you.
[14:43.760 --> 14:46.480]  That's what it comes down to.
[14:46.480 --> 14:48.720]  And so I don't want to sit here and pat you on the back.
[14:48.720 --> 14:59.880]  I really want to just metaphysically hug you as we watch the desperate carnage in slow
[14:59.880 --> 15:05.080]  motion going all around us and just look in the eye and say it's good to know there's
[15:05.080 --> 15:10.920]  still some people that have it succumb to the great delusion.
[15:10.920 --> 15:17.360]  I simply pray that as it gets more intense in the years to come that I don't succumb.
[15:17.360 --> 15:24.000]  But I know I will succumb unless I count on this true spirit of the universe that created
[15:24.000 --> 15:32.000]  all matter, time, space, thought, light, dimensions.
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.040]  But that energy, that God, the true God will not come into your life unless you ask it
[15:39.040 --> 15:40.880]  to.
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.720]  It's a free will.
[15:42.720 --> 15:45.720]  It gave you your free will.
[15:45.720 --> 15:57.120]  And when you choose to join God, you become a small expression of God in the world.
[15:57.120 --> 15:59.760]  You become an eye of God.
[15:59.760 --> 16:12.240]  You become God experiencing His creation at the lowest level to the highest level.
[16:12.240 --> 16:21.280]  But to be with God, you have to decide that you want to join with God.
[16:21.280 --> 16:22.360]  There's so much news here.
[16:22.360 --> 16:24.200]  It's all incredibly over the top.
[16:24.200 --> 16:27.520]  It proves everything we've been warning of.
[16:27.520 --> 16:38.600]  And at the end of the day, this is a spiritual war.
[16:38.600 --> 16:45.800]  This is a science fiction dystopia movie you're living in.
[16:45.800 --> 16:54.200]  The people running things are totally given over to the other spirit.
[16:54.200 --> 16:59.980]  And you're not going to sit there and ever change their minds about what they're doing
[16:59.980 --> 17:01.480]  at the highest levels.
[17:01.480 --> 17:05.560]  The top controllers know good and well what they're doing.
[17:05.560 --> 17:13.920]  And they've been promised in their own delusions and in the cosmology, the world system of
[17:13.920 --> 17:21.960]  thought they've created, that this is an ugly creation, that humans are bad, that humans
[17:21.960 --> 17:28.720]  are fallen, and that we need to be overwritten and gotten rid of, and that only by transcending
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.120]  humanity will they become gods.
[17:32.120 --> 17:37.480]  And that's the Illuminati religion, the false Illuminati religion, the counterfeit Illuminati
[17:37.480 --> 17:49.080]  religion that you know is the Illuminati.
[17:49.080 --> 17:53.280]  And you're saying, wait a minute, but God says we're fallen.
[17:53.280 --> 17:59.240]  So what do you mean the elites say we're falling and have to be gotten rid of?
[17:59.240 --> 18:05.040]  They're the ones that follow the system, the paradigm that has made humanity fallen.
[18:05.040 --> 18:13.280]  They make us fall so that we don't take our birthright and can be interdimensionally incinerated,
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.560]  overwritten, destroyed.
[18:15.560 --> 18:21.440]  And they want us to buy into that and give up our free will and our birthright to populate
[18:21.440 --> 18:26.320]  the stars.
[18:26.320 --> 18:27.600]  Think about that.
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.440]  And they openly say we're ugly and bad and how great the world will be without humans
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.880]  and the great singularity of their God that's about to be born that they will merge with.
[18:36.880 --> 18:41.520]  We are in the hands of lunatics.
[18:41.520 --> 18:43.360]  They're the ones destroying the environment.
[18:43.360 --> 18:45.040]  They're the ones destroying the family.
[18:45.040 --> 18:50.480]  They're the ones creating every form of ugly twisted abomination you can imagine while
[18:50.480 --> 18:58.240]  telling those of us resisting it that we are the plague.
[18:58.240 --> 19:01.920]  So when we come back, I will plow into the news, but later in this hour, and Tim Kennedy
[19:01.920 --> 19:09.560]  is coming to talk about this as well, we're going to discuss the metrics that are there.
[19:09.560 --> 19:14.960]  Document that humanity is quickly degenerating at a very fast pace, that it's being engineered,
[19:14.960 --> 19:20.800]  but that our acquiescence and acceptance of it is what is allowing us to be inducted
[19:20.800 --> 19:26.440]  into this and that the minute we realize that and flip on the basic instincts that God's
[19:26.440 --> 19:32.360]  given us to resist, we will become stronger and actually triumph over it and it will be
[19:32.360 --> 19:37.400]  the challenge against this dehumanization that will actually bring us to the next level
[19:37.400 --> 19:41.280]  of transcendence.
[19:41.280 --> 19:45.960]  The New World Order thinks humanity is going to fall, that it will be the New World Order
[19:45.960 --> 19:53.840]  allowed to test us, that will force the true human to arise.
[19:53.840 --> 19:59.560]  Satan is broken, Satan has already failed, since before the foundations of the earth,
[19:59.560 --> 20:02.360]  our birthright will be secured.
[20:02.360 --> 20:05.120]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[20:05.120 --> 20:09.280]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:09.280 --> 20:13.160]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[20:13.160 --> 20:17.240]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious
[20:17.240 --> 20:18.240]  drought.
[20:18.240 --> 20:21.560]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[20:21.560 --> 20:24.360]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[20:24.360 --> 20:29.880]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[20:29.880 --> 20:31.560]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[20:31.560 --> 20:34.840]  With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.
[20:34.840 --> 20:39.680]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[20:39.680 --> 20:41.600]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[20:41.600 --> 20:45.840]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, you can literally freeze dry anything you
[20:45.840 --> 20:48.600]  eat, even things like ice cream.
[20:48.600 --> 20:57.480]  To learn more, call Harvest Right today at 800-594-4635 or go to harvestright.com.
[20:57.480 --> 21:03.400]  That's 800-594-4635 or harvestright.com.

[21:10.320 --> 21:14.320]  Attention, this is an important message for anyone who had an IVC filter implanted to
[21:14.320 --> 21:17.040]  prevent blood clots from traveling to their heart or lungs.
[21:17.040 --> 21:21.760]  The FDA warns that IVC filters may cause serious complications such as heart or lung damage,
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.640]  internal bleeding and even death.
[21:23.640 --> 21:27.720]  If you or a loved one has had an IVC filter implanted, you may be entitled to substantial
[21:27.720 --> 21:28.720]  compensation.
[21:28.720 --> 21:33.440]  Call the IVC filter justice now at 800-870-7899.
[21:33.440 --> 21:36.360]  IVC filters have been known to fracture and cause tearing at the heart, lungs or vena

[22:03.040 --> 22:08.760]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
[22:08.760 --> 22:12.960]  the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in hand.
[22:12.960 --> 22:13.960]  There is a war against Christianity.
[22:13.960 --> 22:18.560]  Fight back with EPH612.com, the only clothing line for strong Christian men of faith.

[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  line for strong Christian men of faith.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.960]  news, but coming up a little bit later in the hour, I am going to get into the designed
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.120]  collapse of humanity we're witnessing that everything else is just window dressing around.
[25:17.120 --> 25:25.440]  And that if we don't have a sense of destiny, a sense of wanting the species to succeed.
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.200]  Because look, the overall message in the media is humans are bad, we're ugly, we're stupid,
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.000]  but oh, we're going to have transgender bathrooms and mommies and daddies are bad and don't
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.720]  say he or she, because someone might not be a he or she.
[25:36.720 --> 25:43.080]  It's just total scrambled foe rights, everyone wanted to know what an anti societal weapon
[25:43.080 --> 25:45.600]  system would look like, you're being hit by it.
[25:45.600 --> 25:55.000]  And they write textbooks admitting they are, it has nothing to do with that.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.040]  This is a weapon system, this is a joke.
[26:00.040 --> 26:06.160]  This is forced mental illness and every metric shows mental illness and I can see what my
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.920]  own two eyeballs is exploding.
[26:11.920 --> 26:18.060]  People are acting like babies everywhere.
[26:18.060 --> 26:26.080]  It's because the general public is in a trance state totally immersed in their brainwaves
[26:26.080 --> 26:28.120]  in a near sleep state.
[26:28.120 --> 26:37.160]  It's mainstream news, children's brains are completely rewired in a bad way, IQs are plunging.
[26:37.160 --> 26:45.480]  Attention spans are less than that of a goldfish, less than seven seconds.
[26:45.480 --> 26:52.120]  Most people now I talk to, they're gone.
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.760]  They're not even listening to a word you say.
[26:55.760 --> 27:03.920]  They're bouncing from one thing to the next and they're not even alive.
[27:03.920 --> 27:06.800]  They respond to stimuli.
[27:06.800 --> 27:08.840]  They don't have original thoughts.
[27:08.840 --> 27:10.680]  They don't put out stimuli.
[27:10.680 --> 27:12.800]  They don't affect the world around them.
[27:12.800 --> 27:23.000]  They are nothing but receivers, not transmitters and they believe that transmitting nothing
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  and being completely supine is empowering.
[27:29.000 --> 27:36.960]  That's the one false instinct they hold to that being cynical, being stupid, being foolish,
[27:36.960 --> 27:43.280]  being uninformed is a shield, an armor.
[27:43.280 --> 27:52.960]  But they have words like racist and homophobe and sexist and they grasp on to class words
[27:52.960 --> 28:05.080]  like warfare, like it's a life preserver in the frozen Atlantic North.
[28:05.080 --> 28:12.320]  They are children caught in a trance by the television.
[28:12.320 --> 28:19.120]  Even though they're 30, 40, 50 years old, they were captured early, they were put into
[28:19.120 --> 28:25.800]  a wonderland, into a dream state, into a trench.
[28:25.800 --> 28:32.680]  And now there's just the stimuli of giggling and laughing at Alex Jones, giggling and laughing
[28:32.680 --> 28:37.720]  at Donald Trump, laughing when you hear about the fluoride, even though they tell you it's
[28:37.720 --> 28:38.720]  killing you.
[28:38.720 --> 28:40.200]  See, that's their rule.
[28:40.200 --> 28:48.560]  It's killing you, U.S. government admits, Harvard admits, cancer, brain damage, but still
[28:48.560 --> 28:59.920]  the sitcoms make jokes so it feels good to laugh, even though you can't think.
[28:59.920 --> 29:13.560]  An NPR to the pseudo-intellectual keeps them in a calm, happy space where you're successful,
[29:13.560 --> 29:22.880]  you've arrived because you listen to the show and you follow these beliefs and you like Bernie
[29:22.880 --> 29:31.280]  Sanders and Hillary and Bill and you care and you're progressing because your leaders
[29:31.280 --> 29:40.560]  are in charge and they tell you you're winning the war, the war, the war of inequality.
[29:40.560 --> 29:45.560]  Oh, it's getting so much better, isn't it?
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.920]  Yes, Hillary's not a warmonger.
[29:49.920 --> 29:50.920]  Everything's fine.
[29:50.920 --> 29:51.920]  We'll be back.
[29:51.920 --> 29:52.920]  Stay with us.
[29:52.920 --> 29:54.320]  We're on the march.
[29:54.320 --> 29:56.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:56.720 --> 30:22.720]  Alex Jones and the G.C.N. Radio Network.
[30:22.720 --> 30:32.300]  And what are you going to tell me about MPs, constructions, in our
[30:32.300 --> 30:46.340]  portfolio feeds you both the history of your life, who you want the world to.
[30:46.340 --> 30:49.920]  Will that make any sense?
[30:49.920 --> 30:51.520]  intended to hide her lumpy body.
[30:51.520 --> 30:54.000]  The garments stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.280]  and her thick calves covered with black hair.
[30:56.280 --> 30:58.640]  She sounds just like social justice warriors
[30:58.640 --> 31:00.880]  we see at all the Bernie Sanders rally.
[31:00.880 --> 31:03.240]  Maybe she secretly does feel the burn.
[31:03.240 --> 31:05.160]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:05.160 --> 31:07.120]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:07.120 --> 31:10.040]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:10.040 --> 31:12.840]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals
[31:12.840 --> 31:16.000]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.360]  The same team based right here in America
[31:18.360 --> 31:21.720]  brought you the Alexa Pure Ground Breaking Water Filtration
[31:21.720 --> 31:25.000]  Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.360]  Whether it's your home or office,
[31:26.360 --> 31:29.160]  you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[31:29.160 --> 31:32.320]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:32.320 --> 31:36.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.560]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[31:38.560 --> 31:40.720]  replacing older, more expensive filters
[31:40.720 --> 31:42.560]  that didn't do as good a job.
[31:42.560 --> 31:46.360]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:46.360 --> 31:49.800]  It's normally $220 plus, but right now, for limited time,
[31:49.800 --> 31:53.200]  it's less than $200 at infowarstore.com.
[31:53.200 --> 31:55.880]  And the small profit we make goes to find our reporters.
[31:55.880 --> 31:57.280]  This is a 360 win.

[33:32.600 --> 33:35.080]  Something people's are working from the door.
[33:38.080 --> 33:40.680]  I've got the moon night.
[33:40.680 --> 33:44.080]  It's a yes that almost stops your heart.
[33:44.080 --> 33:45.480]  You try to scream.
[33:45.480 --> 33:48.920]  I've got a television in my garage where I work out.
[33:48.920 --> 33:50.600]  And it's hooked up to the internet.
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.880]  And a lot of times it craps out.
[33:53.880 --> 33:55.920]  And there was, I just clicked on YouTube, though.
[33:55.920 --> 33:57.720]  Because a lot of times when other things aren't working,
[33:57.720 --> 33:59.000]  I click on that, it still works.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.360]  And it was giving me what YouTube wanted me to see.
[34:02.360 --> 34:05.400]  So for like an hour working out, in the background
[34:05.400 --> 34:08.480]  was how great the Queen of England is and people singing
[34:08.480 --> 34:11.200]  God Save the Queen.
[34:11.200 --> 34:15.120]  And Justin Bieber and how incredibly cool he is.
[34:15.120 --> 34:17.600]  And then just all this mindless garbage.
[34:17.600 --> 34:19.480]  And it was literally just showing me
[34:19.480 --> 34:23.200]  how the West is a dumping ground of the most weaponized
[34:23.200 --> 34:25.760]  brainwashing anyone could ever imagine.
[34:25.760 --> 34:28.120]  And it was showing all these different Hollywood stars
[34:28.120 --> 34:30.080]  and all these different little two minute pieces
[34:30.080 --> 34:33.640]  with Justin Bieber and other rock stars or hip hop stars.
[34:33.640 --> 34:37.680]  And it was just so empty, so clownish, so ridiculous.
[34:37.680 --> 34:40.600]  People on red carpets, people trying to act cool.
[34:40.600 --> 34:43.320]  It was like a caricature of itself.
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.320]  It was like the best comedy, way better than Monty Python.
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.760]  But it was so saddening that I had to turn away.
[34:54.080 --> 34:56.120]  These people singing God Save the Queen
[34:56.120 --> 34:58.360]  for some Transylvanian parasite.
[35:00.600 --> 35:02.200]  With Prince Philip, the eugenicist,
[35:02.200 --> 35:04.440]  sworn to want to kill 80% of the world population
[35:04.440 --> 35:05.440]  standing next to her.
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.520]  With Prince Charles, who lives in Count Dracula's castle.
[35:10.640 --> 35:11.960]  Half the year in Transylvania.
[35:11.960 --> 35:15.560]  Now he's like retired to Transylvania, complete lunatics.
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.400]  Yes, the house of dragon folks rules over us.
[35:19.400 --> 35:21.360]  It's total fruitcake, Phil.
[35:21.360 --> 35:23.760]  I go to the grocery store, it's just royalty everywhere.
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.920]  You know the royalty, you think I was a British subject.
[35:27.920 --> 35:30.840]  And that's just one, one millionth micron
[35:30.840 --> 35:34.160]  of all the brainwashing, just like Niagara Falls
[35:34.160 --> 35:35.880]  hitting us in the face every day.
[35:35.880 --> 35:38.360]  A total false reality.
[35:38.360 --> 35:40.240]  So I want to tell all the liberals and the trendees
[35:40.240 --> 35:41.880]  and the main line conservatives and everybody.
[35:41.880 --> 35:44.480]  You all tune in to what you think is the answer,
[35:44.480 --> 35:47.320]  what you think is this spectrum of analysis.
[35:47.320 --> 35:49.600]  And it's all there to make you think you're intellectual
[35:49.600 --> 35:51.800]  and smart because you read the weekly standard.
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.440]  Or a national review, or you watch CNN, or MSNBC,
[35:56.440 --> 35:58.440]  or you read a book by Bernie Sanders.
[35:58.440 --> 36:00.160]  I mean, give me a break.
[36:01.520 --> 36:04.720]  The establishment globalist combine
[36:04.720 --> 36:06.720]  with golden sacks at the very top
[36:11.280 --> 36:15.840]  is weaponized, aimed directly at you
[36:15.840 --> 36:19.920]  to make you obsolete and to be a mindless bobble
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.520]  who goes along as a suboid in this technocracy,
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.440]  in their own words.
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.360]  Do you understand Goldman Sachs over 100 years ago
[36:29.360 --> 36:31.880]  was a group of socialist and globalist
[36:31.880 --> 36:34.040]  who pooled their money to create that organization
[36:34.040 --> 36:36.600]  to take over the US stock market and they did it.
[36:38.760 --> 36:40.680]  Do you know about any of this?
[36:40.680 --> 36:43.280]  Because you need to discover it now.
[36:43.280 --> 36:44.600]  We don't have much time.
[36:46.320 --> 36:49.120]  The admitted world government project
[36:49.120 --> 36:50.720]  is to bring in a technocracy
[36:50.720 --> 36:53.320]  where normal, human, individual,
[36:54.720 --> 36:57.360]  undomesticated life is impossible.
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.040]  Then they will make life itself
[36:59.040 --> 37:00.600]  and reproduction impossible
[37:00.600 --> 37:03.240]  without going through a scientific system.
[37:05.320 --> 37:07.640]  They want a monopoly on all reproduction,
[37:07.640 --> 37:10.680]  on all creatures on the planet.
[37:10.680 --> 37:19.520]  They want to be G-O-D, capital letters, exclamation point.
[37:19.520 --> 37:21.280]  Now I'm gonna get into the news here.
[37:24.080 --> 37:26.080]  But I wanna talk to liberals and trendies
[37:26.080 --> 37:27.720]  and everybody else that's cynical
[37:27.720 --> 37:29.560]  and thinks they're in control of the situation
[37:29.560 --> 37:31.560]  and makes a joke out of everything.
[37:31.560 --> 37:34.840]  You have been subliminally and culturally programmed.
[37:34.840 --> 37:36.600]  You've been given hypnotic suggestions.
[37:36.600 --> 37:44.080]  You have been absolutely prepared and programmed
[37:44.080 --> 37:46.520]  to have a response when you're threatened
[37:46.520 --> 37:50.400]  to make a joke out of it and submit to it
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.920]  and to only fight on petty issues with fellow humans
[37:54.920 --> 37:57.320]  at a low level.
[37:57.320 --> 37:58.960]  That's how you've been trained.
[37:58.960 --> 38:00.760]  That's how you've been captured
[38:00.760 --> 38:03.200]  and the bull instructor is now wrapped around
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.880]  your life, your destiny.
[38:04.880 --> 38:08.600]  The entire genetic line of badasses before you
[38:08.600 --> 38:10.040]  that brought you to this point
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.880]  and you are desecrating it.
[38:12.880 --> 38:14.520]  You are mutilating it.
[38:14.520 --> 38:15.680]  You are disrespecting it.
[38:15.680 --> 38:18.400]  You are, gotta use it if it fits,
[38:18.400 --> 38:19.680]  pissing all over it.
[38:22.120 --> 38:30.360]  Now, they just put live feeds of the police,
[38:30.360 --> 38:35.080]  pepper spraying at Bilderberg in Dresden
[38:35.080 --> 38:37.520]  where reporters and people are now showing up
[38:37.520 --> 38:40.880]  daring to just see the world's shadow government
[38:40.880 --> 38:46.120]  and cops in RoboCop future uniforms
[38:46.120 --> 38:49.360]  are just engaging in all forms of evil.
[38:49.360 --> 38:51.000]  I guess that's up on infohors.com.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.280]  We'll get the reporters on about it
[38:52.280 --> 38:54.440]  but quite frankly, that's just a microcosm
[38:54.440 --> 39:00.720]  of everything I'm talking about here.
[39:00.720 --> 39:02.680]  You must admit to yourselves,
[39:02.680 --> 39:04.040]  I'm talking to our general audience
[39:04.040 --> 39:07.560]  but to people that have been put into a spell.
[39:07.560 --> 39:09.200]  Do you remember if you were a little girl
[39:09.200 --> 39:10.720]  when you were four years old with Barbie
[39:10.720 --> 39:13.080]  and getting Barbie high heel pink shoes
[39:13.080 --> 39:15.360]  and a Barbie dress and dressing up and imagining
[39:15.360 --> 39:17.000]  you were a princess over a kingdom
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.480]  and being on a power trip and just feeling good about it?
[39:20.480 --> 39:22.600]  Now, do you remember being older, maybe five, six, seven
[39:22.600 --> 39:25.320]  and then dressing up and then it felt stupid
[39:25.320 --> 39:27.280]  and you realized that it was make-believe?
[39:27.280 --> 39:28.800]  Make-believe's good in children
[39:28.800 --> 39:30.920]  to imagine big things in their future
[39:30.920 --> 39:33.600]  and to war game and model dreams.
[39:33.600 --> 39:36.520]  But when the dreams are given to you artificially by Disney
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.080]  and you're put in a position to believe
[39:39.080 --> 39:40.600]  you really could be a princess,
[39:40.600 --> 39:42.800]  you then grow up to worship the real princess,
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.480]  the demonic crone of Saxe-Cobart-Gotha,
[39:46.480 --> 39:49.080]  Elizabeth of Saxe-Cobart-Gotha.
[39:49.080 --> 39:50.840]  You see how that works?
[39:50.840 --> 39:52.440]  They give you the false dreams,
[39:52.440 --> 39:54.160]  the false memories as a child
[39:54.160 --> 39:56.360]  like you're a replicant in Blade Runner
[39:56.360 --> 39:57.680]  and you become a replicant.
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.960]  You are a replicant basically.
[40:01.960 --> 40:03.560]  You came from a father and a mother
[40:03.560 --> 40:05.760]  but they short-circuited the genetic line,
[40:05.760 --> 40:08.640]  the instincts, the rituals, the rites of passage
[40:08.640 --> 40:12.680]  that would trigger your normal ascension to a man or a woman
[40:13.800 --> 40:15.280]  to a powerful entity.
[40:15.280 --> 40:20.280]  And this flesh suit we wear, this earth suit,
[40:26.760 --> 40:27.600]  that's the same thing.
[40:27.600 --> 40:29.000]  You're part of the Democratic Party,
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.480]  you're part of the Republican Party,
[40:30.480 --> 40:33.480]  you're part of the church, you're part of this.
[40:33.480 --> 40:36.160]  It's all there to totally control you
[40:36.160 --> 40:39.320]  and to make you delusionally as a boy.
[40:39.320 --> 40:41.160]  I remember being three years old,
[40:41.160 --> 40:44.480]  three and a half years old jumping off my porch
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.720]  with a towel tucked in to my shirt
[40:47.720 --> 40:49.440]  saying that we were Batman and Robin
[40:49.440 --> 40:50.720]  and I remember being about three and a half,
[40:50.720 --> 40:52.600]  four years old and saying to my neighborhood friend,
[40:52.600 --> 40:54.760]  you know, we're not really Batman and Robin.
[40:59.680 --> 41:02.040]  And I remember I just didn't wanna play Batman and Robin
[41:02.040 --> 41:03.880]  after I was about three and a half, four years old.
[41:03.880 --> 41:05.000]  Everybody else was still playing it
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.920]  when they were 10 or 11.
[41:06.920 --> 41:08.480]  When I was 12 and I'm not bragging,
[41:08.480 --> 41:11.880]  this is a normal behavior, I was going after women
[41:11.880 --> 41:13.160]  who were 16, 17 years old.
[41:13.160 --> 41:15.280]  They're like, what are you doing, kid at the pool?
[41:15.280 --> 41:16.600]  Coming up to, you know, a 17-year-old,
[41:16.600 --> 41:18.200]  I just, you're very beautiful.
[41:21.560 --> 41:24.200]  Even though what I was doing, I just, hey, you're beautiful.
[41:25.280 --> 41:27.560]  I was a man, we're trying to be one.
[41:27.560 --> 41:28.400]  And that's the difference.
[41:28.400 --> 41:30.320]  I was following my genetic code.
[41:30.320 --> 41:31.400]  I was being a human.
[41:31.400 --> 41:33.560]  I'm nothing special, folks, I'm just a man
[41:35.120 --> 41:36.800]  that can read textbooks written by
[41:37.960 --> 41:40.040]  White House Science Zarr and the Club of Rome
[41:40.040 --> 41:42.440]  and Prince Philip's books and all of it,
[41:42.440 --> 41:45.480]  how they're gonna dumb us down, get control of us,
[41:45.480 --> 41:47.880]  poison us slowly and then wipe us out,
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.600]  first gonna make us all sterile,
[41:49.600 --> 41:52.000]  then have cultural systems so we don't have kids.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.560]  And I'm sitting here watching them do all of this
[41:56.600 --> 41:59.760]  and destroy us and I know I'm right.
[42:00.920 --> 42:02.520]  This isn't my opinion.
[42:02.520 --> 42:04.600]  I wasn't playing Batman and Robin
[42:04.600 --> 42:07.040]  when I was seven or eight or nine years old.
[42:07.960 --> 42:11.680]  I was reading the entire World War II Encyclopedia
[42:11.680 --> 42:12.920]  by Timelife Books.
[42:15.320 --> 42:17.840]  I was reading the entire World War I Encyclopedia.
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.560]  I was reading the entire Engineering Encyclopedia.
[42:22.640 --> 42:25.160]  It had no idea no one else was doing that.
[42:25.160 --> 42:26.960]  And now I know why all these years later
[42:28.360 --> 42:30.760]  because it was my genetics and my spirit
[42:30.760 --> 42:32.680]  was a weapon system against these people
[42:32.680 --> 42:35.480]  just like you are and was grabbing the data,
[42:35.480 --> 42:37.680]  trying to figure it out, seeing what adults were saying,
[42:37.680 --> 42:39.200]  trying to decipher the system,
[42:39.200 --> 42:40.480]  trying to find out what was behind it
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.560]  the whole time, survival, survival, survival,
[42:42.560 --> 42:44.200]  my instincts were you were under attack.
[42:44.200 --> 42:45.040]  You were under attack.
[42:45.040 --> 42:45.960]  Don't drink that tap water.
[42:45.960 --> 42:47.480]  Ask your parents for water filters.
[42:47.480 --> 42:48.880]  Oh, the tap water's good, drink it.
[42:48.880 --> 42:50.880]  Drink the water, feel sick, feel weak.
[42:50.880 --> 42:51.880]  But I was aware of it.
[42:51.880 --> 42:53.720]  My instinct was over-driving it,
[42:53.720 --> 42:56.080]  growing new neural pathways around the attack.
[42:59.360 --> 43:00.560]  When you're aware of the attack,
[43:00.560 --> 43:02.560]  it flips all the switches on.
[43:02.560 --> 43:05.160]  Don't be a victim that I'm under attack and give up.
[43:05.160 --> 43:06.160]  Say, I'm gonna fight.
[43:06.160 --> 43:07.280]  Tell your brain you're gonna fight.
[43:07.280 --> 43:08.600]  You're never gonna give up.
[43:08.600 --> 43:12.080]  Have the will, don't let them kill your spirit,
[43:12.080 --> 43:14.520]  your soul, your guts, who you are.
[43:14.520 --> 43:16.520]  I'm gonna go to the news.
[43:16.520 --> 43:17.880]  But just look at these headlines.
[43:17.880 --> 43:20.080]  Look at DrudgeReports.com, just look at it.
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.120]  Mexico buckles under migrant surge to USA.
[43:24.120 --> 43:25.360]  They say they're at their limit.
[43:25.360 --> 43:27.440]  They have a deal with Obama for five years
[43:28.440 --> 43:32.200]  to allow the immigrants out of the Middle East, China,
[43:32.200 --> 43:34.360]  but mainly Central and South America that come through,
[43:34.360 --> 43:36.480]  they let them through, they get it, train stations
[43:36.480 --> 43:37.920]  and hold onto the trains.
[43:37.920 --> 43:40.360]  The cops make sure they have food and a backpack.
[43:40.360 --> 43:42.920]  This is unspoken, but it's admitted.
[43:42.920 --> 43:44.600]  And then they're allowed to travel through Mexico,
[43:44.600 --> 43:46.080]  but if they get off the train,
[43:46.080 --> 43:48.560]  they are beaten up six months to a year hard labor,
[43:48.560 --> 43:49.400]  tortured, you name it.
[43:49.400 --> 43:51.720]  This is, that's in the line of guardian.
[43:51.720 --> 43:53.720]  But Mexico can't control it anymore
[43:53.720 --> 43:55.760]  because the surge is so massive,
[43:55.760 --> 43:57.080]  Mexico's now going,
[43:58.360 --> 44:00.000]  stop, we gotta cut the deal.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.640]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[44:04.640 --> 44:06.440]  Exclusive board patrol agent,
[44:06.440 --> 44:09.080]  brutally attacked in Arizona, alien shot dead.
[44:09.080 --> 44:10.240]  But look at this one,
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.600]  Mexico buckles under migrant surge to USA at the limit.
[44:14.600 --> 44:17.800]  Board patrol agent brutally attacked in Arizona.
[44:17.800 --> 44:19.120]  Hillary humiliation,
[44:19.120 --> 44:21.680]  Bill bragged about sleeping with 2,000 women.
[44:25.480 --> 44:27.440]  Thanks a billion, Drudge dominates in May
[44:27.440 --> 44:28.800]  over a billion visitors.
[44:31.640 --> 44:33.520]  We now have the White House spokesperson saying
[44:33.520 --> 44:35.400]  it's criminal, the Department of Justice now saying
[44:35.400 --> 44:37.280]  it is a criminal probe into Hillary.
[44:37.280 --> 44:38.480]  That is huge.
[44:39.600 --> 44:42.080]  The Germans threaten England don't leave the Euro
[44:42.080 --> 44:43.720]  or we'll cut you off financially.
[44:43.720 --> 44:47.440]  Ah, England being bossed around by the Germans yet again.
[44:48.320 --> 44:49.880]  When it's the global authority running one
[44:49.880 --> 44:51.440]  that are planning to leave the EU
[44:51.440 --> 44:52.920]  as part of a larger collapse.
[44:55.520 --> 44:59.200]  Oh, baby burst, 2015 had lowest fertility rate
[44:59.200 --> 45:01.200]  down 600,000 births.
[45:01.200 --> 45:02.240]  Economy blame, that's right,
[45:02.240 --> 45:04.640]  make you so poor you can't have kids.
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.320]  Summer market panic, bond yields all time low,
[45:08.320 --> 45:10.720]  similar headlines up on infowars.com.
[45:10.720 --> 45:12.520]  And guys come in and pop on the microphone,
[45:12.520 --> 45:15.880]  fill me in, that was our feed of police spraying
[45:15.880 --> 45:17.040]  stuff in people's faces.
[45:17.040 --> 45:18.840]  I saw you, if TV viewers saw it,
[45:18.840 --> 45:20.360]  I'm just in here with all these TVs around me
[45:20.360 --> 45:22.640]  seeing what the crew is saying.
[45:22.640 --> 45:24.400]  We've got the crew coming on in 15 minutes,
[45:24.400 --> 45:27.440]  we'll find out what's going on over there.
[45:28.680 --> 45:31.400]  But think about a government.
[45:31.400 --> 45:33.240]  It's the same thing in Europe where they always go,
[45:33.240 --> 45:35.600]  Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty,
[45:35.600 --> 45:37.560]  give us your huddles, your tired, whatever,
[45:37.560 --> 45:38.520]  that's in a poem.
[45:39.600 --> 45:41.240]  They'd leave you at Ellis Island for three months
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.920]  to make sure you didn't have black plague,
[45:42.920 --> 45:46.640]  spabonic plague, TB, all these other diseases
[45:46.640 --> 45:48.520]  so they could delouse you,
[45:48.520 --> 45:50.000]  make sure you didn't have flesh-eating bacteria
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.280]  that are carried on lice.
[45:52.840 --> 45:54.880]  No, now it's in the news, they just say,
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.160]  no, we bring in tens of thousands of people every day.
[45:59.160 --> 46:02.960]  Hundreds of them have TB, some of it immune to antibiotics
[46:02.960 --> 46:03.880]  and it kills you.
[46:05.680 --> 46:07.520]  And we're gonna put these people in the schools
[46:07.520 --> 46:09.320]  with your children and we're gonna bring them here sick
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.120]  and pay for it too, not cause they care folks,
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.320]  but because they are breaking our will
[46:15.320 --> 46:17.080]  and training us to accept anything and everything.
[46:17.080 --> 46:20.320]  Look at this, US tuberculosis cases rise
[46:20.320 --> 46:25.320]  as foreign-born patients triple the 1986 caseload percentage.
[46:27.360 --> 46:29.280]  Two thirds of contagious tuberculosis carriers
[46:29.280 --> 46:31.600]  in the United States during 2015 were born overseas
[46:31.600 --> 46:35.040]  up from one fifth, that's who's bringing it in.
[46:35.040 --> 46:37.560]  It's okay though, you gotta put your kid next to him,
[46:37.560 --> 46:39.360]  let him cough on him or you're a racer.
[46:44.080 --> 46:47.160]  Border ranchers with few options now have police radios,
[46:47.160 --> 46:48.680]  just as the border collapses.
[46:48.680 --> 46:50.120]  Oh, but Scarborough a few days ago,
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.120]  they were shocked that Hispanic, Hispanics on the border
[46:55.200 --> 46:56.520]  went to war, what do you think they want to learn?
[46:56.520 --> 46:58.040]  That their kids killed?
[46:58.040 --> 47:01.320]  There's 100,000 dead, 100 plus thousand missing,
[47:01.320 --> 47:02.600]  most of it's on the border.
[47:02.600 --> 47:04.840]  I mean, you like your kids getting raped and killed?
[47:04.840 --> 47:05.960]  You like your house getting burned down
[47:05.960 --> 47:06.920]  and people threatening to kill you,
[47:06.920 --> 47:09.120]  if you don't let them keep drugs at your house?
[47:10.920 --> 47:12.160]  You think they like that?
[47:13.400 --> 47:14.800]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[47:18.520 --> 47:21.800]  And this is a Esquire, go ahead, they're talking about Esquire.
[47:23.160 --> 47:25.160]  You guys got audio on that or?
[47:25.160 --> 47:26.200]  I'm gonna blurb with the computer.
[47:26.200 --> 47:27.480]  Oh, let's shut that down real quick
[47:27.480 --> 47:29.160]  cause I'm not getting audio in here.
[47:29.160 --> 47:30.280]  As soon as the computer's back up,
[47:30.280 --> 47:31.960]  we'll have that clip for you.
[47:31.960 --> 47:34.240]  But continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.400]  tempers flare at school board meeting
[47:37.400 --> 47:40.160]  over protections for transgendered students.
[47:40.160 --> 47:41.440]  How do you distract the public?
[47:41.440 --> 47:43.320]  We're gonna put men in your bathrooms.
[47:43.320 --> 47:44.280]  We're gonna put in other bathrooms.
[47:44.280 --> 47:45.800]  We're gonna make men and women go to the same bathroom
[47:45.800 --> 47:47.320]  in Alamo Draft House they're announcing.
[47:47.320 --> 47:50.800]  And women will squat over urinals that men use.
[47:50.800 --> 47:52.440]  I mean, that's being announced right now
[47:52.440 --> 47:54.000]  as something they're looking at doing.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.240]  It's just a total distraction.
[47:55.240 --> 47:58.360]  Oh, TV's coming in, black plague, wet leprosy,
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.640]  all this stuff's going on.
[48:00.640 --> 48:03.560]  But don't worry, we've got training bathrooms.
[48:04.800 --> 48:06.200]  That's just a total distraction.
[48:06.200 --> 48:08.640]  College dorms, a new front in U.S. battle
[48:08.640 --> 48:09.880]  over transgendered rights.
[48:09.880 --> 48:12.800]  Yeah, we don't worry about the admitted illegal NSA spying
[48:12.800 --> 48:15.560]  or open borders or our government bringing in jihadi cells
[48:15.560 --> 48:19.080]  or all the rest are drug-resistant bacteria eating people
[48:19.080 --> 48:20.400]  by the hundreds of thousands a year.
[48:20.400 --> 48:21.480]  None of that's an issue.
[48:21.480 --> 48:23.400]  It's, well, welcome to college.
[48:23.400 --> 48:24.960]  There won't be any jobs for you in the future,
[48:24.960 --> 48:26.760]  but we're gonna teach you how to be social justice warriors.
[48:26.760 --> 48:29.200]  Now, let's freak out over the inequality
[48:29.200 --> 48:31.680]  of men and women wanting to use each other's bathrooms.
[48:31.680 --> 48:33.520]  Let's not just put in individual bathrooms
[48:33.520 --> 48:35.800]  and go to that model and say, here,
[48:35.800 --> 48:37.480]  we have this for whatever you are.
[48:37.480 --> 48:39.640]  No, let's just, we're all going in the same bathroom.
[48:39.640 --> 48:42.160]  We're making boys and girls in elementary school
[48:42.160 --> 48:45.600]  and middle school, going the same showers together.
[48:45.600 --> 48:48.280]  We're gonna put cameras in there to make sure you're safe.
[48:48.280 --> 48:49.320]  Watching you in the bathroom.
[48:49.320 --> 48:51.480]  See, it's all 1984, but to make sure you're safe
[48:51.480 --> 48:52.400]  because we care about you.
[48:52.400 --> 48:53.760]  No, it's all weaponized.
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.760]  Continuing, this is the death of our culture.
[49:00.040 --> 49:02.480]  Again, we've got trainee bathrooms,
[49:02.480 --> 49:03.800]  but we don't have children.
[49:03.800 --> 49:05.280]  People go, good, we're overpopulated.
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.880]  If you don't have 2.1 children on average in a culture,
[49:07.880 --> 49:10.000]  then there won't be anyone to take care of the old
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.400]  and there won't be a social security system.
[49:11.400 --> 49:13.320]  That's an admitted fact worldwide.
[49:14.720 --> 49:16.320]  But don't worry, we can euthanize you.
[49:16.320 --> 49:19.680]  So that's just some of the news there.
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.680]  This is the manifest brainwashing that's going on.
[49:23.680 --> 49:25.560]  Before I go any further and come back
[49:25.560 --> 49:27.720]  and actually play that clip for you
[49:27.720 --> 49:29.280]  and find out what's going on with our reporters
[49:29.280 --> 49:32.840]  over there in Deutschland.
[49:33.840 --> 49:37.320]  Living defense, harmful organism cleansing.
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.000]  We produced the first run of this in December.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.160]  It's sold out in two days.
[49:41.160 --> 49:44.240]  We produced three times as much this time.
[49:44.240 --> 49:45.920]  And I thought, well, that'll at least give us
[49:45.920 --> 49:47.600]  a couple weeks of it.
[49:47.600 --> 49:48.440]  I guess it's not.
[49:48.440 --> 49:50.400]  It looks like it's gonna sell out by next week.
[49:50.400 --> 49:53.680]  I guess because we're discounting it by,
[49:53.680 --> 49:56.120]  what is that, 25% out of the gates.
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.440]  34.95, it's 120 big capsules.
[50:00.440 --> 50:04.440]  And it's got 20-something known herbs and compounds
[50:04.440 --> 50:07.600]  that in a healthy, clean, not rough way,
[50:07.600 --> 50:10.160]  but very strong way, takes out the garbage.
[50:10.160 --> 50:11.880]  And there's all sorts from bacteria right up to,
[50:11.880 --> 50:14.680]  you know, all the hard little worms and things.
[50:14.680 --> 50:16.800]  Living defense is just amazing.
[50:16.800 --> 50:19.600]  It's got close to five stars on third-party sites.
[50:19.600 --> 50:21.600]  Go to m4warslife.com, go there,
[50:21.600 --> 50:22.600]  see the reviews for yourself.
[50:22.600 --> 50:25.280]  But listen, it's a bunch of well-known herbs
[50:25.280 --> 50:26.560]  and things that are good for your body regardless.
[50:26.560 --> 50:29.160]  Get yourself the living defense.
[50:29.160 --> 50:30.640]  You know, a child would take one pill a day
[50:30.640 --> 50:32.480]  but consult your pediatrician.
[50:32.480 --> 50:36.080]  That's what I do during a six-week detox cleanse.
[50:36.080 --> 50:37.960]  An adult of medium size two,
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.560]  some of these really big, three,
[50:39.560 --> 50:43.560]  and you do it over six weeks, unbelievable.
[50:43.560 --> 50:44.640]  I mean, you'll start seeing results.
[50:44.640 --> 50:46.280]  I certainly did right away.

[52:03.520 --> 52:05.280]  If you ever wanted a great deal
[52:05.280 --> 52:06.880]  on a powerful solar generator,

[52:15.560 --> 52:17.520]  and it's getting worse, so please listen.
[52:17.520 --> 52:19.560]  Solar generators really do provide
[52:19.560 --> 52:21.240]  life-saving electrical power.
[52:21.240 --> 52:24.360]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[52:24.360 --> 52:25.840]  emit no fumes or gases,
[52:25.840 --> 52:27.640]  and produce electricity from the sun.
[52:27.640 --> 52:30.160]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[52:30.160 --> 52:31.920]  intensifying civil unrest,
[52:31.920 --> 52:33.800]  you're not going to have to suffer through it

[53:33.000 --> 53:35.640]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become?
[53:35.640 --> 53:38.720]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters,
[53:38.720 --> 53:40.120]  or even a future collapse,
[53:40.120 --> 53:42.880]  you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.
[53:42.880 --> 53:46.040]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomandbloom.net,

[53:47.560 --> 53:50.200]  of uniquely designed medical kits and supplies
[53:50.200 --> 53:52.160]  for when help is not on the way.
[53:52.160 --> 53:54.280]  For everything from individual first aid kits
[53:54.280 --> 53:56.240]  to the ultimate family medical bag,

[53:59.160 --> 54:01.400]  That's store.doomandbloom.net.
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.720]  You'll be glad you did.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.680]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[54:06.680 --> 54:10.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:10.240 --> 54:18.240]  All right, for some reason, that clip from the morning Joe
[54:18.240 --> 54:20.200]  won't play, so we're re-importing it.
[54:20.200 --> 54:23.200]  It's corrupted in more ways than one, I guess.
[54:23.200 --> 54:24.600]  But I want to play that clip where they're just,
[54:24.600 --> 54:26.320]  I can't believe people want a wall.
[54:26.320 --> 54:27.720]  Oh yeah, you're next to a failed state
[54:27.720 --> 54:29.000]  with hundreds of thousands dead,
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.880]  100,000 dead, 100,000 missing, total bedlam,
[54:31.880 --> 54:34.520]  dead bodies everywhere, mass graves everywhere,
[54:34.520 --> 54:35.960]  heads getting chopped off everywhere.
[54:35.960 --> 54:38.360]  I would talk about 10 heads getting delivered
[54:38.360 --> 54:41.880]  to the police department a few years ago in Arizona,
[54:41.880 --> 54:43.240]  and they would actually have national media say
[54:43.240 --> 54:45.240]  I was a liar, no heads got delivered,
[54:45.240 --> 54:47.040]  even when the heads were dumped off.
[54:48.760 --> 54:50.200]  I mean, that's the stuff they do,
[54:50.200 --> 54:53.120]  knowing that their audience is in a zombie mode.
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.120]  Just tell them, there is no drone program.
[54:55.120 --> 54:56.920]  Hillary, I don't have any secret emails.
[54:56.920 --> 54:57.840]  I don't have a secret server.
[54:57.840 --> 54:59.560]  Oh, I do, I forgot about that.
[54:59.560 --> 55:00.400]  None of it's secret.
[55:00.400 --> 55:02.240]  Oh, here's her email ordering them
[55:02.240 --> 55:03.680]  to cut the secret part off the top.
[55:03.680 --> 55:06.560]  It's just insulting everyone's intelligence.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.920]  And yes, we fund ourselves by saying
[55:10.920 --> 55:11.920]  get ready and get prepared,
[55:11.920 --> 55:13.120]  but it's what I really believe that.
[55:13.120 --> 55:15.240]  I've actually gone as far as getting generators
[55:15.240 --> 55:17.800]  and storeable food and stuff here at the office,
[55:17.800 --> 55:19.360]  not just at my home,
[55:19.360 --> 55:21.280]  because it's gone from being a possibility
[55:21.280 --> 55:23.680]  to a probability to almost certainty.
[55:23.680 --> 55:24.720]  And I'm not happy about that.
[55:24.720 --> 55:26.560]  I've got stacks of news mainstream
[55:26.560 --> 55:28.240]  with the elites getting armored redoubts,
[55:28.240 --> 55:30.600]  getting cash and gold, panicking,
[55:30.600 --> 55:32.520]  running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[55:32.520 --> 55:35.520]  I mean, I don't know what to do, okay?
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.200]  But the public's going into zombie mode.
[55:38.200 --> 55:39.360]  They've weaponized the media
[55:39.360 --> 55:41.520]  where the attention span of the average person is gone.
[55:41.520 --> 55:43.440]  Organizational skills are gone.
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.160]  Those that still are conscious are seen as the enemy.
[55:47.160 --> 55:50.400]  I mean, you're gonna see a societal collapse very soon.
[55:50.400 --> 55:52.200]  I'm telling you, folks, it's clear.
[55:52.200 --> 55:54.000]  A mental illness is exploding.
[55:56.600 --> 55:58.040]  We've got these weird criminals
[55:58.040 --> 55:59.440]  that everyone's worshiping, the Clintons,
[55:59.440 --> 56:00.680]  the media behind them.
[56:00.680 --> 56:02.680]  Everybody should get water filtration
[56:02.680 --> 56:05.600]  and info wars store.com, 10% off promo code water,
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.000]  the Alexa Pure Probe, the Pro Pure,
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.600]  they're all excellent as well.
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.000]  It's got all of it.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.200]  I mean, just get geared up and fund the operation
[56:15.200 --> 56:16.800]  right into the future.
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.200]  And we hope to slow this down or turn it around and stop it.
[56:19.200 --> 56:21.160]  If we're able to do that with your help, thank God.
[56:21.160 --> 56:23.760]  But I tell you, it's moving into a defense mode
[56:23.760 --> 56:24.600]  at this point.
[56:24.600 --> 56:27.080]  And finally, solutionsfromscience.com
[56:27.080 --> 56:28.760]  is another great place to get prepared.
[56:28.760 --> 56:31.840]  Solutionsfromscience.com, solutionsfromscience.com,
[56:31.840 --> 56:34.040]  you find a wide variety of preparedness products
[56:34.040 --> 56:36.440]  that were created to help keep you safe
[56:36.440 --> 56:38.240]  when disaster strikes from solar power generators,
[56:38.240 --> 56:41.040]  revival gear, fertilizers, they're all available right now.
[56:41.040 --> 56:42.480]  The Solutions From Science website,
[56:42.480 --> 56:44.200]  and Solutions From Science regularly
[56:45.800 --> 56:48.320]  bought a surplus of solar panel generators

[56:57.200 --> 56:58.760]  Great system.
[57:03.200 --> 57:05.480]  It's just overwhelming at this point.
[57:05.480 --> 57:08.160]  Again, the government is letting people in
[57:08.160 --> 57:13.000]  by the tens of thousands every few months.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.880]  That's a conservative number with TB
[57:15.880 --> 57:16.880]  that cannot be treated.
[57:18.800 --> 57:20.360]  And Scarborough thinks it's bizarre
[57:20.360 --> 57:22.560]  that anyone wants a wall here at us.
[57:22.560 --> 57:23.600]  Pretty shocking stuff.
[57:23.600 --> 57:25.640]  So you send a liberal journalist down there,
[57:25.640 --> 57:28.400]  he comes back saying, Trump is right.
[57:28.400 --> 57:29.240]  That's right.
[57:29.240 --> 57:30.080]  So we said, you got to go down there
[57:30.080 --> 57:32.080]  with no preconceived notions.
[57:32.080 --> 57:33.480]  Right, just an empty notebook.
[57:33.480 --> 57:35.880]  Go to my former home state.
[57:35.880 --> 57:38.800]  Where my, you know, and walk the border,
[57:38.800 --> 57:41.760]  drive the border 800 miles and talk to whoever you see
[57:41.760 --> 57:43.720]  and let them tell us what they think about
[57:43.720 --> 57:46.080]  what's really going on, whether we need a wall, in fact,
[57:46.080 --> 57:48.200]  instead of hearing it from the debate stage.
[57:48.200 --> 57:49.040]  Let's hear it from the people.
[57:49.040 --> 57:50.520]  And the people say build the wall.
[57:50.520 --> 57:51.720]  They said build the wall.
[57:51.720 --> 57:52.560]  They said two things.
[57:52.560 --> 57:56.000]  The Hispanic, Anglo, Democrat, Republican,
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.160]  uncommitted, clueless, whatever.
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.600]  They said we want a wall, and yet we want it to be married
[58:00.600 --> 58:02.920]  with some compassion for the people
[58:02.920 --> 58:03.920]  that we're trying to keep from jumping into that.
[58:03.920 --> 58:06.080]  Here's another surprising thing from the article
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.480]  is that he said that Hispanics were less sympathetic
[58:10.480 --> 58:13.320]  towards illegal immigrants than whites.
[58:13.320 --> 58:16.480]  So I think that there's a lot of interesting things there.
[58:16.480 --> 58:19.160]  But one thing I think is that most of those Hispanics
[58:19.160 --> 58:21.280]  are first generation and they see it as unfair
[58:21.280 --> 58:22.920]  that they came over here the legal way.
[58:22.920 --> 58:24.680]  No, it's not going to hit pause.
[58:24.680 --> 58:26.680]  It's not about a color of the people's skin.
[58:26.680 --> 58:29.480]  It's that they're not under the white guilt.
[58:29.480 --> 58:31.960]  They know Mexico has one of the strongest borders
[58:31.960 --> 58:33.400]  in the world.
[58:33.400 --> 58:36.520]  They know that it's a lot of criminals
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.600]  and diseases are coming across.
[58:38.600 --> 58:40.440]  They're not suicidal, okay?
[58:40.440 --> 58:41.280]  That's why.
[58:41.280 --> 58:42.120]  We'll be back.
[58:42.120 --> 58:42.940]  Stay with us.
[58:42.940 --> 58:43.780]  I'm Alex Jones.
[58:43.780 --> 58:46.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:46.880 --> 58:50.800]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:53.320 --> 58:57.080]  Buckley, tell us about Alexa Pure Breeze discounted
[58:57.080 --> 59:00.880]  over 25% off as an introductory promotion.
[59:00.880 --> 59:02.120]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[59:02.120 --> 59:04.600]  It's an energy efficient HEPA ion cluster
[59:04.600 --> 59:06.240]  air purification system.
[59:06.240 --> 59:08.800]  It has a four stage purification process.
[59:08.800 --> 59:10.720]  It has a HEPA filter, pre filters
[59:10.720 --> 59:12.320]  and a carbon activated filters.
[59:12.320 --> 59:14.400]  And the most amazing thing about it is that it has
[59:14.400 --> 59:17.080]  this patented ion cluster technology
[59:17.080 --> 59:19.800]  that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct
[59:19.800 --> 59:20.760]  of clean water.
[59:20.760 --> 59:22.560]  So this is non-toxic.
[59:22.560 --> 59:23.920]  It's a beautiful unit.
[59:23.920 --> 59:24.840]  It really looks good.
[59:24.840 --> 59:26.920]  I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner.
[59:26.920 --> 59:30.560]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan.
[59:30.560 --> 59:31.600]  It's super quiet.
[59:31.600 --> 59:34.680]  The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95.
[59:34.680 --> 59:37.680]  And there are other units that are up to $899 to $1,000
[59:37.680 --> 59:39.400]  to do exactly what this unit does,
[59:39.400 --> 59:42.840]  but they're not as quiet because this one has a silent mode
[59:42.840 --> 59:44.760]  which runs at 16 decibels.
[59:44.760 --> 59:47.600]  Go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside
[59:47.600 --> 59:48.440]  all the time.
[59:48.440 --> 59:50.960]  Great job, Alexa Pure, infowarstore.com.
[59:50.960 --> 59:52.760]  But we thank you so much, my friend.
[59:55.800 --> 59:58.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.360]  Live.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.640]  But we're alive, all right?
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.960]  And here we go.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.480]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.920]  Broadcasting in a wide.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.560]  Invading the matrix with bayonets fixed.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.480]  And a crazed look of testing in our eyes
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.160]  with love of humanity committed.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.320]  Like 21st century kamikaze.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.120]  The driving our intellects, our will, our understanding,
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.560]  our energy, our guts, right into the enemy.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.720]  Desperateness is the way to defeat globalists.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.360]  By desperate, I mean the desperate action.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.440]  Filled with resolve, commitment.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.440]  We've got a reporter from Germany, big developments there.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.080]  That's coming up.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.720]  Huge economic news, the earthquake news.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.400]  It's all coming up.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.000]  But right now, I'm going to let this report take us to break
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.880]  because we've got the euro and the German government
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.000]  threatening the British and the UK.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.640]  You better stay in the EU, even though you
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.920]  didn't vote to be part of it, or we're going to destroy you.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.840]  Kit Daniels, infowars.com.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.560]  Did you know the Bilderberg group was directly responsible
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.920]  for the 1973 oil crisis that occurred here in America?
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.080]  Most people think it was OPEC that orchestrated
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.000]  the entire thing.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.560]  But that wasn't quite the case.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.000]  It was, in fact, the Bilderberg group's idea.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.480]  In May of 1973, about five months before the oil crisis
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.320]  occurred, the Bilderberg group met in secret.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.080]  And the meeting included several CEOs of oil companies,
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.320]  such as Exxon and British Petroleum,
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.400]  as well as President Nixon's national security advisor,
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.800]  Henry Kissinger.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.840]  They predicted that soon there'd be about a 400% increase
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.280]  in the price of oil.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.120]  And then on October 6, 1973, after the meeting,
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120]  the Yonge-Kipper War occurred, which
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.720]  directly led to the increase in oil prices.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.600]  But how did the Bilderberg group know this?
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.800]  They planned it.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.240]  But why?
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.160]  As economist F. William Engdahl noted in his book,
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.000]  A Century of War, one enormous consequence
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  of the ensuring 400% rise in OPEC oil prices
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.520]  was that investments of hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.880]  by British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, both of whom
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.760]  were present at the 1973 Bilderberg meeting,
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.960]  and other Anglo-American petroleum concerns
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.400]  in the Risky North Sea could produce oil at a profit.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.680]  He continued, the profitability of these oil
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.280]  in these new North Sea oil fields was not at all secure
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.560]  until after the OPEC price rises.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.040]  So the Bilderberg group came up with the idea of an oil crisis
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.920]  to ensure profitability for the oil companies connected
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.280]  to Bilderberg.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.000]  And the former oil minister for Saudi Arabia,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.640]  Sheikh Yamadi, confirmed this.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.480]  In 2001, Yamadi said, I am 100% sure
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.360]  that the Americans were behind the increase
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.640]  in the price of oil.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.000]  The oil companies were in real trouble at the time.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.280]  They had borrowed a lot of money,
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.840]  and they needed a high oil price to save them.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.520]  Yamadi also said that when he visited Iran in 1974
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.600]  on official oil business, he was told
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.400]  that it was in fact Henry Kissinger who
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400]  wanted to raise the oil prices.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.600]  And that Kissinger wanted a war in the Middle East
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.080]  in order to justify the said price increase.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.480]  And a few weeks before the Yom Kippur War occurred,
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.240]  Kissinger, who was now the Secretary of State under Nixon,
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.200]  he issued a statement saying that if there was a war that
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.080]  was going to break out in the Middle East, that US military
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.120]  intervention was completely out of the question.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  Basically, Kissinger used secret diplomatic channels
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.120]  to ensure that not only would the war happen as badly
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.200]  as possible, but that OPEC would use the war to justify
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.080]  a price increase.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.480]  Kissinger downplayed the war, for example,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.440]  to President Nixon and took control of the situation
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.600]  himself.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.080]  In fact, the National Security Agency
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.000]  found out about the war two days before it happened.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.480]  But they were told by the White House under advisement
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.400]  from Kissinger to sit on the information.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.440]  And also, Kissinger told the Israelis
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.680]  to stand down and let the war happen.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.680]  And the rest, you know, is history.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.160]  The war occurred.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.720]  The US gave arms to Israel to fight in the war.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.200]  And then OPEC, in response, embargoed the US.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.640]  Thereby increasing oil prices.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.600]  Now, I added some links in the video description
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.040]  below that go more into detail about the Bilderberg groups
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.960]  involvement with the 1973 oil crisis.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.200]  But at the very least, remember this.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.200]  The oil crisis shows us exactly why we must constantly
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.040]  watch the Bilderberg group and also begs the question,
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.640]  what are they up to now?
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.520]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.

[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.400]  Emails in Clinton probe dealt with planned drone strikes.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.960]  Some vaguely worded messages from US diplomats
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.120]  in Pakistan and Washington use a less secure communication
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:16.640]  system.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.040]  At the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton's
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.000]  handling of classified information
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.080]  is a series of emails between American diplomats
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.960]  in Islamabad and their superiors in Washington
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.680]  about whether to oppose specific drone strikes in Pakistan.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.920]  The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the low side
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.840]  government slang for a computer system
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.480]  for unclassified matters.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.280]  It's part of a secret arrangement
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.720]  that gave the State Department more of a voice
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.760]  and whether a central intelligence agency drone
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.840]  strike went ahead.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.280]  According to congressional and law enforcement officials
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.000]  briefed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation Probe,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.880]  some of the emails were then forwarded by Ms. Clinton's aid
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.800]  to her personal email account, which
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.080]  drew to them to a server she kept at her home
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.320]  in suburban New York.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:03.120]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.800]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.280]  You can't survive without it.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.440]  But where do you get it?
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.000]  Alexa Pure Probe is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.480]  water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.720]  The Alexa Pure Probe transforms water
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.280]  from virtually any fresh source into clean,
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.040]  healthy drinking water, pairing the unprecedented super
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.880]  filtration power of an all-new gravity block core
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.600]  with a hybrochromatic shell.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.840]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities,
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.640]  including bacteria, viruses, fluoride,
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.600]  disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.000]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.480]  stainless steel construction, easy assembly, low maintenance,
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.560]  replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.920]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.160]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.760]  Rob Doe joins us.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.880]  You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.960]  Tell us what brainforce did.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.920]  I'd been working all day.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.400]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.400]  I get in here at 8.30.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.720]  I was kind of run down.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.640]  I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.960]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.320]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there, I popped two of them.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.680]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.760]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.160]  Got four and a half stars.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.440]  People really love it.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.080]  Read about it.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.960]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.720]  such high praise, because it really
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.840]  does have the best organic-based systems that
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.240]  will blow your socks off.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.920]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.440]  but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.800]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.720]  took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce,
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.600]  and came in.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.160]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:01.280]  at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.080]  proudly presents The Alex Jones Show,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.320]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.640]  We're now well into hour number two on this Friday edition.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.800]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.560]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.920]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, UFC fighter,
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:35.840]  but really the reason he's on is Green Beret, Special Forces
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.800]  soldier Tim Kennedy, who's going to be in studio with us
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.480]  for 30 minutes, talking about societal collapse,
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.480]  because it's already happening all over the world.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.360]  Culturally, it's happening here.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.640]  Economically, it's happening.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.680]  And it's being organized.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.800]  And mass mental illness is increasing.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.200]  They've created an artificial system
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.680]  where people don't ever have to actually do anything.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.080]  While they're being made dependent,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.400]  that's a perfect storm of control.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.840]  And we've got EBT cards not working around the country,
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.480]  and people melting down.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.280]  Why are the globalists pushing us
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.040]  towards societal disintegration?
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.560]  We're going to be talking about that coming up
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.120]  in the next hour.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.720]  In fact, you guys pulled me all those articles
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.280]  from yesterday.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.440]  Thank you.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440]  Now, obviously, there's some big developments here
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.480]  with open borders.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.480]  Last hour, I played a clip from the morning
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.640]  job where they sent their reporter down to the border
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.640]  for over a month, and he found that the vast majority of people
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.160]  want a border wall, they agree with Donald Trump,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.680]  and the majority of them are Hispanics.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.880]  And Hispanics wanted the wall more than Anglos.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.320]  And they said they didn't really know why,
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.800]  or maybe it was because they were first generation
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.240]  and had paid their dues.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.880]  Now, I know the folks on the border,
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.880]  they're most of them are ranchers,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.240]  and they actually work, and they're producers,
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.880]  and they are fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:06.200]  tenth generation in Texas and New Mexico and Arizona,
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.840]  really cool people.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.520]  And they're mainly Hispanic, and they are almost universally
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.320]  upset about what's happening, because they get robbed,
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  they get killed.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.560]  People walk right in their house,
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.840]  they sever people's heads, they kill their cattle.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.400]  It is just a collapse.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.680]  Most women, well, there's 80% percent of women
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.960]  being brought in and get raped by the coyotes.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.360]  I don't mean the wolves, I don't mean the diminutive wolf,
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.240]  I don't mean the smaller canine, I mean the smugglers.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.480]  That's on record, but don't worry.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.840]  The Hollywood White House-funded director, Robert Rodriguez,
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.120]  puts movies out where the cowboy white guys
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.320]  are shooting pregnant Hispanic women.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.120]  That's not going on.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.680]  So this again is the triumph of the hoax over reality,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.600]  but it's coming out.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.960]  At the limit, Mexico buckles under migrant surge to US.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.520]  This is, again, out of Reuters.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.880]  Oh, Mexico says, stop taking people.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.240]  So many are coming into our country to get to you.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.440]  Some of them aren't leaving.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.200]  We can't handle it.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.080]  We need money to then speed it up.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.880]  Mexico is struggling to stem the flow
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.400]  of Central American migrants, oh, they're migrants,
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.160]  traveling to the United States ahead of this.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.600]  It's all UN language, ahead of the US presidential election,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.640]  causing major concern in Washington,
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.280]  which is weighing, sending more agents to help,
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.560]  and then the agents get there and load them on contractor
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.720]  trucks and bring them in, contractor vans to legalize them.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.640]  In 2014, Mexico moved to strengthen its southern border
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.240]  when a surge in child migrants from Central America
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.880]  sparked a political crisis in the United States.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.800]  They just call it a child wave.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.080]  That's a total red herring.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.760]  Last year, Mexico detained over 190,000 migrants,
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.320]  more than double the number in 2012.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.720]  And now they say it's just collapsing,
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]  and what are they going to do?
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.640]  They need money, yes, of course.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.400]  Meanwhile, remember, Illinois tried to pass a law last year.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.360]  It nearly was defeated.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.200]  No, no, no, the legislature passed it.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.960]  But then it was getting held up by the governor
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.680]  last time I checked.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.560]  Hey, can we look on the status of Illinois
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.800]  trying to pass a law?
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.760]  Just type in Illinois trying to pass law.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.440]  I think it did pass.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.400]  I'm going from memory, check it.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.080]  Illinois passing law to let illegals vote.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.840]  I mean, imagine if Mexico said we're passing law
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.120]  to let illegals vote.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.560]  That's just crazy.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.120]  But only in America.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.040]  Well, now San Francisco hopes Trump fear
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.200]  will lead to voting rights for illegal immigrants in the city,
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.600]  Fox News, locally.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.160]  The San Francisco Board of Supervisors
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.440]  is hoping that residents in the city who fear Donald Trump's
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.080]  rhetoric and policy proposals will
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.720]  flock to the polls this November and support
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.480]  giving voting rights to illegal immigrants.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:53.800]  Amazing.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.200]  And again, TB pouring in and other diseases
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.120]  that are untreatable in many cases,
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.480]  drug-resistant strains, it's all OK.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.080]  This is a government literally trying to enslave and kill
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.920]  everyone.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:12.200]  This is a government wanting things to completely
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.120]  and totally break down.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.160]  Meanwhile, Roger Stone has put us in contact with the main group
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.920]  that he certifies as a best group out there
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.760]  that is setting up the Stop the Steel rallies that are now
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.960]  just a First Amendment Trump support
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.080]  to try to keep the communists and socialists
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.040]  in the White House run George Soros people
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.480]  from completely trashing Cleveland.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.440]  And now the police have apologized to us off the record.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.440]  And I'm talking directly to Stone.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440]  Let's talk to him.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.120]  But they said, we've been ordered to not give you
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.200]  any permits period or let you meet 10 miles away
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.160]  in a warehouse district where no one can see you
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.080]  or where the communists can come, I guess, and beat you up.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.040]  Kit Daniels has this report up on infowars.com.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.040]  Cleveland to ban Trump supporters outside RNC.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.280]  So free speech zones to put Trump supporters
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.680]  on the other side of the planet.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.960]  Everything else has been rigged.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.760]  Wouldn't they do this?
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.960]  And I'm telling you right now, I'm going as a citizen out there.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.760]  The communists and socialists are going to be running around
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.840]  doing everything they want.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.000]  And I'm going down there.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.240]  And I'm going to walk around.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.720]  And I'm going to talk about the First Amendment.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.720]  I don't care what the Democrats that run in Cleveland, Ohio
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.520]  have to say.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.720]  And everybody needs to be there.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.040]  They know libertarians and patriots and conservatives
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.720]  and constitutionalists.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.480]  If the government says don't demonstrate
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.560]  or we're not going to be a permit,
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.240]  tend to go, OK, because we don't want
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.680]  to be associated with the communists and all those folks
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.080]  that run around doing stuff.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.960]  You're going to let them take over if you do that.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.320]  It's now time to say we're going to exercise this period.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.160]  We have the police arresting and detaining
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.480]  and doing all sorts of people to reporters in Germany
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.560]  trying to cover Bilderberg.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.960]  The folks that have opened the borders,
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.800]  the folks that are threatening the UK
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.880]  not to try to leave the EU, they never voted to enter.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.040]  Just like we never voted to enter the Trans-Pacific
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.080]  Partnership that welds the Asian Union, the European Union,
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.440]  and the North American Union together.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.720]  The city of Cleveland is attempting
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.280]  to suppress pro-Trump rallies during the Republican National
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.560]  Committee convention, a move even the liberal ACLU
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.000]  is called unconstitutional.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.400]  Democratic city officials are giving pro-Trump groups
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.720]  24 hours to complete applications for free speech
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.680]  permits, which they won't give us,
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.480]  which severely restrict the First Amendment
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.680]  rights of applicants.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.360]  They just say do this or that's the way it is.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.560]  There's only 18 hours of permit time
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.120]  under these regulations.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.960]  Parade time over the three or four days of the convention,
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.160]  ACLU general counsel Susan Becker said,
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.600]  we just found out about that recently.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.200]  So we are hoping we can really negotiate these points,
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.840]  but it's really up to the city to come back
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.680]  the more reasonable time, places, and manner of regulations.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.680]  And it goes through how it's really far away
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.800]  in the free speech zones.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.800]  But have all been adjudicated to be unconstitutional.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.720]  Then we've got House passes Puerto Rico rescue.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.440]  Ah, the collapse accelerates.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.560]  The EBT cards suddenly aren't working in many areas.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.360]  Hmm, beta testing.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.040]  We're going to get to all of that coming up.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.480]  The 5.2 magnitude desert earthquake
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.720]  shake Southern California.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.760]  Is that a tremor for the big 8.5 seismologists say
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.520]  is two years overdue?
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.640]  And if it hits in a populated area,
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.440]  you'll think it's the intro to Thundar the Barbarian.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.400]  I guess you haven't seen that in the 1970s.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.960]  You wouldn't know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.320]  But let's just say something out of a disaster movie.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.680]  So we're looking at all of that.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.080]  We're also going to be looking at what's
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.360]  happening in the stock market.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.880]  Stocks drop as government bond yields hit fresh lows.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.000]  And I've got stacks of articles where the elite are buying
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.680]  gold and hoarding cash and getting armored redoubts.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.960]  I know we've talked about it forever,
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.040]  but now it's in the mainstream news.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.160]  But now we go to Dresden, Germany,
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.120]  the site of the most prestigious world government body,
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.720]  which for 60 years they kept secret.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.440]  Now, thanks to drudgerport.com and our reporters
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.200]  at infowars.com and others,
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.360]  they are forced to report on the goings on there
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.920]  and days after we broke it.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.120]  CNBC, everybody else reported exactly what we said.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.920]  Trump, stopping Trump, stopping the British exit
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.200]  out of the unelected Euro, world taxes,
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.080]  carbon taxes, internet taxes, internet IDs.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.760]  It's all on the table, a giant power grab
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.120]  by an unelected grip of crooks meeting with our ministers
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.360]  on their knees, literally.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.600]  And I'm told in some cases, bathhouse figuratively.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.800]  Paul Joseph Watson, what has developed
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.680]  since we talked to you 24 hours ago?
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.320]  Well, of course, the big development, Alex,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.280]  which Rob will get into in more detail
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.920]  because he was there on the scene,
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.320]  was the big confrontation we had last night
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.760]  with the governor of Saxony, Stanislav Tillich.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.040]  Now, of course, this is huge
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.120]  because every single time Bilderberg happens,
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.480]  the media claims it's just a talking shop
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.600]  that no decisions are made, it's no big deal.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.480]  But we've got this guy on tape.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.920]  And this is massive, brazenly admitting
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.720]  that he comes here to attract investment into Dresden.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.320]  In other words, lobbying.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.080]  This is a huge lobbying scandal
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.160]  and he's been caught on tape brazenly admitting it.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.160]  Meeting with politicians, again, as Skelton said yesterday,
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.840]  this is a politician-rich conference.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.160]  He's meeting with them,
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.200]  he's attracting investment to Dresden.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.200]  He also admitted that he's basically sitting
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.600]  at the kids' table.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.160]  So he might get to speak to the big wigs,
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.800]  to the senior Bilderberg elitists at some point,
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.160]  but for the time being, probably,
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.880]  tomorrow when he will visit,
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.960]  he will sit, you know, 100 feet away from them
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.720]  and barely get the chance to even talk to them.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.240]  And let's be clear, they always do this.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.960]  They always have about three or four,
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.720]  like Fareed Zakaria or the lady from Washington Post.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.600]  They always have a few of these little minions
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.560]  to act like the press is there,
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.360]  they have a signed agreement, which is admitted,
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.200]  not to speak about it.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.640]  And then they'll usually have the mayor
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.960]  or the local billionaire, whether it's New York,
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.080]  whether it's London, wherever, or Virginia,
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.720]  they'll have a local who literally has to sit
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.160]  at a little kids' table
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.320]  and maybe summoned into the real king's court.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.960]  So this is a modern Versailles,
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.280]  is what Bilderberg really is.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.720]  Go ahead.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.880]  Exactly, and he's gone on the record,
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.800]  he's talked about it,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.800]  because he's not aware of what this is all about.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.200]  Again, he's committed the cardinal sin,
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.360]  which is to talk about Bilderberg.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.280]  The first rule of Bilderberg, like Fight Club,
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.920]  is don't talk about Bilderberg.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.320]  He's broken that rule before he's even attended.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.360]  But he's proud of himself,
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.280]  because he's saying, hey, I'm here to just get money locally.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.760]  Sounds like he might be a patriot.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.000]  Could be, or he could just be completely unaware
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.960]  of what Bilderberg is all about
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.360]  and why they've enforced this Chatham House rule,
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.360]  where they can't go on record about it.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.640]  But that is an absolutely huge report,
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.080]  and it's up on infowars.com right now.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.160]  The other development is today,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.760]  we went about half a mile away
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.640]  from the site of the hotel
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.880]  and found, thanks to a local tip,
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.160]  the water cannons that they're preparing
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  for a big protest.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.360]  How loving!
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.280]  So Bilderberg prepares water cannons to repulse the naves.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.720]  The article's already up.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.240]  We need them to add the video to it,
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.000]  because that's just gone up as well.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.160]  So there were two protesters here yesterday,
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.400]  basically, who held cardboard signs.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.640]  They were harassed by police.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.680]  They were forced to put the signs away.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.560]  Later on, we heard that they were reportedly arrested
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.480]  for possessing a tent and, wait for it,
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.080]  a loaf of bread,
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.520]  because a loaf of bread was treated
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.400]  as a dangerous weapon here in Dresden.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.480]  We were actually told that.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.400]  That's not confirmed,
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.800]  but that's what we were told that they were arrested for.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.800]  So for two people with a couple of cardboard signs
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.120]  and a loaf of bread,
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.840]  they've got water cannons ready.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:41.360]  Now, that's not to say that there won't be trouble,
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.760]  because also we've got left and right protesters
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.360]  coming together, potentially clashing tomorrow here.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.200]  Yeah, let's just say it.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.640]  The Soros and rats are always being activated
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.680]  to come in and stir up trouble.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.600]  They don't even know why,
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.680]  so the police have a cover when they're ordered
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.080]  to go in against everybody.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.160]  And again, we're not blaming the police,
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.720]  but that's how the globalists do it.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.720]  They ship in the anarchists, they stir it up,
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.440]  then the police are ordered to stand down
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.960]  during the first rollout.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.040]  Then in the second phase of the rollout,
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.600]  they then are told to attack everybody.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.080]  Go ahead.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.080]  No, that's what we've been told that what usually happens
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.920]  is that they have these left versus right protesters.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.280]  They start off peaceful,
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.400]  but then an agent couture, somebody from the left,
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.480]  because in one case they later identified him,
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.360]  starts throwing bottles at the police,
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.000]  giving the police to go in
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.120]  with the excuse of being heavy handed.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.840]  So that's what we've got to be wary of tomorrow.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.680]  Again, it's Saturday, people are off work,
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.960]  so there's likely to be more protesters here,
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.400]  and it could be a clash between left and right.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.000]  So that could be the spark that sets off
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  some kind of police action
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.600]  involving the use of those water cannons
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.320]  and a militarized scoop tank,
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.320]  which is also pictured in the article.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.400]  Oh my gosh, well, there's the headline,
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.480]  water cannons, scoop tanks.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.840]  That scoop tank is directly out of Silent Green.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.120]  Holy Toledo.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.480]  Yeah, and they're parked up there.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.040]  There was a security guard guarding those three vehicles.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.640]  We went up there, tried to talk to him.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.080]  He didn't want to talk.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.560]  After about three minutes,
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.640]  we were kicked out by another security guard
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.880]  who came up and it's all on tape.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.720]  So, you know, they're getting ready for something big,
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.360]  and it could happen tomorrow.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.280]  Oh, I mean, this is classic.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.320]  We saw in Switzerland,
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.920]  the police were really mean the first few days,
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.960]  but then realized what was happening,
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.160]  and they were a more pro-free speech,
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.960]  and it was literally villagers marching with torches
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.880]  up to the gates of the situation,
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.720]  right out of Frankenstein.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.560]  But in Germany, you know, the police,
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.760]  I guess, are trying to keep the people from realizing
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.160]  this global government Frankenstein
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.400]  that's menacing everyone and destroying our freedom
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.880]  and destroying our future,
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.320]  that actual Dr. Frankenstein is meeting inside that hotel
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.800]  right now, and God forbid that people ever learn
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.000]  who made the monster,
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.320]  because then they might not just oppose the monster,
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.480]  they might actually oppose who created it.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.280]  Well, that's right, and we've got another leak.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.880]  We talked about the economic collapse,
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.880]  which is, you know, we had that article up this morning,
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.280]  talked about that yesterday.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.560]  Also, German federal finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.720]  is in attendance at Bilderberg, which is interesting.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.720]  He's the one threatening the EU.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.080]  That's the top of Drudge.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.480]  Let's show Dr. Spiegel, Drudge has a copy of it,
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.880]  threatening the UK that will shut all your markets down
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.480]  and won't let you trade with us.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480]  I mean, this is economic terrorism.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.280]  The Bilderberg group threatens economic terrorism on the UK
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.280]  to stay in the Euro.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.480]  This, I mean, the UK couldn't be conquered by Hitler,
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.880]  but it can be now by Merkel.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.880]  Go ahead.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.480]  It's economic terrorism.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.280]  He's threatening an economic embargo,
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.280]  saying that there will be no trade deal between the UK
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.880]  and the EU if the UK votes to leave,
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.680]  which is complete nonsense,
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.280]  because the UK would be the EU's biggest export market.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.680]  We buy their products, they need it.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.280]  The EU is the corrupt failing institution
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.680]  that would be in desperate need of the United Kingdom support.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.080]  The parasite is unelected and is telling you,
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.880]  there's like tapeworms telling you
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.080]  that they're not going to feed you anymore
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.080]  if you kick them out.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.080]  Exactly.
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.480]  But another thing, and this is what's coming out,
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.680]  this is another leak.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.880]  He's also the one calling for more Muslim migrants
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.480]  to be brought into Germany,
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.280]  because according to him, there is a risk of inbreeding
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.680]  amongst the German people.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.480]  Those were his words, not mine.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.480]  And he also said, quote,
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480]  for us, Muslims in Germany are an enrichment
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.480]  of our openness and diversity.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.480]  So he's openly calling.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480]  Stop, stop, stop.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]  This is too bombshell.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.480]  Again, we broke all this on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.480]  Drudge magnified it, forced mainstream news worldwide
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.480]  to report exactly what we said.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.480]  They confirmed it.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.480]  Just showing we have the real sources.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480]  Paul, I don't know about this leak.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]  I know about my sources.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.480]  I know you're getting some on the ground there.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.480]  Did you get this?
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480]  Was it skeleton?
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.480]  This is bombshell.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.480]  Are we getting leaks right now from the current meeting?
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.480]  Because I just got from folks that worked for one of them.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.480]  What was on the agenda last week before they went,
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.480]  which was international news.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.480]  Are you saying you're getting leaks right now in real time?
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.480]  Because I think I'm about to have a, you know what, dream.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.480]  Go ahead.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.480]  Well, it's the same every year.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.480]  You know, we've got leaks that come out from our inside sources,
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.480]  and we've got what they're saying in public.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.480]  He's saying in public that he's going to threaten UK,
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.480]  again, with economic terrorism.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.480]  But tell me about the leak.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.480]  I'm salivating.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.480]  Well, the leak that he's there,
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.480]  and this is what he's saying in public,
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.480]  and this is what they're talking about at the Bilderberg meeting.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.480]  And he's echoing, you know, what Stephanie von Berg,
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.480]  the green path, he had said back a few months ago.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.480]  He said it's good to hear in a white people.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.480]  Yeah.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.480]  Calling for Germans to be a minority in their own cities
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.480]  within 20 years and saying that that's a good thing.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480]  That's right.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.480]  And this is the beachheads, folks.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.480]  This is the beachheads.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.480]  They blew up the Middle East.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.480]  They trans-shipped the people into invade Syria.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.480]  They shipped them through Turkey.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.480]  They're going wide open Macedonia as the main corridors.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.480]  They're bringing them in to make you a minority and an enemy.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.480]  These people being brought in will be your minders
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.480]  and your controllers, okay?
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.480]  A lot of them are just victims of it as well.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.480]  But they are the new political minion class.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480]  You're being replaced.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.480]  And they'll be replaced with robots as well.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.480]  This is all just the collapse phase we're going into, Paul.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.480]  And basically what we're seeing in Germany now
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.480]  is the massive reeducation program.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.480]  In fact, there's an article out today which I tweeted
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.480]  where they're taking students, putting them on an island
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.480]  and re-educating them to sympathize with the migrants.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480]  That was, I think, we posted it.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480]  That's right.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]  Germans put Germans now.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.480]  In fact, pull that up.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.480]  I have that in the stack.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.480]  I can't find it right now.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.480]  Germans, that's not the headline, of course.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.480]  It's like, oh, sensitivity training on islands for the migrants.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.480]  No.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.480]  Germans being German children being sent to reeducation camps
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.480]  to prepare them for open borders.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.480]  Just like the Army manual, 2010,
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.480]  classified three years ago, says reeducation camps
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.480]  for right-wingers.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.480]  It actually says reeducation camps and uses the Soviet term.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.480]  Paul, this is insane.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.480]  That's why I looked at all the news this morning
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.480]  and just went into a hissy fit.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.480]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.480]  This is really happening.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.480]  It's completely insane.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.480]  You've also got a program which is teaching migrants
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.480]  how to flirt with German girls.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.480]  You've got programs in the schools.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.480]  You've got senior politicians calling for Arabic
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.480]  to be mandatory in German public schools.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.480]  This is a huge reeducation campaign.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.480]  And whether you think the migrant influx is good or not,
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.480]  the migrants should have to integrate into German society,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.480]  not the other way around.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.480]  That's not how it's supposed to work.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.480]  So you've got that going on.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:40.480]  You've got Merkel demanding that the guy who arrested
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.480]  the migrant in the store who was behaving erratically,
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.480]  trashing the store, trying to steal a bottle of wine.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.480]  You've got Merkel demanding that he be arrested,
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.480]  not arrested, but kicked out of her party
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.480]  unless he apologizes for basically stopping a criminal.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:59.480]  So this is a massive reeducation campaign
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480]  that's taking place in Germany.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.480]  And it's really beginning to intensify.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.480]  And a Bilderberg member who is at this meeting
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.480]  is calling for that same very reeducation program.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.480]  So that's what they're talking about here in Dresden.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.480]  And by the way, Paul, I saw that article this morning.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.480]  They're hiring the former Stasi to enforce on everybody
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.480]  to not criticize the open borders.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.480]  They're giving people tickets or arresting them,
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.480]  the handout flyers pointing it out.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  I mean, this is a takeover.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.480]  But what was the headline on that article?
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.480]  Because I had it in my stack. I can't find it.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.480]  I'd forgotten that. I want to show people.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.480]  They're now sending German schoolchildren,
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.480]  high school students, and college students
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.480]  to reeducation camps where they cannot get away
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.480]  from vacation to be put in with migrants,
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.480]  bossing them around in social engineering
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.480]  and saying have sex with them.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.480]  I mean, folks, this is so hardcore.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.480]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.480]  And this is what Obama's chief of staff said
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.480]  he wanted in that C-SPAN interview.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.480]  Rahm Emanuel said,
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.480]  we're going to have a national security force
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.480]  just as big, just as strong as our military.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.480]  He quoted Obama.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.480]  But then he wanted to say, when you get out of high school,
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480]  you'll have one to three years mandatory national service,
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.480]  military, no, that's dangerous enough
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.480]  because they can be political.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.480]  Domestically, as social justice warriors,
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.480]  as community organizers,
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.480]  but first you're going to be brainwashed for one year,
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.480]  then two years of on-the-street service,
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.480]  they are building literal Soviet youth brigades.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.480]  Stay there, Paul. Tell us in the break the headline.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.480]  I'm freaking out right now.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.480]  I mean, folks, I knew this was all coming.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.480]  I knew this was all coming,
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.480]  but to actually see it here and to know it
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.480]  and to know that the new Alamo Draft House Theater,
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.480]  they're building in Austin,
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.480]  is going to have one giant bathroom
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.480]  with men and women in it,
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.480]  with women urinating and urinals standing up.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:46.480]  I mean, I'm just saying, it's total psychological warfare.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.480]  We've only seen the beginning,
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.480]  flesh-eating bacteria, TB, death everywhere,
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.480]  covering it up.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.480]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]  We're on the mark.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]  This is total war.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.480]  World War IV has begun.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.480]  This is World War IV.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.480]  It's World War IV.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.480]  It's like the government's aliens or something.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.480]  It's so high-tech.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:08.480]  Well, just wake up.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.480]  We're on the mark.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:31:02.480]  We're on the mark.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.480]  Please listen carefully,
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.480]  because I'm about to point out three things
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.480]  that will save you a lot of money

[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:21.480]  your skin from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.480]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.480]  No one has put together a formula
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.480]  that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.480]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.480]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ,

[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:14.480]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:18.480]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.480]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.480]  In order to fuel hospitals in the UK,
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:30.480]  they're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.480]  What is the secret of Silent Green?
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.480]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.480]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480]  Because of its enormous popularity,
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:45.480]  Silent Green is in short supply.
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.480]  Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.480]  The supply of soil and green has been exhausted.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.480]  You must evacuate the area.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.480]  The rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo,
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.480]  Big Builder Bird Group Company,
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:07.480]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.480]  and the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.480]  So enjoy the flavor.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:12.480]  We're going to get the real solution,
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.480]  which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.480]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.480]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:20.480]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.480]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.480]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:31.480]  for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:34.480]  and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.480]  But that's called the death panel.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.480]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.480]  They told me to say that they were sorry,
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.480]  but that you had become unreliable.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:55.480]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.480]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.480]  will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.480]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.480]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.480]  on its army, on its prison guards,
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.480]  on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.480]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:17.480]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.480]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:23.480]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.480]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.480]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.480]  We gotta stop them.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.480]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.480]  Silent Green is people!
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:43.480]  I am letting myself get hysterical on air
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:49.480]  because that's the normal response to the type of dehumanization
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.480]  and the dystopia the globalists admit their building on purpose.
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.480]  A dystopia for us, a supposed utopia for them.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.480]  We're not going quietly into the night.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.480]  It's Breitbart reporting on it.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.480]  The headline should be Re-Education Camp,
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.480]  but Breitbart's great.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.480]  I was supposed to say that because it's too much.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:10.480]  School kids forced to play migrants to better understand them
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.480]  and then they're sent and talks about the island that they're on
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.480]  for refugee of the day.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.480]  Again, this is Re-Education Camp garbage.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.480]  And then look at these headlines.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.480]  I'm going back to Paul Watson and Dresden and then to Rob Dube.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.480]  We're gonna take them and get into other news.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.480]  Exclusive.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.480]  Bilderberg planning to trigger financial collapse.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.480]  Paul Joseph Watson from Inside Intel,
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.480]  over the top, incredible, should be the top story in the world.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.480]  And it dovetails with today's news.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.480]  Let me just show you this since I mentioned it earlier.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.480]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.480]  Stocks drop as government bond yields hit fresh lows.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.480]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.480]  CNBC.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.480]  Why big investors think it's time to hoard gold?
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:57.480]  A summer panic is starting to brew across markets, market watch.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.480]  Former Fed president.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.480]  All my very rich friends are holding a lot of cash.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.480]  Forbes.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.480]  Out is out.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.480]  Schnabble warns of single market access in event of Brexit.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.480]  We will not allow you to trade in our country if you leave.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.480]  We are an unelected bureaucracy.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.480]  We will not vote to enter.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.480]  And if you try to leave, we will shut off your trade.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:18.480]  We are in control.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.480]  Now, you will submit and take the vaccines.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.480]  Then you will feel much better.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:28.480]  Just take the shots and eat the food and shut your mouth and die.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.480]  This is our world now.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.480]  Lay down and die.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480]  Humans are bad.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.480]  Earth.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.480]  Accelerate.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.480]  Generic engineering.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.480]  Ready to spacecraft.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.480]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.480]  Where is your humanity?
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:49.480]  Get your spirit of survival rising.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.480]  Stop being living dead, waddling around like penguins.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:58.480]  I was watching Trump just five minutes ago during the break with the operatives trying
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.480]  to shut down his rally, his speech, his policy speech.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.480]  Beating people up outside as usual.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.480]  He's pointing out 500% increase in the refugees they've announced with no vetting.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.480]  IDs aren't even looked at.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.480]  That's admitted.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.480]  TV everywhere.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.480]  Ah, but we love you.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.480]  But when you fly, say from Austin to New York, oh, we're going to put you through a body
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.480]  scanner and ask you questions and have you take your shoes off.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.480]  It's like, you know, getting a cat wet.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.480]  It's all naked and teach you how to submit because this is just the first level you learning.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.480]  We're going to learn you good.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.480]  And of course the TSA and the cops, they don't know what's going on.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.480]  There's like the general public.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:52.480]  Maybe the cops do it because the cops supposedly have the skills of reduction and of logic.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.480]  And I found why they want to make us enemies with the police.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.480]  Do their bidding, be on a short leash, bring in their new world order.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.480]  But they fear them because they're criminals historically, the globalist are.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:06.480]  So they want us attacking the police to make them be against the people and vice versa.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:13.480]  Because I found the cops are the easiest people to get through to and wake up after special forces people.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.480]  It's because if you're actually in special forces, the military for that matter, or you're in on the street,
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.480]  which can be a combat role just in of itself, you better live in the real world.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.480]  You're going to get hurt real fast.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.480]  And so here's the news.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.480]  We're living in the twilight zone, baby.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.480]  I don't know what to do about it, except get the word out,
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.480]  not comply with unconstitutional garbage and take action and just, just, just, it's, it's energetic.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.480]  We have to have the energy.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.480]  We have to be loud.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.480]  We have to be aggressive.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.480]  We have to never stop and promote the truth.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.480]  It's the info that's key, but we got to get people out of their trance.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.480]  How do you wake somebody up?
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.480]  Won't wake up, dump ice water on them, baby.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.480]  We need an ice bucket challenge.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:55.480]  I'm doing an ice bucket challenge this week, next week to wake up America in the world.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:01.480]  I'm going to redouble my efforts, folks, because this is so serious.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.480]  All right.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.480]  Going back to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480]  I mean, Watson, it is crazy.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.480]  Exclusive Bilderberg member confronted says secrecy of Bilderberg is essential.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:14.480]  Sanders sojourns the White House, vows to support Clinton and fight against Trump.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.480]  George Soros is preparing for economic collapse.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.480]  Does he know something?
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.480]  We don't.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.480]  Yeah, he's running it.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  I mean, this is just getting crazy.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.480]  You're Trump rejects Obama endorsing Clinton.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.480]  He just wants four more years.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.480]  Paul Joseph Watson continuing with other tidbits from Bilderberg is the camera crew pans around
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.480]  and shows TV viewers what's happening there in Dresden.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:35.480]  I'm going to get a short comment from do and then let you guys get back to your important work.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.480]  Well, another aspect to come out of this, Alex, we've talked about how Bilderberg is moving
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:45.480]  towards, you know, the Silicon Valley angle with Facebook reps, Palantir reps, et cetera.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:50.480]  Well, another big story came out today, which was that Google, which of course is owned by,
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.480]  you know, headed up by Eric Schmidt, who is here right now.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.480]  Google is censoring searches for Hillary Clinton criminal.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:03.480]  So if you go to Google and type in Hillary C R I M, you're going to come up with Hillary Clinton
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:10.480]  crime bill 1994, not Hillary Clinton criminal investigation, which is what now the White
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.480]  House spokesman said is that's what the FBI is treating it as.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.480]  So now they've caught Google actually censoring negative searches.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.480]  That's huge.
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:22.480]  And that's Google, who's at the White House, even more than Facebook.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]  That is huge, Paul.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480]  In fact, I saw that earlier.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480]  Let's let's do it on screen for TV viewers.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:31.480]  Regulators go to Google type in Hillary Clinton criminal, and then they block the fact that
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:35.480]  they are now saying it's a criminal investigation with her crime bill.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.480]  Wow.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.480]  But of course that blew up in their face.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480]  And now they've been caught.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.480]  They've had to back off.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.480]  In fact, I'll play that clip in a moment, but go ahead, Paul.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.480]  Remember, they tried to do it with Twitter with a hashtag and negative hashtag about
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.480]  Hillary that the trend and it got shut down.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.480]  And you know, Schmidt has been an advisor to the Obama administration.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.480]  He was the founder of the groundwork, which was a Silicon Valley company dedicated to
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.480]  putting Hillary in the White House.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.480]  Last year, we got the leak that Hillary was the chosen candidate, and they were going
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.480]  to start scheming to defund her Republican opponents.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:14.480]  Now, Trump's come out of the blue cell funded so they can control that.
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:20.480]  So this is another way in which they're going to bury Hillary Clinton's criminal conduct
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480]  crooked Hillary.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.480]  And you know, Schmidt is here and obviously that is one angle that they're going to be
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.480]  talking about.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.480]  The other issue is Cologne.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.480]  Of course, we had the mass molestation of women in Germany in Cologne, Germany on New Year's
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480]  Eve.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.480]  The media didn't report on it for three days afterwards.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.480]  They circulated on social media.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.480]  Massive police cover up.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.480]  Then they said it was white Germans doing it in phase two.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.480]  Then later had to admit the police were ordered to cover up.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.480]  Well, here's the breaking news.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.480]  You know, at first they said, oh, these weren't refugees.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.480]  These weren't migrants and people were like, well, so they were integrated.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.480]  So these were assimilated people.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480]  Well, that's even worse.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480]  But now it's come out.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:04.480]  Most of the culprits of that mass molestation in Cologne had been in Germany for less than
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.480]  12 months.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.480]  They were economic migrants.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.480]  Most of them were refugees.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:14.480]  Two-thirds of them, of those involved in the mass molestation in Cologne on New Year's
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:20.480]  Eve, had committed a crime, again, despite only being in the country for 12 months.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:21.480]  Sure.
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.480]  Let me just interrupt.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.480]  First, we're not supposed to call them illegal aliens.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.480]  Then it's illegals.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.480]  Then it's undocumented.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.480]  Then it's migrants.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:31.480]  This is all UN terms to teach us to be under a global government where we're all poor
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480]  and stupid except for the elite.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.480]  How about the new word be little precious angel darlings?
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:38.480]  So little precious angel darlings.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.480]  The new word is not migrant folks.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.480]  It's little angel cake, darling, perfect, sweetie pies.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.480]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.480]  And again, you know, we spoke to the guy from Nepal yesterday.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.480]  That's a video that everyone should check out on the Alex Jones show.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.480]  He was a legal immigrant, came to Germany to stay in Dresden, has been here for four years,
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.480]  speaks perfect German, speaks perfect English, and he's not happy about the way, for example,
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.480]  about the way, for example, that Pegida is being characterized by the media.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:08.480]  He's not happy about the amount of people being brought into the country.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:13.480]  And listen to this statement from the spokeswoman for the German Interior Minister.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:16.480]  This is what she said when these new stats came out.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.480]  Whoa, immigrants are not as criminal as Germans.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:25.480]  How's that for a statement when it came out that they're responsible for twice the number
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.480]  of crimes in respect to their population?
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.480]  And that's what police whitewashing and Sweden, the police were ordered.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:36.480]  If it's a migrant of color, just, just, just say, you know, say, say native Sweden.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.480]  So they've been even with cooked numbers that they're engaged in half.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.480]  Yeah.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:44.480]  So again, it's all part of this reeducation program.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.480]  They're covering it up.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.480]  They're lying to the German people and they're now forcing, as we covered earlier,
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.480]  students to go and live on islands to be mistreated.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.480]  So they have sympathy with the migrants.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.480]  So there's a massive brainwashing program going on with this.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.480]  It also came out that most of the individuals responsible for the incidents in Cologne were
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:07.480]  from Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:09.480]  So they weren't even, they were from North Africa.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:13.480]  Again, this is the big problem that these crime statistics show that most of the crimes are
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:18.480]  being carried out by people from North Africa, from countries like Morocco, where people
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.480]  go on holiday.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.480]  I mean, it's not a war-torn country.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480]  Sure.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.480]  So I'll hand on this and ask you another question.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.480]  You've got a lot to do, a lot of articles to file, other breaking news that's just coming
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.480]  on infowars.com on an hourly basis.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.480]  How big a victory?
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.480]  Because I want us to not just be negative about what's happening.
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:39.480]  That's what the globalists are launching on all fronts because they're actually behind,
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.480]  in my view.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.480]  How big is it, though, that Bilderberg's being exposed at a level never before seen?
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.480]  I'd say three, four times as much this year than before.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.480]  The fact that they're running things to a great extent is happening.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.480]  The fact that there is a shadow government.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.480]  It always leads to the end of any shadow dictatorship as soon as the power behind the throne, as soon
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.480]  as the conspiracy is exposed.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.480]  Historically, I mean, I would say right now we have turned the tide against the New World
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:08.480]  Order, and I think all their offensives are really defensive moves like the Nazi offensives
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.480]  in the Battle of the Bulge and the Ardennes.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.480]  No, that's exactly it.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:17.480]  I mean, the headline on Drudge, which was our headline a few days ago, was populist panic.
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:19.480]  That's what they're in a panic about.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.480]  You see what's going on with Trump in the United States.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.480]  They don't control him.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.480]  Whatever you think of his policies or his rhetoric, he's self-funded.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:29.480]  He's outside of the control of these people.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.480]  That's what makes them nervous.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.480]  These people are control freaks.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:38.480]  Any political development that they don't have their hands on, it scares them to death,
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.480]  which is now why we're seeing the economic threats with Brexit.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.480]  Because again, that would represent a huge rejection of everything that these people
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:49.480]  have built for 50, 60 years.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:55.480]  Remember, we got the BBC documents out from 1955, which showed that Bilderberg wanted
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.480]  to create the EU, wanted to create the euro single currency.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480]  They did.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.480]  These are the people charting the Anglo-American establishment that runs about 70% of the
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.480]  world right now and wants world government.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.480]  The communist Chinese are allied with them to a limited extent because they want to run
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.480]  it themselves.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.480]  The Russians aren't.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:14.480]  I'm not saying the Russians are perfect, but you notice Russia has never been part of
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.480]  Bilderberg.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.480]  The globalist basically overthrew Russia with the communist movement to destabilize it.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.480]  Russia has finally thrown that giant spider off its back, and the globalists are very
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.480]  upset with Russia.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.480]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.480]  I mean, there have been statements on the record from top globalists over the past couple
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.480]  of years that, quote, Russia is no longer in the new world order and statements like
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.480]  that.
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.480]  So they want a unipolar world.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.480]  Whereas other countries, the Bricks countries, for example, want a multipolar world.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.480]  And that tends to work out better for freedom, better for privacy.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:51.480]  Of course, they have complete privacy inside this hotel, which is surrounded by a massive
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.480]  exclusion zone.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.480]  But we don't.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.480]  But we don't.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.480]  We don't have any privacy.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  They're going to dig into our lives.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.480]  They're going to dig into our emails.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:04.480]  We think yet they expect to get privacy every time they meet in secret for this lobbying
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:10.480]  confab, which is what it is, which is what Tillich admitted to us last night.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.480]  Well, simply incredible.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.480]  Paul, you guys are this is the best job you've ever done to all the crew for our graphics
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.480]  people to the people running the show.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.480]  Everybody amazing job.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.480]  Paul, we're going to go to break when I come back and do two quick segments with Rob do
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.480]  that I'm going to shift gears into Peter shift, joining us on the huge developments of the
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.480]  economy.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:29.480]  So important.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:35.480]  And then we've got a very informed person, Tim Kennedy coming here to talk about COG,
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.480]  talk about destabilization campaigns and more.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:41.480]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.480]  Joseph Watson.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.480]  Great job in 20 seconds.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.480]  Anything else?
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.480]  No, there's going to be a huge protest tomorrow left versus right.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480]  There could be violence.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.480]  There could be clashes.
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.480]  So we're going to be on top of that all day tomorrow.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:54.480]  Yeah, I really want you guys to stay back because I want to be able to get the full
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.480]  conference.
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:57.480]  I know Friday's a key day, but just please.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.480]  I know you guys have a lot of fearlessness, but I just don't want you guys to get thrown
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  into German jail.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:06.480]  So, so please try to hang back, but I mean, don't get hit with rubber bullets like jacari
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.480]  or or or bigs because I think this is going to get pretty bad tomorrow.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480]  Okay, we'll do that.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:14.480]  And then Saturday, some of them like to go walk about.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:19.480]  So that might be an interesting angle to pursue in terms of getting more information out of
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.480]  actual.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.480]  Well, I want to salute everybody that's there.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:23.480]  Godspeed, Paul.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.480]  We'll talk to Rob do it next.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:33.480]  Briefly, folks, speaking of Hillary criminal investigation being censored on Google searches
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.480]  and that's been confirmed.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.480]  Now they've backed off because they got caught.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.480]  It's an ongoing battle, folks.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.480]  Resistance and engagement is what defeats them.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:42.480]  So don't think as they're always after us.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:43.480]  We're losing.
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.480]  No, this is this is fine.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.480]  It's like weightlifting.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.480]  We're going to get stronger here.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.480]  It's like jogging.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.480]  We're going to get better.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.480]  We give up.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.480]  They they win.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480]  We never give up.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480]  We win.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.480]  We never give up.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.480]  We're gonna get stronger and empowered and and live in legend said, living like jelly fish.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.480]  Get your Hillary for prison shirts.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:01.480]  They hate this idea.
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480]  We're so close when we come back.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.480]  Josh Ernest is, I'm going to play the clip.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.480]  You know, admitting, yeah, I know, it's now criminal.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.480]  They've tried to spin that.
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:09.480]  They try to say it isn't.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.480]  That means something big is about to happen.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:13.480]  Folks, get your Hillary for prison limited edition, when this shirt sells out no more
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:17.480]  of this shirt, a new variance going to come out and that will be the final edition of
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.480]  the seasick, you know, obviously, she's going to go to prison or, you know, next addition
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:24.200]  if she gets elected president or indict Hillary or, you know, pray for the fall of Hillary.
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.920]  I don't know.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.960]  Infowarsstore.com, they cannot censor you wearing a shirt out on the street or it's much, much,
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.560]  much, much harder than digital.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.560]  They hate this.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.240]  You meet like-minded people, other patriots, and the small profit we make helps fund this
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:43.560]  very expensive project that is sending in salvos every day that are devastating the
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.760]  world government project.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.080]  And they just don't know what to do.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:57.400]  This is the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:03.600]  And Humpty Dumpty, Shadow of the Wall and Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.680]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.160]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.160]  Here's why.
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.040]  On the weekends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse, so
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.120]  please listen.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:22.280]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators,
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:26.760]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.760]  sun.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:31.920]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.320]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:37.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.920]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.040]  away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for infill
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.040]  war listeners.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.880]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:53.320]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:57.160]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:12.600]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:22.600]  This is a Kit Daniels article up on infowars.com, you cannot make this up.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:29.240]  Canada legalizes oral sex with pets, sex offender acquitted by a bestiality involving peanut
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.440]  butter.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.840]  Next it'll be, you're allowed to marry your pets and next you'll have to have fire hydrants
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:40.040]  at the Alamo, Draft House, movie theaters or wherever your movie theaters are in case
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.040]  you think you're a dog.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.640]  I'm not joking, Canada Supreme Court has legalized oral sex with pets as long as no penetration
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:53.360]  is involved in a ruling slammed by animal rights group, a seven to one in favor, ruling.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.560]  That means Canada has legalized Bill Clinton having sex with Hillary Clinton, a horrible
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.600]  joke meant for the media to pick it up.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.720]  Go ahead, White House media matters.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.640]  She's a war criminal killer, he's a sex offender in my view.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:12.360]  These are horrible perverts and so I think it's fair to put them and you know all of
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.840]  their ilk into this joke but I apologize to dogs or gerbils for that matter or cats
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:28.800]  or lizards I guess, any pet turtles into the same slugs, slugs into the same category
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.280]  as hair hitlery.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:34.160]  Briefly, they're trying to censor more and more, it's all over the news.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:40.320]  We need to have an email to contact you for breaking news, analysis, videos, information,
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.080]  promo codes for the shopping cart, infowars.com forward slash newsletter, go there, put in
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.840]  your emails so we can stay in contact with you.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:52.000]  A lot of huge discounts we sent you as well, we had like 50% off on t-shirts just a few
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.920]  weeks ago for folks that were on there with a promo code so really need to be a member
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.840]  of the info wars insider newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:09.880]  Separately, emails in Clinton probe dealt with planned drone strikes, couldn't be more classified
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.400]  and then meanwhile, Josh Ernest now admits it is a criminal investigation, that's coming
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:23.000]  up but I wanted to also just remind everybody that we sold out of living defense, I wasn't
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.920]  a plug in at the end of the hour, I'm gonna stop doing this a plug early because I run
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.120]  out of time, I realize I haven't plugged anything, we find our operation by selling these products
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:33.000]  plus they're the very best we can bring you.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.240]  Living defense is like 20, almost 30 known organic ingredients that flush out parasites,
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:44.360]  harmful organism cleansing, 120 capsules, check it out infowarslife.com, we ordered three
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.440]  times as much this time, took us six months to get it because it's all, that's the past
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.360]  California standards, we want to be the high standards, that's almost impossible to do
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:59.000]  and it's 25% off out of the gauge so it's selling out at a rate like four or five times
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.800]  what we thought and so it'll be sold out by the middle of the end of next week, in fact
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:07.960]  I may just raise the price back up to normal just so we don't sell out of six months, that
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.600]  would be a better business decision funder operation but right now it's there at the
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:23.880]  discounted price 34.95, 120 capsules, infowarslife.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139, I wonder if the
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.160]  government in Canada will legalize sex with parasites, now that would make it legal for
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:33.800]  Hillary and Bill to have Chelsea but reportedly Chelsea's Webster Hubble's daughter so what
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:39.640]  do you know and of course Michelle Obama looks like a snapping turtle so but you know it's
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.200]  not, it's the fact that she eats all this great gourmet food once you eat stuff worse
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.560]  than prisoner foods why I don't like Michelle Obama and why is the first lady telling us
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.560]  what to eat, we're going to break here in a moment and come back with Rob Dubbitt, Rob
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.240]  what are your observations doing a great job there in Dresden at the Bilderberg meeting
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.720]  covering it, what are your observations the last 24 hours Mike and Padre?
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:02.800]  Well last night right around dinner time I got a text saying hey there's a chance for
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:07.400]  a confrontation for the governor of Saxony so I grabbed all my stuff I literally had
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:13.360]  flip flops and a t-shirt on, I run down to where the church is, get my gear on, my friend
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:18.480]  Tillman was there with his camera and immediately as he came out we ambushed him asking him
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:22.640]  questions about Bilderberg I said is it about bringing more migrants into Dresden he didn't
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:28.280]  want to answer that but before all that happened our friend Max Bachman was able to get him
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:32.440]  inside and get him to admit basically everything we've been talking about it's a giant money
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:36.240]  grab that's what Bilderberg is, ways to funnel money.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:39.000]  A giant money grab that the credit of the euro wants to run our country, stay there
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.080]  back in 70 seconds, 3rd hour straight ahead, Tim Kennedy and more.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:53.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.840]  Hey everyone, Farm System Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:00.120]  know I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:04.000]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.680]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.480]  disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.760]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.920]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:21.720]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:26.040]  vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient easy way to incorporate nutritional
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:30.800]  raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:35.120]  nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids that needs to do its
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:39.800]  healing work, you need to check out InfowarsTeam.com.

[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:45.840]  be very grateful.

[01:59:55.480 --> 02:00:02.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:15.520]  The world is a dangerous place because we lay down to fill.
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:21.200]  Your listening to the resistance is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:24.520]  who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:28.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.120]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:42.360]  It's taken me 21 years to get to this point to build this limited media operation that
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:48.720]  is a very slender, hard, double-edged dagger at the heart of the globe.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:55.640]  A black arrow, if you would, used token iconography.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:04.120]  There are other black arrows in the world, but not many, and this is one.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.920]  And notice 21 years on air to build and have the crew at finally to the point to be able
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:17.440]  to get in the same arena and have a shot, but you, the people, represent a thousand
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:23.120]  black arrows that can take down the smog of our age.
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:29.000]  You must take action and realize that you're unstoppable if you simply take action.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:35.360]  Don't believe in the state, the big establishment church, believe in God.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:36.360]  There's a gun and ammunition.
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:44.280]  You're going to have to use it in emergency.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:47.880]  Come to that point, folks, organize collapse of the world.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.000]  All right, let's go to Rob Dew, InfoWars, now we need a director, reporter on the ground
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  in Dresden.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.840]  Go ahead and finish up your report going out there and getting one of the Bilderberg members.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.160]  I got to say, this has been a devastating year for Bilderberg.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:02.400]  They have got to be upset, and they are like cornered rats inside that facility, Rob.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.480]  Yeah, in fact, Paul and I talked about this today in another report.
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.080]  What is going to happen to this man now that he's kind of spilled the beans on Bilderberg?
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.680]  He was just getting into the kids' table.
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:15.200]  You will probably not be groomed for anything future, unlike what we saw with Bill Clinton
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.520]  and Tony Blair, both who were able to rise to prominence in world leadership after attending
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:22.280]  their respective Bilderberg meetings.
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.840]  Also, I want to talk about the young lady and man who were arrested for holding a cardboard
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.240]  sign possessing bread and a tent.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:34.560]  They were brought out to a park out a little ways from here and kept in the sun for hours,
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:36.600]  and they were spread eagle the whole time.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.120]  They had to sit spread eagle, and anytime they tried to close their legs to get comfortable,
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.120]  they were told to bring them back open.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.360]  The guy was punched and kicked several times.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:48.160]  She was released, and even though she was being handcuffed and detained, they said she
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:49.160]  was never arrested.
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:50.600]  Then they took the man to jail.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.520]  He finally got released early this morning.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.760]  Boy, these are real men.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.800]  For literally cardboard, bread, and a tent.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:02:59.960]  That's what it's come down to.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.200]  We also went to the pizzeria where we got a tip about they wanted to have 24-hour access
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:08.000]  to this man's pizzeria, not even connected to the hotel.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.560]  There's actually a road in between them, but they were also bringing furniture through
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.560]  there.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.560]  We went and asked him about that.
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:17.800]  We had to go through a translator, and the guy looked at us and said, no, no, no comment.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:19.920]  He put his head down and walked away.
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:22.040]  He obviously is hiding something.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.080]  Finally, Lindsey Graham, as far as we know, has not appeared here at the meeting yet.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:30.920]  We did call his office today, and they confirmed he would be going, and he was actually speaking
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.920]  on the Senate board.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:34.200]  But he may be dressed as a woman though, Rob.
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.200]  That's true.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:38.200]  That's true, but we do plan on asking him, and when we do see him, what are his plans
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.040]  to subvert a Trump presidency?
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.680]  Because he's crossing party lines, working with Democratic operatives that are here,
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.960]  the big financiers, and we're going to see what his plans are, and hopefully we can get
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.960]  a comment from him.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.960]  I've already contracted.
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:50.960]  That's right.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.280]  Well, of course, you've got the big left-right battle coming up tomorrow.
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.520]  You've got, Bilderberg likes to sneak out and walk around.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:57.000]  What else are you looking for?
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.080]  Well, those would be the main things, and also, we are searching for the migrant camps in
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:03.080]  the area.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.280]  That's the ongoing mission that we've been doing.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.800]  They try to hide them, you know?
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:10.240]  They do, and the Germans are very good at hiding them.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.160]  They put them in nondescript buildings.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.120]  We do know what their fencing looks like, the fencing they like to use in the company
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.120]  that puts it up.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  I haven't seen drone footage yet.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.160]  Is the drone operating properly?
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:24.600]  The drone is operating properly, but in here in Germany, with all the police crawling around,
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.560]  it is definitely a punishable offense by being arrested.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:32.560]  So I don't know if we're going to get any drone footage at this time, but we do have
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:33.560]  footage.
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:34.560]  I don't know if it's illegal.
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:35.560]  It's certainly not.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:36.560]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:37.560]  Go ahead.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.320]  Jones, we do have footage of Wolstein Castle via drone that is simply, simply amazing.
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.320]  So stay tuned for that.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.440]  We're going to do a whole report on the history of it.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:48.520]  We've just been so busy gathering intel and confronting the scallywags of the Bilderberg
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:49.520]  group.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.960]  Well, you've done well, my friend.
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:54.000]  We salute the Info Wars reporters out there on the ground and all you that support us
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.960]  and make this possible via radio and TV.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]  Thank you so much, Rob.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.120]  We'll be back on The Economy.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:03.760]  This is really key intel straight ahead.
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:10.480]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com emails in Clinton probe dealt with planned drone strikes.
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:15.160]  Some vaguely worded messages from US diplomats in Pakistan and Washington use a less secure
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:19.360]  communication system at the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton's handling
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.880]  of classified information is a series of emails between American diplomats and Islamabad
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:30.680]  and their superiors in Washington about whether to oppose specific drone strikes in Pakistan.
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:36.240]  The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the low side government slaying for a computer
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:41.640]  system for unclassified matters as part of a secret arrangement that gave the State Department
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.200]  more of a voice and whether a central intelligence agency drone strike went ahead.

[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:54.080]  Investigation Probe, some of the emails were then forwarded by Ms. Clinton's aide to her
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:58.600]  personal email account which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban

[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.920]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:06.280]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:08.040]  Why is this so good?
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:12.720]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:17.320]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:18.320]  my system.
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:24.320]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:26.360]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:31.440]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.720]  going on everywhere.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:33.720]  These are all parasites.
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:36.440]  Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.680]  You have the neem in there.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.760]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:44.040]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:45.040]  All right.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.040]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:48.360]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.360]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.360]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:54.040]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:57.320]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:59.520]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:14.560]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:28.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:42.000]  Infowars is turning into a special ops, I guess, commando base or something.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.760]  Jim Kennedy's back there, he's already worked out for like three hours this morning and
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.440]  shot for two hours.
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:48.440]  And he's coming on the show at 1.30.
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:52.440]  And he's back there in Anthony's office while they're having meetings on the drawing board
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:56.200]  about TV shows and survival programs we want to do.
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:02.960]  And he's in red, white, and blue underwear boxers, like just trying to rest so that he
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.960]  can come in here and do the show.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:06.680]  And then he's going to go work out again later today.
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:11.440]  I guess we're turning into a barracks or something.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:13.800]  But I tell you, we've got to get geared up and get prepared.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:19.520]  And more and more, we're going to have shows on shooting, shows on survival programs on
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.880]  you name it because things are getting crazy.
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.200]  And Tim Kennedy is the soldier, soldier, not just one of the top middle heavyweights
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:28.200]  in the UFC.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:33.000]  I mean, the guy, of course, is one of the most highly decorated guys out there, a lot
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.920]  of secret, the highest level units that he obviously can't talk about.
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:41.720]  But it's great to have him as a consultant and, you know, popping in on the show.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:45.960]  He's also one of the hosts of Hunting Hitler and a bunch of other big TV programs he's
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.960]  got lined up.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.040]  But he lives right here in Austin.
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.040]  He loves the show.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:50.040]  He's a patriot.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:53.720]  And so we're talking about some of that exciting stuff with him coming up at the bottom of
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.600]  the hour.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:00.200]  Speaking of getting prepared, stocks drop as government bond yields hit fresh lows.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:05.920]  Wall Street Journal, why big money investors think it's time to hoard gold, CNBC, a summer
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:11.960]  panic is starting to brew across markets, market watch, Forbes, the former Fed president,
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:16.760]  all my very rich friends are holding a lot of cash.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.520]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:25.960]  Meanwhile, Schnabel of Germany, minister, warns the EU, warns the UK not to leave the
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:30.000]  unelected EU that they didn't vote to get into, or they'll just cut them off completely.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.800]  Well, I mean, that's the parasites threatening the host.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.360]  Meanwhile, exclusive Bilderberg planning to trigger financial collapse.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.920]  The last time we said that was 2006, we're on record.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.920]  My film in game came out a year before the 2008 situation.
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.720]  They said they're going to trigger the housing collapse to bring in a consolidation of control.
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:48.720]  And you know what?
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:49.720]  We were proven right.
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:52.480]  Well, our same sources say they're getting ready for it right now.
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:54.640]  So that is a big, big deal.
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:59.400]  We just confronted a Bilderberg group member yesterday that was outside the hotel in Dresden.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:01.920]  Also George Soros preparing for financial collapse.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:02.920]  Does he know something?
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:03.920]  We don't.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:07.000]  Michael Snyder, economic collapse blog up on infowars.com.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.680]  So I like some of the other guests we have on.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:13.800]  I'd say they're about 90% accurate, like Mr. Dent.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.360]  But we've been the last year or so saying who would be right about this?
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:20.520]  Who would be right and say that oil prices would start going back up?
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:23.760]  Who would be right to say gold prices in the aggregate this year would start going back
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:24.760]  up?
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.400]  You know, who would be correct about all that?
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:28.440]  And I would say overall, I'm not pooping anybody.
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.040]  I would say that Peter Schiff has been more, more accurate than anybody else we've interviewed.
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:35.280]  And we only have folks on that are about 90% accurate or more.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:37.840]  So it's not like it's bad to not be as accurate.
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:42.040]  But it is a big debate though about, are we going to have inflation or deflation?
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:45.680]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but when they're printing more money and issuing more garbage
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:50.520]  and more derivatives at any time in history, worse than 2008, tells me down the road paper's
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:51.960]  going to have a problem.
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:56.960]  But now I'm not holding your money so liquid whatever is what you want in my little, you
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.960]  know, brain.
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.440]  But who knows, Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital joins us billions under management
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:06.720]  and of course son of the famous Patriot fighting the IRS and the corrupt government, Erwin
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:08.400]  Schiff who passed recently.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:12.040]  He joins us to discuss all this EuroPak.com.
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:13.480]  So there's your little intro.
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:14.640]  You've been dead on.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:20.480]  Let's just revisit your predictions where we're at currently and your next flotilla of predictions.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.680]  Peter, but congratulations on being accurate.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:26.320]  Though it's kind of like congratulations, you know, you're predicting the Titanic just
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.760]  hit an iceberg and we're going to sink.
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:28.760]  What do we do?
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.560]  Well, you know, I still think it's early even to congratulate me and I'm not going to, you
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:38.440]  know, take credit prematurely, but it sure does seem like things are proceeding according
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:43.120]  to the playbook that I laid out, you know, even though people still believe that the
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.800]  Fed is going to be raising interest rates at some point and that we have a legitimate
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.120]  recovery, the dollar is still falling.
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.680]  More importantly, gold is rising, gold stocks again, pretty much all the gold stocks hit
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:59.560]  new 52 week highs yesterday.
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:05.120]  And here we have today with the Dow down about 150, the Nasdaq's down over 70 points.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.840]  Gold is up yet again.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.360]  It was up a little higher earlier this morning, but the trend is still there.
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:17.200]  And you know, you talk about all these people who believe that there's no consequences from
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:23.000]  the last eight years or seven years of 0% interest rates and three rounds of quantitative
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.840]  easing, how can anybody believe that there is not a bill that's coming due for all that?
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.680]  Because if you look at what Alan Greenspan did, we had interest rates at 1% for not even
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:36.000]  two years.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:41.200]  And then we gradually raised them back up above 5% over a couple of years, no quantitative
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.120]  easing programs at all.
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:49.840]  So what Alan Greenspan did was very mild compared to what Bernanke and Yellen have done, yet
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:55.160]  the consequences, the payback for that monetary policy was the worst financial crisis since
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.160]  the Great Depression.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.160]  Sure.
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:00.360]  And even with the numbers you're saying 1.8% economy, I mean, what's the real economy?
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:01.360]  Negative 2%?
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.880]  Who knows how negative it is because the numbers aren't real because the inflation rate is
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:08.000]  being artificially suppressed.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:15.400]  But my point is, if we had such a bad consequence of the reckless policies under Greenspan, just
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:17.600]  imagine what's in store for us now.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:22.240]  I mean, this is not just going to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.120]  This is going to be the worst crisis, including the Great Depression, because what we're
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.440]  about to enter into, and I think we've already entered into the beginning of it, but I think
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:36.320]  it's going to get a lot worse as it progresses, but this is going to be greater than the Great
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:37.320]  Depression.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:43.520]  Meanwhile, you've got President Obama and all sorts of Democratic talking heads out there
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.560]  trying to talk about how great this economy is.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:48.760]  And Bernie Sanders running around like an idiot.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:54.240]  Oh, yeah, look, you know, we had this awful jobs report last Friday.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:59.320]  Not only was it way below estimates, they revised down the prior month, we had another
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:04.600]  mass exodus of workers out of the labor force to get the labor force participation rate
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:10.080]  back down to the lowest it spends since the early 1970s before women entered the workforce.
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.280]  So if you look at the labor force participation rate for men, it's the lowest it's spent
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.120]  in the history of the Republic.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:18.160]  And so this has been a disaster.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:23.520]  And all of these so-called economists who are Democrats who are trying to say that the
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.800]  Republicans are wrong for criticizing the economy if a Republican had been president
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:32.480]  for the last seven years, and everything was exactly the same.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:36.840]  Can you imagine what they'd be saying about the rise in income inequality, the rise in
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:43.240]  poverty, the collapse in real wages, the collapse in home ownership, the mass exodus out of
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:44.240]  the labor force?
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:48.920]  I mean, this is statistically the worst economy really in our lifetimes, yet because there's
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:53.160]  a Democrat president, nobody wants to criticize him from the left.
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.440]  Well, the show isn't about who's right and who's wrong.
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.480]  It's about knowing the future and getting prepared, obviously, and we'll talk some about
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:00.480]  that.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:02.800]  But I mean, you did say you thought oil would start going back up.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:03.800]  Oh, yeah.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:07.280]  I mean, you did predict that they would, you know, basically start talking about going
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:11.200]  back, you know, to, you know, QE Unlimited, you predicted how they would go up when they
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:14.880]  went up, but you've also been predicting that, you know, gold would go back up.
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:18.120]  Oh, they're trying to artificially suppress it, but, you know, worldwide the demand's
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.120]  going back up.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:24.680]  And they admit in elite publications that, indeed, the quote, elite are hoarding cash,
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.680]  gold, you name it, building armored bunkers at record levels.
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:29.200]  I mean, what have these people done?
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.760]  Well, you know, yeah, I mean, the price of oil has almost doubled from its low.
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.520]  It got back above, in fact, I saw it as high as about 5160.
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:43.880]  It's since pulled back below 50, back in the 49s, but the trend now I think is up and it's
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:47.800]  going to be even bigger once the dollar really starts to cave in.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.680]  I mean, the dollar index still hasn't broken down.
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:51.880]  It's going down.
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:54.560]  But I think, again, people are still holding out hope that.
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:55.560]  Sure.
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:56.560]  What's the time frame?
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.640]  I know you don't want to go out on a limb, but just you're one of the most accurate guys
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:16:59.640]  out there.
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:00.640]  What's the time frame?
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.560]  What do you really think when you sit around the coffee table talking to your wife?
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:03.960]  Well, you know, it doesn't matter.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.320]  I think it's happening right now, when it's going to accelerate, you know, from a march
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.880]  to a stampede, I think people have to protect themselves now.
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:13.680]  I mean, look at our strategies.
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:17.120]  Look at how much gold stocks are up or silver stock, talking about gold and silver.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.000]  I mean, you're talking about stocks that have tripled quadrupled so far this year and Wall
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.680]  Street still doesn't own them.
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:25.000]  So this, I think, is still early in the scheme of things.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.120]  So what your listeners to do, if they didn't follow my advice, you know, three months ago
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:34.040]  and six months ago to get on this train is you haven't missed it.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:35.320]  I mean, you still got to get on.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:38.200]  You've got, you've got to get out of US dollars, get out of US stocks.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:42.920]  You should be talking to my representatives at your Pacific capital, set up an account,
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:47.400]  take your depreciating dollars before they really collapse and diversify abroad, get
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.800]  some money into Switzerland and Singapore and New Zealand.
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:51.640]  And by the way, Peter Schiff is not a sponsor.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.400]  I'd call him, give him to be one of the guys, a great guy, but I do agree.
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:00.000]  People should be diversifying, but I mean, look, let me ask you this question and Peter,
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.080]  looking at the timeframe historically here, I understand it's already here in most of
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:06.080]  the world.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:10.040]  It's already here in the US at a trot and you're talking about a gallop of stampede.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:11.040]  What's the timeframe though?
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:15.040]  I mean, I know you don't, I mean, speculatively, you know, I think the election could be a
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:19.640]  callous because I think one of the reasons that Janet Yellen is reluctant to admit
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:24.840]  how weak the economy is, is because she doesn't want to interrupt the Hillary Clinton narrative.
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:29.560]  I mean, the whole idea that Obama saved us, everything is great.
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.480]  And now we should turn over the reins to Hillary.
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:33.760]  So we're in low land till the election ends.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:34.760]  Yeah.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.600]  I mean, but things are getting so bad.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:42.200]  Can the Fed hold out and still pretend everything is good until the election?
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:46.000]  But certainly by the time the election is over, there's no law, there's no reason to
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.320]  put up the pretense.
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.120]  So I think by the end of the year, the Fed's going to have to come to the rescue, at least
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:54.960]  what it's think is to the rescue, they're going to cut rates, they're going to try to
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.680]  have some kind of QE program.
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:59.880]  But again, this is pouring gasoline on a fire.
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:02.040]  None of this is going to help solve our problems.
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.600]  This is why we have a problem.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:06.560]  The Federal Reserve has created this problem and they make it worse.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.480]  Let me ask a politically solver's question, but the audience wants to know, I'm worried
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:13.640]  Trump's going to get in and then they're going to hold the collapse back till then and then
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:15.520]  blame it on him.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:19.240]  Well look, I don't think they'll be able to blame it on Trump if it happens, you know,
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:22.320]  right when he walks into the office.
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:26.480]  So but I think the crisis is going to happen regardless of who we elect.
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:31.720]  I do think that Trump has a better chance of doing the right thing than Hillary.
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:34.160]  Hillary has no chance of doing the right thing.
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:39.360]  Trump might see it all depends on, you know, he does a good job of identifying the problem.
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:40.760]  His solutions are all wrong.
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:42.720]  Now, maybe he knows they're wrong.
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:46.800]  Maybe he's just playing politics because he wants low interest rates.
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:48.560]  He wants low interest rates as he's a builder.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:50.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:54.600]  We've got our guest here, Peter Schiff, Johnny, is EuroPacificCapital.com.
[02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:55.960]  He's been dead on so far.
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:59.480]  So we're going to come back and I'm going to ask him what's front and center on his
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:00.480]  radar.
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:01.480]  Not just my question.
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.480]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:08.800]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist, author of 85 books and founder of the National
[02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:13.240]  Chain Meyer Clinics to tell you about two your health liquid vitamins.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:17.880]  I've been taking these every day for over a decade now and I try to encourage every one
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:21.000]  of my clients to take them every day and there's a number of reasons.
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.160]  First of all, it's the best vitamins you can get.
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:25.840]  It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients in it.
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:29.880]  And then the most important reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my
[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:32.360]  patients is because it's got brain food in it.
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:34.160]  It's got the essential amino acid.
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:38.920]  It's got trypsin, phylloelony, tyrosine, and choline, vitamin B6, and these chemicals
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:42.840]  that are all natural from food turn into the brain chemicals that make you happy.
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.800]  To your health is delicious.

[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:06.200]  Fresh liquid waste was so valuable to the improvement of health that in the 1800s there
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:11.480]  were 160 spas set up in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to dispense fresh liquid waste
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:16.120]  to the sick and aged. The results were restored health and a return of youth. Fresh liquid
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:20.020]  waste supplies the most easily digested of all proteins and ranks higher in protein
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:24.640]  value than the egg. Unfortunately, the current methods of processing waste causes proteins
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:29.960]  to twist, fold, and become denatured. This makes them non-functional in the body. Like
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:33.960]  a lock and key, proteins do not work in the body unless they retain the shape that nature
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:38.640]  gave them. We at Synergistic Contrition believe that our technological enhancements restore
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:43.040]  the protein structures of our way to the shapes that nature originally gave them. The results

[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:13.440]  Peter Schiff, Peter Schiff of Euro-Pacific Capital. Instead of me asking the questions
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:16.320]  here in the five minutes we have left, you've got the floor. What's front and center for you?
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:22.400]  Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's when are people going to wake up? You know, I was
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:29.360]  on this guy because I was in the CBC a couple of days ago. And still, they acknowledge that,
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:35.440]  okay, things seem to be slowing down. They're not as good as we thought they were, but they still
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:41.520]  don't understand the gravity of this situation. They still have no clue how much damage has been
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.800]  done to the U.S. economy these last seven years. They still have confidence, have faith in the
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:51.200]  Federal Reserve, have faith in the dollar, believe everything is going to be okay. And
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.720]  they just think, well, we're at a little bump in the road. They don't realize that we've run
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:59.280]  out of road or the road has now come to the end and we're going over a cliff. That is actually
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:05.600]  what's going on. And to me, this is more obvious than the problems that I was a warning about in
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:12.400]  2007 that came to a head in 2008, yet all the people who were oblivious back then are equally
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:18.400]  clueless now. And to me, this should be even more obvious, especially since we just have that example
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:24.080]  of what happened in 2008, fresh in everybody's mind, even though it's still what, eight years ago,
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:27.840]  it's all the same people. They were here. They lived through it. It's not like they had to learn
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:32.400]  about it in a history book. This isn't like the Great Depression, where it's very easy for a
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:38.640]  revisionist textbook to you learn the wrong thing. We experienced this ourselves, yet we're still
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.840]  not prepared for what's about to happen, which again, is going to be much worse than the 08
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:48.480]  financial crisis. And it's going to be a dollar crisis. It's going to ultimately be a sovereign
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:54.560]  debt crisis. And it's going to bring this whole bubble economy to its knees. And Americans are
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:59.040]  not going to be able to get away with this anymore. We can't just keep pretending we have a real economy.
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:04.000]  We just can't keep running trade deficits and borrowing money to pay for imported products.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.360]  Meanwhile, we have a bunch of people who are pretending to work. 100 million people that
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:10.960]  don't work pretending. Peter Schiff. Okay. Everything you said is totally true. Two
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:15.280]  plus two equals four. You've been absolutely right. Here's the rest of the stories Paul Harvey would
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.800]  say. They're not going to follow common sense like you just said and stop pretending. I think
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:25.840]  they'll get even worse. Nationalize things, start wars. I mean, historically, they'll make the wrong
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:31.040]  decisions to stay in power. So what do you expect them to do? I mean, look what they did in 2008,
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.680]  make it worse, give themselves trillions. I expect them to make the wrong decisions until
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.080]  they can't do it anymore. I mean, eventually the market won't give them any more rope. We will have
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.320]  hung ourselves on the rope we already had. So at some point, we're going to do the right thing.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.120]  But my portfolio, what I'm doing with my clients, I'm betting that they keep doing the wrong thing
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:52.480]  because there's no indication they're going to do the right thing. So what are they going to do?
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:56.240]  They're just going to print more money. They're going to take interest rates down. These clowns
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:00.320]  are probably even going to try negative interest rates. Even though they're not working in Europe
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.640]  and they're not working in Japan, they're dumb enough to do it. Because when it comes to central
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:09.360]  bankers, if one of your friends jumps off a bridge, will you jump off the same bridge? Because
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:15.760]  everybody is doing it. It must be the right thing to do. Lemmings. Wow. And look, what you're doing
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:20.400]  with your bet is risky, but it's not. I mean, it's risky in that short term. It looks scary,
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:25.040]  but we know historically, there's no way they can extend this forever no matter how much voodoo
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:30.320]  they've got. I don't even think it looks scary in the short run because it's already unfolding.
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:34.400]  The dollar is already going down. Gold is already going up. No, you're right. The Fed has said
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:39.280]  they're out of bullets. The Fed has admitted it isn't working. Yeah, well, I mean, but the thing is
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:43.760]  their bullets never work, but they're not out. They have a machine gun. They can print as much
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:47.760]  money as they want. If they actually think money printing works, there's no limit to how much
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:51.440]  they admit it's not working. So how do they have the cake and eat it to you? You've seen the statements
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:54.800]  they go, no, this isn't working. We're out of bullets. So what does that mean? No, no, they've
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:59.200]  never admitted that they still believe their policies were a success. That's how clueless they
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.040]  are. They still believe that their policy a few statements where they've admitted it's not working.
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.160]  I mean, I've seen some statements, but no, I mean, you're right. Then they kind of like out of one
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:10.640]  side, they go, this isn't working, but then out of the bullhorn, they say it is. No, they don't
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:15.440]  accept responsibility for their role in inflating the housing bubble. They don't accept their blame
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:20.160]  for the financial crisis. They still believe that all their policies were correct. And so the next
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:24.560]  time the economy turns down, they're going to do it all over again. See, they're still pretending
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:29.680]  we have a recovery. All right, Peter, you've been dead on. Thank you so much, EuroPak.com. Have a
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:34.640]  great weekend. I'm going to try to get my family ready. I tell you, he's back during the green
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.360]  room. Tim Kennedy coming here to talk about economic collapse, preparedness, why we're really
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:44.560]  joining forces to try to get people rallied and awake. And yes, folks, there he is with Joe Biggs
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:49.280]  back there salivating over Joe Biggs's new sniper rifle. I feel sorry for the social justice
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:53.760]  wars. I think they're putting us in reeducation camps. We'll be back. We're on the March,
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:59.120]  the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:08.960]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com exclusive Bill Clinton's lover before and after his marriage
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:14.640]  tells how lumpy Hillary with her fat ankles and hair on her toes, scheme to get her to lie on 60
[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:19.520]  minutes about Bill's other affairs. There appears to be no limit to what Hillary will do to destroy
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:24.720]  her perceived enemies. Dolly Kyle writes in her new bombshell book, Kyle began sleeping with Bill
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:29.920]  Clinton after high school and their affair didn't end until he moved to the White House. Billy was
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:35.360]  a sex addict. Bill was undone by Will Chamberlain's claim to have slept with 20,000 women. That's 10
[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:40.160]  times more than I've had, he told Dolly. Dolly says Bill told her he and Hillary, who he called
[02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:44.720]  the warden, needed to have a baby so we could appear to be a normal couple. When Dolly met
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:50.000]  Hillary May 20th, 1974, she wore a misshapen brown dress like thing that must have been intended to
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.640]  hide her lumpy body. The garments stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her thick calves
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:59.520]  covered with black hair. She sounds just like social justice warriors we see at all the Bernie
[02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:05.040]  Sanders rally. Maybe she secretly does feel the burn. Clean pure drinking water. You can't

[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:16.320]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:20.960]  Right now, I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:27.280]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache.
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:32.240]  John has a long mustache. It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:36.320]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:46.160]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:48.800]  People that had guns or things they wanted. They just took them away.
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:52.800]  Where? Re-education camps. That's what they call it.
[02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:57.440]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:00.880]  or kids belong to their families or recognize kids belong to whole communities.
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:05.120]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:12.240]  And we need the type of camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:15.600]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.440]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:24.720]  had built assembly centers. Come on, I'm a star citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:27.680]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:31.440]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's not far away.
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:35.840]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:40.560]  knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:46.080]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States.
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:48.080]  And they're disloyal to the United States.
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:52.800]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:02.000]  This is what we're doing here unless you're not a kid about it.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.080]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:08.160]  Put your gun down, really?
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:17.120]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:19.200]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:27.360]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:30.080]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:41.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:45.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're facing a red dawn scenario, a sneak attack scenario,
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:47.840]  but not from Cuba right now.
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:53.360]  We're facing it from big globalist combines like Bilderberg and Davos and George Soros who admit
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:56.800]  they're bringing in a planetary world government where they make the rules,
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.520]  they pick the winners and the losers and where Homeland Security for eight years under Obama.
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  It had some problems before, but under Obama, gun owners, veterans, conservatives, libertarians
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:13.120]  are the number one enemies as they bring in massive amounts.
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:14.400]  It's not in the tens of thousands folks.
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:17.120]  They're covering up the number just like they cover up the illegals.
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:19.920]  The board patrol tells us they complete the smuggling process.
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:24.800]  It's got to be in the hundreds of thousands of refugees here, five million in Europe.
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:28.080]  They're just ignoring all the laws. They let people in that have TB.
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:32.400]  Our government is acting like it's actually out to get us because it's not our government,
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:36.480]  in my view. And we have seen the last four years you heard it here first with our guest
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:42.400]  Cy Hirsch and Colonel Schaefer and many others that our own military said we're not going to
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:47.040]  back Al Qaeda in Syria. They sort of give in the intel the Russians.
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:50.640]  Now, you knew that four years ago here, that was declassified in the last six months.
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:53.600]  That was released in the press in the last six months.
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.680]  So the good news is there's still America left.
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:59.360]  That's following the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to a certain extent.
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:03.760]  And you've got criminal alien globalist groups from outside this nation
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.520]  that are absolutely preparing to bring down this nation and the rest of the world in a
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:13.840]  financial economic collapse warfare. You name it, all the ingredients are there.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:17.040]  So Tim Kennedy, who is known as a UFC fighter.
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:22.800]  I mean, I know better because I follow actual what's going on in the country that he's one
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:27.280]  of the most experienced special forces soldiers ever, many, many, many tours around the world,
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:32.400]  some of the most classified elite units, which qualify him to talk about COG
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.240]  destabilization programs because they study them on both sides.
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:40.560]  And when he came in a few weeks ago and said they're planning destabilization and collapse,
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:42.400]  that doesn't mean they're going to totally implement it.
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:45.200]  But it means it's being looked at. And it's not just on the drawing board.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.920]  It's being moved forward right now. And he can correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:51.280]  But from all my information and just studying this in our context,
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:55.040]  this is like a nine on a Richter scale. Previous stuff was a two or three.
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:59.760]  This is all the alarm bells are going off. All the political sensors are going off.
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:02.320]  The elites are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:05.040]  They're weaponizing the media now more than ever.
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.600]  They're pulling out all the stops in my view.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.880]  And so, I mean, I'll just tell the story and then give them the floor.
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:13.760]  It's hard to shut me up. But he was already here today doing some work with us.
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:14.560]  So I said, please come in.
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:20.400]  That St. Stoner, I've known him since high school.
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:22.960]  These guys have been training together for a few years.
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.960]  Got to know him. We talked about preparedness.
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:32.480]  He talked about how I should go out and do some training and just get prepared for what's unfolding.
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:36.640]  And then the more and more we talked, we just said, well, why not actually produce
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:42.560]  some internet tutorials that are also exciting and entertaining so folks watch them
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:46.000]  on how to get ready to get prepared and how to promote a true patriot
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:52.720]  or dangerous freedom are your terms culture that is the antithesis of this jellyfish,
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:57.920]  coward culture, emasculated male, disempowered females.
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:03.360]  So just a pro human force multiplication that you're so well trained in that I've organically
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:07.920]  developed to reach out and empower the American people
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:14.160]  to resist by becoming healthy and involved and being leaders and that will automatically
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:17.920]  counterbalance the attempts they've engaged in to make us all domesticated.
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:21.280]  And so we're launching this true patriot initiative that you'll see roll out in the
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:24.800]  next few weeks and next few months on top of your incredible schedule and mine
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:29.040]  and UFC and special things you're doing on the side and hunting Hitler.
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:30.720]  I mean, you're a guy that works 18 hours a day.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:32.960]  It's going to be around somebody who has more energy than I do.
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:34.400]  Tim Kennedy, it's great to have you here with us.
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:35.120]  Thanks for having me.
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:35.920]  All right. So you got the floor.
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:40.240]  Tell us about true patriot and where we stand and where this country is going,
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:44.480]  because as things get so bad and as the situation gets bad, you're going to see
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:48.000]  more and more alliances and more and more patriots coming together with the courage
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  you've got to be associated with in full wars, my friend.
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.440]  It's scary sometimes, but it's exciting.
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:57.920]  True patriot is this idea that we're going to empower people to,
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:03.040]  for the first time, grab on to what it means to be a patriot.
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:10.080]  Right. The loose assumption that we can just live our life in liberty,
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:13.840]  that we can grab our freedom and do whatever we want, it can never be realized.
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:19.520]  Unless you train, unless you prepare, unless you understand what individual responsibility
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:24.480]  looks like. So a true patriot, if you go to infowars.com forward slash true patriot,
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:29.520]  we are rolling out not only tutorials, not only impassioned truth telling videos,
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:35.600]  but we're giving you the skills to be just that, an individual that can live its life
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:39.600]  in liberty and freedom. We're showing you how to shoot, we're showing you how to grow your own
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.600]  food, we're showing you how to exercise every single one of those beautiful amendments that
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:47.040]  were written by our founding fathers. They were brilliant, they were geniuses,
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.360]  but they knew what was coming and they knew what they had just fought in 1776,
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.280]  and they never wanted to see that again. So they wrote these things and said,
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:59.520]  you have to be able to, just like a muscle, exercise these frequently, because if you don't,
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:05.440]  they die. And that's what true patriot is. We are passionate in this idea of freedom and liberty.
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:11.280]  I have been to countries that believe in socialism, that try to enact communism.
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:17.440]  They don't work. The one thing that we know works is freedom. And I've fought for it,
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:22.640]  I've killed for it, I've bled for it, now I sweat for it, now I teach it. And you have to,
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:27.520]  you have to buy onto this idea and believe it and train it every single day,
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:30.160]  and that takes hard work. And that's what true patriot is.
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.320]  Well, there's the saying, you know, you talk the talk, you walk the walk, and it's absolutely true.
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:38.880]  We have to physically go out and plant gardens, we have to physically spend time with our children,
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:42.080]  we have to physically turn the TV off, we have to physically go for a jog,
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:46.160]  we have to physically stop eating GMO. If we do all those physical things,
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:50.640]  then the mind awakens and turns on, then we'll go to city council, then we'll run for office.
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:54.880]  But we have to physically get out of the malaise that so many patriots are in physically,
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:59.600]  myself included, a long journey from just totally, only being cerebral and gaining like
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.280]  80 pounds and getting totally out of shape, nice being great shape. It's been a slow journey,
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:07.920]  but I've gotten back in probably 90% back to where I was. And again, then I'm that much better at
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.760]  fighting the globalists. And, you know, as you guys have done in the Green Berets and the Special
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:18.240]  Forces, going behind enemy lines in occupied tyrannical nations, organizing the people to
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:23.200]  resist tyranny, you know, the motto, to paraphrase it, you know, is what, what free the oppressed,
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:23.840]  defend the oppressed.
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:27.440]  It's suppressed, and the oppressed a little bit. Yeah, it's to free, freeers the oppressed.
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:30.640]  And so getting back to that, yeah, our government may be run by criminals,
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:33.920]  and we may be going into a world government, but America is still alive. All of us are seeds,
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:38.560]  and Tim Kennedy's a big seed. I'm a seed, you're a big seed to grow, to grow the mighty oak. And
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:43.600]  to have somebody like Tim Kennedy here, you know, activating in America in the real battle for the
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:49.200]  Republic is a true leadership model to everybody else in the military and out of the military.
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:52.400]  Because, you know, obviously in the Pentagon, you're one of their top, you know, promoters,
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:57.040]  patriots, you know, one of your big names out there. Here you are on your own with Info Wars,
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:00.160]  knowing what you're doing because the country's in so much trouble, folks. And you're going to see
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.560]  more of this. People are in the government who are good. Most of them are good. Incorporations
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:08.000]  are good. They have just been compartmentalized. They've been taught they don't have any power.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.600]  But Tim's motivated. Yeah, he's a super soldier. He won't tell you that himself, but he's the best
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:16.080]  there is. I've been told by the other folks in the military, and he's here to defend the Republic.
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.000]  But I want to ask you a question. What are you doing now? Because listen, I don't do this because
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.720]  I'm some hero. I do this because instinctively, I can't be run over and be a slave without standing
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:28.960]  up. I'm just a regular guy, 20-something years ago, got involved and see where we are. Imagine
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:33.360]  when Tim gets involved and you get involved, we're looking to win this thing, not just be,
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.920]  you know, overrun and defeated or, you know, hide out in the woods. We're going to go out
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:42.480]  and take this country back. You hit the nail on the head when you said it takes work.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:49.040]  It is so easy to control a populace that is weak and that's pathetic that they have no
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:53.440]  skills to do anything. They have to rely on somebody else. You have to have somebody give you
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:56.720]  a phone because you can't earn enough money to go get one for yourself. You don't even know
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:01.760]  how to grow food. You don't know how to change your oil. You are literally living your life
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.160]  as a slave. So individual responsibility, you know, it's the idea of dangerous freedom.
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:10.960]  I would prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. Slavery is, no, it's not in chains.
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:16.320]  I'm out picking cotton. That's not what I'm saying. When you give every single bit of who you are
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:21.440]  and the strength of you person to somebody else and make them provide what you need, your subs.
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:26.720]  Let's show Trigley Puff. I know you almost cry. I mean, we laugh because we're uncomfortable.
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:30.800]  We're not pleased the social justice warriors that can't talk and just scream racist. We're not
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:35.120]  pleased to see Trigley Puff that's like, you know, four foot nine and weighs 300 pounds and
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:40.080]  sucking a bottle screaming ban free speech. We are threatened by the masses of dangerous
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:44.400]  lemmings like them that will run us and our families over a totalitarian cliff. And we're
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:50.960]  here to, as Paul reveres to say, now is the time to reactivate and take action. Yeah, you know,
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:57.360]  my safe zone, it's about 2000 meters because that's how far I can shoot. You know, I train that.
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:02.720]  I work that. And all the way from 2000 back to five meters, every single different range setting,
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:06.640]  I'm pretty efficient with a gun. So my safe zone, it's not you, you know, saying a word that I'm
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:11.360]  uncomfortable with. It's me training and being knowing that I'm proficient to be provided for
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.600]  my family and make sure that they're safe. And that's my safe zone. Well, think about this.
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:20.560]  They have university studies. You can pull them up 7 million people down of starvation or an
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:24.960]  association starvation for malnutrition, the Great Depression. We were 90 percent rural.
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:29.040]  Half the folks are roughly were totally self-sufficient. The others partially. We are now
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:35.120]  89 percent urban and of the 11 percent that are rural, less than half are self-sufficient.
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:39.600]  Five percent of the country is self-sufficient. I'm not self-sufficient compared to my dad who
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:44.320]  grew up on a farm and he's a doctor, but my dad can fix anything. I am an idiot compared to my dad.
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:50.240]  He is nothing compared to his dad. We are becoming jellyfish. Yeah, but it's never too late. You
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.440]  know, that's why we're that's why I'm saying just right now, what are you doing? Where are you doing
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.400]  your research? What are you doing with your game? What time are you getting up? What time are you
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:03.440]  going to bed? We were built to go to bed tired. You're not supposed to sit in your chair. You have
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:08.000]  more energy when you bust your ass. I've got a study right here. Go ahead. It's like the doors
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.920]  are open, right? You're living. You got the blue pill. You got the red pill. One is you're going
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:14.640]  to live in slavery and you have no idea what's going on. They're just going to provide substance
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:19.120]  for you. The other one is this realization, this existential experience and the more that you do it
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:22.240]  every time that you train, every time that you work, every time that you exercise one of those
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:28.000]  freedoms, it's like another layer of these. I have more energy than when I was 18. I can't even
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.080]  hardly stand it. The more data I get and the more I realize I'm resisting tyranny but building
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:36.160]  something good, it's like I'm genetically meant to do it and my brain and body goes good. You're
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:40.080]  doing what you're supposed to. Here's all this energy and power. Boom. They want you to be lemmings.
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:44.000]  They want you to be powerless. They want you to have no individual responsibility. They don't want
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.200]  you to know how to grow food. They don't want you to know how to change your oil. They don't want
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:51.600]  you to know how to... That's what's manly. Taking care of your kids, being a good father, being
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:56.640]  healthy. I said exactly. You know, you want to talk about being a good parent. It's believing and
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:00.480]  knowing that you're doing everything in your power to ensure that they're safe and have everything
[02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:05.440]  that they need. Not a teacher, not a principal, not the government. That's not their job to raise
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:10.800]  your kids. It's your job. You raise them. You educate them. You give them their morals. You give
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:17.360]  them what teach them what justice is. That is your job. Don't give that away. And that has to be
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:22.480]  hard work. And every single time that you start working hard at one thing, the stronger you get
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:28.560]  and the weaker they get, the stronger we are as a people, the weaker they are. Believe it and start
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:32.560]  doing it. That's right. And who are we? I mean, what is a true patriot in your view? And I think
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:38.240]  your view is just... It's true. It's prima facie. It's not some secret we found. We're not cult leaders.
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.640]  We're not special other than the fact that they've so enslaved people and put them in a trance.
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:47.600]  This is seen as bizarre right here. Pure Americana. I'm seen as weird for being upset about them.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.080]  The federal court just ruled they can ban our guns in public. You can't have a gun out in public.
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:54.560]  I mean, this is serious. That was yesterday, folks.
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:04.080]  A patriot is somebody that has the ability and the strength of will to live their life how they
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:09.840]  want to. Not somebody tell me what I can do. With that, there's an assumption that you
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:15.360]  are giving away some of the security, some of the safety that can be provided. I'm saying,
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:21.360]  I don't want you to help me live my life. Free range humans. That's it. Leave me alone.
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:26.000]  Well, we know it sounds good to live in this control box, but people die. They turn into jellyfish.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.320]  The brain dies. The body dies. They admit it. Humanity is in deep trouble. Every metric shows
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:37.840]  disease, ignorance. It's all exploding. They can't control people that can do things on their own.
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.480]  You know, a bully goes to the mall and sees a bunch of shuffling wimps who don't even know about
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:46.240]  their surroundings and things. You know, oh, I'm a criminal, right? I can feed on them. But somebody
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:50.640]  like you, we've talked about this. How upsetting is it to go see... I don't think it myself was
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:54.160]  really tough or smart. I didn't even care to these people. I'm alive. They're dead. What is it like
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:57.840]  for you, one of the most highly trained people, works out probably the hardest in the world?
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.400]  What is it like for you to see how domesticated they are?
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:10.160]  I just see weakness. It's not that I look at them and I feel sorry for them. I see an opportunity
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:17.280]  to plant a seed because I have hope. Hope is not a plan. We have people running on that idea.
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:22.400]  At least you're optimistic. Yeah. There's a chance. The soil is fertile right now. It can be
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:27.200]  cultivated. I am planting seeds. Every single time that you watch one of my videos that you
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:31.280]  go to infowars.com forward slash true patriot and you watch something, I'm planting a seed in your
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:36.480]  mind to go out and work, to go out and shoot, to go to the range, to practice free speech,
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:41.760]  to go and figure out what the difference between alternate current and direct current is and how
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:46.240]  that works in your electrical system. You're like, go do something that makes you stronger.
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:49.680]  Find out where the meat comes from. I mean, you guys have gone out. I mean, separately,
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:52.800]  we kind of had the idea for this few months ago because you and Shane and others were just going
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:57.040]  out to visit, you know, Mennonites making their own milk to make a deal to get your own milk weekly
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:50:01.440]  or, you know, or, or going out like, you know, see about a co-op about, you know, raising vegetables.
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.960]  That is so human, so manly. That's what it's really all about. Not strutting into some bar and,
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:10.720]  you know, you know, acting tough. I'm not saying it's bad to go to bar folks, but you know what I
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:15.360]  mean? We've got to get balanced and actually get back to the soil. Every, I'm going to skip this
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:19.600]  break. This is so important. Everything the globalists are doing is about taking us out of our
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:24.480]  natural environment. Why is that? Because it makes us, it makes us weaker. You know,
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.080]  you know, in the United States, I was talking to my sister, I was like, um, where's the best
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:32.080]  place to get natural milk? I just want milk from a cow to give my family. I want to go look at the
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:36.000]  farmer. I want to meet the cows, make sure I got nice, clean, healthy source. And she's like, well,
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:40.640]  you know, it's illegal in most states. I'm like, what? Wait, I can't even buy milk from a cow.
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:43.840]  Of course you come from farmers in California. Like, this is how I was growing up as normal.
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:47.920]  I could just go drink milk. I'm going to make cheese. We can get butter, but it's illegal in
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:51.440]  like 42. That's a big reason why you're a lot more healthy though. As you grew up in a farm and
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:55.760]  didn't even know you were escaping. Do you even know where your food comes from? Do you have any
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:01.680]  idea? Do you go and meet the animal that you're going to put in your body? Do you have any idea?
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:04.720]  Do you just walk into the grocery store? Don't care about what steroids are in it,
[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:08.800]  what the government puts in it, or blinding. And again, I know our audience, most of them,
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:12.880]  actually know this and nobody's bad. I'm still not doing the things I should do most of the time,
[02:51:12.880 --> 02:51:16.720]  but I've turned the ship around. I've changed the direction. This is about getting our audience to
[02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:22.480]  also carry this message with powerful videos, informational, on to others, that there is hope
[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:26.800]  and lifestyle change isn't just about looking good. You know, like all these TV shows and things
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:31.280]  say, it's about taking your country back, starting with your body, with your family, but also a lot
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:36.400]  of hardcore, you know, pro-America political messages as well. So we're sitting there talking,
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:40.960]  you're already going out to, you know, talk to these Amish or whatever, you're already going
[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:45.280]  to have to do this. Why don't we send a camera crew? Why don't we go show urban farming that's
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:48.880]  going on right here in Austin, Texas? Why don't we show what true sustainability is,
[02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:53.200]  not this phony UN garbage? I mean, talk some more about your plans with this, because I'd say 80%
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:59.680]  of this is your brainchild. It's so easy to do. You know, people are scared. What does it mean to
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:04.480]  be able to be self-sufficient? You know, I'm talking solar power. How do you do that? I'm
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:08.880]  going to show you, you know, like, how do I go and set up my own urban farm? We have farms here
[02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:15.120]  in Tastic Darrow, or that's where I grew up. We had one acre of parcels, and we had community
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:18.320]  farming where one person would grow one thing, the neighbor would grow another, and then would
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:22.880]  share, and everybody had enough to survive. And then you come into here, Austin, Texas, a huge
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:28.720]  cosmopolitan gigantic city, and we have tons, hundreds, maybe even thousands of people that are
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:32.480]  now turning the page and saying, no, I'm going to grow everything that I need here on my own home.
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:37.120]  I'm going to have goats. I'm going to get their milk. I'm going to have cows. Just eat, like, and
[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:41.120]  by the way, that check makes the whole globalist corporate model that is designed to make us
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:45.840]  independence. Exactly. So why is this happening spontaneously? Just the last three, four months
[02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:50.640]  we started talking about this, because we instinctively can see and then look at the news and see
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:54.880]  everything's unraveling. They're getting ready to do bail-ins. You look at these giant cities,
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:59.600]  they're time bombs. The food is just in time delivery. Within a day, everything's off the
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:04.080]  shelves. We already see riots all over the world. Things are degenerating quickly. We're not just
[02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:08.720]  here saying move to the country and have a year supply of food. You'll die in a year if that's
[02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:14.240]  the case. If things really collapse, which we're trying to stop, you will need to know how to fight,
[02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:18.960]  how to move, how to communicate, at least how to identify other patriots. This is how they
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:25.520]  intend to totally control us, and it's gone from being a possibility to a probability. Tim,
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:29.680]  I mean, I know you can't get into classified stuff, but clearly, COG ramp up for civil
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:34.560]  emergency, ramp up for martial law, all over the world is accelerating. Without a doubt.
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:39.440]  It's frightening to look at what, 15 years ago, when I first went to Special Forces,
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:43.840]  and the things that we were training, we're talking direct action, hostage rescue,
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:52.560]  specific time-sensitive targets type things. Two in the recent days where we're doing a lot of
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:59.200]  civil unrest, where we're looking for destabilization and planning for both how to do it and what to
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:07.920]  do if it happens. As a patriot, as a libertarian, scares the dog shit out of me.
[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:12.320]  We'll believe that, but absolutely. And as somebody trained, because Delta Force under
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:16.000]  Clinton did do destabilization in 1999 in Seattle to set a precedent,
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:21.280]  with that training, now you're trained for destabilization, also how to counter it,
[02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:24.160]  you can then sit back and we see destabilization going on, don't we?
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:31.040]  Yeah, but that is why it's so important. You can't control something that doesn't need you.
[02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:35.760]  I don't need anything from anyone. We are completely self-sufficient. Food, water,
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:42.320]  shooting, self-defense, everything in my home and my family is protected and provided for,
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.160]  so I don't need them to give me anything. Oh, listen, I've got to learn all this now,
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:49.440]  because I know more than the basic investigative guy, but nothing compared to my dad.
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:57.040]  My dad at like 67 is like a robot that can build a house, build anything, fix cars, fix machinery,
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:01.760]  build fences, grow food great, cook dinner great, skin things super quick.
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:05.440]  And I'm like, this guy's like a combat robot when it comes to like building things
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:09.920]  and doing things and his dad was like that. And I'm like an idiot. And I really feel guilty
[02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:14.000]  that I'm not passing it on to my son. So that's why I want to try to do your sheepdog training.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:17.280]  I want to get involved. I want to try to just not sit there and say, I know everything,
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:21.120]  but I'm going on the journey of trying to be more of a good father and a human.
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:27.600]  That's it. You said journey. That's what it is. It's a daily dedication to this journey of being
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:32.560]  free. And my dad loves cooking and loves fixing things. He's like powerful. He's excited. He gets
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:36.960]  off on it. And I'd be like, kid, oh God, more chores day. He loves to clean the garage. He loves
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:41.280]  to help somebody change a tire. But I just realized that's what a man's like.
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:46.400]  And you're going to have access to how to do it. Right here. Not only do you want to learn how to
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:50.960]  do it, but you're going to own it. It's going to be part of what, if you want to understand what a
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:57.040]  patriot is, what being a real libertarian is, it's being free. And being free means you have to work
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:01.680]  to have that freedom. It's not free. Freedom is not free. So we're going to have how to skin an
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:05.760]  animal. We're going to have self-defense videos. We're going to have sheepdog courses that anybody
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:10.400]  can come to. We're going to have how to grow your own food. And it's not about having a monopoly
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:15.200]  on it or we're the best. It's that we're putting the alarm out. Hey, the founders were self-sufficient.
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:20.400]  That's why they could kick butt. Okay. And again, the whole enemy plan is about us being domesticated.
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:24.480]  We have to start moving in the other direction. Everybody already instinctually picks this up.
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:29.920]  Now's the time. Could not be more of an important time than right now. Has to be right now. We can't
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:35.200]  wait another day. We have to do it right now. Listen, you can come and watch our videos, film
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:39.520]  your own videos. If you have a farm, go grab a community. It's about community. We'll feature
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:44.480]  your, we'll come out to your farm. We will. But it has to grab your neighbors, grab your friends,
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:48.560]  grab the people from your church, grab the people from your golf club. I don't care who it is.
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:53.680]  Grab people and get them involved. Not just America, but the human condition is under attack.
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:59.520]  We're going into servile bondage, artificial synthetic world. We're breaking the matrix,
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:04.720]  folks. We're coming out of it. Freedom is addictive. It is. When you get your first
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:08.560]  taste of what Liberty truly feels like, I mean, it's the greatest hit in the world.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:14.720]  Animating contest of Liberty just opens your eyes and all you want to do is have more of it. And
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:19.760]  anytime you see that that is being restrained, it infuriates you. When you get passionate about
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:25.920]  this, believe it, start doing it, fall in love with it and grab everybody you know and with open
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:30.320]  arms. That's right. They want to control us with clowered and pivot. They want to collapse society
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:34.560]  where we're getting food for the amount of the back of a truck. And look, even if they accelerate
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:39.600]  the collapse and this message doesn't get out there completely, it doesn't matter. It's the seeds
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:45.600]  in the long-term battle that will defeat them. Yeah. Right now, the soil is fertile. It is
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:49.520]  waiting for somebody to come and cultivate it. And that's what we're doing. We're giving you the
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:52.960]  information. We're planting the seeds and those trees are going to grow. And we have to believe
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:56.480]  we can change the world. We already are. Look at how InfoWars alone, we're just one small part of
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:00.640]  this, has dominated Bilderberg, forced world government out in the open. And it's gone from
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:04.960]  us being national news every month, every day. And it's not a power trip. It's actually, though,
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:10.480]  a great responsibility to know that we're sitting here in an organization that is one of the strongest
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:14.560]  points of liberty in the world. The enemy makes fun of us. They attack us. They try to demoralize us
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:18.480]  because they're scared of us because they know they're globalists. They've come in and hijacked
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:22.720]  this nation. We've got five minutes to the next segment. But Tim, the website's infowars.com,
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:27.120]  four slash true patriot. There's some promotional videos stuff up there, but this is just the launch.

[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:12.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:32.720]  We can't get into the behind the scenes stuff that nothing classified but stuff Tim's telling me
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:37.280]  about. A little bit of heat, you know, from some of the brass whenever he comes on the show,
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:42.080]  but most people in the military are really good patriots. The mainstream media will misrepresent
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:46.880]  what I say about Jade Helm and then say, Alex Jones says there's martial law in 2015 and then
[03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:50.160]  we never said that. They just misrepresent and then some people in the military hear that and
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:54.320]  think, oh Alex is saying bull, but the truth is if you actually follow what we say, then people know
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:01:01.200]  it's dead on. We're never going to agree on anything and I don't think any adult is going to be able
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:07.360]  to say, we agree on everything. We're individual minds and that's totally fine. But what we both
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:12.800]  believe in is liberty and freedom and we're going to do everything that we can to push that envelope
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:18.240]  to its hopefully breaking point. Absolutely. Tim Kennedy's our guest here. We've got David Knight
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:23.360]  taking over in the next segment. It's been an amazing broadcast so far, but some really cool
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:28.480]  stuff you guys have shot. There's the one minute promo piece that we can play here in the background
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:34.320]  without audio or maybe with the audio of you guys were pulling out of helicopters and sharp shooting
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:40.560]  and doing yoga. You name it, just all fusing it together. But give us some other examples of some
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:46.720]  of the projects. We go into a lot about the liability and assets of you as an individual.
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:52.480]  What are the weaknesses and strengths of you as a person? Are you strong? Are you healthy? Do you
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:56.720]  have good food? Is there a balance between, I'm not saying like serenity yin yang stuff,
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.400]  I'm saying like just as a person, are you a healthy person? Because the chassis,
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:04.880]  the chassis, you as a person has to be healthy for you to be able to reach out and to do more things.
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:11.440]  If that's weak, then you can't do anything. It seems like it's crazy and outlandish that
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:15.520]  people are repelling out of helicopters that people are. I like your war face. You got the
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:22.880]  handgun and the dagger. I think the camera guy was like, so what do you think about people
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:29.840]  taking your guns away? And that's what that scene was. I was just like, no, no, not a chance.
[03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:34.720]  Not a chance. No, I love freedom too much. You're not going to get those. And the reason
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:39.200]  that we have all of the other ones is because of our freedom. Let me ask you this in closing,
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:44.320]  there's an acceleration obviously in preparation for collapse. Do you think there's a way to stop
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:47.680]  the collapse? I mean, I've got a stack of mainstream news here saying collapse today. I mean, I hope,
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:54.800]  I don't want to collapse. I hope it's not coming. No. So how you stop a collapse is to build a
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:59.280]  strong foundation. And what's the foundation of this country? It's the people, right? So the people
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:04.480]  have to be strong. Right now we are weak. So you're trying to stop the collapse? That's exactly
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:08.160]  what I'm doing. That's what true patriotism is. I'm giving people the opportunity to become stronger
[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:12.720]  as individuals with individual responsibility with the assumption of risk that I'm going to work hard,
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:16.080]  that I'm going to be a productive member of society. That I'm going to pay my taxes,
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:22.480]  my fair share of taxes, not 45% my fair share. Then we as the people become strong, the foundation
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:26.640]  becomes strong, the collapse can't happen because we as a people are strong. That's right. They're
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:30.640]  trying to overwhelm us. The globalists want that to happen in closing and we can reshoot some other
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:35.520]  stuff today. I appreciate all your time. I know a lot of people, I mean, I used to 15 years ago
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:39.360]  go to the military trying to take over. So I was mad at the military, not at military people themselves,
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:43.760]  but, you know, that the military was being trained for this. I didn't realize that the
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:47.360]  military was some of the most awake people. Now they're super awake from what I've experienced.
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:51.280]  The police are super awake from what I've experienced. That's why Soros is going after them.
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:56.160]  What is your experience? I mean, how many guys in special forces say are pretty much aligned with
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:02.000]  your views? I think every one of them. I mean, there'll be a weirdo out there every once in a
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:06.480]  while, you know, that like, I love their beautiful minds and it's a great perspective because,
[03:04:06.480 --> 03:04:10.080]  you know, the guys that are coming from some of the Ivy League schools, special forces is a very
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:15.840]  unique group of guys because everyone's way too educated. They're way too smart to be shooters.
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:20.400]  And so you have this intellectual, cognitive group of dudes, 12 of them that are always arguing
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:27.920]  back and forth, but the vast majority, 80, 90, 95% are all barreled share of freedom fighters.
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:30.800]  We got a couple of videos to shoot, but I'm going to go to break, come back and do five more minutes
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:34.160]  than pass them a ton of the day, but not because I want to get more into this because the most
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:39.920]  a group, the group that I see that's the most awake is the patriots in this country. So it's
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:43.920]  kind of this paradox where the globalists want to use the military to carry out their
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:48.160]  world government takeover, but then it's the military that's the most awake and the biggest
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:52.080]  supporters, the Constitution Bill of Rights and who actually put it all on the line because they
[03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:56.560]  do believe in something. So you have this scum running things with these wonderful people under
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:05:00.800]  them that are basically enforcing this. How do you deal with that paradox? Tim Kennedy will be right
[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:10.160]  back. Joe Biggs here with info wars.com emails in Clinton probe dealt with planned drone strikes.
[03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:15.040]  Some vaguely worded messages from US diplomats in Pakistan and Washington use a less secure
[03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:19.360]  communication system at the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton's handling of
[03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:24.880]  classified information is a series of emails between American diplomats in Islamabad and
[03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:30.400]  their superiors in Washington about whether to oppose specific drone strikes in Pakistan.
[03:05:30.400 --> 03:05:36.560]  The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the low side government slaying for a computer system
[03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:41.520]  for unclassified matters as part of a secret arrangement that gave the state department
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:46.160]  more of a voice and whether a central intelligence agency drone strike went ahead according to
[03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:50.320]  congressional and law enforcement officials briefed on the federal bureau of investigation
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:54.960]  probe. Some of the emails were then forwarded by Miss Clinton's aide to her personal email
[03:05:54.960 --> 03:05:59.520]  account, which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York. You can find

[03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:08.800]  or call 888-253-3139. Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors
[03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:14.560]  would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:22.000]  defense. 60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:28.640]  of their own air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:34.240]  Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[03:07:34.240 --> 03:07:40.560]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught
[03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:48.800]  with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic
[03:07:48.800 --> 03:07:54.480]  foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex has
[03:07:54.480 --> 03:07:59.280]  turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it
[03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:12.160]  starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:26.960]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:35.440]  Tim Kennedy is my guest for a few more minutes and then we're going to hand the baton to David
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:40.160]  Knight but he's planning some really exciting stuff actually going out reporting for us.
[03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:44.880]  But not just reporting as standing up talking but looking at the scenes, looking at what's
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:50.640]  happening. Basically getting people to start thinking outside the box like somebody in
[03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:55.120]  Special Forces would do or like the globalists would do because Special Forces is doing it
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:59.680]  to try to win the fight or protect the people. The globalists are looking at it and how to
[03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:05.680]  control the population. That's why they want you in a zombie state. So Tim, talking more about that.
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:13.120]  Man, go to a supermarket. Go to Walmart and look at people. Look at their eyes are down.
[03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:16.160]  They have no idea what's going on around. You're going to go on Walmart and show that?
[03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:21.440]  Yeah. Within cameras. Yeah. So one of our sheepdog courses actually take you to supermarkets.
[03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:26.640]  We walk around and when we come outside I say, you know, where do you think this person lives?
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:29.600]  Pointing at a car and just looking at the bumper stickers like, oh, that person lives in this
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:33.520]  community. Their kids go to this school. They're part of this club. And then we watch the person
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:37.520]  come out of the supermarket, head down to the shopping cart. They don't even see the 10 of us
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:42.880]  standing next to their car because they're so self-centered and ethnocentric. And they think
[03:09:42.880 --> 03:09:47.440]  being self-centered, that's how they're winners. We've been taught only caring about yourself.
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:51.920]  Yeah. Weak. Weak. That's what it is. Or they twist it and go care about others, give up your life
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:58.560]  to the government. Well, no, that's self-centered too. It's just bizarre. So I'm excited. When I
[03:09:58.560 --> 03:10:03.840]  say go exercise your freedoms, it's not just, you know, your right to bear arms. It's not just
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:08.080]  being able to buy raw milk. It's also your freedom of speech. It's also your freedom of religion.
[03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:12.960]  You know, it's also you gotta exercise everything like muscles or losing. Yes. Yeah. So there's a
[03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:16.960]  report out actually on that today. There's a report out showing that people that are really busy
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:22.400]  doing a lot of things. They live longer. They have higher cognitive ability. They're more fulfilled.
[03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:26.320]  They have a better sex life. Everything. I mean, they're alive. Other people are dead.
[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:34.240]  Why time star people are happier. I feel so sorry. Like I feel bad for people that get up to do the
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:39.200]  nine to five, come home, have a beer, crash on the couch, watch some football, just get all this
[03:10:39.200 --> 03:10:43.200]  stuff that is getting put into their brain and into their body is toilet. It's trash. And then
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:47.200]  you look at like me and my friends, my group, my community, you know, the Jake Sines, the
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:52.800]  Shane Steiners, you like these guys, like we live life at a different level. We experience so much
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:57.840]  more. We do so much more and I have nothing but like sympathy for, well, don't compare me to you
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:01.520]  guys physically, but I do work at night or a lot of other stuff and it's empowering. And as I've
[03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:06.400]  heard exercising more, I had even more energy and my life's just so good. It's crazy, but it is a
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:10.960]  scary paradox because all these jellyfish and folks are so self-centered. They're so unhappy.
[03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:16.160]  They're so depressed. They admit they are so they get more lazy, more self-centered and buy more
[03:11:16.160 --> 03:11:20.880]  into the trendiness. They're total prisoners. I just want to see them free. The average jellyfish
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:25.840]  gets off on somebody dumber than them. It makes them feel good. It makes me hurt. Yeah, it breaks
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:29.840]  my heart. And especially when they get to the point where they're in so much pain physically
[03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:33.040]  and emotionally. Now they're going to the pharmaceuticals and saying, hey, I need this
[03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:36.640]  because I feel so depressed or they go into the psychologists that went to schools that are
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:42.080]  completely controlled by the world. That's the trap. Briefly before you go, let's get more into
[03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:46.080]  the military because we were talking about this. That is so exciting to hear. I've said 95%
[03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:51.360]  of the active duty or recently out special forces folks. I don't care if it's the Navy,
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:57.280]  the Marines, you know, the army, whatever it is. They are the most awake, charged up patriots that
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:01.440]  are fully aware of every angle I find. The police have big problems. They've been globalized. They've
[03:12:01.440 --> 03:12:05.600]  been put under different edicts. Some of them are bad. The culture is degenerating. But I wondered
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:08.560]  why George Soros and others were trying to stir up this war with the police because they want to
[03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:12.640]  federalize them with their strong cities. You an initiative. This is a real takeover folks. Okay.
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:17.280]  So I realized, well, they're the second most awake group. I mean, I was always wondering why,
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:20.720]  even though I bashed the police a lot when they were doing bad stuff and projected on to all of
[03:12:20.720 --> 03:12:24.960]  them, say 10 years ago when I wasn't more sophisticated, they were still so many times big
[03:12:24.960 --> 03:12:28.960]  listeners and would just kind of smile at me and say, you'll wake up someday, even though they do a
[03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:32.160]  lot of bad stuff because they're giving those orders and I'm not defending that. They're the
[03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:38.320]  next most awake group. Is that an accurate statement? Yeah, it is. You know, when we become
[03:12:38.320 --> 03:12:42.720]  soldiers, we raise our right hand and we say that we're going to protect the Constitution
[03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:50.160]  for domestic. That is protect the Constitution. The Constitution is the document that empowers us,
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:54.720]  that gives us those freedoms. So when you want to talk about a group, a populist that is awake,
[03:12:54.720 --> 03:13:01.120]  that is alive, it's because they have sworn their life to death to protect the one document that
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:05.920]  gives us our freedoms and liberties. That is the most important thing to me and to all of my friends.
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:09.920]  It's the Constitution. So how does that paradox work where we've got such incredible corruption at
[03:13:09.920 --> 03:13:15.840]  the top? I mean, undisputed, pure evil now in both parties, but really bad with the Democrats.
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:20.800]  I mean, that's really rotting. You can smell it from here and then you've got such great people
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:25.120]  that are actually under it. But now I've learned so many times just quietly not going along with the
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:31.120]  agenda. That's not mutiny. When your country's been hijacked, that's duty, isn't it? Yeah. It's not
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:34.800]  like we're disobeying orders, but we know what the right thing is and we do the right thing.
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:40.560]  You know, I'm not over there killing people. So we have oil and I'm like over there killing.
[03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:48.000]  So we have an opportunity to put somebody that we believe might be more negotiating to our
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:53.600]  ideas. I'm killing really bad people. And so we're, we make a difference. You can't tell us,
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:56.720]  but you personally killed some pretty famous terrorists, I've been told. I'm by others.
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:14:02.560]  Yeah. I mean, I've been in Special Forces for 15 years. I've been a Special Forces sniper,
[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:08.000]  a Ranger, you know, Green Beret. I'll be really bad at my job. If I hadn't killed bad dudes,
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:13.520]  I'd be like the worst guy ever. It's like, it's like a mechanic. And you knew Chris Kyle?
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:19.120]  Yeah. We worked same place at the same time and deployed on the same missions.
[03:14:19.680 --> 03:14:22.800]  I mean, obviously it's Hollywood, but generally how accurate is that movie?
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:31.520]  He was a very, very, very, very talented sniper. You know, he believed in protecting his soldiers.
[03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:34.400]  And that's what a sniper does. And I'm told in competition, you're one of the top snipers in
[03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:41.120]  the world. Are you not? I get beat sometimes, but not often. I shoot three, four days a week
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:44.160]  and compete at the highest level in sniper competitions.
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:48.800]  Did you ever compete against Kyle? Just out there at the base? No, no, no. I know he was a
[03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:58.640]  seal, but you were an army. But yeah, we, a very healthy rivalry. Sure. Well, then looking at that,
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:02.720]  and obviously you follow orders. What I was talking about, and of course you know about this,
[03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:07.200]  four years ago, General Dempsey, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:12.400]  he and other admirals and generals, they went to the White House and I was told this a week
[03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:16.160]  after it happened. And it was years later, told us confirmed. And Cy Hirsch came on the show and
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:20.080]  said, no, you broke that. That was true. Cause we had Colonel Schaefer, but other sources off
[03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:23.360]  record that gave us even more that they went, we're not going to be the Air Force for Al-Qaeda.
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:27.280]  We're not going to do this. Then Rand Paul came out and Ted Cruz months later and said that,
[03:15:27.280 --> 03:15:31.360]  but it was the military itself that actually went and said, we're not going to go over there and
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:35.280]  kill Christians. We're not going to back ISIS at Al-Qaeda. And those people like Tosh Plumlee,
[03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:40.080]  Blue the Whistle, it was a CIA contractor, you know, talking about that. So that's a big deal
[03:15:40.080 --> 03:15:45.680]  that really since been gauzing and on the military has been saying no to criminal orders. And I know
[03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:49.200]  you don't want to sit there and say that on air. That was above you where that happened. But what
[03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:53.840]  type of discussions were there in the military when that happened? And we know it's right and wrong.
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:58.880]  We know it's just and unjust. We know what freedom looks like. And we know what the Constitution
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:02.320]  stands for because we swore to protect it. And we're going to do everything in our power,
[03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:06.720]  both, you know, passively within our ranks or officially through the channels that we can,
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:12.080]  or in battles. We're going to do everything that we can to do the right thing. You know,
[03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:16.000]  they're, you're not going to like, look at the most awesome shorts in the world right now.
[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:22.240]  We love freedom. And you're not going to be like, put us behind a desk in front of a microphone
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:25.440]  or in front of a bunch of generals. We're going to say the exact same thing. And by the way,
[03:16:25.440 --> 03:16:28.160]  you didn't know you were going to be on the day you were up here working after you worked out.
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:31.520]  And like you were back there just resting after a huge, what, what three hour workout
[03:16:31.520 --> 03:16:35.440]  about to shoot some videos. And I said, come on the air. So that's why there's a suit on top of
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:41.520]  American, American flag jacket. I got my gun, my pocket. I got my, my awesome shorts. I walk in
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:47.040]  and go, Hey, quit napping. You're going on air. All right, I'll get to work. Poor special forces
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:50.160]  soldier just wants some rest and I won't let him. We got three minutes. We got a break and I'm
[03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:54.240]  going to hand it over to David Knight. Again, there's just some basic videos that are pretty
[03:16:54.240 --> 03:16:59.120]  powerful up at info wars.com forward slash true patriot, dangerous patriot. You'd rather,
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:03.840]  you know, have the dangers of freedom than the, you know, security of slavery. But history shows
[03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:07.840]  as Benjamin Franklin said, when you give up liberty for supposed security, you get and deserve
[03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:14.720]  neither. I mean, the most insecure thing is being a jellyfish. And right now it's just getting
[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:17.840]  started. The true patriot, you know, we're just, those are teasers. Those are like, Hey, look at
[03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:22.000]  this. Get passionate. Get believe in this idea. Get emotional about this. We're about to flood the
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:25.840]  site with it. Yeah, you're going to get more. This is just the beginning. Like when is the next
[03:17:25.840 --> 03:17:30.240]  thing coming as fast as we can do it as much as much as we've already shot a ton. There's a,
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:34.720]  there's a lot more coming. So just get excited. Grab your friends, grab everybody that you know
[03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:39.520]  and get on the idea. Get on the train of liberty. All right, brother. We'll stay right there. We're
[03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:42.800]  about to go to break. And in that, I know you didn't want to plug it earlier. I said, Hey, plug
[03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:47.040]  the other stuff you're involved in. I mean, this is an info war and we need people to support what
[03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:51.840]  we're doing, whether it's the sheepdog training, which I know is always over full or whether it's
[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:56.800]  your work with, with Ranger up great and amazing patriot clothing. And then also you've got all
[03:17:56.800 --> 03:18:01.840]  the other stuff you're doing, you know, leave the charge there with UFC. What are the best places
[03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:06.800]  for folks to find Tim Kennedy information? Tim Kennedy MMA on most social media platforms,
[03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:10.640]  you know, like when I see a community, like I reach out and find the groups of people that,
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:15.200]  that are part, are part like you, like we even the shoes I wear, woobies, like it's made by
[03:18:15.200 --> 03:18:19.680]  special forces guys. Like I can dead lifted them. I can jump out of helicopters with them.
[03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:24.400]  Like I want a pair of those. I'll give you a pair of whatever. Everything about my life
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:30.400]  is symbiotic. And so, you know, hop on board, get on, follow info wars, follow me, Tim Kennedy
[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:35.600]  MMA, both on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, obviously, but you're going to get a ton of
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:39.760]  true patriot for me. So you get go. Well, I'm just excited because it's great. You're used to
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:43.440]  organizing the stuff and leading it. We can just turn you loose and you're just all the stuff we've
[03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:46.880]  been shooting. They've been shooting is amazing. Yeah. And the great work, Shane Stoner and the
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:50.240]  crew, my only problem is I need to arc up more camera people. We are so overwhelmed and also
[03:18:50.240 --> 03:18:55.680]  it takes money to produce all this. We have this living defense that we only had in stock one time
[03:18:56.480 --> 03:19:00.880]  and it all sold out. So I produce three times more. It's got like 27 ingredients that pass
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:04.800]  California standards. So, you know, the air has more lead in it than the, than they allowed to
[03:19:04.800 --> 03:19:08.480]  be in a product. So this is as clean as it gets. It's, it's, but it took us six months to finally
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:12.160]  get all the ingredients and have them all tested clean. That's what causes so much money is the
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:16.000]  triple testing and on each ingredient. It's killing us, but we do it to have the very best
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:20.720]  products out there. Plus we know we're targets. So this will flush the parasites out like nothing
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:24.880]  you've seen. It's so good for your kids. You name an adult takes three, a child would take one,
[03:19:24.880 --> 03:19:28.400]  consult your physician first. It'll sell out by next week and the profit we make helps fund
[03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:33.280]  this operation. This is trying to defend human liberty. InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsShore.com is

[03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:08.960]  Barr Justice is responsible for the content of this ad. Attention all women who have been diagnosed
[03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:14.960]  with ovarian cancer. In February 2016, Johnson and Johnson lost two major lawsuits and was
[03:20:14.960 --> 03:20:20.960]  ordered to pay a total of $127 million by a jury to two women who died of ovarian cancer
[03:20:20.960 --> 03:20:25.760]  after years of using the manufacturer's talc-based products such as Johnson and Johnson's baby
[03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:30.240]  powder. Multiple studies show that women who have long-term use of talcum powder in products such
[03:20:30.240 --> 03:20:35.280]  as baby powder for feminine hygiene can increase the risk of contracting ovarian cancer. If you or
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:40.480]  a family member have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and used talcum powder prior to the diagnosis

[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:22.480]  I wish a buck was still silver. It was back when the country was wrong. Welcome back to the Alex Jones
[03:24:22.480 --> 03:24:27.680]  show in this fourth hour of Friday, June 10th. I'm David Knight. We're going to talk about what's
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:34.240]  going on in Bilderberg, and especially, I guess you could call it the precariat part two. We're
[03:24:34.240 --> 03:24:39.360]  going to talk about the plan to make you the Eloi, as I mentioned in the short one minute when we
[03:24:39.360 --> 03:24:43.600]  talked about this. You've got to understand this thing called universal basic income is something
[03:24:43.600 --> 03:24:48.400]  that's being pushed not only by the utopian socialist left, but it's being pushed by the
[03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:53.760]  Wall Street Journal, by Forbes, even by the economist Charles Murray. Remember back in the
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:25:00.320]  1980s, I think it was 1984. He talked about losing ground was the name of his book, talking about
[03:25:00.320 --> 03:25:05.920]  how welfare made people dependent, and it was the basis of a lot of welfare reforms. Now they're
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:11.600]  talking about a universal basic income, which will make everyone dependent to the state. And it's
[03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:15.840]  even being pushed by the American Enterprise Institute. You would think the American Enterprise
[03:25:15.840 --> 03:25:22.640]  Institute would value the idea, the traditional idea of work and reward, but no, they are pushing
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:28.480]  for a nanny state that is going to care for you from cradle to grave to build a dependency, like
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:33.520]  we've seen them shut down the activities of Indians when they put them on the reservation. Now this
[03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:38.960]  is not anything new. This is something that's been coming around for quite some time. It is an idea
[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:43.600]  of both the left and the right, because you know what, folks, there is no left and right. We see
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:49.280]  this over and over again. At the top, they all push globalism. They're all pushing a universal
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:53.440]  basic income to make you dependent upon the state. The American Enterprise Institute is run by the
[03:25:53.440 --> 03:25:57.440]  Koch brothers, okay? So we're going to talk about what the Koch brothers have in common with the
[03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:05.360]  Communists. This is a moment in history like when the German central bankers, one of whom the head
[03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:10.560]  of the central bank and his brother was creating the Federal Reserve at the same time in America,
[03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:15.280]  with those who are plotting to do that at Jekyll Island. But the head of the German central bank
[03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:22.000]  took Vladimir Lenin, put him on a train with $10 million in gold, and sent him into Russia to
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:27.600]  start the Communist Revolution. Oh, who would have thought that the German bankers would create the
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:32.960]  Russian Communist Revolution? You see, there's a lot of phony opposition. There's a lot of phony
[03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:36.400]  dichotomy, the idea that we've got the people on the right versus the people on the left,
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:42.240]  and we've got capitalist versus these. When they get to the top, all of this stuff that they divide
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:49.040]  you into, they just ignore that. They all have a common agenda. And you can see this, even with
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:55.280]  the terms that are being used by the economists, things like the precariat, sounds like the proletariat,
[03:26:55.280 --> 03:27:00.560]  right? The secretariat, I'm sorry, the salutariat. Yeah, they're going to give you a secretariat.
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:04.720]  They're going to give you a secretariat to rule the world. So all this stuff, the billionaire
[03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:09.520]  space race that we're looking at, the Artilek War that we've talked about in the past with Hugo
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:15.280]  de Gares, the coming singularity, artificial intelligence taking 90 to 95% of the jobs,
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:20.720]  all of that. That's why these business people are joining with the utopian socialists to propose
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:29.280]  a control of you. How are they going to stop this? You see, Brexit is a good example of how
[03:27:29.280 --> 03:27:34.880]  the common people are grabbing their pitchforks and their torches, and they're going to burn down
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:40.160]  this thing that the Bilderberg helped to create, which is United States of Europe on the way to
[03:27:40.160 --> 03:27:44.400]  creating a world government on the way to creating the kind of government that you saw portrayed
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:51.520]  in the movie, Elysium, colonies in near space, where they have a monopoly of manufacturing,
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:59.360]  of energy, where they tell you what to do when they enact Agenda 21, packing you into very close
[03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:04.400]  confined quarters in the cities, keeping the rest of the earth off limits to everyone but them.
[03:28:04.400 --> 03:28:09.280]  And then having them remove themselves to space colonies where you can't get at them
[03:28:09.280 --> 03:28:12.800]  and take them down. See, this has all been talked about in many different ways,
[03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:16.240]  and it is all coming together. There is a singularity, and it's not just a technological
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:20.560]  singularity. There is a political and economic singularity that's coming. So we're going to talk
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:25.920]  about that. But first, let's talk about Hillary Clinton, because she's one of the players on this
[03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:31.040]  for sure. Now, there's an article on the New American, came out yesterday, TPP and the new
[03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:35.360]  Clinton email scandal. Hillary Clinton is embroiled in yet another email scandal.
[03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:40.560]  This one deals with emails that would show her involvement in an advocacy for
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:46.480]  the Transpacific Partnership. Now, she's telling us, well, yeah, I was for it before,
[03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:52.320]  but now I'm against it. It's just a facade, folks. It's just a facade. For those of you
[03:28:52.320 --> 03:29:00.240]  in the Democrat Party, don't be misled by this. She is for the TPP. She's campaign saying she's
[03:29:00.240 --> 03:29:05.040]  not in favor of it, but she was before and evident shows that she was for it before she was against
[03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:09.520]  it. And you can even see that in what the State Department was doing with her. For those of you
[03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:13.920]  on the left, those of you who are Bernie Sanders supporters, look at what happened with the
[03:29:13.920 --> 03:29:17.600]  Keystone Pipeline. It was a State Department that was under Hillary Clinton that was pushing so
[03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:23.200]  hard for that. I mean, even Obama didn't want to spend the political capital to sign on to
[03:29:23.200 --> 03:29:30.240]  the Keystone Pipeline. And of course, that is a massive piece of crony capitalism and imminent
[03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:37.120]  domain, giving a Canadian corporation the power to condemn property in the United States. I have no
[03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:42.720]  problem with the environmental aspects of using oil. I favor it, but I don't favor crony capitalism
[03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:47.200]  and imminent domain by multinational foreign corporations. And that's what that's about
[03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:50.160]  that I oppose. We're going to talk about Hillary some more when we come back. Stay with us.
[03:29:50.160 --> 03:29:59.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:03.200 --> 03:30:08.960]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com exclusive Bill Clinton's lover before and after his marriage
[03:30:08.960 --> 03:30:14.160]  tells how lumpy Hillary with her fat ankles and hair on her toes scheme to get her to lie on
[03:30:14.160 --> 03:30:19.040]  60 minutes about Bill's other affairs. There appears to be no limit to what Hillary will do
[03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:24.320]  to destroy her perceived enemies. Dolly Coll writes in her new bombshell book. Kyle began sleeping
[03:30:24.320 --> 03:30:29.120]  with Bill Clinton after high school and their affair didn't end until he moved to the White
[03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:33.760]  House. Billy was a sex addict. Bill was undone by Will Chamberlain's claim to have slept with
[03:30:33.760 --> 03:30:39.120]  20,000 women. That's 10 times more than I've had, he told Dolly. Dolly says Bill told her he and
[03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:44.080]  Hillary who he called the warden needed to have a baby so he could appear to be a normal couple.
[03:30:44.080 --> 03:30:49.360]  When Dolly met Hillary May 20th 1974 she wore a misshapen brown dress like thing that must have
[03:30:49.360 --> 03:30:54.000]  been intended to hide her lumpy body. The garment stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:59.040]  thick calves covered with black hair. She sounds just like social justice warriors we see at all
[03:30:59.040 --> 03:31:04.240]  the Bernie Sanders rally. Maybe she secretly does feel the burn. More than two years ago
[03:31:04.240 --> 03:31:09.600]  info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've
[03:31:09.600 --> 03:31:14.240]  told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate

[03:31:19.760 --> 03:31:24.800]  the bad member of the halogen family into the water. They took the good halogen in and put the

[03:31:36.240 --> 03:31:41.840]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now

[03:33:21.760 --> 03:33:30.720]  Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight on this fourth hour of Friday, June 10th, 2016. We're going to
[03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:36.480]  cover some Hillary Clinton news. We're also going to cover I want to get to Bilderberg and talk about
[03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:40.720]  one of the topics that they mentioned that they're going to talk about. Of course they're going to
[03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:45.920]  talk about they're not going to really tell you what they're really talking about in many cases.
[03:33:45.920 --> 03:33:51.360]  Most of stuff is kind of general boilerplate. It's very non-interesting. Most of the topics that
[03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:53.840]  they put of course are going to talk about China. Of course they're going to talk about Russia. They
[03:33:53.840 --> 03:33:57.760]  didn't even say that they're going to talk about Brexit. But of course you know they're going to be
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:01.840]  talking about that in detail and you know they're going to be talking about Donald Trump in detail.
[03:34:01.840 --> 03:34:06.080]  So they didn't mention Donald Trump. They didn't mention Brexit. You know that's going to be part
[03:34:06.080 --> 03:34:09.760]  of what they're talking about. But one of the things that they did talk about is something that's
[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:17.440]  really been accelerating in public over the last couple of years. It's something I've seen it go back
[03:34:17.440 --> 03:34:21.760]  now as far as 2010. I don't know how long these socialist economists have been talking about it.
[03:34:21.760 --> 03:34:29.520]  But I think the amazing thing about this universal basic income, an unconditional welfare payment.
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:34.960]  So you could continue to do another job. They would just give you a base salary. We saw this
[03:34:34.960 --> 03:34:40.560]  referendum rejected soundly in Switzerland just this last Sunday. I want to talk about all the
[03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:45.920]  connections with that as well as what is going on with the singularity, what is happening to people
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:53.200]  with globalism and how it is the tool with which they are going to try to pacify us and turn us
[03:34:53.200 --> 03:34:58.160]  into what HGLs call the Eloy. Remember that at the very end of the book? They go forward into the
[03:34:58.160 --> 03:35:03.040]  future and they see these little pink jigglypuff things and there's a cooling and all this kind
[03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:09.920]  of stuff that's in his mind what humanity devolved into. But then there were these dark creatures
[03:35:09.920 --> 03:35:15.680]  that came up from underground. They were the Morlocks. And he realized that first he thought,
[03:35:15.680 --> 03:35:21.680]  you know, the Eloy were in charge of everything. They were kind of taken care of and everything,
[03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:26.640]  but he realized that they were simply the food source for the Morlocks. And so we're going to
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:32.960]  talk about the precarious who they're going to try to turn into Eloy. That's probably you or will
[03:35:32.960 --> 03:35:38.000]  be you pretty soon because 95% of the people they're planning on in the next decade or so are
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:41.920]  going to lose their jobs to these disruptive technologies. Now before we go back to the news,
[03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:46.960]  I just want to mention briefly that we do have living defense back in stock at infowarslife.com.
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:52.640]  This is something that we came out with a single run of it. It sold out incredibly quickly.
[03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:56.160]  It's very difficult to manufacture to the high standards that we manufacture. So it took us a
[03:35:56.160 --> 03:36:02.080]  while to do another batch. Alex did a triple batch and now it's about to sell out, but it is still
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:06.880]  back in stock. It's going very quickly. You can find out about it at infowarslife.com.

[03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:21.120]  the toxic and harmful organisms from your body using living defense. Read the reviews,
[03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:25.680]  read about it at infowarslife.com. It is now back in stock and not for long.
[03:36:26.800 --> 03:36:32.160]  Let's go back to Hillary Clinton. Of course, I have this article I just mentioned about how
[03:36:32.160 --> 03:36:37.280]  there's some emails that they do not want to have escape. They're blocking these. They're
[03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:42.480]  blocking FOIA requests for these emails that would show Hillary Clinton's deep support for the
[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:48.000]  Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will destroy not only our economy, but our sovereignty.
[03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:53.760]  It'll destroy internet freedom. It'll destroy so many things. But we know that Obama is all in
[03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:59.520]  for this. And we know that one of the people that has been touted as a potential vice presidential
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:05.120]  candidate for Hillary Clinton, going back the Castro brothers, we've talked about them from
[03:37:05.120 --> 03:37:10.880]  Texas, one of them a congressman, one of them the former mayor of San Antonio, both of them
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:17.280]  the spawn of one of the founders of the racist Hispanic organization, La Raza. Okay, that's
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:20.240]  what people need to understand with all this back and forth about Donald Trump.
[03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:25.680]  You want to talk about La Raza? What if I told you that I just joined a group for white males?
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:29.600]  I want to promote white males. I want to make sure there's more white males in higher positions.
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:34.160]  I want to give scholarships exclusively to white males. And the motto of this organization that
[03:37:34.160 --> 03:37:39.520]  I have joined for white males says, everything for white males, if you're not a white male,
[03:37:39.520 --> 03:37:44.320]  you get nothing. What if I told you that was our motto for our organization? Would you say I was a
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:49.040]  white supremacist? Would you say I was a racist? You would be right if you did. Okay, if I joined
[03:37:49.040 --> 03:37:57.840]  an organization like that. La Raza, the race, their motto is everything for the race, nothing for
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:04.000]  those outside of the race. So don't tell me that this judge who is handing out scholarships to
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:09.280]  people on the basis of them being Hispanic and illegal immigrants is not biased against Donald
[03:38:09.280 --> 03:38:15.920]  Trump. Okay, but these two Castro twins, one of whom is a congressman, one of whom is now currently
[03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:19.600]  HUD Secretary, used to be the mayor of San Antonio and wanted to try to get rid of the Alamo or
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:28.480]  completely reinvent it. He's been, the congressman Castro has been touring Vietnam with Obama,
[03:38:28.480 --> 03:38:34.480]  talking about how they wanted to push TPP. And Obama was on Jimmy Fallon last night,
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:40.480]  joking about the TPP and talking about how we don't need somebody who's not a serious candidate.
[03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:45.360]  You know, Donald Trump really isn't a serious candidate. He does all this reality TV stuff
[03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:50.080]  and you can't take the guy seriously. He's just an entertainer. And then Obama does this to prove his
[03:38:50.080 --> 03:38:57.200]  point. That being said, the American people face an important decision this fall. The entire world
[03:38:57.200 --> 03:39:03.360]  is watching and they look to us for stability and leadership. Now, I know some of the presidential
[03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:08.240]  candidates have been critical of my foreign policy. I don't want to name any names. Something about
[03:39:08.240 --> 03:39:15.680]  Donald Trump. But I believe it is of the utmost importance to work alongside other world leaders.
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:21.280]  That's why I signed the Iran nuclear deal. That's why we reopened diplomatic ties with Cuba.
[03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:26.080]  And that's why I negotiate the new trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership for TPP.
[03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:28.800]  Now, hold on there, press dispenser.
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:40.000]  Are you saying you're down with TPP? Yeah, you know me.
[03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:46.960]  Going that great. TPP is now really cool. And it's really cool to go on and talk about how
[03:39:46.960 --> 03:39:53.120]  this other guy is just an entertainer. But I'm serious, right? Okay, seriously? Okay. Now,
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:39:57.600]  besides the TPP, what else is Hillary unauthentic on? Of course, I want to play this for you. We
[03:39:57.600 --> 03:40:03.920]  mentioned it the other day. She came out in favor of building a wall and deporting people who came
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:09.760]  here illegally from Mexico. She said Mexico was pushing people on us. Let's play this clip of
[03:40:09.760 --> 03:40:19.280]  Hillary Clinton 10 years ago. Mexico is such an important problem. Mexican government's policies
[03:40:19.280 --> 03:40:25.840]  are pushing migration north. There isn't any sensible approach except to do what we need to do
[03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:31.040]  simultaneously. You know, secure our borders with technology, personnel, physical barriers,
[03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:36.000]  if necessary, in some places. And we need to have tougher employer sanctions. And we need to try
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:41.200]  to incentivize Mexico to do more if they've committed transgressions of whatever kind they
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:45.920]  should be. Okay, physical barriers. We got to deport them. We got to have employer sanctions.
[03:40:45.920 --> 03:40:50.640]  And it's coming from the Mexican government who's pushing them on us. But she's not racist, is she?
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:56.960]  No, it's only racist when her opponent does it. And it's only a problem when their opponent does
[03:40:56.960 --> 03:41:01.520]  live television. But when they do it, they're serious. And they can make TPP sound cool because,
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:08.080]  you know, it rhymes with so many different things. Don't pay any attention to what's in it, okay?
[03:41:08.080 --> 03:41:12.720]  They kept it secret for years and years. Now, but we're told that Hillary Clinton is the first
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:17.040]  woman to run for president. And as somebody called up and pointed out to us and said, no, no, no,
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:22.480]  we've had Green Party candidates who ran for, we had Cynthia McKinney. We've also had Jill Stein.
[03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:27.920]  And there's been a whole slew, frankly, folks of women who have run for presidency. Going back
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:36.000]  to 1872 was the first one. Victoria Woodhall. Women didn't even have the vote in 1872. But she
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:39.200]  ran for president back then. She was the first person to run for president. So they said, well,
[03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:45.280]  Hillary is the first major party candidate to run for president. Because, you know, the other
[03:41:45.280 --> 03:41:49.360]  parties don't count. Why don't they count? Well, that would be because of what the Democrats and
[03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:55.600]  Republicans have done to our democracy. To make sure that they have a duopoly. That they have
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:42:01.760]  a monopoly essentially on power because it truly is a single party. And so we can talk about who
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:06.400]  the first woman was or whatever. Does it really matter? Do you know who the first left-handed
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:11.120]  candidate we had for president was? Or the first redheaded candidate for president? Does it matter?
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:16.000]  You know, she likes to say, what difference does it make when you're talking about stranding people
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:19.840]  and leaving them to die at Benghazi? It doesn't make any difference. But it makes a difference
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:24.240]  when we talk about who the first woman president was. No, it doesn't. It doesn't make any more
[03:42:24.240 --> 03:42:28.800]  difference than the first left-handed person, quite frankly. What we need and what I would like to
[03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:34.640]  celebrate is maybe in my lifetime, the first candidate who takes individual liberty and the
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:38.800]  Constitution they swear to seriously. Now, that would be something to celebrate. I don't really
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:42.800]  care about your identity politics that you like to play here. And if you want to play that, you
[03:42:42.800 --> 03:42:48.240]  know, we can play the trivia game. We had a Libertarian Party candidate and Tony Nathan was a VP.
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:53.840]  She was the first woman to get an electoral college vote. So what? Okay, back in 1972,
[03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:59.120]  had a guy who was supposed to go vote for Nixon said, I just can't do it. And so he voted for the
[03:42:59.120 --> 03:43:05.920]  LP and they got their first electoral college vote. But you know, what's interesting about Woodhull
[03:43:05.920 --> 03:43:12.240]  is the fact that history doesn't repeat itself. But as we've said before, it certainly rhymes.
[03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:16.960]  And so I want you to take a look at some of the rhyming issues about Victoria Woodhull,
[03:43:16.960 --> 03:43:21.600]  the first woman who really did run for president and how she lines up with Hillary Clinton,
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:26.560]  the first major party candidate to run for president. Okay, they're both feminists,
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:34.400]  both eugenicists, both support. And of course, Victoria Woodhull called it the free love idea.
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:38.400]  Okay, it's essentially an anti-family agenda. Let's destroy all the conventional norms about
[03:43:38.400 --> 03:43:43.200]  family and everything. She called it free love. That's Hillary Clinton with the LGBT movement.
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:48.160]  She was into a cultic religion, spiritualist follower of an Austrian mystic. Okay, wouldn't
[03:43:48.160 --> 03:43:53.200]  be surprised about Hillary. I don't know if she has any religion other than politics.
[03:43:53.920 --> 03:43:59.120]  But one of the other things that Victoria Woodhull may have in common with Hillary Clinton is that
[03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:04.560]  when she was running for president, she was indicted. How about that? The first woman to run for president
[03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:08.880]  was indicted while she was running for president. Now, unlike Hillary Clinton's
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:25.040]  she was in her arch enemy at the time. And here's another place where history repeats itself.
[03:44:25.040 --> 03:44:32.000]  Okay, we have an evangel, a big dog preacher, okay, if you want to call him that.
[03:44:33.040 --> 03:44:38.960]  This is a guy who was a very well-known abolitionist. And of course, this is 1872.
[03:44:38.960 --> 03:44:45.120]  It was right after the Civil War. So he'd become very famous during the lead up to the Civil War.
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:52.000]  His name was Henry Ward Beecher. Okay, he was a clergyman. And he was adamantly opposed to
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:45:00.240]  Victoria Woodhull and her free love anti-family agenda. But he was also a prolific adulterer,
[03:45:00.800 --> 03:45:07.440]  a total hypocrite, which is another. Another thing that we continually see,
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:12.240]  another cookie cutter stereotype. These stereotypes exist because they really are
[03:45:12.240 --> 03:45:18.720]  true folks. So we've got this guy who's a famous clergyman who is this incredible hypocrite.
[03:45:18.720 --> 03:45:24.640]  And so they're having this very public argument going back and forth about free love. It's one
[03:45:24.640 --> 03:45:31.280]  of the things that she supports as being a feminist. Then she finds out as one of the
[03:45:31.280 --> 03:45:36.480]  many women that he was having an affair with confessed to her husband. That information
[03:45:36.480 --> 03:45:43.760]  was taken from her husband to Victoria Woodhull, who also owned the press. And I guess you could
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:49.920]  kind of say Hillary Clinton doesn't actually own a newspaper. But in a sense, she does own the press,
[03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:55.920]  doesn't she? Clinton News Network, they are very, very friendly to her. She doesn't actually
[03:45:55.920 --> 03:45:59.440]  hold stock in them. She doesn't actually do the hiring and firing. But she does have,
[03:45:59.440 --> 03:46:03.600]  she does own the press to a large degree. Well, Victoria Woodhull actually had a newspaper that
[03:46:03.600 --> 03:46:12.000]  she ran as a business. And so this woman who had had an affair with this hypocritical clergyman,
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:17.040]  who was at war with Victoria Woodhull, confessed to her husband. He went to Victoria Woodhull,
[03:46:17.040 --> 03:46:23.760]  and she published details of the affair. They arrested Victoria Woodhull, took her to trial,
[03:46:23.760 --> 03:46:30.800]  and died at her, and charged her with sending obscenities to the mail because they said,
[03:46:30.800 --> 03:46:36.880]  well, you have published obscene obscenities by talking about his affairs. And because you
[03:46:36.880 --> 03:46:40.320]  mailed your newspaper, we're going to get you for sending obscenities to the mail. I mean,
[03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:44.560]  you're talking about a stretch. That was a stretch. But anyway, she was eventually cleared.
[03:46:45.680 --> 03:46:51.760]  He was actually went on trial from being in a civil trial for charges of adultery.
[03:46:52.400 --> 03:46:57.760]  But the interesting thing about it too is that it completely took reconstruction off of the
[03:46:57.760 --> 03:47:04.800]  headlines. Just as we see today, they'll focus on the salacious details of celebrity sex.
[03:47:04.800 --> 03:47:13.280]  This is 1872 and completely mess one of the darkest chapters in our country's history,
[03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:17.600]  reconstruction, which they didn't want to talk about anyway, gave them a good excuse to get
[03:47:17.600 --> 03:47:23.200]  that off. So if you look at history, isn't it interesting how the stereotypes just continue
[03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:29.440]  to repeat themselves? Now, the other day I was talking about the precarious, one of the admitted
[03:47:29.440 --> 03:47:32.960]  topics by the Bilderbergers that I thought was kind of interesting. It was something that I
[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:38.800]  didn't know about. Prior to that, I started doing research on it. And of course, a book that was
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:44.720]  written in 2014 really helped to accelerate this. And so there was a lot of people talking about
[03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:51.600]  it in 2015. And now it's become a big deal. The end game of this, which I really didn't get to
[03:47:51.600 --> 03:47:58.000]  the other day, was the idea they're going to provide a universal basic income. This is
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:03.920]  unconditional welfare folks. This is what's being proposed. And what's truly shocking when you look
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:09.600]  at this is not just that the Bilderbergers would be looking at this as an instrument of control,
[03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:18.080]  as I see things like the pushback and the rise of all these anti-immigration parties, the people
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:22.160]  seeing what's being done to their currency and saying, we don't like what is happening with
[03:48:22.160 --> 03:48:25.840]  this consolidated government. So you have the rise of all these individual parties that they
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:32.560]  like to characterize as ultra right wing parties. And of course, Donald Trump would be in that
[03:48:32.560 --> 03:48:37.440]  category. So how do we control this? I say, well, this universal basic income, what I found that
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:43.280]  was really surprising was the fact that this is being supported by so many in the business community,
[03:48:44.160 --> 03:48:48.320]  Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, the American Enterprise Institute, the
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:54.800]  conservative slash libertarian think tank that is funded by the Koch brothers. They're all pushing
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:49:02.000]  this socialist utopian idea of a universal basic income. Look at this story from Forbes.
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:07.600]  Universal basic income is not a crazy idea, they tell us. And again, it's unconditional monthly
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:12.960]  income. And we just had this last Sunday, the Swiss had a referendum. They said, we're going to give
[03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:20.000]  $31,000 to every adult in Switzerland without conditions. You can still have a job. You can
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:23.920]  do whatever you want to. That's just going to be a basic level of income. And if that was a 40-hour
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:30.160]  work week, that would work out to $16 an hour pay. So there's your $15 an hour pay that Ernie
[03:49:30.160 --> 03:49:33.520]  and Hillary are pushing, the socialists are pushing, but it's a little bit more than that.
[03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:38.240]  And you get that for doing nothing. He says, the concept has been called utopian, irresponsible,
[03:49:38.240 --> 03:49:44.240]  socialist. Yeah, because it is. It is. It was rejected by 77% of the Swiss voters.
[03:49:44.240 --> 03:49:49.200]  But then he says, last weekend, The Wall Street Journal published an extensive essay by American
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:55.520]  Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray in favor of universal basic income for the US.
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:01.920]  Now, many of you may not remember who Charles Murray is. I remember him. I remember his book,
[03:50:01.920 --> 03:50:09.760]  Losing Ground, 1984. It was a big deal. It was the intellectual basis for massive welfare reform
[03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:14.640]  during the Reagan administration. And the fundamental premise of his book, Losing Ground,
[03:50:14.640 --> 03:50:19.600]  was to go back and look at people in the inner city, the poor in the inner city, predominantly
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:26.400]  black and saying, look at how welfare has destroyed these communities. At one point in time, there
[03:50:26.400 --> 03:50:31.520]  were rising small businesses that were coming up. But then when welfare came in, it completely shut
[03:50:31.520 --> 03:50:35.520]  that down. And the longer it's been there, the more firmly it got entrenched, the more it's harmed
[03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:41.120]  those people. We saw the same thing in Indian reservations. It's by design. It's how they make
[03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:46.480]  you passive. It's how they control you. And they've got a dangerous class they call the precariat
[03:50:46.480 --> 03:50:52.880]  that they want to control. But what has flipped these people? Why have they gone from saying we
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:58.240]  can't have welfare that increases dependency to promoting the idea that we're going to have
[03:50:58.240 --> 03:51:02.320]  universal welfare without any strings? Stay tuned. I'll tell you what's up with that. We'll be right
[03:51:02.320 --> 03:51:08.240]  back. If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:13.280]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends, we already
[03:51:13.280 --> 03:51:18.720]  see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar generators really do
[03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:24.400]  provide life saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently amid
[03:51:24.400 --> 03:51:29.200]  no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous summer storms,
[03:51:29.200 --> 03:51:34.080]  blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest
[03:51:34.080 --> 03:51:38.480]  of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has
[03:51:38.480 --> 03:51:44.160]  a big sale on their fast charge solar generators. And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars
[03:51:44.160 --> 03:51:49.520]  worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for M4 Wars listeners. So it's a good time

[03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:22.480]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight on this Friday, June 10th, 2016.
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:26.640]  Real quickly before we get back to what I was talking about with the universal basic income, the
[03:54:27.440 --> 03:54:33.600]  universal joining of the Socialist Left and Wall Street together. That's what they're talking about
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:38.400]  at Bilderberg and I'm going to tell you how they are joined together at the hip before I do real
[03:54:38.400 --> 03:54:44.240]  quickly. Living Defense is now back in stock at infowarslife.com. Our first batch sold out very
[03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:50.160]  quickly. Alex tripled the size of it and it is quickly selling out again. Go to infowarslife.com
[03:54:50.160 --> 03:54:54.080]  before we sell out. It's very important that you understand 9 out of 10 people are infested with
[03:54:54.080 --> 03:54:59.360]  harmful organisms and you can pick these up in a variety of ways. Once these organisms have made
[03:54:59.360 --> 03:55:03.840]  it inside your body, they will steal your nutrients, they will release toxic waste. It's time to start
[03:55:03.840 --> 03:55:09.440]  eliminating these toxic harmful organisms. Yeah, organizations. I'm talking about so many different
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:14.800]  organizations but these are parasites inside your body besides the guys at Bilderberg.
[03:55:14.800 --> 03:55:20.240]  Lemonate these from your body using Living Defense. Again, you can find out more about that at
[03:55:20.240 --> 03:55:26.560]  infowarslife.com. It is selling out very quickly even though we have tripled the batch run on this.
[03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:33.360]  Now, going back to what we were talking about, I've got, when I started talking about the Precariat,
[03:55:33.360 --> 03:55:38.080]  I had somebody email me going back and said, well, you know, it didn't start back in 2014.
[03:55:38.080 --> 03:55:43.200]  That's Guy Standing's book, The Precariat, The Dangerous Social Class and that's what they're
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:49.600]  talking about at Bilderberg now. It didn't start in 2014. They're going back 2011, 2012, and going
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:55.360]  back to 2010. I'm not really sure when this started but it's going back farther and farther.
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:56:01.280]  But it is something that is being sold to us by the socialists, of course, okay? You look at this
[03:56:01.280 --> 03:56:05.920]  and you talk about Precariat. We break everybody down into these classes that need to be managed.
[03:56:05.920 --> 03:56:11.280]  That's the way the Marxists always look at people. You belong to a class and how are we going to
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:20.720]  manage this class warfare that we've got going here? Well, the very idea, the very terminology of
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:27.120]  Precariat harkens back to proletariat. They also talk about a salatariat. This would be the higher
[03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:33.520]  level minions who still have all the privileges and benefits like pensions and vacations and
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:38.240]  things like that, okay? Then there's some other people who still get paid. They're the proficians.
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:43.520]  Those are people who are the technological people that are needed and highly skilled but
[03:56:44.320 --> 03:56:47.680]  they're still going to have, they're not going to have the kind of security that the salatariat
[03:56:47.680 --> 03:56:53.600]  has, okay? The upper level minions. The proficians are going to have to have multiple jobs that they
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:57.280]  hold throughout their career. They're going to have to move around. We've seen this developing
[03:56:57.280 --> 03:57:00.960]  for quite some time in the engineering community. You're not going to have, you don't go to work
[03:57:00.960 --> 03:57:06.240]  and spend this way for a long time. Even when I was beginning as an engineer, it was pretty well
[03:57:06.240 --> 03:57:10.800]  understood that you're not going to go get a job for IBM and stay there for 40 years and get some
[03:57:10.800 --> 03:57:16.000]  kind of a wonderful pension when you leave. No, you're going to keep moving from company to company
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:20.080]  and if you got a pension, it's going to be because you save the money yourself. So we've seen what
[03:57:20.080 --> 03:57:24.560]  happened with the proficians but now what's happening and is going to happen in an accelerating way
[03:57:25.280 --> 03:57:29.520]  are the people that are at the lower level job skills. They're going to be making less money.
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:34.480]  They're going to be in a very precarious and dangerous position. No stability in their life.
[03:57:34.480 --> 03:57:38.880]  They're the ones who are totally getting screwed first because it's going to get everybody folks.
[03:57:39.440 --> 03:57:46.400]  But the first ones to feel the heel of globalism on their throat. And I'm looking at this lecture
[03:57:46.400 --> 03:57:51.440]  series that they sent me, the future of the left that was done back in November 2012. Whatever
[03:57:51.440 --> 03:57:58.720]  happened to parliamentary socialism, socialist democracy and so forth has they left a future
[03:57:58.720 --> 03:58:02.560]  and so forth. They're talking about it from a leftist standpoint. But when we go back and we
[03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:06.720]  look at these business publications, as I was pointing out, we've got Forbes Wall Street Journal,
[03:58:06.720 --> 03:58:11.760]  Business Insider and the wake of this Swiss referendum. They're all talking about how
[03:58:11.760 --> 03:58:19.440]  wonderful and how necessary it is for us to have a universal basic income. This is being pushed by
[03:58:19.440 --> 03:58:24.560]  some of the most anti-welfare, historically anti-welfare people you had around. The American
[03:58:24.560 --> 03:58:29.120]  Enterprise Institute, David Koch, Charles Murray and others. I'm going to follow up on this tonight
[03:58:29.120 --> 03:58:32.960]  on the InfoWars Nightly News. There's not enough time to finish it tonight. Join us tonight at
[03:58:32.960 --> 03:58:59.520]  7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern for the Nightly News.
