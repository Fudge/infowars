[00:00.000 --> 00:18.080]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to
[00:18.080 --> 00:44.000]  the Alex Jones show we got a lot of breaking news behind the scenes is why
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.360]  barely had time to skid into my seat here incredibly important transmission
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.080]  straight ahead but first John Bowne has filed an extremely powerful report
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.680]  dealing with the fact that Linda Sarsour and her Soros groups are openly funding
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.520]  sedition inside this country
[01:03.480 --> 01:10.040]  respect this president of the United States of America due to the broad and
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.280]  ironclad protections of the First Amendment a charge of sedition against
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.600]  the u.s. citizen is extremely rare nevertheless sedition remains a crime
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.720]  in the United States under us code 2384 a federal statute that punishes seditious
[01:25.720 --> 01:32.480]  conspiracy and 18 us code 2385 which outlaws advocating the overthrow of the
[01:32.480 --> 01:37.400]  federal government by force generally a person may be punished for sedition
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.080]  only when he or she makes statements that create a clear and present danger to
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.200]  rights that the government may lawfully protect a person found guilty of seditious
[01:47.200 --> 01:51.480]  conspiracy or advocating the overthrow of the government may be fined in
[01:51.480 --> 01:56.240]  sentence to up to 20 years in prison states also maintain laws that punish
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.040]  similar advocacy and conspiracy against the state government Brooklyn-born
[02:01.040 --> 02:06.000]  Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour is walking a tightrope as she
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  tests those federal statutes
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.400]  she won't be condemned the acid attacks women have their genitals cut off the
[02:31.400 --> 02:37.160]  gates being thrown off buildings any of it any of it pro-life feminist aren't
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.280]  allowed to march in those deals but the Muslim women are I mean it's just the
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.000]  most sickening evil group using the fact that we're so tolerant to run all
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.120]  over us well guess what we're awake now which to enjoy your little Hamas meeting
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.120]  which we see you which do you defend what she said about this president and
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.400]  really about this country and that sound bite your jihad is an air before
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.360]  mention both in the Quran and the Bible Bridget she is from Lebanon she knows
[03:02.360 --> 03:06.160]  Arabic and she knows this word is mentioned also in the Bible if you
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.480]  leave it for us jihad means to be a better person more honest more truthful
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.240]  and more trustworthy but of course if you leave this jihad for ISIS leave the
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.760]  Quran for ISIS or Bible for KKK they have different interpretation of it
[03:22.760 --> 03:28.920]  Linda Sarsour is the poster child for this red-green axis she is getting left
[03:28.920 --> 03:34.080]  as groups to basically push the narrative that Islam is peaceful Islam has
[03:34.080 --> 03:37.320]  nothing to do with the problem and yet from a national security standpoint
[03:37.320 --> 03:43.000]  Islam has everything to do with the problem Sharia is the blueprint by
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.720]  which all of these jihadi groups operate whether it's al-Qaeda the Islamic
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.680]  state the Muslim Brotherhood Boko Haram al-Shaba fill in the blank they all
[03:50.680 --> 03:54.480]  say that their Muslims wage in jihad to establish an Islamic state under Sharia
[03:54.480 --> 03:59.080]  and yet it is people like Linda Sarsour working with the media in groups like
[03:59.080 --> 04:03.120]  care which is Hamas working with the media to say that this problem has
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.880]  nothing to do with Islam and it's just actually false it is it's very radical
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.880]  she was specifically inciting hatred and violence if these words were coming out
[04:12.880 --> 04:16.240]  of any other person we would have said well you know that that really
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.080]  overstepped the line but coming from Linda Sarsour you have to understand her
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.040]  background this is a lady that comes from a long line of terrorists her
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.520]  family members are as we speak sitting in Israeli jails for conviction of
[04:28.520 --> 04:33.520]  terrorism when you look at her praising in her speech at Isna Imam Siraj Wahaj
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.360]  who was a co-conspirator in the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 she
[04:38.360 --> 04:43.400]  called him her hero and her mentor Sarsour is rising as a spokesperson for
[04:43.400 --> 04:48.320]  Sharia Law's gradual wedge in the US ironically laying the groundwork to
[04:48.320 --> 04:53.440]  create no-go zones similar to those all over Europe where women aren't welcome
[04:53.440 --> 05:00.400]  john bound reporting for inforce.com you can't make this stuff up after a
[05:00.400 --> 05:06.120]  series of embarrassments and scandals CNN is in full-blown crisis mode with the
[05:06.120 --> 05:10.760]  network now attracting fewer viewers for its primetime shows than multi-decade
[05:10.760 --> 05:16.640]  old reruns of Yogi Bear with the Trump Russia collusion story fading into the
[05:16.640 --> 05:21.800]  background an issue that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings despite knowing it
[05:21.800 --> 05:27.080]  was fake news the network's ratings are now plummeting and there's no doubt that
[05:27.080 --> 05:32.560]  CNN's most recent scandal that sparked hashtag CNN blackmail has played a role
[05:32.560 --> 05:37.160]  after CNN threatened to dock some random gift creator that president Trump
[05:37.160 --> 05:43.120]  happened to retweet to put things into perspective the CNN app now has only one
[05:43.120 --> 05:48.280]  star out of five in the Apple App Store where comparably the Fox News app has
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.760]  three and a half stars whereas the Info Wars and Alex Jones radio app have both

[08:14.400 --> 08:21.320]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[08:21.320 --> 08:29.960]  live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[08:29.960 --> 08:34.920]  well we got some really good news yesterday Hillary Clinton is the lead
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.360]  the Democratic Party in 2018 midterm elections which pretty much the
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.360]  campaigning force started in the last few weeks she has incredible negative
[08:44.360 --> 08:48.400]  numbers her own party hates her the Sanders supporters hate her because she
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.920]  stole the nominations from him but it gets better Nancy Pelosi is to be the
[08:52.920 --> 08:59.480]  co-head with her along with you can't make this up Elizabeth Warren aka
[08:59.480 --> 09:06.880]  Pocahontas all incredibly unpopular even in their own party and they've tried to
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.680]  unseat obviously Nancy Pelosi they tried to have Hillary put out the pasture but
[09:11.680 --> 09:16.080]  it doesn't happen but you know what maybe it's good to keep the old guard in
[09:16.080 --> 09:20.680]  because even though they're super unpopular if you look at who's coming
[09:20.680 --> 09:26.000]  up next it's even more frightening Linda Sarsour who has at least three close
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.560]  family members in Israeli prisons for terrorism is running around everywhere we
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.280]  just played clips in the last segment if you just joined us we're gonna play more
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.120]  of this coming up saying activate jihad America overthrow Trump if you're a
[09:40.120 --> 09:45.360]  Muslim don't assimilate because this ladies and gentlemen is a Palestinian
[09:45.360 --> 09:49.880]  which which means basically a vagabond in the Middle East Saudi Arabia won't take
[09:49.880 --> 09:56.080]  him Jordan won't take him Egypt won't take him Syria won't take him Shaddan
[09:56.080 --> 10:04.080]  won't take him Somalia won't take him Iran won't take him no one will take a
[10:04.080 --> 10:09.840]  Palestinian because most the Palestinians were never in quote Palestine or
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.760]  where or where Israel now is where Jerusalem is predating Palestine as
[10:15.760 --> 10:22.480]  it's been called for a thousand years no one will take them how many people how
[10:22.480 --> 10:29.000]  many Palestinians in Saudi Arabia taken not one because any Arab will tell you
[10:29.000 --> 10:36.960]  or any Muslim will tell you that Palestinians 24 7 are trying to take
[10:36.960 --> 10:43.600]  over your political process and wherever they go discord terrorism starts and she
[10:43.600 --> 10:47.560]  gives these speeches where she says stay angry stay mad your life in America is
[10:47.560 --> 10:51.600]  miserable you are fighting the evil white supremacist president these are
[10:51.600 --> 10:57.000]  quotes and she's got all these whacked out crazy feminists supporting a woman
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.720]  who pushes genital mutilation and who supported the jihad operations and the
[11:01.720 --> 11:05.320]  Arab Spring that killed close to a million people and it slayed over 200
[11:05.320 --> 11:11.000]  thousand women many of them small children Linda Sarsour is a veritable
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.640]  witch demon but that's the rising star in the Democratic Party she was given
[11:17.640 --> 11:23.800]  200 plus million dollars just last year and hundreds of millions more this year
[11:23.800 --> 11:29.640]  by George Soros to lead and to run with the organization she captains the
[11:29.640 --> 11:35.400]  feminist movement in America I knew who she was but when I saw she was leading
[11:35.400 --> 11:40.920]  the DC March the day after the inauguration on the 21st I was there
[11:40.920 --> 11:44.800]  witnessing it I went and looked up who was funding it was 280 something
[11:44.800 --> 11:49.640]  million to her group and the subgroups to fund just those nationwide marches
[11:49.640 --> 11:55.720]  that day handing out thousands of American flag had jibs head coverings to
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.040]  women I came back on air and said ladies and gentlemen a radical Muslim is
[12:01.040 --> 12:06.080]  running the women's event I couldn't believe it now six seven months later
[12:06.080 --> 12:11.280]  it's all over the news but like it's a good thing USA today oh the new face of
[12:11.280 --> 12:21.560]  feminism the hijab and Linda Sarsour you can't make this up the the family
[12:21.560 --> 12:31.480]  member and the political operative of Hamas she speaks at Hamas meetings you
[12:31.480 --> 12:34.800]  cannot make this up and look I know everybody's been talking about her for a
[12:34.800 --> 12:46.720]  while I just it shows how we'll put up with anything in this country now that
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.520]  said let me shift gears into this the National Rifle Association has rebranding
[12:52.520 --> 12:56.280]  itself be more hardcore more political very proud of our audience and I'm very
[12:56.280 --> 13:01.840]  proud of people like the Motor City madman Ted Nugent when he was an NRA
[13:01.840 --> 13:07.160]  board member who was instrumental in getting NRA back to being hardcore and
[13:07.160 --> 13:10.480]  not milk toast it was gun owners of America who we should get Larry Pratt
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.480]  back on this week in fact we will Larry Pratt who helped keep the NRA honest
[13:15.480 --> 13:19.600]  remember they even support assault weapons bands back in the 90s and stuff
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.840]  semi-auto bands I mean the NRA got bad for a while but thanks to activists and
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.000]  members keeping them straight they've gotten more hardcore and they've gotten
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.320]  more popular well now they've got people like Jesse James and Dana Loesch and
[13:36.320 --> 13:41.920]  others that are what you'd say radicalizing the NRA which radicalism
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.920]  extremism and defensive liberties no vice to quote Barry Goldwater who is the
[13:47.920 --> 13:50.760]  granddaddy of our whole counter movement against the globalist make no
[13:50.760 --> 13:56.480]  mistake a chilling National Rifle Association ad a chilling National
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.320]  Rifle Association ad gaining traction online appears to be an open call to
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.880]  violence this is from 11 days ago the video has tens of millions of views on
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.920]  different platforms and it's a one-minute ad that sounds like I could have said it
[14:10.920 --> 14:16.200]  or you could have said it because it's truth it's not plagiarism by the NRA of
[14:16.200 --> 14:22.400]  the Liberty Movement it's truth it's self-evident in fact I'm gonna cut some
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.840]  promos that are basically a nod to this piece and we should all put out our own
[14:27.840 --> 14:31.440]  YouTube videos on our own testimonies about why we have the Second Amendment
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.840]  everybody should do it on a webcam or on your local access TV or on talk radio
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.680]  everyone should give testament to why we have the Second Amendment we're gonna
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.000]  air that ad here in just a moment in fact I told the crew last week I want to
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.720]  put it into rotation here to run on the network and on the radio show like I
[14:48.720 --> 14:53.040]  want the woman it had to actually run on the full GCN network I wanted to run in
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.160]  our ad slots that are a thousand dollars a minute sounds like a lot it's not
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.480]  for syndicated radio I'm gonna take some of my ad time I've got on the network
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.640]  and I'm running this for the NRA because it's hardcore and if we don't all
[15:04.640 --> 15:08.960]  contribute to the fight we're gonna lose if we contribute we win time energy
[15:08.960 --> 15:14.240]  money prayers whatever you got a chilling National Rifle Association and
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.120]  getting traction online appears to be an open call to violence no they're
[15:19.120 --> 15:22.480]  violent they're radicalizing they're trying to overthrow the country they're
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.720]  funded by Soros and the promos I'm cutting and the news pieces I'm cutting
[15:26.720 --> 15:30.000]  we show you who's behind it we just go further those will be out in a few days
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.960]  as a nod to this a chilling National Rifle Association and gaining traction
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.120]  online appears to be an open call to violence no we said the clinched fist
[15:40.120 --> 15:46.680]  of truth speaking out information warfare taking action against you
[15:46.680 --> 15:56.280]  politically economically legally legislatively praying all of it we're
[15:56.280 --> 15:59.880]  winning the info war you're the ones calling for the death of Trump you're
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.320]  the ones calling for violence you're the ones calling for hashtag hunt
[16:03.320 --> 16:11.600]  Republicans so we're gonna play her piece and then the incredible over-the-top
[16:11.600 --> 16:17.240]  response by LA activist of Black Lives Matter the holy unsubsidiary of
[16:17.240 --> 16:24.920]  George Soros respond to the NRA dignity and power now I want to explain
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.560]  something ladies and gentlemen all they've done is taking KKK psychology
[16:28.560 --> 16:31.240]  that I've decried spoken out against because it's a tool of division and
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.720]  control and they have deployed it into minority groups and they've gotten
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.920]  Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the big foundations to
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.320]  give hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[16:43.320 --> 16:49.440]  hundreds of millions of dollars to BLM to normalize cop killing to normalize
[16:49.440 --> 16:53.840]  having a chip on your shoulder to normalize colleges from New York to
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.920]  Washington State from Texas to Florida saying no whites are allowed this weekend
[16:58.920 --> 17:04.080]  remember in Missouri last year they lost like a third now their students over it
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.320]  the white professors were saying no whites allowed on the commons ground at
[17:09.320 --> 17:14.120]  the park in the middle of the university and white students are trying to walk on
[17:14.120 --> 17:17.920]  there with Asian students from the newspaper and the white college
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.960]  professors come over and say no whites allowed and then say give me some muscle
[17:22.960 --> 17:30.040]  and starts trying to call some black guy over to be the muscle this is liberals
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.160]  trying to engage in race baiting and using race and tribalism as a weapon
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.880]  just like evergreen faculty demand investigation a professor who dissented
[17:37.880 --> 17:47.800]  from no whites day and now the media has to defend that so let's go ahead and go
[17:47.800 --> 17:56.080]  over this let's go ahead and play the NRA Dana Loche piece and then we'll get
[17:56.080 --> 18:01.240]  into their counter strike here it is they use their media to assassinate real
[18:01.240 --> 18:05.280]  news they use their schools to teach children that their president is another
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.040]  Hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.080]  to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president
[18:15.080 --> 18:20.240]  to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.640]  scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn
[18:25.640 --> 18:30.320]  cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.600]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.800]  madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the
[18:40.800 --> 18:46.600]  only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.360]  fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth I'm the National
[18:52.360 --> 18:58.200]  Rifle Association of America and I'm freedoms safest place and I'm Alex
[18:58.200 --> 19:03.880]  Jones and I am the info war the key to keeping this restoration of our Republic
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.440]  nonviolent but to win the info war you've got to have overwhelming force
[19:08.440 --> 19:13.600]  overwhelming truth and overwhelming energy which we have and we're beginning
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.880]  to major league just got chills wow this truth feels so good doesn't it major
[19:18.880 --> 19:26.360]  league turn the tide I mean we are winning but it only makes the victory
[19:26.360 --> 19:30.240]  that much more special and cherished doesn't it it's like a child that it's
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.400]  really sick when they're little and you almost lose them and then you end up
[19:33.400 --> 19:36.920]  loving them and needing them and caring about them even more think of what all
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.520]  our ancestors of every race color and creed all the human race have gone
[19:41.520 --> 19:46.080]  through together all the striving and how far we've come the wars the
[19:46.080 --> 19:50.320]  captivity the enslavement the degradation the sorrow but also the
[19:50.320 --> 19:55.640]  triumph and the victories and the commitment and where we are with this
[19:55.640 --> 19:59.480]  wondrous planet and the wondrous technology and the wondrous discoveries
[19:59.480 --> 20:03.440]  and the secrets of the universe that we've already cracked and so many more
[20:03.440 --> 20:09.000]  that were exponentially about to all share the globalists are desperate that
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.560]  we not have access to this the ultimate racism the ultimate anti-human globalist
[20:13.560 --> 20:18.080]  eugenics movement that says humanity's failed and over and that machines are
[20:18.080 --> 20:22.720]  gonna override us and the elite are gonna merge with silicon and that to do
[20:22.720 --> 20:28.080]  that they must first shed themselves of us the cancer what type of satanic
[20:28.080 --> 20:37.040]  whacked out crap is that that's what you get from the priest at Google the
[20:37.040 --> 20:41.440]  priest at Apple the priest at IBM the priest at Microsoft that is their
[20:41.440 --> 20:47.000]  religion ten years ago I put that the film in game a blueprint for global
[20:47.000 --> 20:54.720]  enslavement it's free online I hope it's not pearls before swine risk my life
[20:54.720 --> 20:58.160]  to make that film they almost killed me over it they were so upset they came
[20:58.160 --> 21:04.040]  after his hardcore back then the media attacked it and said it was insane you
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.880]  watch that film it all came through it's got the quotes of the world leaders of
[21:07.880 --> 21:14.400]  how they worship Lucifer and the Lucifer has told them you will be gods but first
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.840]  you must destroy the humans and they're humans themselves but they believe they
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.320]  must shed themselves of that form and transcend transcendence like the stupid
[21:25.320 --> 21:29.880]  Johnny Depp movie and then he's in the ether and in the atmosphere nanotech and
[21:29.880 --> 21:35.680]  guides the world perfectly as the digital Valhalla and the digital second
[21:35.680 --> 21:45.640]  coming it is a total setup but the globalist have been given all this power
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.920]  so they can't believe they've been conned so let's go to black lives matter and
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.560]  their response to Dana Loche saying that basically the Second Amendment is
[21:56.560 --> 21:59.200]  inherently racist even though the communists are marching with their
[21:59.200 --> 22:02.080]  second amendment we have a right to defend ourselves with our second
[22:02.080 --> 22:06.480]  but we don't want that we're winning the info war and imagine if you start a
[22:06.480 --> 22:10.040]  fight with the libertarians the conservatives the veterans 90% of the
[22:10.040 --> 22:14.880]  veterans being patriots the police the military the patriots the people with
[22:14.880 --> 22:18.440]  the resources the middle class multicultural groups that want freedom
[22:18.440 --> 22:22.240]  your fools I've been to your communist rallies I've been to your anti-file
[22:22.240 --> 22:26.160]  rallies you guys look like you don't even know how to wipe your butts I don't
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.520]  say that meanly you look uncared for you can tell you were putting a crib you
[22:30.520 --> 22:33.880]  were never taken care of most of you were foster children who weren't even
[22:33.880 --> 22:38.280]  given enough milk you've got shriveled brains your six times were likely not to
[22:38.280 --> 22:43.840]  give the charity nine times more likely to steal in major surveys Harvard
[22:43.840 --> 22:49.760]  University of Canada Toronto search engine liberals more likely to steal
[22:49.760 --> 22:55.360]  more selfish hundreds of studies I understand you've been told by the
[22:55.360 --> 22:58.280]  corporate media you're gonna get ahead if you could pull down the middle class
[22:58.280 --> 23:01.800]  you'll get some booty you'll get some goodies you'll get some spoils you'll
[23:01.800 --> 23:06.360]  get some loot you're not gonna get it they didn't get it in Venezuela they
[23:06.360 --> 23:09.160]  didn't get it in Russia they didn't get it in North Korea they didn't get it in
[23:09.160 --> 23:14.480]  China you don't get it limited free market is what has developed untold
[23:14.480 --> 23:22.000]  wealth true free market will take us to the stars and beyond but you don't
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.080]  understand that they don't want you to know there's unlimited resources in the
[23:26.080 --> 23:33.520]  human mind we've already come 95% of the way we need to go to life extension out
[23:33.520 --> 23:38.840]  to a point where we're technically immortal we are already there we're at
[23:38.840 --> 23:43.840]  the threshold and are facing the globalist and once they're out of the
[23:43.840 --> 23:50.680]  way ladies and gentlemen it's unlimited what we're about to have but of course
[23:50.680 --> 23:53.280]  they're teaching us all to hate each other and kill each other and act like
[23:53.280 --> 23:57.600]  fools and a lot of you aren't gonna win and you're not gonna transcend because
[23:57.600 --> 24:02.480]  you have bought into this either as a globalist or as a minion either
[24:02.480 --> 24:08.400]  selfishly as a globalist or selfishly as a minion you're profane and you're not
[24:08.400 --> 24:12.320]  meant to pass the gate and it's very sad now let's go ahead and show the
[24:12.320 --> 24:17.720]  George Soros funded response to the NRA they use their guns to assassinate
[24:17.720 --> 24:22.280]  black people they use their schools to funnel black students through a school
[24:22.280 --> 24:27.760]  to prison pipeline they use their state institutions bought politicians business
[24:27.760 --> 24:32.320]  conglomerates and white supremacist domestic terrorists to incite violence
[24:32.320 --> 24:37.360]  over and over again and then they use their new president to enact a law and
[24:37.360 --> 24:42.640]  order administration all to make them shoot first to make them ask questions
[24:42.640 --> 24:48.640]  later make them scream I thought he had a gun in his hand and I feared for my life
[24:48.640 --> 24:55.440]  and he matched the description of a suspect and she was threatening us to
[24:55.440 --> 25:00.720]  shoot and kill Philando Castile, Charlene Alliles, Keisha Michael, Keith
[25:00.720 --> 25:06.400]  Bursey and Waukesha Wilson until the only option left is for black people to
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.360]  disrupt the systems that keep us oppressed and build the kinds of
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.600]  communities in which we want to live and when that happens they'll use it as an
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.560]  excuse to kill more of us the only way we stop this the only way we save our
[25:19.560 --> 25:24.200]  communities and our struggle for freedom is to fight this violence with the
[25:24.200 --> 25:29.160]  raised clenched black fist of resistance we are black lives matter and we are
[25:29.160 --> 25:35.600]  freedom's future place wait hold up what's with the aggressive fear
[25:35.600 --> 25:41.480]  mongering video tactics someone cut the music and bring up the lights better
[25:41.480 --> 25:46.440]  we're talking about our lives here when the NRA issues a public call to their
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.680]  constituents inciting violence against people who are constitutionally fighting
[25:50.680 --> 25:54.640]  for their lives we don't take that lightly no I'm sure we know that we are
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.360]  not safe but we are not scared either we will continue to produce media teach
[26:00.360 --> 26:05.320]  students march and protest to not only protect the First Amendment as fiercely
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.880]  as the NRA protects the second but to protect our lives from gun-toting
[26:09.880 --> 26:15.040]  racist we demand the NRA immediately remove their dangerous propaganda
[26:15.040 --> 26:20.000]  videos narrated by conservative talk radio host Dana Lash and Grant Stinchfield
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.800]  good luck yeah let's get rid of that first of images like you want to the
[26:24.800 --> 26:28.040]  second okay let's lay out the facts to these useful idiots let's look at these
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.800]  useful morons on screen for TV viewers the number one cause of death for black
[26:32.800 --> 26:37.640]  people in this country is abortion 51% are killed by abortion okay that's
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.800]  number one I fight that not because I'm some white knight but because I realize
[26:41.800 --> 26:45.160]  all our lives are connected and I realize it's wrong even if a lot of black
[26:45.160 --> 26:48.160]  folks are have chips put on their shoulders and are weaponized against me
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.000]  and filled full of racist crap I still take the high road because I'm on the
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.920]  high road now let's expand we can pull these numbers up it's less than a
[26:56.920 --> 27:01.360]  hundred blacks shot and killed by police every year you can pull up the
[27:01.360 --> 27:07.440]  numbers it's over 2,000 that die every year in Chicago blacks and 90 plus
[27:07.440 --> 27:11.480]  percent are black-on-black you pull the numbers up the numbers vary every year
[27:11.480 --> 27:15.640]  but just just just randomly type into Google for yourself number of blacks
[27:15.640 --> 27:20.880]  shot by police every year versus number of blacks shot by blacks I mean the
[27:20.880 --> 27:24.240]  graphs are everywhere we've shown them many times or the number of blacks shot
[27:24.240 --> 27:28.440]  by police versus the number of blacks shot in Chicago by other blacks I mean
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.840]  it's in the thousands in one city and the low hundreds nationwide for police
[27:33.840 --> 27:39.080]  are there some cases where bad cops shoot innocent black people absolutely but
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.160]  the media takes those and magnifies them where one dead person's a tragedy 10,000
[27:44.160 --> 27:48.640]  dying is a statistic and then these folks right here are funded by hardcore
[27:48.640 --> 27:55.480]  globalist that funded the Arab Spring that funded all these other big events
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.280]  the overthrow of Ukraine these civil wars trying to start one where blacks
[28:00.280 --> 28:06.320]  are the trigger for it and then the scapegoat for it for the Civil War you
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.160]  look at the numbers there you go blacks killed by whites you can see the
[28:10.160 --> 28:14.840]  numbers right there super low whites killed by blacks we're talking basically
[28:14.840 --> 28:22.700]  15 20 times depending on the jurisdiction higher you got 50 blacks killed by
[28:22.700 --> 28:27.080]  whites you got 450 whites killed by blacks that's us news and world report
[28:27.080 --> 28:30.680]  not the statistic I was looking for I'm just going from memory but we'll find
[28:30.680 --> 28:33.320]  it during the break and come back because I just thought of this as we were
[28:33.320 --> 28:37.320]  showing the video because I've gone over everybody knows these numbers I mean
[28:37.320 --> 28:40.920]  we're talking hundred and something blacks shot and killed by cops every
[28:40.920 --> 28:45.400]  year most the time it's actually black officers doing it because to stop all
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.560]  the right stuff they mainly put black officers in the black areas now so you
[28:49.560 --> 28:52.880]  got a hundred something blacks being killed some of medicine it's wrong you've
[28:52.880 --> 28:56.360]  got thousands of blacks killed in Chicago every year by blacks didn't even on
[28:56.360 --> 29:00.040]  the radar screen you got most of blacks never getting born being killed by the
[29:00.040 --> 29:04.400]  globalist by the liberals by the abortionaries then you've got the
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.360]  gangster black culture rap music that pushes blacks act like thugs everybody
[29:08.360 --> 29:12.240]  else so they're inducted into the prison system so that the schools do become
[29:12.240 --> 29:15.440]  pipelines into prison that's one of the only true things that thought that
[29:15.440 --> 29:19.960]  ignorant woman said but again now that they're gonna try to get blacks to act
[29:19.960 --> 29:23.200]  more racist act more violent and black lives matter groups are gonna push
[29:23.200 --> 29:27.160]  killing cops which are totally innocent getting shot in the back of the head like
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.160]  this poor black cop got executed last week in New York and then the mayor
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.720]  wouldn't even go to her funeral or memorial went and help run the riots
[29:35.720 --> 29:40.040]  over in Germany what CNN said weren't riots they're trying to start a
[29:40.040 --> 29:44.080]  revolution black lives matter is the most idiotic moron group and it's now
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.920]  bordering on terrorism and it's being sued for it so good luck idiots we're
[29:48.920 --> 29:57.200]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:57.200 --> 30:05.320]  after a series of embarrassments and scandals CNN is in full-blown crisis
[30:05.320 --> 30:09.520]  mode with the network now attracting fewer viewers for its primetime shows
[30:09.520 --> 30:15.720]  then multi-decade old reruns of Yogi Bear with the Trump Russia collusion story
[30:15.720 --> 30:20.600]  fading into the background an issue that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings
[30:20.600 --> 30:26.000]  despite knowing it was fake news the network's ratings are now plummeting and
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.600]  there's no doubt that CNN's most recent scandal that sparked hashtag CNN
[30:30.600 --> 30:35.960]  blackmail has played a role after CNN threatened to dock some random gift
[30:35.960 --> 30:39.960]  creator that President Trump happened to retweet to put things into
[30:39.960 --> 30:45.920]  perspective the CNN app now has only one star out of five in the Apple app store
[30:45.920 --> 30:50.720]  where comparably the Fox News app has three and a half stars whereas the
[30:50.720 --> 30:56.160]  info wars and Alex Jones radio app have both four and a half stars I'm Miller

[34:13.960 --> 34:19.160]  knows we're not exaggerating the left is so racist so race baiting inculcating
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.400]  wounding the minds of black people particularly with such foaming at the
[34:25.400 --> 34:31.800]  mouth anti-white black nationalism it is meant to put them into their total
[34:31.800 --> 34:38.120]  minority group then prep by gangster rap for prison so the very conduit of
[34:38.120 --> 34:45.440]  school to prison the black lives matter was talking about earlier in that video
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.200]  that conduit probably being produced by some liberal white guy we know funded
[34:51.200 --> 34:59.000]  by Soros is actually being run by them and that's the fact think about how
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.200]  incredible that is so during the break they were printing off some of the
[35:02.200 --> 35:05.560]  statistics and some of the numbers and my memory serves you'll get a couple
[35:05.560 --> 35:10.960]  hundred blacks killed or less than a hundred killed you'll get 300 or so shot
[35:10.960 --> 35:17.680]  by police and then you add that to thousands and thousands of blacks
[35:17.680 --> 35:21.640]  shooting each other and killing each other in Chicago alone every year but
[35:21.640 --> 35:27.520]  nobody focuses on that nobody gets into that nobody wants to talk about that
[35:27.520 --> 35:34.880]  because it's not the fun of claiming that there is this epidemic of white
[35:34.880 --> 35:38.280]  cops running around shooting white people when the truth is you can just
[35:38.280 --> 35:43.360]  type this into a search engine police are more likely to shoot white people
[35:43.360 --> 35:48.960]  than any other group statistically not just that whites are a majority in some
[35:48.960 --> 35:57.160]  areas but per capita police shoot more white people more often than any other
[35:57.160 --> 36:04.280]  group and they admit they slow roll into predominantly poor black areas because
[36:04.280 --> 36:09.240]  they don't want to be blamed with racism and so that causes crime to go up and
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.360]  more blacks to be killed and allows a culture of crime to take over actually
[36:14.360 --> 36:17.240]  they found some of the headlines let's pull them up this study found race
[36:17.240 --> 36:22.040]  matters and police shootings but the results may surprise you more whites are
[36:22.040 --> 36:27.680]  shot per capita than blacks a Washington Post actually got that right back in
[36:27.680 --> 36:34.520]  2016 these numbers are known the Washington Post launched a real-time
[36:34.520 --> 36:38.480]  database to track fatal police shootings and the project continues this year as
[36:38.480 --> 36:43.840]  of Sunday 1,502 people have been shot and killed by on duty police officers in
[36:43.840 --> 36:52.200]  January 1st 2015 of them 732 were white 381 were black and 382 were of
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.160]  another unknown race the vast majority were white but again it doesn't matter
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.080]  there are some bad cops that shoot people they shouldn't everybody knows
[37:01.080 --> 37:05.040]  that the point is George Soros and the globalists know there's a rebellion
[37:05.040 --> 37:08.320]  against the corrupt government they know there's a mass awakening they want to
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.080]  short-circuit it with a bunch of race baiting race fighting and everybody
[37:12.080 --> 37:16.080]  killing each other it's in the wiki leaks they're trying to start a race war
[37:16.080 --> 37:19.440]  and a lot of people are self-centered out there in the population they think
[37:19.440 --> 37:24.840]  I'm against a race war because I'm afraid they think I'm against a race war
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.800]  because I'm scared I'm gonna get killed no it's the opposite I'm scared you're
[37:29.800 --> 37:37.560]  gonna get killed I've got security I've got firearms I live defended behind a
[37:37.560 --> 37:44.000]  gate behind walls if there's a race war in this country it's going to be the
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.840]  minorities that share the main brunt of the slaughterhouse and that's not a
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.400]  threat that's a fact but why would I feel good if you got killed I'm trying to
[37:54.400 --> 37:58.560]  keep you from aborting your children I'm trying to tell Mexicans that they've
[37:58.560 --> 38:02.880]  got a five-year program to forcibly inoculate every Mexican girl at the
[38:02.880 --> 38:08.040]  age of 11 and it's been linked to sterilization but your loraza funded by
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.600]  the fortune 500 your metcha funded by George Soros the big foundations wants
[38:12.600 --> 38:18.600]  to wound you with racist Chicano brainwashing to keep you stunted under
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.880]  their control in your barrio under the management of your local Mexican
[38:23.880 --> 38:28.880]  Politico Don in the Mexican mafia that keeps your people down and sells you
[38:28.880 --> 38:36.040]  drugs and pipelines you into the prison but nobody sells out their people like
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.800]  the black leaders and that's well-known
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.280]  Mexico orders HPV axinations for all fifth-grade girls saying it will end
[38:44.280 --> 38:50.800]  the threat of cervical cancer which is basically so rare it's unbelievable a lot
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.720]  of folks they shut up Alex let Gates do this let the let the UN do it I am not
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.200]  racist but they're coming after us why are you exposing all this because I have
[39:00.200 --> 39:04.440]  to tell the truth and I tell you what's going on doesn't mean black lives
[39:04.440 --> 39:09.320]  matters gonna listen doesn't mean metcha and loraza are gonna listen and it
[39:09.320 --> 39:13.040]  doesn't mean of down the road we fail to stop this race war big horde of people
[39:13.040 --> 39:17.800]  are coming down the street for me and my family shooting guns off in the air and
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.840]  burning buildings I'm gonna light up whoever I got to to defend my family but
[39:22.840 --> 39:28.120]  it doesn't mean I'm gonna enjoy it I'll do what has to be done just like I've
[39:28.120 --> 39:33.200]  done in the information war but Trump's trying his best to turn prosperity back
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.760]  on and to unify America and we're trying our best as well up against the likes
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.360]  of George Sorosa horrible nasty who's overthrown over 80 countries crashed
[39:43.360 --> 39:48.520]  over a hundred economies who admits he worked for Hitler and says he's proud of
[39:48.520 --> 39:54.760]  it and doesn't apologize and that's why he gets the ADL award of the year it's
[39:54.760 --> 40:02.760]  all part of a sick joke given Obama a peace prize but even the Washington
[40:02.760 --> 40:06.360]  posts that lies so much been bought out by Bezos now in the last year so it's
[40:06.360 --> 40:10.120]  even worse admits that police shooting database and federal
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.960]  crime statistics death by homicide and goes on to say there is no sign of
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.600]  bias unless it means white people being shot now I'm done talking about that I
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.440]  want to get to the really really really really really big news that is so
[40:25.440 --> 40:30.480]  illustrative of CNN's deception and I'll get into military news political news

[43:44.000 --> 43:48.040]  sponsors they don't want us creating our own economy they are so frightened it's
[43:48.040 --> 43:51.480]  in the wiki leaks it's in the Clinton Foundation documents their library
[43:51.480 --> 43:56.320]  foundation that they have always been afraid of us selling books or videos or
[43:56.320 --> 44:00.680]  anybody creating a new economy they were writing about Joseph Farah 93 in the
[44:00.680 --> 44:05.760]  Western Journalism Center he created world net daily a few years later saying
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.280]  if libertarians or conservatives or nationalists or even leftists they say
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.040]  start selling books and videos that we don't control or having their own
[44:14.040 --> 44:18.520]  newspapers it's over for us they'll create their own new economy so they
[44:18.520 --> 44:22.600]  instructed mainstream media to call us conspiracy theorist to say we were evil
[44:22.600 --> 44:28.520]  if we sold anything and to call for us to be shut down when I say us I wasn't on
[44:28.520 --> 44:32.560]  air for two more years but that's what they did to everybody and look how they
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.520]  failed and look how they're collapsing and look in her own words she's losing
[44:36.520 --> 44:42.440]  the info war lastly it's been sold out for close to six months as well I signed
[44:42.440 --> 44:48.520]  a contract with Misha B.C. America that produces the only organically produced
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.200]  bio PQQ all the other stuff out there is synthetic they have the patent this is
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.280]  the only one with 175 plus studies it's the only one with the proven nerve
[44:57.280 --> 45:01.600]  regrowth it's the only one in Europe it's a drug people buy basically the same
[45:01.600 --> 45:08.040]  formula for $300 to $600 at medical clinics my dad was at a big fancy
[45:08.040 --> 45:11.480]  medical clinic he's a doctor about four years ago and he said son they are
[45:11.480 --> 45:15.480]  selling this for $400 a bottle the stuff he had he said we can go out and get it
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.120]  and and bottle it for 60 bucks a bottle sell it for 130 have a hundred percent
[45:20.120 --> 45:26.440]  markup and undercut the entire market well we did it except I'm offering it
[45:26.440 --> 45:31.840]  20% off even though it's been sold out try DNA force for yourself but warning
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.520]  maybe you've had back pain before maybe you've had nerves that were cut off this
[45:35.520 --> 45:38.480]  creates tingling this had a lot of people have their feeling come back I'm not
[45:38.480 --> 45:43.520]  gonna make claims this research true organically based bio PQQ and it's not
[45:43.520 --> 45:49.560]  technically organic the other stuff synthetic completely map lab made this
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.200]  is made from organic sources but the bacteria is GMO I'll just tell you up
[45:54.200 --> 45:58.040]  front but it's not like the super high-tech stuff it's a bacteria that's
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.480]  just been bred to be able to then secrete and produce this just like beer
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.280]  is bacteria a lot of good bacteria obviously but this one that's how the
[46:06.280 --> 46:13.120]  Japanese do it but it's bio identical the stuff is only found in comets and
[46:13.120 --> 46:17.160]  then trace amounts in blueberries yes this is what I'm not kidding look up
[46:17.160 --> 46:21.160]  bio PQQ that's just one of the things that it's got the organic coq 10 these
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.440]  acids and amino acids that help you upload it it's an amazing product my dad
[46:26.440 --> 46:31.480]  developed it with Dr. Group info wars life.com we made it better than the stuff
[46:31.480 --> 46:38.920]  $300 $600 okay that you go get from doctors so info wars life.com or triple
[46:38.920 --> 46:42.720]  eight two five three three one three nine it is back in stock DNA for Santa
[46:42.720 --> 46:46.320]  for auto ship an additional 10% off that's a big savings with things like
[46:46.320 --> 46:48.920]  that okay
[46:49.920 --> 46:59.840]  yesterday morning I get up to see the fourth day of riots in Hamburg and read
[46:59.840 --> 47:05.800]  the headline in the Associated Press that 470 plus officers have serious
[47:05.800 --> 47:13.640]  injuries then I see a poll Joseph Watson tweet I mean if you see the videos
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.320]  we're showing right now as a radio listener but info wars.com info wars.com
[47:17.320 --> 47:21.760]  force law show you will see it it looks like the city's been bombed by bombers
[47:21.760 --> 47:27.160]  in World War two or something I mean we're talking about fires over your 510
[47:27.160 --> 47:33.760]  square miles burn hundreds of burning vehicles dozens of burn shops buildings
[47:33.760 --> 47:42.520]  on fire George Soros funded scum of the earth running around attacking the G20
[47:42.520 --> 47:45.880]  even though these are the very globalists that have empowered them put
[47:45.880 --> 47:49.080]  them on welfare give them a welfare state give them everything they want
[47:49.080 --> 47:52.560]  this is like something out of
[47:52.560 --> 48:05.040]  soylent green protesters flood streets of Hamburg as G20 wraps up now the
[48:05.040 --> 48:12.520]  headline from CNN that Paul Watson tweeted that will put on screen is Hamburg
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.680]  Germany an eclectic and international mix of demonstrators peacefully tramp
[48:16.680 --> 48:21.320]  through the streets of Hamburg on Saturday and Sunday a show of anti-capitalist
[48:21.320 --> 48:25.040]  muscle in earshot of the world's top leaders who were finishing up the G20
[48:25.040 --> 48:30.960]  summit there it is peaceful demonstrators flooded the streets we haven't
[48:30.960 --> 48:35.080]  shown you the dramatic footage yet that's on red state rising that shows it
[48:35.080 --> 48:39.840]  from a skyscraper and just shows like scores of fires from a bird's eye view I
[48:39.840 --> 48:45.080]  mean it is crazy I'll show you that I guess after the break
[48:45.080 --> 48:53.920]  now understand is CNN trying to be absurdist is CNN trying to be a parody
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.160]  is CNN trying to be like Monty Python in the Holy Grail with the night that goes
[48:58.160 --> 49:03.000]  neat and he wants a shrubbery has his arms and legs cut off and keeps saying
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.920]  it's merely a flesh wound and keeps denying that any of that's happened or
[49:08.920 --> 49:19.840]  gone on ladies and gentlemen I have a stack of news articles here from
[49:19.840 --> 49:26.440]  mainstream news admitting that it was quote an orgy of violence that that
[49:26.440 --> 49:29.960]  that that that people are in critical condition that thousands were injured
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.760]  400 plus police officers look at these headlines for yourself CNN claims G20
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.320]  protest was peaceful that's a kick Daniels article upon info wars calm that
[49:40.320 --> 49:44.480]  boils all this down that everybody should get to that everybody should tweet
[49:44.480 --> 49:49.240]  at real Alex Jones that everybody should share because he boils it all down and
[49:49.240 --> 49:55.080]  shows what really happened and shows the fake articles put out by CNN but here's
[49:55.080 --> 49:59.960]  other mainstream media that won't even be as deceptive as they are Merkel
[49:59.960 --> 50:06.320]  defends decision to host G20 in Hamburg after rioting Bloomberg Germans angry
[50:06.320 --> 50:14.160]  over orgy of violence at Merkel's pre-election G20 Reuters water cannon
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.440]  and burned out cars violent riots continue in Hamburg after G20 summit
[50:18.440 --> 50:30.080]  RT ISIS poster girl that's a whole nother article Arab refugees in Germany
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.240]  can't understand why G20 protesters are rioting they say you get everything
[50:34.240 --> 50:37.720]  they're bringing us in why are you rioting I mean even the Muslims don't
[50:37.720 --> 50:49.280]  understand it so I asked you this why would CNN why would CNN come out in a
[50:49.280 --> 50:53.560]  bunch of headlines and videos and say all weekend it was peaceful when
[50:53.560 --> 51:00.400]  Hamburg's been on fire since last Wednesday why do they lie if food became
[51:00.400 --> 51:03.880]  scarce would you be able to feed yourself and your family have you found

[51:07.480 --> 51:10.560]  month supply and worst of all they're packed with chemicals and other

[54:22.160 --> 54:29.920]  now we make jokes about CNN but there are still some people that believe CNN and
[54:29.920 --> 54:33.280]  so it's happening is mainstream media knows they've been found out they know
[54:33.280 --> 54:36.200]  they're liars they know they have no credibility they know they have a six
[54:36.200 --> 54:40.880]  percent trust rate even the Associated Press's national study last year so all
[54:40.880 --> 54:46.720]  they can do now is be disruptive and troll the public but they're out live
[54:46.720 --> 54:50.480]  with big money and with a lot of civil servants and bureaucrats and also
[54:50.480 --> 54:57.040]  losers losers like company and a lot of losers want to be disruptive of society
[54:57.040 --> 55:05.040]  and success and so that's really the position CNN has taken editorially is
[55:05.040 --> 55:11.400]  that whatever the truth is just lie whatever is happening blaming on the
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.000]  other side so they want to demonize the g20 they want to play the part of
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.800]  supporting revolution and the Arab Spring and the radical jihad's and the
[55:18.800 --> 55:23.240]  overthrow of Ukraine they're funding the cultural revolution of George Soros and
[55:23.240 --> 55:30.080]  his disruptive culture squads all over the world and they want to overthrow even
[55:30.080 --> 55:37.280]  socialist regimes in Germany and put something even worse in and so that's
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.960]  why you have the g20 calling for global government and you've got them pushing
[55:43.960 --> 55:47.120]  the open borders and bringing in the Islamists and all the rest of it but
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.240]  still George Soros and the big foundations sent in the groups to burn
[55:53.240 --> 55:58.320]  down large parts of Hamburg and then even the Muslims said we don't understand
[55:58.320 --> 56:03.920]  they let us in they give us everything free you don't even work here in Germany
[56:03.920 --> 56:10.480]  why are you burning everything Germany has capitulated that's the point though
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.840]  they want you to see the violence legitimized all over the world and
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.440]  believe you're going to be green-lighted if you do it here if you go and shoot a
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.520]  cop in the back of the head or if you go and club somebody over the head with a
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.920]  bike lock or if you go as a mob of men and drag some woman off it tries to go
[56:27.920 --> 56:33.440]  here Milo speak that you're a hero so they have to say it's peaceful to give
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.800]  you political backing in the summer of rage so that as more cops and more
[56:38.800 --> 56:42.520]  citizens and more libertarians and more Christians and more conservatives get
[56:42.520 --> 56:47.800]  killed there's no opposition to it because no one reports on it just like
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.880]  when a guy screams Allah Akbar and stabs a cop or kills a school teacher or
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.320]  shoots up a bar or shoots up a church or shoots up their Christmas party in
[56:56.320 --> 57:03.040]  San Bernardino or goes and shoots up a gay bar you don't call it Islamic you
[57:03.040 --> 57:09.320]  say it's a right-wing hate crime and when Congressman Scalise gets shot still
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.520]  fighting for his life back in critical condition with infections and a couple
[57:13.520 --> 57:23.480]  cops get shot some you say it's oh it's Trump's fault and then you put out the
[57:23.480 --> 57:29.120]  hashtag hunt Republicans you arrogantly double and triple and quadruple down to
[57:29.120 --> 57:35.000]  infinity because you have nothing to lose your cornered scum and you keep the
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.960]  illusion up that you're confident and you're in charge so that all of us that
[57:38.960 --> 57:43.640]  are in the majority of every color of every creed feel like we're the minority
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.160]  but that illusion is falling you got to ask yourself what's gonna come next
[57:49.160 --> 57:54.200]  protesters flood the streets of Hamburg and peacefully trample to the streets
[57:54.200 --> 58:02.920]  she and in total in your face crazy fake news why would they do it because
[58:02.920 --> 58:08.040]  they've decided to own who they are the villains Zucker I guarantee you has sat
[58:08.040 --> 58:11.720]  in those meetings and said we're known to be liars let's go with it let's be as
[58:11.720 --> 58:17.600]  disruptive as possible let's call everything truthful lies here it is
[58:17.600 --> 58:21.080]  got the headlines right here the Muslims are saying why are you doing this
[58:21.080 --> 58:25.960]  Germany has submitted you got to read this article Arab refugees in Germany
[58:25.960 --> 58:32.080]  can't understand why G20 protesters are rioting they go on to say they've been
[58:32.080 --> 58:35.840]  totally open and done whatever we want why are you doing it they've submitted
[58:35.840 --> 58:41.200]  to us why are you burning it it's ours hamburgers ours why are you burning it

[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:12.760]  journalists to understand this is the total mental illness insanity of the
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:17.600]  elites literally saying let them eat cake as the Islamists Muslims pour in in
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:22.080]  mass Austria deploys military to Italian border as migrant crisis explodes
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:27.360]  that's up on info wars calm linking to AFP and the associated press the Europe
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:31.880]  cities centers sound the alarm that there aren't any Germans or French or
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:36.440]  anybody left AFP and then they're not welcome it's no go zones wow you mean
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:40.880]  people aren't white connect races to oh in fact just as just as much so or even
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.640]  more so there's no Christian background to be a true Muslims you have to
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:54.600]  believe in Islam as a religion and as a state so it is impossible for someone to
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:02:01.720]  be a true Muslim and a true American at the same time because Muslims always
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:09.280]  look to live under Islamic Sharia not under American Constitution I am one of
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:16.080]  them trust me I know him I was very involved with my Muslim community for
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:21.360]  the first 10 years here in the United States and I heard a million times
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:27.280]  saying that we are here to eventually replace the American Constitution with
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:31.640]  Islamic Sharia 60% believe Islam is incompatible with French society well
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:36.080]  don't worry what your brain damage from enough vaccines you won't care over
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:41.680]  5,000 cases of female general mutilation in England over the past year alone as
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:47.440]  they cut full-grown women's journals off but that's okay it's Muslim and Bill
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:50.800]  Gates finally says something I agree with Bill Gates warns Angela Merkel's
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:54.480]  open-door migrant policy has left Europe at breaking point and calls on leaders
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.560]  to stem the flow from Africa but but he's been pushing this before but he says
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:01.760]  it's gonna cause a rebellion and that they're gonna lose control he's only
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:08.000]  saying that because they push too far ISIS cornered in Mosul as Iraq prepares
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.240]  victory celebrations that's right Trump and our US military but his
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:16.880]  leadership has almost smashed ISIS that Obama and the globalists created
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:21.960]  Obama and NATO were behind the whole Arab Spring whole invasion force all of
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:25.120]  it our military set aside you want to go back to England don't you weren't even
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:28.880]  raised here your dad was a dictator you tried to democratize they've used that

[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:39.200]  kick ISIS al-Qaeda out and we will look we will we will not help al-Qaeda and
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:43.520]  ISIS take over that was our military's compromise against Obama and now we're
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:50.360]  here five years later and it's time for Assad you made that agreement to begin
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:55.080]  to segue out that's the agreement he made many nations look to the Geneva
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:59.960]  process to resolve the Syrian conflict in a way that produces stability and gives
[1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:03.480]  the Syrian the Syrian people the opportunity to determine their own
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:08.600]  political future and our hope is Bashar al-Assad will not be a part of that

[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:33.320]  Syrian President Bashar Assad and Washington supporting rebels who have
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.600]  been fighting Assad both the US and Russia oppose the Islamic State group in
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:41.680]  Syria that's a p lying right there I've interviewed the folks that brief

[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:31.840]  I helped the blind to see I got no friends
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:39.240]  as they read the papers they can't be seen with us
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:47.200]  no I'm not feeling shot down I'm feeling good that's why mr. nice guy by the way
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:52.360]  I decided what to do I have not released the Megan Kelly hours and hours of
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:56.560]  interviews that we recorded while she was here because she lied doesn't said
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:00.680]  it wasn't a hit piece and we knew it was but her ratings have gone from seven
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:05.200]  million to two million she's done everybody hates her Joe Rogan did a
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:08.840]  piece last week saying she's over that you know anybody that basically does one
[1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:12.600]  of those hit pieces on me like Pierce Morgan or anybody else is done she was
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:17.040]  done when she took on Trump but she's really done now but I thought now's the
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.680]  time to release some big chunks of it this week because we can in the
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:25.920]  aftermath show her destroyed and I told her at the end of the interview I said
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:30.520]  I know this is a hit piece I know you lied to me and you will be destroyed you
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:34.800]  will be defeated and she laughed at me and I said keep laughing you know you're
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.160]  not gonna have a job soon and then she got basically tears on her eyes and I
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:42.480]  know behind the scenes that she's been crying she's a total basket case and you
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:48.480]  know I feel sorry for her she's a mercenary that they sent up against the
[1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:54.600]  resistance I could have been in a coma and the public would have been for me I
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:58.760]  didn't do that good a job I'm all about the truth I didn't do a very good job I
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:03.160]  shouldn't let her in here for 12 hours I was tired at night but they still
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:07.800]  edited together to make it look like a bumbling idiot and it blew up in their
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:14.840]  face galactic style and now they admit what Cernovich said weeks after that the
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:20.000]  word is she's gone and what Cernovich said from his sources that that night from
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:24.440]  NBC was they're looking for her exit well now weeks later the word is she's
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:28.360]  bye-bye and it's not about being vindictive to Megan Kelly but she thinks
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:32.120]  that she gets paid 18 million dollars a year by NBC to run around doing hatchet
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:36.160]  jobs on America that people aren't gonna hate her of course no one watches the
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:41.480]  show of course dateline had 10 million viewers when she started a week later
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:47.160]  seven and a half then five then three point three then two two million they've
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:53.880]  lost eight million of their viewers in six weeks because people are sick of the
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:59.940]  globalist they're sick of Hollywood they're sick of celebrity type talk show
[1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:07.600]  hosts like her they want teleprompter free they want raw they want real
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.160]  speaking of real Mike Cernovich is riding shotgun with us this hour into the
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:13.920]  next to be like we're gonna open the phones up at the bottom of the hour
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:20.600]  first-time callers on any subject I've raised see it in in a scores of reports
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:24.240]  when I saw it I said this can't be real when Paul Watson tweeted it yesterday
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:29.280]  morning and to put his tweet up on screen for TV viewers and I went and there
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:36.600]  it was their headline that the protests were all peaceful and loving and good
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:41.000]  here it is Hamburg an eclectic and international mix of demonstrators
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.200]  peacefully tramped through the streets of Hamburg on Saturday they'd been
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:49.080]  rioting and burning the city since Wednesday now I've got tons of news I'm
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:53.920]  not going back to this for lack of news then I went to CNN's main website it
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.840]  was all positive except one article about burning cars and looting at the
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:03.640]  bottom contradicting all the other articles saying they were angels why
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:08.920]  would they lie like this I think to condition us they've been caught lying
[1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:16.080]  they have a 6% trust rate according to AP show why not try to like go so deceptive
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:20.360]  you become like a cartoon character when everybody knows that you know somebody
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:25.440]  Sam lies that he's treacherous but he's still funny and so it's like they're
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:29.480]  becoming the night that went me maybe we can chew that up later from the
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:34.040]  nights of the holy grail where he's going to the forest his cockums over
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.320]  says I want you to buy me a shrubbery or I'm going to kill you he says okay I'll
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:40.960]  buy a shrubbery goes I want 20 shrubberies you know it's a classical
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:44.200]  thing once you start paying somebody off and I want a lot of bushes and trees
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:48.520]  he goes no that's it cuts his leg off you thought it's merely a flesh wound
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:53.120]  that's the other leg off that's the arms off but he refuses to admit he's been
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:58.280]  beaten so Mike Sernich is a smart cookie filmmaker producer best-selling author
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:02.800]  researcher more than 10 million views a week just on his videos it's got a
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:07.080]  scare CNN he's got the CFR doing hit pieces on him he'll be joining us soon
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:11.000]  here he already once a week host an hour but in the next month he'll be on several
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.220]  hours every day I want to get his take on that the Democrats doubling down
[1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:20.840]  saying Hillary and Obama and Pelosi will lead the the midterm election push
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:24.440]  against Trump what you couldn't ask for something better well I guess Linda
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:30.340]  Sorcerer is even worse calling for Jihad she's like the new pet glorious
[1:13:30.340 --> 1:13:36.640]  stynum of feminism pushing general mutilation it's like it's satire it's
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.720]  like Kurt Vonnegut is having a hallucination and writing all this and
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:47.720]  has CNN as the joke I mean we've got CNN caught hiring al-Qaeda correspondent
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:52.240]  you can't make that up info wars.com you've got Comey admittedly now caught
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.360]  perjuring himself and lying with classified memos they now admit were
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:03.320]  classified this is incredible mainstream and media admits that we've got the
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:07.040]  Pope saying the US-Russia alliance is dangerous and that our countries are
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:12.160]  evil this from a guy leading the pedophile takeover of the Catholic
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:17.760]  Church we've got just insanity this hour into the next we've got British man
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:22.480]  21 makes history by giving birth to baby daughter when I read the headline in AP
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:26.640]  Reuters the Sun I said it'll be a woman that thinks she's a man that had a baby
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:30.120]  and sure enough it was because they haven't produced artificial wombs that
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:36.400]  work properly they still got to use cows to grow humanoids and clones so it's a
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.760]  woman that thinks she's a man that had sex with a man she had a baby but they
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:48.160]  say it's a man it's fraud it's not that I hate mentally ill people I mean you know
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.240]  if somebody wants to go be a woman or be a tranny you know if it's a gay guy and
[1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:55.760]  wants to go pick up more guys you want to go get breast implants and doll your
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:00.600]  hair up knock yourself out I'm all for freedom but if you really think you're
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:07.720]  a man and you're a woman and you go and have a baby now let's show the baby bump
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:14.160]  and then the media runs with it that a that a man had a baby no a woman had a
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:21.400]  baby a woman had a baby a woman had a baby a woman a woman a woman just like
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:26.760]  male and female whales male and female rabbits male and female praying
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:33.280]  mannises man male and female bass male and female tigers they come this is
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:39.000]  mass mental illness saying that you're biologically a man when you're a woman
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:45.680]  and you got a uterus again it's like the the South Park piece where he thinks
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:51.360]  he's a dolphin so Mike Cernovich chronicling the globalist what are they
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:54.000]  doing I know they're trying to instill mass mental illness they admit that in
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:59.880]  the WikiLeaks and their white papers but what is CNN doing going next level
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:03.840]  everything is like fake news where they say no one would shake Trump's hand and
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:06.400]  then they added it to look like no one shook his hand when everybody was
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:10.800]  actually chasing him begging to be close to him climbing over themselves and he
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:14.360]  was just shutting them wearing his American flag pin while everybody else
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:20.040]  was wearing G20 pins I mean and don't I mean what is CNN doing Cernovich man I
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:23.520]  think about that all the time actually you mentioned being in like a Kurt
[1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:28.400]  Vonogard hallucination I feel like we're in a video game now because what is
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:34.160]  happening is really too absurd to believe every day more fake news CNN
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:39.040]  hiring Al Qaeda right literally funding terrorism and of course you reported on
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:42.920]  that story like two or three years ago I love how these people breaking news big
[1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:46.200]  scoop and then they talk about something that you had talked about a long time
[1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:51.640]  ago and then of course the white helmets are ISIS that maybe maybe people
[1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:55.240]  learn the truth about the white helmets in a year or two you know who knows but
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.280]  it's become so absurd that I honestly and this doesn't happen often I can't
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:03.320]  figure out their angle it doesn't make any sense what they're doing I mean
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:08.040]  everybody sees burning cities 475 cops some of them fight for their lives
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:12.040]  citizens burn up fight for their lives total carnage the city looks like it
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:16.120]  just got bombed by B2 bombers and they're on the news saying it was totally
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:20.640]  peaceful yeah that's the whole point you we can now with your own eyes you can
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.760]  contradict what you say there they go oh it's a peaceful protest even though
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:28.520]  Hamburg was burning you couldn't tell a difference between Hamburg and Syria it
[1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:33.160]  was one of the same now the the whole Chris Khaleesi or whatever he's the guy
[1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:36.000]  who said we couldn't talk about Hillary's health by the way one thing
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.160]  that they're not counting on is for people to have a long memory so the same
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:44.320]  guy who said we can't talk about Hillary's health tweeted out a gif where
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:48.640]  it looked like the First Lady of Poland wasn't shaking Trump's hand when what
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:52.080]  has happened is she had went to shake the First Lady's hand and then she turned
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:56.360]  over and shit shook Trump's hand and you're thinking how stupid are these
[1:17:56.360 --> 1:17:59.880]  people I couldn't get away with stuff like my own followers the people who
[1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:04.880]  like me if I posted that my family if I told lies like this on air would disown
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:10.720]  me yeah yeah our listeners and viewers and readers wouldn't would never allow
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:15.240]  that so I'm like wait a minute this guy he's lying is this is fraud and what
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:18.160]  they're doing Cernovich they are they know they've been caught they're trying
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:23.080]  to condition us to accept it we are being conditioned they're titrating it to
[1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:26.440]  just accept it I think they're trying to normalize it and the news is it's not
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:31.840]  working right I mean even the president of Poland had to say man you're lying
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:36.880]  call this a lie it isn't a bias anymore I used to believe that the media was
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:41.320]  just biased you know hey cuz I'm biased I'm pro-trump if I hear something bad
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:45.360]  about Trump I'm not gonna believe it as likely as I would something bad about
[1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:48.200]  Hillary that's called being a human being but everybody who reads me knows
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:53.280]  that don't come to me for the really nasty stuff on Trump people get it but
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:58.280]  that is just outright fabrication that's just a lie that that is visual
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:01.760]  evidence saying that you're a fraud it isn't about buying trying to be caught
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:06.680]  that's what I'm saying they're telling lies now that are it's like give a
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:11.480]  Palestinian stabs three police officers and kills one and then get shot they'll
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:16.280]  say you'll Israeli shot a Palestinian and killed him today and they're not
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:19.560]  even mentioned that they stabbed somebody well you raise a good point
[1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:24.160]  actually maybe the CNN is like the cheating spouse and this is a cry for
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:28.360]  help maybe they want to get caught lying because that's the only way that they
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:31.280]  can really exactly that's the criminology you're taking it one further
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:35.320]  their psychopaths first are very careful about their murders then they get more
[1:19:35.320 --> 1:19:38.840]  and more reckless taunt the police send in letters saying you can't catch me
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:43.080]  that's it son of it you did it you figured it out it is a cry for help
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:47.280]  they've been it that you you did it I didn't really it is the last stages of
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:53.040]  total mental illness a cry for help that's it CNN is crying for help man and

[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:47.360]  the arrogance all the mentally ill energy of the robber barons and the
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:52.840]  globalists are now imploding I've got a huge story we're gonna cover when we
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:59.560]  start the next segment that I want to thank Daria who is actually off today for
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:03.840]  calling up and pointing out because I meant to get to it but I had it buried
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.280]  here in my stack in fact maybe you guys can print me those articles again I may
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:12.040]  have taken them to my office it's pretty amazing I'm gonna wait till the start of
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:17.200]  the next segment to get to that this is just incredible but but getting back to
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:25.040]  Mike Cernovich now part of the enforce team Mike Hillary is announcing she's
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:30.200]  going to front line run the 2018 midterm elections that also means Rob of
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:35.080]  course the contributions many of them as you always does and that Pelosi is
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:39.520]  gonna stay in and that Obama is coming back to help as well I mean talk about
[1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:43.240]  arrogance even their own party wants them out but they're in control they're
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:48.520]  going to stay in control as their party becomes a coastal party everything they
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:51.480]  said was gonna happen the Republicans is now happening to them again this is
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:55.320]  more of the mental illness more of the self destructiveness but again it's the
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:00.600]  bravada it's the delusional behavior we see from people that were given what
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:05.000]  they had the Clintons were given power by previous globalists they're now in
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.880]  control so it's a perfect scenario talk about spoiled brats being given daddy's
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:14.480]  business and running into the ground that's what they've done yeah I love it
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:19.260]  everything that I'm watching happen I'm loving because while the media is
[1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:23.840]  pushing another Trump Russia conspiracy theory about a 20 minute meeting
[1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:28.560]  Donald Trump Jr. had with some you know lawyer advocate or whatever trying to
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:32.880]  make a big deal out of it they have Pelosi in they have Hillary Clinton and
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:38.160]  then they have this Muslim Brotherhood guy forget his name I love it when I'm
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:42.280]  watching the 2008 midterm election run-ups I the only thing that scares me
[1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:48.160]  is that Paul Ryan is such a coward and the GOP are so cocked that as bad as the
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:53.520]  Democrats are do the Republicans really want to win or do they just want to
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:57.840]  throw it it's like pro wrestling at this point Paul Ryan doesn't want to win he's
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:03.120]  just the bad guy or whatever in this script and it's all fake so my only
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:07.760]  concern is that the GOP doesn't want to actually win in the midterms which is
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:11.600]  why the Patriots are gonna have to unite and we're gonna have to run our own
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:16.280]  primary campaigns and get people out of the Republic well that was my next point
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:19.680]  as soon as you finish I threw it to you I was gonna say because it's true I mean
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:22.920]  we're on the same page this reality the enemy is the Republican establishment
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.280]  the Democrats are self-destructing they don't even know who the president is
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:30.520]  Pelosi like 12 times in the last few months has said that George W. Bush is
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:34.280]  still in office she doesn't know what planet she's on they want a mental test
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:38.840]  on Trump how about a test on her as you've said it'll definitely show she's
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:43.000]  got a serious neurological problems same thing with Maxine waters they're the
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.520]  ones screwing themselves in the ground like Rumpelstiltskin the problem is
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:51.360]  blue-eyed psycho talk about white devil Paul Ryan and the Republican
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:55.520]  establishment they are capable criminals they're the ones killing the repeal of
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:59.480]  Obamacare they're the ones killing tax cuts that are gonna kill the Trump
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:04.880]  recovery so they are enemy number one yeah they're trying to sabotage them the
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:09.440]  2020 thing is right now everything's so unpredictable that it's hard to know what
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:15.320]  will happen in 2020 the 2018 midterm so you're gonna really see a lot of people
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:17.760]  running against the primary challengers you're gonna have a lot of
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.600]  incumbents the Republicans facing the new opposition of people I've been
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:26.960]  contacted by a lot of people you know vets business people people at all
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:30.960]  levels moms every there are a lot of people who want to run and what I'm
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:36.560]  gonna do as we head towards 2018 is pick five or ten districts where there's a
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.040]  good chance we can Eric Cantor an establishment cock Republican and then
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:45.560]  I'm gonna actually go on the campaign trail and help these people run their
[1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:49.560]  primary campaigns I mean Roger Stone for example might be helping on Omar
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:53.840]  Navarro who's running against Maxine water how powerful would that be we
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.440]  should have Roger you know talk about what that would look like so there are
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:01.400]  these upstart contenders out there and then people like Roger experienced
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:04.920]  political operatives people like me experienced the media we're gonna be
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:11.080]  getting involved in laying out the blueprint to win this is an incredible
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:15.200]  time to be alive and again if we can just get the Republican establishment out
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:19.400]  of the way we're going to win if Trump can get his tax cuts and repeal Obamacare
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:23.720]  as he said just repeal it which shows he's for real that will kickstart the
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:27.640]  global economy and this recovery will stick if it doesn't though I think by
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:32.600]  winter we could see things downturn and they can get really really nasty the
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:35.840]  good news is voters have said in studies they're gonna blame the Republican
[1:29:35.840 --> 1:29:39.720]  establishment not Trump if this recovery fails we'll talk more with Mike
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:44.640]  Sernovich and give you the big news on the other side wait till you hear this
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:49.280]  the elite are really hitting the panic button we'll be right back we're on the

[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:41.480]  enemy globalist that's right ladies and gentlemen highway to the danger zone
[1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:47.560]  Mike Cernovich is our guest we're gonna be taking your phone calls at 800-259-231
[1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:57.440]  Cernovich financed the red pill that is one of the top videos on Amazon and on
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:02.280]  Netflix you name it I know because they show the top grossing ones and then the
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:07.160]  top ones getting watched you know at the front of the page most popular I saw
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:12.240]  red pill last night when I was watching a documentary with my wife I noticed that
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:16.360]  red pill was up there so that is a film that Cernovich has produced we've ordered
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:21.160]  a bunch of them they're coming in I'm gonna sell them on DVD but that's just
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:26.080]  an example of what Cernovich is doing I myself have also financed films like
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:29.760]  loose change and others I meant to get back into it but he's doing a kick
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:36.160]  starter program for a film called hoaxed exposing mainstream media lies will
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:40.280]  one of these films save the world no but all of them together will win the
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:44.440]  cultural revolution against the globalist and it shows how Amy Schumer
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:50.200]  they had to remove the star program rating system from liberal comedy people
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:54.920]  because they're so unpopular they leave it for other folks so it just shows how
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:58.880]  we're winning in the marketplace of ideas a feminist sets out to make a
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:02.600]  feminist film finds out it's all bull makes a phone about how men are being
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:07.280]  oppressed and DN franchise disenfranchised by design and it becomes
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:11.560]  one of the number one films of the year and Cernovich is now gonna do another
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:16.520]  kickstart to find another film and some will say well of a films doing so well
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:19.880]  you don't need money not with Hollywood not with these big distributors folks
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:26.280]  I've had films that sell a million DVDs and are on in theaters and then I
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.160]  didn't get any money that's how Hollywood operates you just don't get paid but
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:35.320]  it doesn't matter you still affect massive change and have a giant effect
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:39.280]  not quite a million it was it was a lot of DVDs and a lot of paid downloads and

[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:30.800]  program and this new film that you've because you know how to pick the winners
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:36.440]  I've seen that with a lot of films you've you've helped finance but before we do
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:41.000]  that just in putting a book in what we were earlier talking about then I'm
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.120]  gonna get into this huge media news that we haven't hit yet and then calls
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:51.080]  where do you see this crying out for help with CNN telling bigger and more
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:55.440]  obscene lies as liars all they know how to do is intensify what they're doing I
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:59.720]  think your theory and criminology is proven accurate in observation in the
[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:05.120]  field CNN is mentally ill crying out for help the equivalent of someone going
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:10.760]  to dementia rubbing feces on their face yeah the cry for help CNN cry for help
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:14.760]  is for sure because again what we were talking about earlier it isn't merely
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:19.800]  that people who work at CNN have a bias it's a natural human impulse to be
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:25.400]  biased they are now fabricating stories that can be refuted within a second
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:30.640]  by objective verifiable evidence that tells me that they clearly must be
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.800]  mentally ill or they feel so conflicted that they're thinking maybe if I just
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:40.840]  lie big enough my bosses will let me tell the truth maybe Jeff Zucker and the
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:44.640]  other people who own me will let me tell the truth if I just get caught again
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:48.680]  I'll be punished and they want to be punished and disciplined and put in
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:51.720]  their place and it's a mix of that Zucker in
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:55.680]  Italy we've got three veritas videos the highest levels tells them lie tells them
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:58.520]  try to start World War three he thinks they're making money off of it which
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:03.600]  isn't really true he's been ordered to do it and it's a rearguard action for him
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:06.800]  he's telling the old-time Warner executives yeah we're kicking Trump's
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:10.400]  butt he's just following orders and they're just soldiers following orders to
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:14.240]  lie and so the lies aren't working so just intensify I mean I think that's it
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:17.400]  is you've got the globalists that are somewhat disconnected but even if
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:23.400]  Harvard Law Journal and Harvard magazine as you showed the other day and the
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:26.720]  Financial Times of London and all these admit globalism is falling apart
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:32.400]  everybody hates it the tide is going out so they seem to start getting it at
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:36.480]  the top I mean do you think we're entering a phase where they may understand
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:40.640]  now that nothing they can do will put their new order together again well at
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:45.120]  the top here's what I think is happening is people like Jeff Zucker are just
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:50.120]  legitimately evil people he's the kind of person who when the lights go out and
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.480]  the doors are shut in the soundproof room you know you can only imagine what
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:40:56.400]  is happening in those soundproof rooms that they install in their houses and
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:01.920]  whatnot but the people like Chris Calizo who spread gifs that are fake I
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:07.440]  think he feels so disgusted by what he has to do for Jeff Zucker but he's got
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:11.040]  to make a living so in his mind he thinks well I mean I have to have a job I
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:15.760]  have to make a living well I'm just gonna lie so much in such obvious ways
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:21.520]  that I'm gonna have to be fired and I'll be free from this hell that CNN is
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:26.080]  that's my theory about the individual the individual people they want to be
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:30.760]  free from the hell of Jeff Zucker and that is why they're just lying that's
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:35.520]  why CNN fabricated a story three guys fabricated a story about Anthony
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:41.520]  Scaramucci total lie they wanted to get fired because they're tired of having to
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:45.320]  lie and they say that in the videos they say Trump isn't with the Russians it's
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:48.720]  all made up it's Hillary that's weather but we're ordered to do it we feel sorry
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:52.280]  for Trump I mean it's true we're on a witch hunt against him it's all made up
[1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:56.120]  they know about the WikiLeaks they know what evil old globalists they work for
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:01.160]  yeah exactly so they're conflicted that's why they're spreading the fake news and
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:04.040]  by the way you told me this and I've talked to him as well a lot of these
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:09.560]  big reporters hate their jobs they know it's all lies well most of them do that's
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:13.480]  why they watch info wars and stuff mainly because they want to learn how to
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:17.520]  build their own brand and go off on their own and not have to work for people
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.440]  like Jeff Zucker I mean just look at if you take I mean let's talk about CNN for
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:26.040]  example they had a pedophile on their show Jacob Schwartz a bill the
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:31.200]  Blasio employee went on to CNN with Chris Cuomo to talk about how Russians and
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.480]  racism stole the election there's a picture of him with Brooke something or
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:41.160]  other so CNN is a platform of pedophiles they have never disavowed this
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:45.400]  Jacob Schwartz who they had on their show to talk about Russia so if they're
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:50.640]  welcoming pedophiles onto their show what what can we expect and let's expand
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:56.080]  CNN silent on claims that hired al-qaeda correspondent info wars.com
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:00.200]  Paul Joseph Watson get this article out folks left-wing website exposed news
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:05.000]  network for paying correspondents to power on with terrorists CNN is refusing
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.920]  to respond to the claim it hired a correspondent who worked 7,000 al-qaeda
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.080]  jottison Syria left-wing website alternate documents how star CNN
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:17.080]  correspondent Clarissa Ward worked with al-qaeda media man by real Abdul Karim
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:22.120]  gain access to her heroes on the ground well I mean I had CNN reporters on a
[1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:27.160]  decade ago and five years ago who were being paid in the productions hundreds
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:32.560]  of thousands per piece by Qatar Bahrain and others to go do PR pieces on how
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:38.920]  genocide was good CNN's been doing pay-to-play forever yeah well but let's
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:42.080]  just think of the evil because a lot of people think we're playing up the evil
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:46.040]  we've now we've now found that if you're a pedophile and you want to complain
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:50.440]  about Russia Chris Cuomo will have you on a show and Chris Cuomo by the way
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:54.920]  tweeted out that it's bigoted for a man to not want his underage daughter to be
[1:43:54.920 --> 1:44:00.600]  in his to be in a shower alone with a man in his wing what are you for real like
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:04.720]  a lot of times I'm just when I a lot of times when I talk this is why I tell
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:07.960]  people he is a sexualization of children cheerleader he needs to be
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:12.400]  investigated that's what I say is when I talk to people I don't need to smoke
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:18.440]  marijuana I the reality is so weird that you're like wait a minute a CNN anchor
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:22.840]  said that an underage girl is her dad is a bigot if he doesn't want his underage
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:26.440]  girl to have a penis in her face in a locker room and they have a pedophile
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:31.680]  on the show and they're giving al-Qaeda filmmakers money like this is all happy
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:35.520]  and they funded the Arab Spring and cheerleaded when churches were being
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:39.360]  blown up Anderson Cooper when they were blowing the churches up and murdering
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:43.560]  everybody in Egypt five years ago they were cheerleading the murder of the
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:47.480]  government in Libya in the fall of it al-Qaeda taking over and cheerleading the
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:52.640]  invasion of Syria I mean these people really are truly evil that's the thing
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:56.560]  it's true sociopathy cheerleading all of the evil that has happened they're now
[1:44:56.560 --> 1:45:00.760]  inciting violence against Trump supporters domestically fake news is
[1:45:00.760 --> 1:45:04.520]  causing domestic terrorism I offered Brian Stelter a hundred thousand dollars
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.440]  for charity maybe you want to match it I said if he'll wear a MAGA hat and walk
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:15.480]  through New York with the GoPro for two hours and and live stream what happens
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:19.160]  I'll donate a hundred thousand dollars to charity because he claims being a
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:23.240]  journalist is so dangerous well I'll go where I see an in hat and I'll walk all
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:27.600]  around New York think nothing of it I'll go where I see an in hat so well will
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:31.400]  Brian Stelter for a hundred thousand dollars for charity put on a make America
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:36.880]  great again hat and walk around with the GoPro and live shows their supporters
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:41.920]  are crazed the losers whose identities invested in the fake media and who get
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:46.760]  violent when they see a Trump supporter I've experienced it for myself on a
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:50.680]  weekly basis where they come over and scream at you and call you Hitler and
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:54.880]  they're literally mentally ill they are the biggest idiots I want to go to these
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:59.480]  phone calls but I want to get into your kickstart thing as well we're gonna go
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:06.280]  to vicious Ryan Jeff Montoya Joe and others here in a moment 800 to 5 at 9
[1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:13.960]  9 2 3 1 and then I'm gonna get into wait for this folks New York Sun New York
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:21.080]  Times Bezos Slim and Buffett sounds like gangsters doesn't it publicly pleading
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:25.320]  poverty asked Congress for help with their newspapers the New York Sun
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:30.960]  reports news outlets to seek bargaining rights against Google and Facebook they
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:34.720]  want to be able to shut down basically alternative news and be able to force
[1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:39.000]  their stories into the top everywhere and I guess control it and they're
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.840]  asking for help Google and Facebook continue to gobble up the digital
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:45.680]  advertising market siphoning away revenue that once paid the quality
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:49.160]  journalism that Google and Facebook now offer for free they're gaining
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:52.280]  increasing control over digital distribution so newspapers that wants
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:55.320]  to liberate their journalism with their own trucks increasingly have to rely on
[1:46:55.320 --> 1:46:59.240]  these big online platforms to get their articles up in front of people fighting
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:04.320]  for attention alongside fake news I love another mainstream paper calling
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:08.400]  competition like us showing CNN telling you there were no riots we show you the
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:12.920]  riots in Hamburg they're calling us fake news websites that lift their content
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:17.280]  and cat videos and they want cat videos delisted in their all competition
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:21.880]  delisted to force feed their garbage and it says that they're going to Google
[1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:27.000]  and Facebook to help them support and force feed their advertising and their
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.440]  papers and make everyone click on their ads so they're threatening any trust
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:36.000]  against Google if they don't go along with them I mean this is just
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.720]  unbelievable Mike Cernovich well they can't they can't win in the free market
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:44.520]  that's what they're learning I mean if you think about it if you're a child
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:48.600]  rapist like Roman Polanski and you rape a 13-year-old girl after drugging her
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:52.840]  Meryl Streep will say you're a good man and clap for you and say it's terrible
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:56.120]  that you're being depraved and they'll fund your movies but the internet wall
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:00.480]  dollars yeah they want to fund the pedophiles movies but then and then they
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:03.240]  claim oh there's a free market in Hollywood no because there's a little
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:08.520]  elite group of financiers who are part of that cabal of pedophiles who support
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:13.160]  people like Roman Polanski I mean if you ever want to watch a Hollywood director
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:16.280]  run away from you I have them try to troll me on Twitter because they're
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:20.080]  jealous of my success and my celebrity even though I don't don't even care
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:24.400]  about that kind of stuff I just want to make America great I go hey why don't
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:30.200]  you do a documentary on the underage casting couch in Hollywood block they
[1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:35.400]  run that is like light to let me explain this this is why I said red pill
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:39.560]  being one of the top films is such a salmon story swimming upstream and makes
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:43.760]  them so upset they're trying to force feed feminism force feed Amy Schumer
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:48.120]  force feed it it's being rejected with one star everywhere they're in full
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:52.520]  panic mode it makes Gamergate look like nothing and then meanwhile though you go
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:55.160]  to the front page of Google you go to the front page of Facebook you go to the
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:58.360]  front page of YouTube you go to the front page of Twitter they're already
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:01.720]  force-feeding Hollywood and force-feeding mainstream news they've
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:06.000]  already delisted info wars off Google news the contract you got they admitted
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:11.120]  was real millions of dollars to delist info wars by Google hiring contractors
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:17.040]  so despite all the force-feeding Cernovich they're still panicking asking
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:21.160]  for us to totally be blocked from the marketplace of ideas don't they
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:26.800]  understand the Streisand effect yeah and we're also the blockchain is moving
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:30.720]  towards an unsensible internet so within a couple of years they won't even be
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:33.320]  able to ban us on the internet there'll be social media companies on the
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:37.160]  blockchain that's why the media doesn't want people to know about Bitcoin you
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:39.720]  know they call Bitcoin a scam and everything like there's so many things
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:46.520]  that are working against the hegemony of the Hollywood University media pedophile
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:52.520]  complex they can't take it a great a great poll came out today showing that
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:58.120]  people now especially Republicans view higher education as a complete and total
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:03.360]  scam nothing but an indoctrination factory so people are waking up and this
[1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:08.280]  is again the backlash that is why Bill Gates finally said oh this migration
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:13.360]  stuff wait wait wait because Bill Gates he might be an evil person but he's also
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:19.000]  calculating and he realized we went too far too fast and we should have we
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.560]  should have calmed down a little bit we shouldn't have completely tried to
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:25.320]  enslave people we shouldn't have the rapes and everything or what changed it
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:29.040]  all is and they failed Austria has put troops on the border Hungary and
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:32.560]  Romania got demonized first in Poland but now Western Europe's putting troops
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:36.640]  on the border because it is literally insane asylum Muslims running around

[1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:39.760]  we're going to your phone calls with Mike Cernovich here in just a moment he'll be
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:44.160]  with us a little bit of the next hour to take your calls but before I do that one
[1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:47.720]  of the crew members just made a really good point in fact when I saw this this
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:51.680]  morning I thought the exact same thing but then didn't ever come in and make
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.800]  that point that's why it's good to take your calls it's good for the crew to
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:00.400]  make points because we've all got a brainstorm every angle of this why is
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:06.800]  Bezos probably the richest man in the world owner of Amazon Carlos Slim the
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:11.080]  Mexican kingpin and Warren Buffett three of the top five richest men in the
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:17.680]  world calling for Google to front place their articles and force feed their
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:21.840]  stories that nobody is looking at a reading and arguing that Google's
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:25.320]  getting all the advertisement and so they're falling apart that is a threat
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:31.880]  their subsidiaries in Europe through the EU have Merkel and have Macron openly
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:36.080]  with these 50 million and hundred million dollar fines biggest fines in
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:43.400]  history basically intimidating Google Facebook and others into sharing the
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:49.880]  market with other globalists and censoring the free press so Google
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:53.280]  and Facebook are already being censored for not doing enough censoring in
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:57.000]  Europe it's already to crony and it's already horrible but they want it more
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.640]  intense than once they've done it in Europe they're well trained at doing it
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:06.240]  here and so basically other major billionaires like Bezos who owns the
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.080]  Washington Post and got 600 million dollars from the CIA to engage in
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:15.840]  propaganda from Obama before he left office they're weighing in now with
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:20.760]  their intimidation in a hostile takeover of Google and Facebook so there's no
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:26.280]  honor amongst thieves but that's where all of this is going Mike Sernovich yeah
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:30.680]  man there's so much going on I mean Chelsea Clinton who stole money from
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:35.160]  Haitian orphans for her wedding dress you know the media pretends like that
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:38.320]  never happened and she's on Twitter crying about Ivanka Trump and Donald
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:44.080]  Trump that the the DNC man they've learned nothing it is mind-blowing to me
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:48.280]  that they've learned nothing from their loss but it's fun watching them fail
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:53.560]  spectacularly it's fun watching for example Carlos Slim if we want to talk
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:58.360]  about foreign influence and the media why don't we talk about how one of the
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:03.040]  big owners of the New York Times he owns 18% of the company Carlos Slim he
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:08.920]  could send the 401ks and the pensions of every New York Times reporter into the
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:14.400]  garbage by selling his stock but they claim oh he has no influence on it they
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:18.560]  don't want to talk about it I watched a documentary this weekend propaganda which
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:22.880]  tried to make Peter Teal look bad called nobody speak but all it did was made
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:27.840]  Peter Teal look like a great guy right but in the movie they go oh isn't a
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:33.020]  terrible thing Sheldon Addison Allison bought the Las Vegas review and I go
[1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:39.080]  wait a minute if money by billionaires and media such a problem why is nobody
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:44.480]  talking about Carlos Slim a Mexican who owns the New York Times they want to
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:48.960]  pretend it doesn't happen they don't put disclosures in every article and say
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:53.800]  well our biggest shareholder Carlos Slim our owner is gonna make a ton of money
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:59.360]  if we have open borders because of the phone calls that go back and forth right
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:03.360]  because he's a telecom monopolist there's never any kind of disclosure like
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:10.240]  this 10 billion plus last time I checked of his money off U.S. taxpayers
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.640]  administering the stupid Obama phone pure profit unbelievable it's incredible
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:20.760]  we're gonna go to break come back and go to vicious Ryan Jeff Montoya Joe and

[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:35.600]  the Japanese that really happened who knows but it's okay to ask questions us
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:40.120]  having our own opinions is not a conspiracy theory it's simply speculating
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:44.320]  and having discernment or discrimination like you discriminate who makes a better
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:49.880]  hot dog who makes a better hamburger or who makes better clothes that's from the

[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:18.480]  toracal riddles riddles though the second one's a little bit more vicious you

[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:31.440]  common both of them have epileptic seizures correct you got that one right
[2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:36.160]  and what Hillary Clinton saw in her mind's eye in September 11th should
[2:01:36.160 --> 2:01:41.300]  definitely be public knowledge second one is here what does
[2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:53.820]  Lewis learner Obamacare Obama Franny and Freddie Mac having common that's a good
[2:01:53.820 --> 2:01:59.600]  question the certain of us can you get that one no this is a tricky one you
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:08.960]  ready yes they they all prosecute tea partyers I mean conservative that's
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:13.040]  right great points you know Cernovich talked about this jokingly halfway at
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:16.560]  dinner with myself and Paul Watson but it's almost true we knew from the secret
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:19.360]  service he was falling down roughly every 45 minutes they said watch your
[2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:23.080]  black ambulance a week before Millie Weaver and Gavin caught her for an
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:27.520]  hour but with medical folks running in and armored suits with stretchers I mean
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:31.960]  she was really bad then and then a week later on September 11 she collapsed it's
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:37.120]  like we willed her to manifest the truth in front of the cameras and then the
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:40.880]  media would edit it once she fell and said that we made it up but again that
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:44.700]  showed their arrogance that they believe they're in control Mike Cernovich you
[2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:48.560]  want to comment on that yeah so that that was actually a funny dinner that
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:52.400]  was where you know Alex and I had an intervention on you know Paula great and
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:58.040]  we go you are a sex icon you are the Beatles you are Bieber you are the it's
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:02.080]  better than paper but we weren't young yeah we were have you know the idea
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:06.160]  though is that he's a big icon he's a pop culture icon and he needs to own it
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:10.960]  but yeah I said that we we had in a way like will then to existence and then
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:14.720]  Alex goes wait wait wait wait that's not the Alistair Crowley stuff and I go no
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:19.760]  I'm not saying that Alex but unconsciously by talking about it all the time
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:24.840]  collectively that rattles her people and then her people attend to her more and
[2:03:24.840 --> 2:03:28.160]  then her people freak out more and then you four and then it makes her think
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:32.040]  about how she's having the other seizures and makes her nervous it makes
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:35.880]  them give her more drugs so she does it more and then it makes more people
[2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:39.760]  videotape her and stake her out to catch it that's all the secret service said
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:43.720]  as they said just follow her around we don't know what it is but the word is
[2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:47.480]  she's got a brain tumor right it's like if I tell you quit worrying about it quit
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:50.600]  worrying quit worrying quit worrying quit worrying quit you're gonna worry about
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:54.280]  a more you'd be like oh well I didn't think about that oh so that's all we did
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:58.680]  is Hillary sick Hillary has a stool we made her remove that resting stool she
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:02.960]  had right everything we did so her people now like oh my god don't have a
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:09.280]  seizure don't have a seizure don't ever see and then notice to the Democrats

[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:11.760]  who's great by the way drudge is amazing but the story in drudge and big
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:16.560]  stories all over the place they're swimming across and big bags of stuff
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:24.120]  strugs swimming across the river swimming right across we just caught these guys
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:27.520]  coming across the border they're jumping in they just jumped in the rafts
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:33.360]  they're coming up one two three four they have big satchels and actually the
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:37.760]  camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they're
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:42.000]  gonna be killed because they're showing this on camera the guys carrying bags of

[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:08.280]  liberty it's Alex Jones my son of a tried to shotgun with us we're about to
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:14.920]  go to Ryan Jeff Montoya Joe Mike and others but I covered this last hour but
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:17.320]  I want to bring this back up with Sarnovich and we should probably search
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:21.360]  engine this I forgot to tell you during the break search engine wiki leaks
[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:38.600]  Soros wants you in controlled web to censor opposition push his open society
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:44.080]  news that's basically the headline from last year but you read this you see
[2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:50.160]  this that's what they're calling for they've got the EU going after Google and
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:55.080]  Facebook with huge fines shing they didn't get rid of enough racism and then
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:59.600]  using antitrust against them when clearly they are somewhat of oligopolies
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:05.880]  because all the old money Bezos slim Buffett and others they're jealous of
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:10.360]  Google and Facebook there's an internal power struggle and now they've gone to
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:16.640]  Congress asking for Google to basically be broken up or they're asking for
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:20.800]  Google to force feed their news and they're advertising and share money
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:25.440]  with them people have a right to go to being they have a right to go to dog
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:27.800]  pile they have a right to go to hundreds of other search engines they go to
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:31.600]  Google because it's the biggest and it's got its problems and it does a lot of
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:38.480]  bad things gotta say though Google isn't as evil as Facebook or as Apple or as
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:42.600]  Bezos and Amazon I mean Amazon is funding anti-gun open borders
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:48.520]  anti-free speech garbage they are Bezos is the worst he won't even use his 87
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:56.400]  billion dollars he got 600 million in January of this year from the CIA to run
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:01.120]  a tax on the president and Trump hadn't gone after him because he knows the
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:06.120]  optics it was someone he's going after the press the Washington Post is not the
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:11.800]  press so here's the deal certain of its broke this month's ago they're already
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:15.720]  trying to shut us down they're already trying to delist info wars when you
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:19.000]  spread info wars links when you spread our videos when you spread our articles
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.800]  when you aggressively do it on Facebook Twitter in person on your email telling
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:28.680]  your co-workers your boss your wife your husband your neighbors your church this
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:33.720]  is a fight for the future and info wars is under the most attack they're trying
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:37.640]  to intimidate people so they won't support us so they won't link to us so
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:43.320]  they won't promote us when it's a badge of honor to be attacked by MSM it's a
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:48.320]  badge of honor info wars is so credible that's why they run all these stories
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:53.360]  lying about us and what we stand for going back to Mike Cernovich Mike I
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:55.840]  want you to stay with us if you can if you got to leave understand but I want
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:12:59.640]  to go to I want to go to phone calls but tell us about films films are an
[2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:03.520]  amazing way to get the truth out I've reached hundreds and hundreds of
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:06.880]  millions of people with my films you've been helping with Kickstarter programs
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:11.400]  take films from obscurity like red pill and help push them to the top how do
[2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:17.080]  folks get involved supporting the new film project hoaxed well we have some
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:21.480]  breaking news right now the globalist deep state hit piece on me is being
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:26.360]  officially launched three people wrote this article for foreign policy they're
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:31.240]  now calling me an internet harasser but within the article they admit here I'll
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:35.520]  quote now let's explain let's explain that foreign policy is the Washington
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:39.200]  Post version of foreign affairs it's where they put out the calls for coups
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:42.040]  against the president so they call for deep state control it's where they
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:45.480]  actually give orders to their own operatives just like in the old days
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:49.520]  Russian spies would put code words in newspapers this is admitted they're the
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:53.200]  folks that wrote the article three years ago when CIA was legalized to engage
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:57.280]  in deception domestically they put that out so that so that foreign service
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:01.360]  folks know they're now going to target America with their disinformation so
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:06.000]  this is actual rogue CIA targeting myself you and other cell folks about the
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.560]  article let's put it out yeah so this article I just sent to the great team
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:15.000]  is they attack me and they call me fake news but they said and I quote my
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:20.160]  reports include details that only someone on the inside could know for
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:25.000]  example my tweets about Sierra Mela were so specific that they documented
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.200]  meetings and lunch lunches the NSC staffer had with certain people that is
[2:14:30.200 --> 2:14:34.720]  how good my sources are and then because you're talking to people at the
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:38.720]  White House and they know I am too that's how good they are they're like I
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:44.840]  know where they're having lunch lunch I'm watching you people think you're

[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:57.000]  call the CIA a lot of American people you can pull it up three years ago and
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.960]  they celebrated that propaganda now legalized inside the US Trump's trolls
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:06.520]  are waging war on American civil servants alt-right bloggers are flinging out
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:10.080]  government employees singling out deemed hostile the president's agenda that's
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:14.760]  right we're pointing out all your moles that are actual Soros operatives on

[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:33.400]  everything you say is wrong now they're saying wait a minute Sernovich knows
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:38.720]  whether eating lunch maybe I have them bug maybe maybe I have things who knows
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:43.080]  what I know because all the people know is everything that I say comes true a
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:47.800]  long time like and I said this before and I play dirty too I know about the
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:51.040]  drug dealers and the sugar babies and everything and if these people come
[2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:54.960]  after me I have this with my lawyer and a trust account and if anything ever
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:58.920]  happens to me I've told them I said if you think I play dirty now if anything
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:03.760]  happens to me or my family I will release the motherload of all of you
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:08.880]  doing drugs cheating on your wives the heroin everything so how do you see all
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:13.440]  of them let's expand on that we didn't draw first blood we don't want to run
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:16.800]  these people over they're not giving us quarter so now we've got up off the
[2:17:16.800 --> 2:17:20.480]  bench we're beating the living snot out of them politically and so they're
[2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:26.440]  hoping for violence now and a civil war man if they really make us get up off
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:29.960]  the bench they're gonna really get their asses handed to them well yeah
[2:17:29.960 --> 2:17:33.280]  because I didn't even do politics two years ago I hated it I just want to do
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:37.800]  guerrilla mindset all day right I didn't want to do political stuff but that is
[2:17:37.800 --> 2:17:41.240]  how bad they've made it that they brought people like me into the full well I
[2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:44.240]  mean talk about it they tried to run you out and that's what it didn't mean and
[2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:48.240]  you know they try to destroy us it makes it stronger yeah exactly and that's what
[2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:52.160]  they have to learn is that they're attacking me my whole business is based
[2:17:52.160 --> 2:17:55.800]  on mindset and success and and remaining positive when people attack you and
[2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:59.720]  overcoming adversity and they think the little hit articles or their threats or
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:02.920]  everything are gonna gonna intimidate you know me that's what they think they're
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:07.240]  gonna do but what they're realizing now I know so much more than I've ever you
[2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:10.640]  and I have talked privately about what we really know you know is like a safe

[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:43.800]  demonization you know is them seeing if they can get the public to turn on us

[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:16.440]  your phone calls I just want to make a point here I don't claim to be the
[2:24:16.440 --> 2:24:19.560]  toughest meanest guy around but the best thing ever happened to me growing up in
[2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:24.000]  Dallas was was kind of like the end of the 50s type stuff it was in the 70s
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:28.720]  and 80s but it was like the end of that kind of culture was that my parents are
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:32.520]  really nice folks but they let people beat me up and I guess they thought it
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:35.240]  was more like old-fashioned they know it was like gang members four or five years
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:40.400]  older than me and it just was the best activation of my genetics and my genes to
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:43.840]  be aggressive and enjoy fighting that means politically whatever not make me a
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:48.720]  victim to to really get hurt bad I mean quite a lot I mean that concussions
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:53.240]  repeatedly where I was in the hospital broken bones you name it and and it just
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:58.800]  it just changed me completely you know the stressors of it and the modern
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:02.280]  people are so wimpy they don't even ride bikes outside they don't they don't
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:07.400]  wrestle they don't do sports and so many millennials and generation Z's have
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:11.720]  never experienced any of that so they just buy it all the propaganda but even
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:15.040]  as they become violent against Trump and us they're kind of finding their
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:19.440]  humanity again at kind of the base level of resistance and so as they try to
[2:25:19.440 --> 2:25:24.280]  kill us they may even find themselves and and and leave the domestication but
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:28.280]  the reason Cernovich and I get so excited about this is we're not hyping
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:32.640]  here we're defeating the globalists together that means you the world is
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:37.920]  waking up Trump's got like 65 percent approval ratings in the real polls they
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:42.160]  admit they're over sampling 15 points in Gallup and he's at 50 we're having
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:47.360]  devastating victory and it's super exciting it's super dangerous but when
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:50.720]  they come after you and your family when they try to destroy you when you're
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:55.080]  put to the ringer and then you have victory yeah the dopamine flows it's
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:58.680]  it's what it's all about and and believing in victory and not being a
[2:25:58.680 --> 2:26:03.000]  globalist that wants to make other people weak so you feel big it's the
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:08.240]  opposite of that and so it's it's the animating contest of liberty is what
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:12.520]  Jefferson talked about he said it made him high he couldn't stop it that's why
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:15.200]  he went was part of the French Revolution after ours but then he found out
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:20.560]  that was a bad version and came back so again don't thank us it's an honor it's
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:25.560]  like Cernovich says Mike this isn't work is it then we're going to Montoya and
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:30.080]  Jeff and Ryan and Joe I'm going everybody go ahead no I mean this is the
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:33.880]  greatest job in the world even with all the death threats and harassment and
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:38.080]  bomb threats and all the attacks we get that's how I know people that see it in
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.720]  like Brian Svelter know that they're they're vacant hollow because I'm
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:45.840]  getting attacked and I'm like I love it this proves that I'm telling the truth
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:50.680]  I want in the ring attack me what you want in the game yeah welcome to the
[2:26:50.680 --> 2:26:54.840]  jungle bitches welcome to the jungle family friendly I watched language but
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:58.960]  yeah welcome to the jungle this is the way it works people are fighting to you
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:02.880]  people at your throats it's a fight for Western civilization you got to deal
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:06.120]  with it so that's how I know they don't we're so blessed compared to our forebears
[2:27:06.120 --> 2:27:09.720]  that had to drag cannons 50 miles through the snow with no shoes with a
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:14.080]  trail of blood behind them from Tom Tykondoroga we have it easy compared to
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:17.440]  folks that had to fight before we just got to be able to stand up the zombies
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.520]  let's go I mean we even have it easy compared to like if you ever read the
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:26.120]  book sapiens the story humanity we have it easy these people cry about internet
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:29.920]  abuse trolling people being mean to them they ought to get a little bit
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:34.760]  humanity has been on a long grind for survival with a lot of struggle there's
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:39.840]  no need to activate till you're in a struggle exactly we're designed to handle
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:44.960]  acute stress we're designed to respond to attacks and get stronger the problem is
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:49.760]  that they don't have a conscience or a heart they're hollow inside they're like
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:54.360]  c.s. Lewis wrote a great book men without chess and it was the idea that the
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:57.680]  modern man you know it shows how far masculinity and how quick it was
[2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:01.280]  declining they don't have any robustness to them they won't stand up on any
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:05.000]  principle they don't believe anything Brian Stelter and those types of people
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:08.920]  that see it in they don't have chess they don't have integrity they don't have
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:12.400]  valor they're not excited by this they have nothing so they don't have a will
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:17.920]  with yeah but the meme with the meme they cave in over a meme you you get
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:22.280]  memed all the time we laugh about him I love it Alexa video we I remember you
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:26.640]  because because I do have an idiot side of me I am funny I am stupid I revel in

[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:17.760]  basically I wanted to just bring to recollection what it is that we did
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:22.400]  almost two years ago when we the people actually put such pressure on John
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:27.800]  Boehner to get him to resign and I remember back was widely recognized our
[2:29:27.800 --> 2:29:32.240]  success but Ryan was widely perceived as being a continuation of the same
[2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:36.200]  policies nothing's changed and so I'm coming right back to you you've been

[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:02.760]  going to bring up something really important i'm going to write a note
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:08.280]  to sternovich because he brought it up and the word is girls
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:10.360]  we're going to talk about that here in just a few minutes but first
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:14.280]  Montoya thanks for holding you bring up the main enemy we love to make fun of
[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:17.720]  Pelosi make fun of michael more all these jokes
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:21.480]  maxine waters i don't know which one's goofier and stupider and more evil
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:24.600]  hillary coming back to lead the democrats that's mana from heaven but the big
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:28.040]  enemy is the republican establishment the john mccain's the
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:31.240]  poll ryan's what do we do about him
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:35.080]  i think we can start by just going back and just looking at history learning
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:38.280]  from with our past mistakes and realizing what the best
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:43.480]  what it is that we did to actually um to make that happen and how we can
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:47.080]  um implement that on a much larger scale so that way
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:50.040]  we are really getting rid of the people that are causing the problems that we
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:54.200]  have we're facing right now and um i mean i've heard people talk about you
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:58.440]  know we watch the democrats too but then i really think it really is um
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:01.240]  genius to keep some of them in there because they're almost like strong men
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:04.920]  that they're in there you can easily be pushed so i mean i think it's a great
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:09.000]  thing to have some of those uh same old figurehead there but i mean really
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:12.600]  like i just think that really we need to just learn from
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:16.600]  history and um yeah how how is it that we can
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:19.960]  basically do that once again and that some of these republican
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:24.840]  ryanos out if the ryanos they gotta go man and we have to realize that most
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:28.120]  countries like north korea or russia's been through hell or venezuela
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:33.160]  venezuela was the second richest country in latin america 50 years ago on
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:36.840]  average it was as wealthy as the u.s argentina was more wealthy than us
[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:40.280]  it was the old saying was riches in argentine or in argentine
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:43.640]  and then socialism came and their literal hell holes
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:48.360]  literal hell holes i mean up until the 1960s and stuff argentina
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:52.600]  was the place to leave the us for that's why you go down there there's so many
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:56.440]  second third generation americans down there and now they're hellish
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:38:00.040]  beautiful countries great culture great resources they went socialist
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:03.000]  that matter of your white hispanic black asian
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:06.760]  arab you go under socialism you enter hell on earth
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:10.520]  two or three you know decades later it's a fact look at europe look what it
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:13.400]  creates and we've got to pull out of it we gotta
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:16.680]  realize how serious it is mike sernovich thank you montoya
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:20.520]  yeah he raises a good point too but i want to reemphasize something that you
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:24.520]  and i talk about a lot is that caller is the information
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:27.320]  more he's saying how do we get them out well
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:31.880]  he does by sharing the information by calling in by spreading the links by
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:34.520]  posting the messages by posting the videos
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:37.560]  at you know and we want everybody listening to be involved maybe you run
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:41.560]  for congress maybe run for mayor city council
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:45.400]  get these positions yeah let's say four people are running against the globalist
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:48.600]  candidate in your area for city council or whatever it is
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:53.080]  you run you get up there in the debates you don't maybe win first round but then
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:56.360]  the other candidate it's better than the other one you take some away from the
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:38:59.640]  really bad guy and then the good lady wins
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:03.960]  yeah and you get the message out so when when data robacher was going to be put
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:06.440]  up for secretary of state and then that didn't happen
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:10.200]  i was going to run for a seat so i'm going to run for congress in the right
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:14.840]  uh environment and whatever happens i'm going to get the message out i'm going
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:19.240]  to get the message out of debt slavery how we're 50 old baby boomers who are
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:22.440]  liberals are making 18 year old signed contracts
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:25.960]  called student loans that's really no different than debt peonage and
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:29.400]  they're taking away the hope of an entire generation of people
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:32.520]  one of the greatest travesties being perpetuated on the american people right
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:36.520]  now is the debt slavery that the baby boomer
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:40.600]  liberals who won't allow for re-speech on the college campuses are using on
[2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:44.280]  teenagers so there's all these issues we got to get going on
[2:39:44.280 --> 2:39:47.720]  that's why people got to get involved you got to hit hard
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:51.320]  make the other people respond to us
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:54.680]  i agree i've got those key points to ask you in a moment
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:39:58.040]  where is donald trump going wrong and then the word girls those are two key
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:01.400]  points coming up in a moment but let's go to these calls first
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:05.240]  let's go to joe in california then ryan uh jeff and mike
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:11.880]  uh joe in california thanks for holding hi alex hi mike um i was reading a
[2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:15.480]  newspaper recently it had a whole article on the um
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:19.720]  amily airheart situation with the photo and all that and it stated that the
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:22.920]  photo source was an intelligence community asset
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:26.840]  that's you know 80 years ago and my whole spot on this was even the
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:31.160]  situation with north korea japan south korea um if they
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:34.680]  why didn't they you know release this over that 80 year period it probably
[2:40:34.680 --> 2:40:38.760]  would have caused some kind of a diplomatic issue with japan right so
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:41.960]  is it possible that maybe they release this now
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:45.080]  to create a hiccup for donald trump when he's dealing with
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:48.280]  you know japan yeah that's a great point i mean
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:51.800]  obama sealed the jfk files when he was supposed to release those the second
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:54.840]  year in office he made him secret other 20 years
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:58.760]  uh they set on all this stuff why did they release operation northwoods
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:02.520]  a year before 9 11 abc news u.s government planned to bomb its own
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:06.600]  cities conduct mass shootings to blame russia as a pretext for war with cuba
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:10.760]  why now are they releasing what looks like amilia airheart picked up by the
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.920]  japanese or whatever uh why are they why are they releasing this from an
[2:41:14.920 --> 2:41:18.360]  intelligence asset now or was it just somebody dug through all the
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:21.720]  files that after 75 80 years have been released great
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:26.360]  question joe sarnovich yeah i i don't know that i don't
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:30.040]  i don't trust that story there's something weird going on there actually
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:33.000]  so that's one of those stories when it comes out
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:37.560]  that i'm reserving judgment on because it's really weird really suspicious it
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:40.600]  just doesn't feel right to me something feels off about that
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:44.040]  and i'm not really sure why especially the daily basis involved
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:49.400]  yeah exactly so i i'm very whenever i hear daily beast in salon even when they
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.480]  write stuff that i think is true so new york mag for example wrote a big
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:56.520]  profile on steve bannon which was remarkable it makes
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:41:59.880]  bannon look like a great person that he is but
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:03.320]  i'm like it's a new york mag though is is new york magazine
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:07.160]  it can anything be trusted in these publications i i just don't even know
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:09.480]  anymore
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:14.360]  yeah attack attack attack so this is a really fantastic article i'd
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:17.960]  write about bannon but they only do it they only do it to make trump
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:20.680]  they think it makes trump jealousy gets too much attention
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:24.600]  exactly so i know it's a scion i know right away they want to make it look
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:27.480]  like oh we'll make steve bannon get attention again
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:31.080]  and then maybe that'll mess with they're writing that as an elite publication
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:34.520]  one of the five or six that officially writes talking points that then be
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:38.360]  vomited back and forth by all the media to make bannon another distraction
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:42.840]  because he's in there helping trump carry out his america first vision
[2:42:42.840 --> 2:42:47.000]  yeah exactly right but unless they see something on info wars or on twitter or
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.320]  something you're like well it was in the
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:42:53.400]  new york times of the washington post you know history channel maybe
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:57.400]  maybe i but i need more evidence than what they're offering i need some real
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:43:01.240]  because i mean i mean i mean it's absolutely i mean
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:04.760]  you know if you've delivered if delicious four square meals came out of the
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:07.560]  ends of you know possums behind we still would need it
[2:43:07.560 --> 2:43:10.920]  just out of a possums behind i mean it doesn't matter if they say there's a
[2:43:10.920 --> 2:43:13.560]  blue sky we don't believe it because new york
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:17.080]  magazine and and and the new yorker and all those publications are known
[2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:21.080]  enemies of the country uh joe anything else
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:25.000]  uh that should be here i just think it might be deep state you know
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:28.520]  i bless you i appreciate the call all right let's go ahead and go to jeff in
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:32.280]  utah and ryan and mike jeff you're on the air
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:35.880]  hello mr jones thank you for taking my call thank you um
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:39.480]  i want i want to take talk to you about something random if that's okay just uh
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:43.560]  want to thank you for the brain force i've been doing it lately it's been great
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:46.920]  it's a really great product well thank you we went out and basically looked at
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:50.760]  stuff that's 50 60 dollars a bottle that didn't even have as good an
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:54.040]  ingredients that weren't organic some of which are drugs in europe that are
[2:43:54.040 --> 2:43:56.920]  known to be healthy and good for your brain building blocks and we simply
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:44:00.200]  put it out as a new tropic uh at about half the price of leading
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:04.360]  competitors that's why it's super successful and dominant right now but
[2:44:04.360 --> 2:44:08.120]  thank you so much what happened when you took brain force
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:11.240]  that but i also i also want to tell you that i found an alternate
[2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:15.000]  use for it you know one one night i took it right before going to bed
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:19.080]  and i had one of the most vivid dreams i've ever had like in 20 years
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:22.120]  and it started getting me to think about dreams and why we dream
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:26.440]  and the rem cycle and everything and i'm starting to think that it
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:31.480]  our rem cycle um has been diminished because we don't get enough of those
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:34.920]  nutrients that are in brain force so this is kind of a weird complex
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:37.720]  i was about to say i'm not the scientist that put it together it's got a
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:41.560]  bunch of things that are building blocks in the brain
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:45.240]  just base building blocks so it's not like an artificial system that makes
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:48.200]  your brain do things artificially it just gives your brain the basic
[2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:52.360]  building blocks it needs but what i'm saying is if you take it during the day
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:54.920]  this is a different that's different than taking it at night right before you go
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:58.840]  to bed you'll have more dreams and i give it give it to people with
[2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:02.360]  really bad anxiety like me and my my siblings
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:06.360]  anxiety runs in our family and it's amazing our anxiety has gone down i'm
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:09.960]  not saying it's like a you know a panacea but
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:13.880]  i don't know if it's you know i think it's like when you're sleeping you dream
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:16.840]  because your brain is doing some kind of custodial work with getting rid of
[2:45:16.840 --> 2:45:20.440]  neural connections that are not not necessary
[2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:24.280]  that's just a my own theory but i'm not a psychologist the psychologists don't
[2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:27.800]  know why we dream they don't know why we have anxiety why the rates of
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:30.760]  anxiety are going up i think the globalists have taken out
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:34.360]  alpha gpc from the meat and other things um
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:37.480]  to so that we don't dream as well they actually know what it is you know the
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:42.200]  brain figures things out models things uh replenishes nutrients chemical
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:46.120]  sugars it's needed and then works through fears and and
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:49.960]  problems it has uh and basically comes to grip with it
[2:45:49.960 --> 2:45:53.240]  and so a lot of people that have traumatic brain disorders and things they
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:56.280]  don't dream and of course that's associated with
[2:45:56.280 --> 2:46:01.560]  early onset of neurological disorders and so dreaming is the proof that you're
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:04.440]  going into the deep REM sleep you need and absolutely
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:07.400]  we don't exercise enough we don't eat enough raw materials
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:10.840]  and we also don't go through enough challenges every day that are actually
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:14.280]  real so our brain doesn't like the simulated world
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:19.480]  simulations television internet all of it hurts the brain in every study it's
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:22.600]  universal but physical things and real things are
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:27.320]  reading or listening expands the brain great points thank you for your
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:30.280]  testimony about brain force it does a lot of amazing
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:33.720]  thanks for people thank you so much jeff for your support and for holding
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:37.000]  we're going to send you a free t-shirt of your choice or if you like a bottle of
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:39.640]  brain force just uh tell the folks and we'll do that
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:43.640]  what do you think of what he just said you know an important point two is
[2:46:43.640 --> 2:46:47.000]  the supplements you sell actually improve lives
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:51.960]  and the drugs that cnn and other multi-billion dollar meaty conglomerates
[2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:56.920]  sell like statins actually harm people but they attack you
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:02.120]  for helping people help themselves that just shows you how desperate fake news
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:05.560]  is think about that for a minute they've had a wash them post three times the
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:09.320]  last year write articles where i sell snake oil
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:16.040]  and i mean knockout is l-tryptophan it is valerian root
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:19.320]  it is a dose of melatonin a moderate dose
[2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:23.720]  and a bunch of other things that are documented to cause chemical reactions in
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:25.800]  the brain associated with deeper and better sleep
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:31.320]  and they even wrote articles in saying coffee that i sell as a fraud that i'm
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:34.040]  selling good coffee and that coffee doesn't affect your brain and i'm a
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:38.520]  quack so shampoo that's organic uh non fluoride
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:42.200]  toothpaste it's all kooky yeah and laying out on the beach at cancun's
[2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:44.920]  horrible too and you know and you know being married to
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:47.880]  maryl Monroe and her prime would be horrible i'm sure i mean it's it's just
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:52.280]  like wow i sell coffee wow and the wash and
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:55.960]  post owned by the guy that owns Whole Foods
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:47:59.560]  is that promotes prozac and statins and all this crap
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:03.880]  i'm bad when they're owned by the biggest supplement guy in the world
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:07.560]  supplements are five are 50 billion a year or whatever in the u.s
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:11.960]  because they work because they work go ahead sorry
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:14.520]  yeah i mean that's the thing i take a couple hundred dollars a month in
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:16.840]  supplements and i have for years and that's why
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:19.880]  when people look me in the eyes like wow you have such clear
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:23.560]  you know you look clear all the time you focus in everything and people accuse
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:26.920]  me of drugs i have a very regimented supplement regime

[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:55.160]  my son and i care about him but i genetically worry about daughters more
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:58.600]  you want to protect just genetic and when i look at my daughter's particular and i
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:01.720]  think about the new world order that's what drives me and quite frankly that's
[2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:04.920]  when i have just the most outrageous aggressive
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:08.840]  thoughts and feelings of not invincibility but just savage
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:12.200]  power when i think about if somebody messes with my daughters and that's
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:15.080]  so much of i'm even tired of like midnight having to work i just think
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:18.920]  about my daughter's faces and just have an ending energy
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.280]  yeah the other day i was actually putting my daughter
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:27.000]  seven month old siren to the crib and i had this vision in my head
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:30.520]  of all the parents and i got to be careful i was almost crying
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  i thought about all the parents in syria whose children's were murdered
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:38.360]  because of the hillary clinton form paul exactly and how they want to murder i
[2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:41.560]  just thought all i want to do is my daughter to have a good life
[2:50:41.560 --> 2:50:45.000]  that's all these people in syria want is to have their children and then you had
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.560]  a feeling of total commitment against the enemy didn't you
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:51.480]  yeah and then i realized like i just had this vision of parents crying and
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:54.680]  and weeping and and holding the dead children and i thought this is what the
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:58.440]  deep state wants this is what they're up against we'll be right back we'll be

[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:28.120]  not a government document he violated federal law not giving those to the
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:32.440]  attorney general period but now it's admitted they were
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:35.400]  classified comey's private memos on trump conversations
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:40.920]  contain classified material the hill so congress is now saying that he is in
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:44.120]  deep doo doo i want to get your take on that before we talk to ryan
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.480]  and mike but but but getting back to women
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:51.880]  realizing that islam oppresses women and that they're now branding it as the new
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:55.800]  feminism and that globalist hate innocence hate women hate children
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:55:59.560]  they're targeting our strength and they're claiming the west is against
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:03.240]  women when it's been the west that put women on a pedestal
[2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:06.680]  mike sternovich yeah they're they're death eaters
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:10.280]  and they do want to harm children that's why they want to murder more
[2:56:10.280 --> 2:56:14.440]  chill how many how many children in iraq have cancer now something like 500 000
[2:56:14.440 --> 2:56:17.720]  i can't remember there's something like 15 percent of the babies are totally
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:21.480]  deformed yeah from all the um lithium and all
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:25.400]  the batteries and and all of the um toxins from the bombs and the cluster
[2:56:25.400 --> 2:56:28.440]  bombs that are dropped all these are many children are being slaughtered the
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:32.120]  saudi's are murdering christian children the the clinton foundation
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:36.600]  they're going into haiti chelsea clinton stealing money from Haitian orphans
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:40.920]  yeah they're purely they're purely diabolical and that is why
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:44.280]  when the fake news media goes after us i'm so happy
[2:56:44.280 --> 2:56:48.120]  because their fathers now who've lost their children and mothers who have lost
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:52.200]  their children because of madeline albright she said it was worth it
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:56.280]  remember this 500 000 kids is a good price to pay that's worth it
[2:56:56.280 --> 2:56:59.880]  that she said it their own words and then madeline albright yeah
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:03.320]  she said it oh it's worth it who cares briefly because i want to go to calls here
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:07.960]  what do you make of comey and of course it was classified but now it's admitted
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:11.080]  to be classified he perjured himself and it was illegal
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:15.240]  we have to take the gloves off here uh muller all these little clinton rats
[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:19.960]  they have to be dealt with well if if i were trump what i would do and i have
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:23.720]  this whole plan laid out if they want to i call it the mother of all
[2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:28.120]  media stories drive the media crazy here's what i would do if i'm trump
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:32.840]  fire muller he has the power to fire him independent counselors are disaster
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:36.120]  ask ted olson anybody during the reagan administration
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:39.720]  their disaster bill clinton despite being a scumbag
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:42.680]  what he was impeached for had nothing to do with what the investigation was
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:44.760]  about okay i think trump should open investigation
[2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:47.880]  of clinton and the missile secrets and reactors in north korea
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:51.320]  and just started diamonds on all of them just triple down early on
[2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:55.560]  in part so fire muller pardon julian assange
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:57:59.160]  and then just freak the media out just go all in oh have you heard folks are
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:02.680]  saying make julian assange the head guy on this new cyber command

[2:58:05.160 --> 2:58:09.640]  and offer him political refugee status so i would i would pardon

[2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:01.560]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and
[2:59:01.560 --> 2:59:05.240]  how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[2:59:05.240 --> 2:59:09.000]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:12.680]  they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in
[2:59:12.680 --> 2:59:16.440]  and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today
[2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:19.720]  i was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family

[2:59:24.920 --> 2:59:29.560]  between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the
[2:59:29.560 --> 2:59:33.800]  biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these studies up for
[2:59:33.800 --> 2:59:36.120]  yourself this is the real deal folks and the
[2:59:36.120 --> 2:59:40.760]  truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen

[3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:09.000]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:14.360]  they end up on top the truth is humanity is coming down fast
[3:00:14.360 --> 3:00:20.200]  but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[3:00:20.200 --> 3:00:25.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:25.480 --> 3:00:29.320]  mike sernovich is our guest david knights coming up i got to a lot of the news but
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:33.320]  man i didn't get to the media saying men are
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:35.800]  having babies and it's a woman that says he's a man
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:38.760]  and there's people saying they're dogs people blinding themselves government's
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:41.640]  paying for it uh it's because you you you you
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:44.920]  identify as a blind person so you burn your eyes out with drano
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:00:48.920]  and it's just you know i don't care if you want to chop your weenie off just
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:52.360]  i'm not paying for it and i'm not going to pay for you you know to go live in
[3:00:52.360 --> 3:00:55.960]  a mental institution either uh mike in colorado coming up but
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:00:59.160]  ryan in california thank you for holding you're a trooper you're on the
[3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:02.440]  air with mike sernovich who's got a kickstarter program for the new film
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:07.320]  hoax that he i want i had him on the plug it he's not plugging uh go ahead ryan
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:11.320]  all right alex thanks for having me on um and uh thanks for being my daily dose
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:14.200]  of sanity out here in uh los angeles uh
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:17.640]  the wheels have largely uh fallen off this place i feel like
[3:01:17.640 --> 3:01:24.520]  and it's um a lot to do with uh the trans community the gender queer community
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:28.600]  um and you know this is how these new world order people operate you know
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:31.640]  they come in with the solution even though they are the
[3:01:31.640 --> 3:01:35.640]  cause of the of the confusion so anyways i've studied this
[3:01:35.640 --> 3:01:39.400]  into the ground and one thing i've noticed is that
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:43.000]  when you go to one of these liberal colleges and you take a women's and
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:47.400]  gender studies class 101 one of the first things they teach you
[3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:53.000]  is that there is a difference between gender identity and sexual identity and
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:56.840]  that's something that even we can agree with you know just because you're a
[3:01:56.840 --> 3:02:01.240]  male does not mean you're a man just because you have
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:05.080]  female genitals that does not mean you're a woman not every little male child
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:08.760]  wants to swing a bat not every little female child wants to wear a dress
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:12.840]  whatever but here's the thing what i've noticed is is that once
[3:02:12.840 --> 3:02:17.400]  these uh once these people learn that there's freedom
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:21.560]  to be any kind of male they want to be any kind of female they want to be
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:25.480]  then they go all the way over to the other side here it allows folks to dodge
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:29.160]  responsibility and they get confused youth with confused chemicals but let's
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:32.520]  expand transhumanism came out of eugenics with julian
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:36.040]  huxley all this huxley's brother and they said we've got to make it sound
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:40.120]  trendy we'll call it trans and they funded some front groups and claimed
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:43.480]  that one man who was a woman came up with it that was all their front group
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:47.560]  and the media funded it for the whole transhumanism because if a man can be a
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:49.880]  woman advice first so well you can merge with machines
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:54.600]  they're just getting us ready for ending humanity that's their real plan
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:59.240]  yeah yeah i agree and and you know once they go over to the other side of what
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:03.000]  you know there is a lot of support to say that gender is
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:06.840]  a psychological construct fine you can be any kind of a male you want you can be
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:10.120]  a well the psychology and roles associated with it but from genetic history
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:13.240]  but but but i mean here's the issue i don't hate anybody whether they want to
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:17.160]  be a man or a woman the point is is that the issue is it's being force fed
[3:03:17.160 --> 3:03:21.880]  they're confusing kids and it's meant to reduce population and end families
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:25.800]  appreciate your call ryan interesting points mike sarnovich
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:28.760]  yeah you are that i mean you are the daily dose of sanity and this is what

[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:36.680]  though the real news viewpoint again foreign policy
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:39.720]  is now admitting even though it's a globalist magazine

[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:24.760]  all right welcome back to the fourth hour the alex joneshow in this monday
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:29.800]  july 10th 2017 i'm david knight your host we have got a lot of breaking news
[3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:33.640]  we're going to talk about comey's private parts yes they've been exposed
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:37.400]  i want to talk about what the mainstream media is not going to talk about
[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:41.080]  and we're also going to talk about this dirty dossier that they're trying to
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:45.640]  set up on donald trump it's the same people who created the dirty dossier
[3:08:45.640 --> 3:08:49.880]  for donald trump senior that are also involved in this
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:52.440]  meaning so we're going to talk about it we're going to tell you what the
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:55.320]  mainstream media is telling you we're going to tell you what the mainstream
[3:08:55.320 --> 3:08:58.680]  media is not telling you also an interesting story that's on the
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:03.240]  drudge report absolutely amazing folks you need to think about this
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:07.160]  cancer is now more common than having children
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:11.320]  and it's more common than getting married about that
[3:09:11.320 --> 3:09:15.080]  and we're also going to talk about how obama care is metastasizing
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:18.680]  because we've got uh they're not even talking
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:23.080]  about stopping cancer as alex has talked about for the longest time they just
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:26.600]  talk about treating it but now they don't really even talk about that it's like
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:29.640]  well let's make sure that you've all got insurance
[3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:33.000]  so that everybody can get paid for treating you but we're not going to talk
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:37.400]  about the quality of health care we're not going to talk about the affordability
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:40.760]  of health care because if you subsidize it it is simply
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:44.120]  going to continue to get more and more expensive just like college tuition
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:46.520]  and then they're going to make the case just like they're doing for college
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:49.320]  tuition now oh the government needs to pay it all it needs to be free to
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:51.960]  everybody that's what elizabeth warren is sitting on the
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:56.440]  sidelines licking her lips about she can't wait for the government to take
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:09:59.000]  over all of your health care so we're going to give you an update on charlie
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:02.840]  guard as well because that's a very important story
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:06.600]  that has to do with not just parental rights
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:10.280]  and not just the right to life of an 11 month old baby
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:14.520]  but folks it has to do with your right your right to life
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:17.560]  your right to make the decisions about your own life and so we're going to talk
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:21.560]  about this a little bit on friday with an update there's been
[3:10:21.560 --> 3:10:25.000]  yet another update about the charlie guard situation we now got
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:29.560]  some lawmakers in the u.s saying let's give the family
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:33.160]  of charlie guard the parents and charlie let's give them u.s citizenship so they
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:36.920]  can get health care i should tell you something shouldn't it and yet on this
[3:10:36.920 --> 3:10:41.960]  side before you get too proud of the freedoms that you have as an american
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:45.160]  understand that the hospital who wants to provide free health care to this kid
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:49.720]  says well we got to get the authorization of the fda we got to get
[3:10:49.720 --> 3:10:54.040]  their permission to give experimental treatment to a terminal
[3:10:54.040 --> 3:10:58.200]  patient and this is something we've been dealing with regardless of the age of
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:01.000]  the patient for a very long time so something to talk about there as well
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:04.360]  another topic we're going to get into before i go to our caller who's been
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:07.320]  hanging on for a while mic and colorado i'm gonna go to you in just a moment
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:13.800]  colorado voters are deregistering in the wake of the fact that the colorado
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:16.840]  state government says we're going to turn over this information this public
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:20.280]  information about voter registration we're going to turn it over to the
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:24.040]  trump election integrity commission that's going to
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:26.840]  look at fraud and so a lot of people say well i don't want them to see my name
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:31.560]  oh get my name off of there what are they worried about so we're
[3:11:31.560 --> 3:11:34.280]  going to get to all those stories but we've had a caller who's been hanging on
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:38.760]  for a very long time mic and colorado go ahead thank you for holding
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:42.840]  hey david i have some information here and and the information is this you guys
[3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:45.960]  are not afraid to speak out about islam you know
[3:11:45.960 --> 3:11:49.560]  mainstream christian television has censored this for over six years dr
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:53.160]  chuck missoner mark of the beast while he show you about mark of the beast
[3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:57.400]  in the king james it says 666 but this is an absolute mistranslation from the
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:01.720]  codex or manna 350 ad they were reading it from left to
[3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:05.240]  right as you do greek english they should have been reading this these three
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:08.600]  symbols at the possible john wrote down from right to left as mr shoy about
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:12.680]  says in his research he reads arabic the first two symbols are arabic and what
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:17.800]  they say are benzin allah the third symbol is the cross sorts of islam god
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:21.160]  did not forget to tell us about islam in the end times but the mainstream
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:24.360]  christianity has censored this for over six years
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:27.960]  interesting yeah there certainly has been people you know when donald trump
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:30.440]  went to poland and he talked to the people who were there
[3:12:30.440 --> 3:12:33.880]  they talked to the struggles that poland has had and he's kind of focused a lot
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:36.360]  on the 20th century and the fact that they
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:40.360]  had been trampled by both the nazis and the communists but they have been
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:43.560]  fighting this kind of oppression and of course people in eastern europe
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:47.080]  understand what happened throughout eastern europe is not just in poland
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:50.920]  but it was also in austria when i traveled to austria the cities that
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:54.520]  were there that defended themselves against the onslaught of islam coming
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:12:58.600]  from the arabic countries into there that the stand
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:13:01.960]  that they made against that uh... they don't
[3:13:01.960 --> 3:13:05.400]  uh... they don't want to see that happen again and there is still a memory
[3:13:05.400 --> 3:13:09.960]  in those cultures of what happened even though it was centuries ago because it
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:13.160]  was so incredibly oppressive and people need to understand
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:17.960]  that islam is not simply a religion it is a government
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:22.520]  and they see the fulfillment of their religion in worldwide government and so
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:26.040]  worldwide caliphate that's what they see as a fulfillment of their religion
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:30.120]  isn't it but mike yes yes and you know when everyone
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:33.480]  looks from a western mindset mr shoribot will change that
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:37.160]  and when people today say look i saw a beast who received a head wound and the
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:39.400]  world was amazed when the beast came back to life
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:43.080]  that's not the person or the individual of the antichrist that was the muslim
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:48.040]  caliphate the ottoman turkish empire and god is telling us about this in time
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:51.960]  religion as michael savage said you know language border customs that's what
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:56.440]  they do and they change times and season it's not longer ad
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:14:00.200]  but it's after a h after the age of muhammad
[3:14:00.200 --> 3:14:03.960]  so it all points to islam and you know mr uh... mister night look i'd love to
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:08.200]  send this material to you so that you can review it and then you make your
[3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:12.200]  opinion on what islam in the end time in scriptures say
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:15.640]  well you know i can see what is happening i'm not a
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:19.320]  a zombie like the people who are marching in hamburg i mean it's quite
[3:14:19.320 --> 3:14:22.840]  clear to people who are awake and want to see this but
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:27.800]  a big part of the of putting people to sleep and anesthetizing them to what's
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:32.280]  going on in the surrounding is the indoctrination and the propagandizing
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:36.680]  that goes on in their educational institutions to make them so
[3:14:36.680 --> 3:14:40.040]  self-loathing so full of self-hatred for themselves
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:44.920]  that they will not take a look at the obvious violence that is being perpetrated
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:48.520]  on them by the people who are coming in to the countries of the open borders they
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:52.920]  want to embrace this they're so ashamed of who they are because of the way they
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:56.440]  have been indoctrinated since they were children i think that's the key thing
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:14:59.240]  i think that's really where the education needs to begin
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:03.320]  we as parents if we don't have the ability to educate our children
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:06.200]  100 at home as homeschool we need to make sure that
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:09.400]  we educate our children as to what they're being taught
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:12.920]  and to counter what they're being taught because they're not being given the
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:15.720]  tools of learning what they're being given
[3:15:15.720 --> 3:15:20.200]  are a set of propagandized ideas and that's what we need to understand what's
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:23.800]  being taught to our children and then we need to tell our children what the
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:27.400]  truth is i think that's really where this comes from this kind of
[3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:31.160]  Stockholm syndrome where they not only accept the oppressors
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:34.280]  but they also hate themselves and that's what they're being taught
[3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:37.240]  in schools we see that everywhere we saw that in the reaction to
[3:15:37.240 --> 3:15:40.920]  what trump was saying in poland now we see the mainstream media coming out and
[3:15:40.920 --> 3:15:44.760]  saying he was preaching white supremacy and hatred of other people i was like
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:48.200]  no he wasn't he was saying you have to have the will to survive you have a
[3:15:48.200 --> 3:15:51.160]  right to survive the polish people had the will
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:54.600]  even though they were occupied and oppressed and conquered over and over
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:57.800]  again they had the will to survive as a people
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:01.800]  self-determination that's everybody's right and so i think that's a key part of
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:04.360]  it thank you mike uh yeah go ahead and send that to me i'll
[3:16:04.360 --> 3:16:07.720]  take a look at that information appreciate that okay great i'll send it
[3:16:07.720 --> 3:16:11.960]  in two weeks bye bye thank you bye bye all right so let's take a look at
[3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:15.720]  james comey's private parts metaphorically speaking here
[3:16:15.720 --> 3:16:20.520]  comey back in june said my trump memos were unclassified they were not a
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:23.800]  government document and yet we had on sunday night
[3:16:23.800 --> 3:16:28.360]  the news breaking on the hill saying that more than half of the notes taken
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:31.800]  by comey after his meetings with president trump contained classified
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:35.000]  information and they point out in this grab you a new story
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:38.120]  that twice he denied that he had any classified
[3:16:38.120 --> 3:16:41.640]  material he said this when he was testifying to the senate intelligence
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:44.520]  committee he told this to senator roi blunt he also told it
[3:16:44.520 --> 3:16:49.400]  to mark warner he's blunt said so were all your memos that you recorded
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:53.880]  unclassified or other document memos that might be yours as a private citizen
[3:16:53.880 --> 3:16:56.280]  he said i'm sorry i'm not following your question he goes well
[3:16:56.280 --> 3:17:00.520]  i think you said you use classified he said no no not classified documents
[3:17:00.520 --> 3:17:04.680]  unclassified i don't have them anymore i gave them to special counsel but yeah
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:07.960]  my view was the content of those unclassified the memorialization of
[3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:12.760]  those conversations was my recollection recorded now i said at the time
[3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:17.480]  because i was covering this live this testimony live and i said it at the time
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:21.480]  i said he has done the same thing that hillary clinton did
[3:17:21.480 --> 3:17:26.200]  and he's going to try to get off uh with this in terms of saying that uh
[3:17:26.200 --> 3:17:29.000]  nothing's to be done about this because i didn't have any
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:34.120]  uh bad intentions or because i didn't expose anybody criminally but that's
[3:17:34.120 --> 3:17:39.720]  not the standard there are laws and ethics and in the hill the article they
[3:17:39.720 --> 3:17:43.320]  made it very clear what the standard was when they said that more than half of
[3:17:43.320 --> 3:17:46.520]  the memos that he had made about these meetings
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:50.360]  had classified information in it he insisted says the hill that his
[3:17:50.360 --> 3:17:54.440]  testimony he believed the personal memos were unclassified though he hinted
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:17:58.040]  one or two documents that he created might have contained classified
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:01.400]  information he says my view was that the content of those unclassified
[3:18:01.400 --> 3:18:04.760]  memorialization was a was my recollection recorded
[3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:09.080]  that's what i just read to you okay but with when the seven memos that he
[3:18:09.080 --> 3:18:12.520]  wrote regarding his nine conversations with trump
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:15.720]  about russia earlier this year were shown to congress in recent days
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:23.640]  the fbi the fbi claimed that all all were in fact deemed to be
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:27.160]  government documents for the memos had markings
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:31.720]  making clear that they contained information classified at the secret or confidential
[3:18:31.720 --> 3:18:34.600]  level so let me explain this because i want to
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:37.880]  read to you what the washington post is saying about this how they're trying to
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:41.640]  spend this so the fbi is saying that all of these
[3:18:41.640 --> 3:18:45.640]  documents were government documents and he was keeping them on his private
[3:18:45.640 --> 3:18:51.640]  computer and at the time we had a former fbi agents
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:55.480]  and government officials saying look if he wanted to memorialize this and make
[3:18:55.480 --> 3:18:58.760]  sure that he had a record that it was really done contemporaneously rather
[3:18:58.760 --> 3:19:02.120]  than something that he added after the fact when he was
[3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:05.720]  fired and wanted to get even with trump as a disgruntled employee
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:09.560]  there were ways to do that people who work in the system say we have
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:14.040]  work computers that's where government documents are supposed to reside
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:17.880]  not on your private computer and if he had done it that way
[3:19:17.880 --> 3:19:22.440]  if he had done it according to the agreement that he signs when he joins
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:25.960]  the fbi then he not only would have recorded prove
[3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:30.200]  that he had done this at the time but then he would not have violated the law
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:35.960]  which he now has but even beyond that four of the memos had markings making it

[3:24:12.600 --> 3:24:15.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show before we went to break i was just
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:20.760]  telling you that the FBI has said that all of Comey's memos he took seven
[3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:23.640]  memos of his nine conversations with President Trump
[3:24:23.640 --> 3:24:27.080]  the FBI says all of these were government documents furthermore for the
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:31.000]  memos had markings making it clear that they contained classified
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:34.920]  information to the level of confidential and secret
[3:24:34.920 --> 3:24:38.680]  now here's what the Hill said when they released this information
[3:24:38.680 --> 3:24:42.440]  yesterday and understand the Hill is not a conservative
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:46.680]  news organization if anything i think they lean a little bit anti-trump but
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:50.040]  they have different people who write at their organization but they put out
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:54.280]  some information here i want to show you how the Washington Post
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:24:57.560]  spends this report that came from the Hill
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:01.960]  let me give you the report from the Hill first they said that FBI policy forbids
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:05.720]  any agent from releasing classified information it mandates that all records
[3:25:05.720 --> 3:25:09.560]  created during official duties are considered to be government property
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:13.080]  you understand that that's official policy that's why
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:16.760]  all of these memos are government documents because they were created
[3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:20.840]  during the official duty of FBI Director Comey when he talked to the
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:23.400]  president and furthermore it's part of an agreement
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:27.960]  that our FBI agent signed that says this quote all information acquired by me
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:31.400]  in connection with my official duties with the FBI
[3:25:31.400 --> 3:25:35.080]  and all official material to which i have access remain the property of the
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:39.720]  united states of america an agent will not reveal by any means any
[3:25:39.720 --> 3:25:42.200]  information or material from or related to
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:46.520]  fbi files or any other information acquired by virtue of my
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:50.600]  official employment to any unauthorized recipient
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:54.840]  without prior official written authorization by the FBI
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:58.680]  that's why donald trump tweeted out today that fbi director comey
[3:25:58.680 --> 3:26:02.360]  has broken the law it's based on the reporting
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:05.640]  and the reality that was talked about in this
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:09.880]  hill article on sunday now today we had the washington post react to this
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:12.760]  they reacted first of all to donald trump's tweet
[3:26:12.760 --> 3:26:16.360]  just as we had seen cnn's accosta following
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:20.600]  donald trump to to europe to the g20
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:25.560]  saying what is he talking about this three or four agencies it was 17 agencies
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:28.920]  when a week earlier we had had the new york times
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:33.560]  and reuters do retractions and say no no no it wasn't 17 agencies it was three
[3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:36.360]  or four and as we pointed out it wasn't even
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:40.920]  three or four agencies it was a crowd strike report
[3:26:40.920 --> 3:26:44.520]  a contractor to the dnc the same people who told the fbi no no no
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:48.600]  you can't see our servers we're going to tell you that this was the russians
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:53.160]  in spite of the fact the crowd strike had had to do retractions
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:57.080]  based on lies that they had told about the ukraine
[3:26:57.080 --> 3:27:01.800]  so crowd strike a gnc contractor who worked for hillary clinton said we're
[3:27:01.800 --> 3:27:05.480]  not going to show you the server's fbi we will just
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:09.320]  tell you what the situation is and then on the basis of that
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:13.880]  james clapper presented the information to these three agencies
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:17.800]  and they he said nobody objected so then he put it out there as
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:21.800]  everybody agrees with it unanimously all 17 agencies
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:24.840]  where did that phrase come from that came from hillary clinton so what we see
[3:27:24.840 --> 3:27:29.560]  here is intervention by james clapper on the
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:33.080]  behalf of hillary clinton that's called the violation of the hatch
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:37.720]  act that's exactly what happened uh through this while he was in office and
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:41.080]  he did it after he left now here's the washington post story
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:43.720]  trump accuses james comey of breaking the law
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:48.680]  yeah he did he did we just read to you the relevant fbi policy and the issues
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:52.200]  based on a misleading fox news report and let me say to you also
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:56.680]  that it wasn't pointed out in the hill but i have pointed it out over and over
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:28:00.120]  again and others have as well what circa research
[3:28:00.120 --> 3:28:03.720]  revealed and that is the fact that we had the faiza court
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:08.040]  the foreign intelligence surveillance act court say that the fbi
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:12.840]  and the nsa violated the law when they spied on people in the trump
[3:28:12.840 --> 3:28:16.440]  administration and other politicians other senators people like
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:20.280]  lindsay graham are saying wait a minute uh how do i find out because i think you
[3:28:20.280 --> 3:28:23.960]  guys are spying on me how do i find out if you were spying on me or not
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:27.400]  how do i ever get that it well we can't tell you senator if we told you would
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:30.760]  have to destroy your privacy is what they keep saying to them so
[3:28:30.760 --> 3:28:35.400]  we know that the nsa and the fbi violated the law
[3:28:35.400 --> 3:28:38.920]  why not because of an anonymous source coming through some junk
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:43.080]  magazine like the new york times of the washington post some rag like that no
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:47.320]  because the faiza court said so and the faiza court which
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:50.280]  has these decisions and keeps them in secret
[3:28:50.280 --> 3:28:53.560]  declassified that so we would all know and yet nobody has really
[3:28:53.560 --> 3:28:56.280]  paid much attention to it circa put it out there
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:28:58.920]  drudge put it out there we've talked about it here on info wars
[3:28:58.920 --> 3:29:02.280]  let's talk about the way washington post spun this today
[3:29:02.280 --> 3:29:05.960]  they said it was fox and friends on monday morning who put this out and then
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:10.120]  donald trump tweeted oh comey leaked classified information to the media that
[3:29:10.120 --> 3:29:13.720]  is so illegal well let's remind people that
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:17.240]  fox news was quoting a story from the hill
[3:29:17.240 --> 3:29:19.880]  why would washington post then say it was fox news
[3:29:19.880 --> 3:29:24.040]  because they want to show this as a partisan issue rather than a legal
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:27.000]  issue and they want to talk about the monday morning show
[3:29:27.000 --> 3:29:31.480]  rather than the sunday article that exposed this in detail
[3:29:31.480 --> 3:29:35.080]  they go in and they talk about the different classified information in the
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:37.720]  different levels and they say well you know this wasn't really highly
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:40.920]  classified they did exactly the opposite for
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:48.360]  hillary stay with us we'll be right back
[3:29:48.360 --> 3:29:52.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:52.280 --> 3:29:59.560]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:03.400]  this is a public service announcement from info wars dot com
[3:30:03.400 --> 3:30:06.520]  are you aware of political fraud it is rampant out there

[3:30:40.600 --> 3:30:42.520]  could not tolerate the open borders of europe

[3:32:00.760 --> 3:32:04.360]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry
[3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:09.080]  our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a
[3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:12.200]  chance to organize and prepare a defense
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:17.880]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they
[3:32:17.880 --> 3:32:22.600]  had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[3:32:22.600 --> 3:32:27.640]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[3:32:27.640 --> 3:32:30.840]  and the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality
[3:32:30.840 --> 3:32:35.000]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[3:32:35.000 --> 3:32:38.440]  i personally counter this onslaught with anthroplex
[3:32:38.440 --> 3:32:44.680]  anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the
[3:32:44.680 --> 3:32:48.520]  basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[3:32:48.520 --> 3:32:52.440]  inside the human body discover why anthroplex has turned so many heads today
[3:32:52.440 --> 3:32:56.280]  it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at
[3:32:56.280 --> 3:33:00.440]  info wars life dot com with anthroplex
[3:33:05.720 --> 3:33:12.360]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[3:33:12.360 --> 3:33:17.240]  and now your host david knight
[3:33:18.600 --> 3:33:23.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this monday july 10th 2017
[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:26.920]  and i point out that it's monday because it was yesterday sunday
[3:33:26.920 --> 3:33:31.320]  that the hill came out with this expose on james komie
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:36.200]  exposing his private parts his private memos as not being private at all but
[3:33:36.200 --> 3:33:40.760]  really being government documents why we read that information to you
[3:33:40.760 --> 3:33:44.840]  anything that is created as part of his official business is a government
[3:33:44.840 --> 3:33:48.360]  document furthermore out of the seven documents that he created
[3:33:48.360 --> 3:33:51.320]  about the nine meetings that he had with president trump
[3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:55.240]  four of those had classified markings on him meanwhile the washington post says
[3:33:55.240 --> 3:33:59.240]  oh trump is out there tweeting about komie breaking the law
[3:33:59.240 --> 3:34:03.080]  and he's doing it based on a misleading fox news report no it was
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:07.640]  the hill they point out fox news because they want to say it's simply partisan
[3:34:07.640 --> 3:34:11.080]  and so they reference this monday morning show and yet
[3:34:11.080 --> 3:34:16.760]  buried in the comments they have the fox news host referring back to the
[3:34:16.760 --> 3:34:21.400]  hill's article the previous day but they keep trying to put it on fox news and
[3:34:21.400 --> 3:34:24.520]  say there's nothing there move along they say
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:28.040]  trump team embraced this idea that komie had leaked classified information to his
[3:34:28.040 --> 3:34:30.840]  friends because it reinforces the president's prior arguments
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:34.600]  that the man he fired was a real villain in the interactions it reinforces the
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:37.720]  fact that this guy had violated the law
[3:34:37.720 --> 3:34:41.080]  democrats knew they had violated the hatch act when he got involved
[3:34:41.080 --> 3:34:44.520]  in the election with hillary they were screaming saying
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:47.880]  this guy is trying to rig the election or move it in one direction or the other
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:52.120]  and some people pointed out at the time that james komie has done something that
[3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:56.200]  even jager hoover didn't try to do and that is try to threaten
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:01.960]  both candidates simultaneously to keep his position in place that's the level
[3:35:01.960 --> 3:35:05.640]  of corruption that we have here but the fact remains that he's got four
[3:35:05.640 --> 3:35:09.560]  documents that were classified as secret or confidential
[3:35:09.560 --> 3:35:13.160]  and this is what the washington post says fox report again they don't talk
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:16.680]  about the hill the fox report summarizes though not apparently
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:21.160]  top secret material the levels of classification go confidential secret
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:24.520]  and top secret did they ever explain that to us when we were talking about
[3:35:24.520 --> 3:35:27.720]  hillary clinton's emails we said many times
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:31.240]  that her discussions that she would have with foreign heads of state as
[3:35:31.240 --> 3:35:34.760]  secretary of state here in the united states those are born
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:38.200]  at a high level of classifications a matter of fact a lot of this stuff
[3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:41.720]  before it even got stamped it was already understood to be classified
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:45.160]  and most of what she did and put on her servers was
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:49.880]  above top secret and yet when they try to downplay this from the
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:52.520]  washington post says well you know classifications are
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:56.280]  confidential secret and top secret did they ever care about that
[3:35:56.280 --> 3:35:59.720]  when the guy who worked on the submarine the sailor who was on the
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:02.840]  on the submarine took a couple of pictures of his workplace to
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:06.680]  as souvenirs for his kids and they said anything that you take
[3:36:06.680 --> 3:36:10.200]  inside a submarine anything you shoot picture of your bed
[3:36:10.200 --> 3:36:15.320]  that is immediately classified as confidential and they sent him to jail
[3:36:15.320 --> 3:36:18.440]  sent him to jail because remember james comey said well you know for hillary
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:21.080]  clinton we're going to give her a pass because we don't think there was any
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:25.400]  evil intent no that wasn't there wasn't any evil intent
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:30.280]  for this submarine sailor and yet they sent him to jail
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:35.320]  hillary clinton does above top secret even sets up
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:38.680]  flag there so that people can find the emails maybe she just
[3:36:38.680 --> 3:36:42.040]  did that so she was passing it on to them clinton emails.com
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:45.720]  you know just so you don't miss it you know here it is right here not protected
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:48.280]  come and get the information that you've already paid for somewhere else
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:36:51.800]  presumably okay but this is the level of corruption
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:56.280]  and this is the way the washington post spends this
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:36:59.720]  to point out that it's a fox news thing to try to downplay this and say look
[3:36:59.720 --> 3:37:03.560]  it's not the most classified stuff and yeah there's nothing to see here it was
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:08.280]  just trump reacting to fox and friends no it's the reality that he broke
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:13.160]  the law is he going to be prosecuted for that is he going to be prosecuted for
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:17.080]  violating the law as the fiza court says in terms of violating
[3:37:17.080 --> 3:37:20.680]  doing searches without warrants and exposing people
[3:37:20.680 --> 3:37:25.000]  by unmasking them are they going to come after james comey for doing that
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:28.520]  we'll have to see i don't know if attorney general
[3:37:28.520 --> 3:37:32.120]  sessions has the guts or the backbone to do this i'm beginning to wonder
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:35.320]  why he's not taking action on any of this stuff
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:38.440]  all right we're going to play here i've got a clip for you of uh
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:41.400]  mark zuckerberg actually doing an interview with cnn it looks like he
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:44.280]  took a truth ceremony absolutely amazing so i'm going to play that for you but
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:47.480]  before i do real quickly i will remind you that
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:52.600]  the fourth of july special that we put up was not taken down today so it is
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:57.480]  still in effect for the rest of the day and take advantage of these
[3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:00.520]  massive discounts we've got dna force back in stock
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:05.480]  20 off retail we got z shield the toxic metal and chemical defense support
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:09.320]  formula 30 off and at info wars life dot com and
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:14.920]  info wars select storeable food 30 to 40 off at info wars store dot com also
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:18.520]  living defense 20 off retail we have massive
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:23.320]  sales at info wars life dot com again they're still up today as part of our
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:26.440]  info wars fourth of july summer mega specials
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:30.920]  still live today take advantage of this it's uh not going to last
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:34.360]  let's go to this report from uh mark zuckerberg
[3:38:34.360 --> 3:38:49.800]  where he actually tells the truth to cnn here's that clip
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:52.680]  it's an incredibly big deal that facebook
[3:38:52.680 --> 3:38:57.880]  is is completely overhauling its mission and has a new mission so
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:02.200]  what is the new mission of facebook yeah we're going to start censoring pro
[3:39:02.200 --> 3:39:05.800]  trump news or news we don't like not not even fake stuff we're just
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:08.760]  going to censor so how exactly do you do that
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:12.360]  i guess the message is to you hey it don't matter what's true
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:15.640]  you keep your mouth shut or we're going to call you hitler
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:19.800]  take me inside mark zuckerberg's head to like the moment that you decided
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:23.800]  you needed to change facebook's core mission was there an event that happened
[3:39:23.800 --> 3:39:26.040]  or was there just a moment that you said
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:30.040]  we got to change something obama put it in a kill switch
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:34.920]  in place in 2010 and then signed a bill right before he left office
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:39.080]  saying that the cia would be over the media
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:43.480]  and over the board of governors of the fcc i mean this is crazy stuff
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:47.080]  and it's in the news it's not like i'm saying it what if you had to kind of
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:51.320]  learn from the spread of misinformation or what have you learned to make sure
[3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:55.960]  that people can really connect it's not in the news but corporations
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:58.920]  send each other communications and they send stockholders
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:02.280]  information and everything's there everything's there i mean you read the
[3:40:02.280 --> 3:40:05.240]  white papers today it's like we're preparing for a post-human world
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:08.520]  looking at the best way do we just kill everybody right over the virus or do we
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:12.360]  entertain them and then have them opt in to get more money up front
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:15.800]  to then have the government euthanize them later we keep hearing we've never
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:19.800]  been more divided we've never been more polarized was it the political
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:24.200]  climate that that led to kind of this awakening let me give you the big news
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:28.280]  right now let me tell everybody the big news right now if you think
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:32.440]  14 year old and 12 year old news about cameras and microphones
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:35.480]  watching and listening to you you're like oh what there's nothing about me
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:38.040]  that's interesting just like people put stuff on facebook when they're going on
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:41.240]  a town where they live people rob them it's not that you did something wrong
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:44.440]  you told folks what you had in your house where you lived and where you were
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:48.360]  going for a week oh you're going to cancun for a week you said where you
[3:40:48.360 --> 3:40:52.040]  lived and what you had in your house and showed off the stuff you had and then
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:55.400]  robbers robbed you you're a dumbass i don't say that
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:59.160]  meanly it's true just like oh let the government know what i've got
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:01.960]  i'm not even high as if the government's full of angels
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:05.240]  samsung and all these companies for a decade have been telling you they're
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:10.200]  doing this because they're selling the data on you and the intel on you into
[3:41:10.200 --> 3:41:16.680]  big algorithm systems okay that was actually an entry i'm
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:20.760]  sure you figured that out by now that was actually an entry into our contest
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:24.520]  our cnn contest a great entry so i want to play that for you
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:27.480]  and i want to talk a little bit about what happened with uh
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:31.000]  donald trump jr but before i do i want to talk about
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:34.120]  what's really going on in this country with our health care system this story
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:38.120]  that was up on drudge report today cancer is now more common than getting
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:43.480]  married or having a first baby and you know we can talk
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:47.160]  about the fake news we can talk about all this russia this russia that everything
[3:41:47.160 --> 3:41:51.160]  as kelly anconway said to chris quomo today she said
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:54.280]  aren't you embarrassed to talk more about russia
[3:41:54.280 --> 3:41:58.520]  than america and we do need to counter that but let's talk about america here
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:02.680]  for a moment let's talk about our life and our liberty
[3:42:02.680 --> 3:42:06.680]  to pursue health care that's what's really at issue here
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:09.800]  and i want to talk a little bit about what's going on in the u.s with obama
[3:42:09.800 --> 3:42:13.160]  care and i want to talk a little bit about what's going on in the uk
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:16.840]  with this 11 month old baby charlie garth has been an update on this as well
[3:42:16.840 --> 3:42:19.480]  today let's talk about the situation in the uc this
[3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:22.120]  is a uk where they're saying cancer is now more common than getting married or
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:25.240]  having a first baby that may be the case in the united states as well
[3:42:25.240 --> 3:42:28.280]  there's a telegraph story that's on the drudge report developing cancer is now
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:30.600]  more common than getting married or having a first baby
[3:42:30.600 --> 3:42:34.840]  this is research from macmillan cancer support they said there were 361 000
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:41.000]  cancers diagnosed in 2014 the uk compared to 289 000 marriages
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:46.120]  new cancer cases are also as common as graduating from university see
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:50.360]  it's a rite of passage that's how we exit this life now
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:54.920]  is cancer remember when alex jones is talking to megyn kelly
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:42:58.840]  and he was talking to her about this very issue he said you may
[3:42:58.840 --> 3:43:02.440]  likely outlive your children why would he say that
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:05.960]  well it's because of the environmental factors what they put into our food and
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:09.880]  water that's why this is snowballing that's why
[3:43:09.880 --> 3:43:13.560]  cancer is metastasizing throughout our society
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:17.720]  as it's metastasizing throughout our bodies and he said you may think that
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:20.920]  this is really radical but you know he's trying to tell her
[3:43:20.920 --> 3:43:23.640]  what he's been trying to tell his audiences for a long time is one of the
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:27.320]  reasons why we want to be independent but we also
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:31.640]  want to help people to preserve their lives to fight back against this is an
[3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:35.160]  act of resistance folks to take care of your health
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:38.760]  to start eating clean food to understand
[3:43:38.760 --> 3:43:42.040]  the nutritional deficiencies that are in the diet
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:45.800]  in america so it's a part of resisting this
[3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:49.800]  death plan that they have for everybody i also point out 271 000 babies born to
[3:43:49.800 --> 3:43:53.640]  first time mothers in england and wales in 2015 compared to
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:44:00.520]  319 000 new cases of cancer absolutely absolutely disgusting
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:03.800]  to see that kind of information meanwhile what we have going on here in
[3:44:03.800 --> 3:44:07.240]  america we've got conservatives who are revolting
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:11.000]  over talk of keeping the obama care tax
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:14.520]  remember uh admiral akbar you know from star wars that mean
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:18.360]  this attack it's a it's a tax folks it's not
[3:44:18.360 --> 3:44:24.520]  an attack this tax is an attack on our society on our freedom
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:30.440]  this is focusing on welfare and entitlement it is not focusing on
[3:44:30.440 --> 3:44:33.240]  affordability on quality of health care
[3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:36.280]  that's what this is truly about and if you look at this picture we have
[3:44:36.280 --> 3:44:39.480]  on our article we this is from the hills original article from the hill
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:44.520]  we have it on our site obama care the big lie tired of corporate elitist
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:49.080]  government that's precisely what this is this was something that was designed
[3:44:49.080 --> 3:44:52.360]  as crony capitalism this is a kind of fascist
[3:44:52.360 --> 3:44:55.800]  takeover of our health care where are the antifa people
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:59.640]  when it comes to obama care oh no they want even more of that
[3:44:59.640 --> 3:45:02.760]  conservative groups are warning gop senators against keeping an obama care
[3:45:02.760 --> 3:45:05.240]  tax on investment income in their health care
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:08.440]  bill an idea that's gained some traction among lawmakers
[3:45:08.440 --> 3:45:12.440]  gop lawmakers have floated keeping obama care 3.8 percent
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:16.680]  net investment income tax to help pay for more generous health care
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:21.640]  subsidies for low-income people again still ignoring the fact that they did a
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:26.120]  net asset sweep out of fanny and freddy stealing money from people who are
[3:45:26.120 --> 3:45:29.960]  conservatively investing it for their retirement a lot of people
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:33.400]  have done that and fanny and freddy those investors have had
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:37.880]  100 percent of their money taken away fanny and freddy became profitable
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:41.720]  obama could not get the congress to fund it
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:45.640]  and they sued him when he went ahead and took the money
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:49.560]  anyway and a judge agreed with the republican congress and said no the
[3:45:49.560 --> 3:45:53.800]  republicans have to allocate money you can't just grab this money and so
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:57.000]  they continue to do it anyway and we still have
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:01.240]  the department of justice appealing that decision where is attorney general
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:05.800]  sessions on this stop the appeal stop the theft
[3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:09.800]  stop obama care you have to repeal this this is
[3:46:09.800 --> 3:46:12.760]  you're not going to make it more affordable when you put taxes on medical
[3:46:12.760 --> 3:46:16.760]  devices when you put taxes on other health care and this is
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:21.000]  even this is distracting people's attention say there's only a tax on
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:25.000]  investment income that's one of many many taxes that are part of obama care
[3:46:25.000 --> 3:46:28.120]  it is not about making anything more affordable
[3:46:28.120 --> 3:46:32.600]  it is about redistributing income and it is about creating an entitlement
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:35.480]  program it's not about making health care better or more affordable
[3:46:35.480 --> 3:46:38.760]  meanwhile republicans are debating what to do with plan b because it looks like
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:42.440]  they're not going to be able to repeal and replace because that's too much to
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:46.040]  do in one step it's too complicated they can't agree on it
[3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:50.040]  so can't we at least agree they're going to shut this down
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:54.600]  where is the resistance coming from it's coming from the republicans
[3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:58.120]  we said this before the election we said before the election
[3:46:58.120 --> 3:47:03.320]  trump's biggest opponents are not going to be Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi
[3:47:03.320 --> 3:47:07.400]  trump's biggest opponents on obama care are going to be mcconnell
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:10.760]  and bainer that's right i'm bainer but uh ryan
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:14.920]  a clone of bainer it was paul ryan who was the vp
[3:47:14.920 --> 3:47:18.120]  that was going to push through obama care if mit romney got in it would just
[3:47:18.120 --> 3:47:21.480]  would have been romney care like he did in massachusetts
[3:47:21.480 --> 3:47:25.720]  they have always the republicans at the top have always been
[3:47:25.720 --> 3:47:31.480]  about creating this welfare system this government takeover of our health care
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:35.160]  meanwhile we see donald trump doing the right thing and we also see
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:39.400]  in the va the veterans administration we also see
[3:47:39.400 --> 3:47:42.840]  what government run health care is going to look like and we're going to talk
[3:47:42.840 --> 3:47:46.440]  about what it looks like in the uk here in just a moment as well but let's talk
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:49.720]  about what it looks like with our government run health care the va
[3:47:49.720 --> 3:47:53.880]  they've just now terminated 500 suspended 200 for misconduct
[3:47:53.880 --> 3:47:58.680]  548 department of veteran affairs va employees have been terminated since
[3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:02.280]  president trump took office indicating that his campaign pledge to clean up
[3:48:02.280 --> 3:48:05.800]  probably the most incompetently run agency in the united states that's what he
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:09.160]  said by putting his tv catchphrase you're fired
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:13.240]  in action was more than just empty rhetoric another 200 va workers were
[3:48:13.240 --> 3:48:17.800]  suspended 33 demoted and this is includes 22 senior
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:22.440]  leaders more than 70 nurses 14 police officers 25 physicians
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:25.640]  also disciplined were a program endless dealing with the government
[3:48:25.640 --> 3:48:29.000]  accountability office which audits the department a public
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:33.160]  affairs specialist a chief of police and a chief of
[3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:39.480]  surgery massive corruption in the va huge salaries paid to these people at
[3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:43.640]  the top while the soldiers and the veterans who are supposed to be getting
[3:48:43.640 --> 3:48:47.080]  health care can't get anything at all that's the scandal of the va
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:51.080]  and that folks is what government run health care single pair health care
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:53.160]  that's what it's going to look like here in the united states let's take a look
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:56.760]  at what it looks like in the uk today we had
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:48:59.000]  done of course if you haven't been following this story i've done several
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:02.680]  reports on it charlie guard little 11 month old baby in the uk who has a very
[3:49:02.680 --> 3:49:06.120]  rare disease he's been given a death sentence
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:09.720]  by the british courts in the hospital who want to take him off of life support
[3:49:09.720 --> 3:49:14.680]  meanwhile there is a hospital in the united states that wants to give him
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:18.360]  free experimental treatment if they will let him come
[3:49:18.360 --> 3:49:22.520]  and they said no the parents appealed it to the eu court the eu court said
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:26.360]  no and so now well he got even worse than that
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:29.560]  then they said we're going to and there's going to be friday
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:32.840]  june the 30th they're going to take him off of life support and the parents said
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:37.160]  well can we take him home to die no you can't
[3:49:37.160 --> 3:49:40.440]  we don't have any option for doing that so we'll pay for it no no we don't have
[3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:43.640]  any option for you to pay for it either we're not going to let you pay for it
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:46.280]  we're not going to let you take your child home to die
[3:49:46.280 --> 3:49:50.200]  where you would like him to go and not even going to let him go to a hospice
[3:49:50.200 --> 3:49:53.480]  no he's going to die here in the hospital when we say so
[3:49:53.480 --> 3:49:57.320]  that's single pair system that's government run health care
[3:49:57.320 --> 3:50:01.080]  and so now we've got another hearing today
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:06.520]  and this judge justice francis said that they've got 48 hours to produce
[3:50:06.520 --> 3:50:11.560]  evidence to convince them that this treatment is going to help charlie
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:15.720]  why should they have to convince this judge
[3:50:15.720 --> 3:50:18.520]  why should they have to prove that they're not medical specialists there's
[3:50:18.520 --> 3:50:22.840]  a medical specialist in the united states that says yeah i think this might help
[3:50:22.840 --> 3:50:26.360]  why isn't that sufficient why do they care
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:30.120]  so much that they want to kill him as the mother said last week she said
[3:50:30.120 --> 3:50:37.240]  euthanasia is illegal assisted suicide is illegal why is this legal
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:41.480]  and as i said we care so much about him we just want to make sure that the right
[3:50:41.480 --> 3:50:44.600]  things happen to him and the father couldn't take it anymore he stood up
[3:50:44.600 --> 3:50:48.520]  and say why are you going to start telling the truth well we've had a
[3:50:48.520 --> 3:50:51.000]  couple of congressmen in the united states now get involved it was a week
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:54.200]  ago that we had donald trump say if there's anything i can do to help please
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:50:57.000]  let me know i'll be happy to help now we've had two republicans
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:01.160]  come up and say that they're going to offer residency to them

[3:56:01.640 --> 3:56:06.200]  that are now in stock let's get back to this case of charlie guard because this
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:09.880]  also reflects on our freedom here in america the hospital that
[3:56:09.880 --> 3:56:12.200]  wanted to give free treatment to charlie guard
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:15.960]  said we have to talk to the fda make sure they're going to approve this
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:19.240]  do you see the problem with that do you see the problem with our government
[3:56:19.240 --> 3:56:24.840]  saying that everything is prohibited unless they expressly permit it
[3:56:24.840 --> 3:56:28.920]  and they are prohibiting people from taking natural treatments like medical
[3:56:28.920 --> 3:56:33.720]  marijuana and when they do that when they assume that power over your lives
[3:56:33.720 --> 3:56:36.840]  over the lives of you and your family then they can
[3:56:36.840 --> 3:56:40.920]  also mandate that certain things be put into you as well
[3:56:40.920 --> 3:56:45.000]  and so we have this article from the guardian this woman gabby hensliffe
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:48.280]  writes the charlie guard case is heartbreaking but society can't shun
[3:56:48.280 --> 3:56:53.080]  its experts she begins with a poem by calil gabron saying your children are
[3:56:53.080 --> 3:56:55.480]  not your own your children are not your children
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:56:58.840]  does this sound familiar does this sound like melissa harris perry
[3:56:58.840 --> 3:57:02.440]  they come through you but not from you and though they are with you they belong
[3:57:02.440 --> 3:57:07.240]  not to you no no that's wrong she said these words are
[3:57:07.240 --> 3:57:10.600]  sometimes spoken at the funeral of a child i don't know how anybody
[3:57:10.600 --> 3:57:16.520]  could get any consolation from that that is not the basis of our law
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:20.040]  of our ethics of our culture here in the west
