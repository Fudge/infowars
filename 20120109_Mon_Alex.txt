[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:31.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.800 --> 00:39.800]  okay very important broadcast incredibly important transmission lined up today just
[00:39.800 --> 00:46.840]  off the charts information and we tend to be so comfortable living inside this
[00:46.840 --> 00:52.320]  new world order that as it radically accelerates its global program of
[00:52.320 --> 01:00.440]  warfare dehumanization impoverishment and overthrows every form of liberty and
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.840]  ancient system of freedom and law from the Magna Carta to the Constitution to
[01:05.840 --> 01:13.880]  similar laws and codes around the world even I tend to just get punch drunk
[01:13.880 --> 01:20.960]  from it and just expect it to happen so today we're going to really focus
[01:20.960 --> 01:29.680]  predominantly on the designed global financial implosion that the six big
[01:29.680 --> 01:34.560]  megabanks are openly launching to to to bring the world under their control
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.640]  through fraud and to have the trader leaders that they have installed trick
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.480]  the public into signing on to debt bondage now on top of that they're
[01:44.480 --> 01:47.480]  going to have environmentalist tyranny that has nothing to do with the
[01:47.480 --> 01:52.800]  environment as a carbon tax that's accelerating with the airlines the
[01:52.800 --> 01:56.800]  counties the cities the states they don't care they're just going ahead with
[01:56.800 --> 02:04.440]  that worldwide global standardization but the big news obviously is Iran why
[02:04.440 --> 02:12.120]  would they try to start a war with a country that is armed to the teeth and
[02:12.120 --> 02:19.800]  has China backing them up and that many mainline analysts have said could lead
[02:19.800 --> 02:26.360]  to World War three will definitely lead to a short-term industrial depression in
[02:26.360 --> 02:31.680]  Europe there's different numbers but roughly 40% of the world's oil supply on
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.920]  any given day travels through the Strait of Hormuz the globalist are shutting
[02:37.920 --> 02:45.120]  off Iranian oil sales that's about half the money their government gets to fund
[02:45.120 --> 02:52.280]  the whole country and they're banning the importation of gasoline the EU set the
[02:52.280 --> 03:00.440]  US is involved NATO they're set to vote on this in two and a half weeks two and
[03:00.440 --> 03:04.280]  a half weeks regardless of what you think about the Iranians this is not
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.240]  going to be another Turkey shoot like sending in the giant US military behind
[03:09.240 --> 03:13.960]  the scenes on record paying off the main Iraqi military over 90% of it they
[03:13.960 --> 03:22.480]  paid the generals and others beforehand to stand down when the invasion of 2003
[03:22.480 --> 03:31.520]  kicked off after 13 14 years of sanctions on and off bombing UN inspectors in
[03:31.520 --> 03:40.200]  dismantling it Saddam a total 10 horn third world dictator and we lost 6,000
[03:40.200 --> 03:43.920]  US troops and conservatively a million Iraqis died one way or another from the
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.480]  war that's the British Lancet journal and many other prestigious ribs in by
[03:48.480 --> 03:55.760]  2007 said it was a mill probably a million 200,000 we know this Iraq was 26
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.040]  million it's now 23 million and they estimate about 2 million of those have
[04:00.040 --> 04:07.000]  fled the country so a million people went bye-bye into a fog and the West
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.120]  funded Shiite and Sunnis to kill each other to create destabilization to create
[04:12.120 --> 04:16.600]  the perception of a war show that the West could stay there and have no bid
[04:16.600 --> 04:21.760]  contracts and build up its bases and terrorist forces al Qaeda forces to
[04:21.760 --> 04:26.680]  launch attacks into Iran which is now going on and the controlled media
[04:26.680 --> 04:32.680]  thinks you're so stupid they tell you Iran runs al Qaeda Iran is arch enemies
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.440]  with Saudi Arabian Wahhabist they are Shiite as Iran fund what you call
[04:37.440 --> 04:43.360]  asymmetrical warfare terrorist you bet your bucks they do bottom dollar you
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.200]  bet your hand in they do but but they have our so-called media telling us
[04:48.200 --> 04:51.960]  that they're running al Qaeda when our criminal government runs al Qaeda in
[04:51.960 --> 04:58.200]  Libya in Syria in Iran that's the fact so you've got big confrontation coming up
[04:58.200 --> 05:03.320]  on the other side we'll break it down hundreds of nations have fallen to
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.040]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[05:08.040 --> 05:12.320]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.280]  underneath the Americans at home I've determined its influence on our
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.520]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.760]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.320]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.680]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[05:34.680 --> 05:38.400]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.400 --> 05:42.360]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.360 --> 05:47.920]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[08:10.480 --> 08:23.440]  radio network there is absolutely no doubt now that Europe the United States
[08:23.440 --> 08:33.080]  Israel as well as England are preparing a military confrontation with the
[08:33.080 --> 08:42.800]  heavily armed 76 million person Iranian population and we have the headline by
[08:42.800 --> 08:53.280]  Kurt Nemo that breaks it all down alert Iran crisis headed for World War 3 and
[08:53.280 --> 08:57.800]  he has the links to the mainline communist Chinese government run
[08:57.800 --> 09:06.240]  newspapers saying they will back Iran during a military attack the Russians
[09:06.240 --> 09:11.960]  have also deployed some of their fleets and are saying they will defend Syria
[09:11.960 --> 09:19.880]  during an attack US military forces have been deployed as of last week Israeli
[09:19.880 --> 09:27.920]  papers reported with almost no coverage here between the Lebanon Syrian border at
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.160]  least 2,000 US troops were deployed not for an exercise but what Jerusalem
[09:33.160 --> 09:39.680]  post called a deployment to coordinate military operations from air land and
[09:39.680 --> 09:53.680]  sea between the US IDF Israeli defense forces between the US and IDF forces as
[09:53.680 --> 09:58.600]  you know last week the Iranian government that their head of their joint
[09:58.600 --> 10:04.080]  Jesus staff and their top Admiral both said if you enter this area and do
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.960]  military drills off our coastline in the Strait of Hormuz it will be your last
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.800]  warning you have your last warning do not return that's a quote do not return
[10:13.800 --> 10:23.440]  this is your only warning now the West if you read the fine print of what the
[10:23.440 --> 10:28.000]  Euro the EU dictatorship is pushing the countries aren't allowed to vote on it
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.080]  they're just in it they're announcing they're going to start blocking gasoline
[10:33.080 --> 10:39.520]  imports into Iran they import over 50% probably 51% of their refined gasoline
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.640]  and they expert the export oil and then import it back refined they don't have
[10:45.640 --> 10:50.920]  the money in the infrastructure refined more than half of the fuel they need show
[10:50.920 --> 10:56.360]  what they run their country off of oil imagine in the United States had half
[10:56.360 --> 11:03.560]  its gasoline cut off they are putting Iran into an absolute confrontation mode
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.400]  just as Lindsey Williams source said just as the Rand Corporation called for
[11:08.400 --> 11:14.240]  three years ago it is happening on top of this Saturday the United States and
[11:14.240 --> 11:25.040]  Israel announced they are going to send in the next five days their fleets into
[11:25.040 --> 11:30.760]  the Strait of Hormuz including U.S. missile cruisers with nuclear weapons
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.760]  Israeli missile cruisers with nuclear weapons Israeli submarines with nuclear
[11:34.760 --> 11:41.280]  weapons it is insane what's happening and if you turn on the news as I did this
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.160]  morning and last night you're hearing about Tebo or Tybo or whatever his name
[11:47.160 --> 11:55.240]  is you're hearing about the latest fashion shows you're hearing about how
[11:55.240 --> 12:02.000]  great and invincible mitt open borders carbon tax pro-abortion anti-gun
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.880]  Obamacare author how he's invincible and the presumptive nominee for the
[12:08.880 --> 12:19.040]  Republicans and CBS we have a video coming up later CBS ran a news piece
[12:19.040 --> 12:25.760]  just as others have done in past polls and they mentioned first third fourth
[12:25.760 --> 12:29.920]  and fifth and don't mention Ron Paul and second right behind Mitt Romney we have
[12:29.920 --> 12:34.880]  an article on that by Paul Watson and fo wars com with links to the video as
[12:34.880 --> 12:40.000]  well and a screenshot of the poll this is the way they treat the American
[12:40.000 --> 12:48.520]  people now why is this Iran situation so important right as the globalist
[12:48.520 --> 12:54.040]  implode the world economy have government sign sovereignty in Europe and
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.800]  the U.S. through the Super Congress through the super unelected EU bureaucracy
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.880]  as the public is told it's their debt when 90 plus percent of it's not your
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.920]  debt tens of trillions a year pumped out in Europe in the U.S. and the black
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.840]  old private banks they tell Congress they tell the European individual
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.080]  nations we won't tell you where the money went private lawsuits find out
[13:15.080 --> 13:19.520]  because they're plaintiffs some of it's their money they take people's private
[13:19.520 --> 13:23.760]  money steal it out of accounts bring down banks bring down companies and then
[13:23.760 --> 13:27.920]  get bailouts from government and don't even use it to prop up companies they
[13:27.920 --> 13:32.800]  just shut them down and keep it I mean we the world according to all the former
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.680]  top federal regulators like William K. Black and others that sent hundreds to
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.600]  prison for just a small SNL nothing compared to this this is several orders
[13:41.600 --> 13:48.160]  of magnitude meaning exponentially logarithmically bigger the globalist
[13:48.160 --> 13:54.880]  are madmen 40 to 1 bets with people's private bank accounts hailed by the
[13:54.880 --> 14:01.840]  media is absolutely cool top advisor Obama Corsi lies to Congress gets caught
[14:01.840 --> 14:07.800]  head of the CME group Chicago mercantile exchange says he's lying nobody gets in
[14:07.800 --> 14:15.280]  trouble I mean we're seeing magnitudes of corruption by two magnitudes at least
[14:15.280 --> 14:23.240]  two logarithmic exponential hyperbolic Gorgantuan dwarfing anything ever seen
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.740]  an orgy of all out stealing everything you know why because they're gonna blow
[14:28.740 --> 14:33.560]  stuff up they might even nuke cities and and firebomb and bomb police stations
[14:33.560 --> 14:37.680]  and blaming on domestic groups and and and and and and the whore media will
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.440]  line up and say it's domestic groups and the good old boys will get out the
[14:41.440 --> 14:46.000]  salute while talk show hoster being arrested and drug off that's what the
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.160]  globalist are counting on now I'm telling you they could say Iran did it they
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.160]  could say anything they could release a bio weapon they could do any false flag
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.480]  you can imagine but the entire system is set up around continuity of government
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.160]  and total takeover of society and this is an absolute red-level emergency
[15:06.160 --> 15:14.880]  situation the globalists have shown that they are so wild with hubris and
[15:14.880 --> 15:19.720]  arrogance that they are capable of anything we learned a year and a half
[15:19.720 --> 15:26.640]  ago and nobody got in trouble that the top 14 insurance companies themselves
[15:26.640 --> 15:31.280]  subsidiaries of the six megabanks Prudential and others this was in
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.320]  Bloomberg AP but never made it your local paper never a big nightly news item
[15:35.320 --> 15:43.600]  made deals to take the death benefits of US troops from World War two through
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.560]  current I mean that's cold-blooded folks to take people's private insurance
[15:48.560 --> 15:52.040]  policies and let them because the Department of Defense administers them
[15:52.040 --> 15:58.760]  I mean these are just naked crooks but they know how to start a war with a
[15:58.760 --> 16:07.360]  country they've overthrown twice and set up torture groups and they probably
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.160]  are running the moolest today to some extent Iran Contra help put them in
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.760]  power in 79 may go look it up if you didn't know the globalist see it's the
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.520]  megabanks playing us all off against each other and they want a giant
[16:18.520 --> 16:26.320]  political diversion they want a giant political distraction they want a giant
[16:26.320 --> 16:32.600]  earth-shattering earth-shaking war a huge event where aircraft carriers are on
[16:32.600 --> 16:36.480]  fire and missiles are being fired and tactical nukes are being launched in
[16:36.480 --> 16:43.200]  Iran and Iranian sleeper cells which Iran actually says they've got no use the
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.440]  globalist may not have to stage a false flag they'll have Iranians bombing New
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.400]  York bombing Los Angeles bombing Chicago bombing Austin Texas bombing
[16:52.400 --> 16:59.200]  Houston shooting people in the streets because they're getting nuked and attacked
[16:59.200 --> 17:04.760]  and the globalist will push the plunger boom tactical Duke say Iran did it and
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.040]  then it's martial law so hardcore it's gonna make your head spin and you're
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.080]  gonna be ordered to turn your guns in you're gonna be ordered to swear an
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.000]  oath to them and you're gonna have you're gonna see all the spies they've
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.480]  hired and all the control freaks and all the intelligence units activated on you
[17:19.480 --> 17:25.040]  and lots of televised SWAT teams killing quote you know right wing extremist and
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.600]  lots of military bases being attacked by the globalist themselves blamed on
[17:29.600 --> 17:35.200]  domestic groups claiming we work with al-Qaeda and and Iran this is the full
[17:35.200 --> 17:41.040]  spectrum warfare of the bankers running America and once they trigger this war
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.680]  ladies and gentlemen it's gonna be a war on the American people and a war on
[17:45.680 --> 17:51.760]  the Iranians you better believe it and it is gonna be hellish now I'm telling
[17:51.760 --> 17:58.720]  you this is in the works in the cards what I've told you is a very possible
[17:58.720 --> 18:03.440]  scenario that I can see and reverse engineer from all their action and I
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.720]  know they've got everything I just said in blueprint model battle plans right
[18:07.720 --> 18:12.760]  now I just gave you one of their major battle plans right there because
[18:12.760 --> 18:16.400]  everything in intelligence is watching movements and the globalists think you're
[18:16.400 --> 18:23.160]  stupid so they hide everything in plain view and about 90% of my prime
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.040]  projection I just gave you his open source information the rest is knowing
[18:27.040 --> 18:31.560]  the enemy's mind but they could go with a bio attack and say the Iranians did it
[18:31.560 --> 18:35.880]  or just say one popped up during this this crisis to get us all to unify
[18:35.880 --> 18:40.720]  behind the government what did they talk about in the New Hampshire debate
[18:40.720 --> 18:43.800]  though they want to watch Saturday night they kept talking about we need to get
[18:43.800 --> 18:48.480]  the public's trust back it's all about making them look trustworthy and making
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.320]  them look good and fatherly and nice those are all little nobody puppets
[18:53.320 --> 19:02.160]  except Ron Paul that's why it's anybody but Ron Paul so I want you to
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.000]  understand I told you they'd implode Europe over a decade ago through
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.440]  derivatives and use the EU bureaucracy to fully take what sovereign he was left

[24:16.680 --> 24:21.680]  their industrial civilization a lot of areas of Iran look like Chicago or
[24:21.680 --> 24:26.360]  Dallas Texas big listening high-rise buildings people in suits and ties
[24:26.360 --> 24:31.280]  walking around about 70% if you look at the general polls of Iranians or big
[24:31.280 --> 24:42.200]  fans of the US but they're going to be attacked and they're saying that when
[24:42.200 --> 24:46.000]  their power gets cut off they are going to go ahead and block straight or
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.960]  moose and give Europe in the US the same medicine they're getting and the
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.440]  Israelis in the US have said that is the people that run Israel and run the
[24:53.440 --> 24:57.400]  United States have said you know what we're going to attack you when you do
[24:57.400 --> 25:00.520]  that it's like we're going to cut your power off and we're going to have
[25:00.520 --> 25:08.000]  terrorists inside your country I even have a Washington Post article today
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.440]  admitting that the US and Israel are blowing up missile bases and assassinating
[25:13.440 --> 25:20.160]  people in Iran I mean whole bases blow up whole military command bases blow up
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.880]  whole missile bases blow up Ahmed Denizides driving across a bridge it
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.280]  blows up right after he drives across it the Iranians if they were so crazy
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.520]  they're just taking it and taking it and taking it and taking it but they're
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.120]  saying if you cut off half our power we're going to have to go to war with
[25:36.120 --> 25:42.760]  you because siege embargo blockade is the oldest form of war under international
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.040]  law Ron Paul has pointed out it's an act of war can you imagine if somebody cut
[25:47.040 --> 25:53.800]  off half our fuel I mean folks a lot of the average good old boys liquor sales
[25:53.800 --> 25:57.440]  pizza sales go off the charts when there's a war more than New Year's at
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.080]  Christmas and Thanksgiving combined I've talked to liquor store owners I've
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.160]  seen the statistics in the news when there's a new war people go get drunk
[26:04.160 --> 26:10.240]  they they have barbecues they sit there like it's a video game as the banks that
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.520]  run America use our military to terrorize third world nations of course
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.920]  they hate us and then they say well if we weren't dependent on oil we wouldn't
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.560]  have to buy it from all the Republicans say that the big oil companies and banks
[26:24.560 --> 26:30.840]  that run this country don't want the oil to be developed they're always blocking
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.000]  it it isn't some little hippy person blocking exploration of oil it's the
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.240]  big oil companies it's on record the Associated Press sued in 2000 and got
[26:42.240 --> 26:48.880]  documents from 1996 we've written big articles on it where the big ten oil
[26:48.880 --> 26:53.120]  companies got together in meetings and said we got to buy up all the refineries
[26:53.120 --> 26:58.400]  there's too much oil we'll shut it down that way and we'll also you know basically
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.280]  covertly fund environmentalist groups to stop development here to shut down all
[27:02.280 --> 27:07.920]  the smaller companies it's on record and they fund the whole peak oil thing the
[27:07.920 --> 27:13.400]  oil companies do there's no oil left to train you that there's no oil just like
[27:13.400 --> 27:16.680]  they're shutting down all of our coal plants that aren't owned by GE and the
[27:16.680 --> 27:23.560]  power prices are going off the charts they know what they're doing they'd like
[27:23.560 --> 27:31.480]  to sell you less for a whole lot more and it's real simple it's real simple the
[27:31.480 --> 27:34.480]  globalists are gonna love it Saudi Arabia's already said they're gonna love
[27:34.480 --> 27:38.320]  it when the straight gets shut down they're gonna make even more money you're
[27:38.320 --> 27:41.320]  gonna pay a lot more you're gonna pay six seven dollars at the pump and they're
[27:41.320 --> 27:45.960]  gonna tell you Iran did it you think the Iranians are like paying two three

[36:13.920 --> 36:18.960]  perspective we're going to Colonel Shafer they're saying that they will block
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.600]  the Strait of Hormuz now in official Iranian press TV official government
[36:23.600 --> 36:30.720]  organs if the embargo by Europe goes ahead of Iranian oil which is how they
[36:30.720 --> 36:33.880]  fund most their government and they're saying they're gonna import embargo
[36:33.880 --> 36:40.480]  refined gas they sell raw oil and then buy refined gasoline 51% so this this
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.000]  is an industrial depression for them so they've the the people that want war have
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.680]  pushed them into this and we're here this is a big deal and you're upset to
[36:49.680 --> 36:53.880]  vote in less than three weeks on this but that's not even the biggest news we
[36:53.880 --> 37:00.080]  have the and I have trouble not you know hyperventilating when I think about this
[37:00.080 --> 37:06.360]  because this is crazy folks they have the US fleet and Israeli fleet the
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.760]  Associated Press reports steaming towards the Strait of Hormuz after Iran last
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.640]  week issued a challenge that do not come through the Strait again this is your
[37:15.640 --> 37:22.560]  last warning so that a wild provocation by Iran and Israel the United States
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.280]  going in so either they're gonna blink or something's gonna happen how did
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.760]  things escalate this fast which ended Colonel Anthony Shafer sir well I think
[37:33.760 --> 37:36.960]  there's three things that we have to consider as we look to the future first
[37:36.960 --> 37:44.040]  as you put out and I think very well stated the the Iranians have huge
[37:44.040 --> 37:50.520]  problems inside if they decide to break to do the blockade because they do it
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.800]  they aren't net importer gasoline their economy depends on that
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.720]  secondly no matter how much they save a rattle and look I gotta tell you Alex
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.040]  we could take care of the Iranian Navy in a matter of hours and I'm not
[38:05.040 --> 38:11.000]  exaggerating I despite the fact that there's a lot of I think con conflicting
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.600]  information look we've got a carrier sitting you know in there right now we
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.280]  don't need more than a couple of carriers take care of what would be
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.720]  necessary with that said we have to understand the huge consequences of that
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.760]  action regarding our own economy this is a fragile recovery someone argue it's
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.960]  barely moving forward and I don't think anybody wants $5 gallons of gas but
[38:33.960 --> 38:37.360]  that's what would happen the moment we actually have something happened to
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.680]  interfere with I think arguably you're talking about one third of the oil going
[38:41.680 --> 38:45.480]  through the straits of our move now keep in mind that we're down to about 16% of
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.600]  our incoming oil comes out of that region mostly out of OPEC countries which
[38:49.600 --> 38:54.480]  are friendly to us with that said the cost of doing business with gas with
[38:54.480 --> 38:59.840]  you know with crew to go up secondly that the Iranians themselves I think are
[38:59.840 --> 39:02.600]  trying to do things I said this in a recent interview which got a lot of
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.120]  additional airtime the Iranians understand how to push our butts because
[39:07.120 --> 39:10.680]  they've watched the North Koreans do it very effectively one would call it
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.520]  brinksmanship or the North Koreans have been able to walk us up to a line
[39:15.520 --> 39:21.200]  focus in the eye and step back I think the Iranians have noted how to do that so
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.920]  the question becomes do we blink do we actually get into them like we've done
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.000]  the North Koreans in the past I think the Iranians are trying to push our
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.680]  you know pushes right to that level of will you back down or not the third
[39:32.680 --> 39:36.280]  issue I think is one we have to consider very carefully is the Iranian
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.920]  people the Iranian people for the most part are pro-reform they are
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.560]  essentially a people under the repressive regime of these molas but
[39:46.560 --> 39:51.560]  kept them down since the 79 so the people themselves are pro-us we need to
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.360]  do everything we can to prompt Iranian people to move forward in a positive way
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.640]  to change their own government frankly are taking military action this point
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.920]  may well make them our adversary as well what we need to do is walk the line
[40:03.920 --> 40:06.760]  here to not give in to the Iranian government but at the same time or
[40:06.760 --> 40:09.680]  encourage the Iranian people to do what's best for them and the rest of the
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.600]  world to move forward with pushing their their their radical regime out and
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.800]  doing something to join the rest of the the Western free world well obviously
[40:18.800 --> 40:22.960]  just with aircraft at high altitude they can target with precision guided
[40:22.960 --> 40:27.400]  munitions and check out most of those boats but then when ships come by there's
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.080]  all sorts of missiles hidden you know by the tens of thousands as you know in
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.880]  those hills overlooking that and when the head of the joint chiefs of staff
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.600]  Dempsey comes out and says okay they can block the straight from the Intel in
[40:42.600 --> 40:45.640]  the research because I know you're really an Iranian expert how are they
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.240]  planning to block it well just send a bunch of barges out and sink them or
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.560]  sink other ships they're coming through oh they have to do something with large
[40:53.560 --> 40:59.320]  ships the large container ships and fuel ships that's the only way they could do
[40:59.320 --> 41:02.280]  it now the the whole idea of having these small weapons hidden within the
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.200]  mountains and hills yeah I get that but we have very sophisticated technology
[41:06.200 --> 41:10.280]  which could take that out and frankly look let's give you two is carpet bombing
[41:10.280 --> 41:13.160]  the coast that's not unheard of and I think we could take out a lot of that
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.880]  what they'd have to do is smaller boats focused on some of these large tankers
[41:17.880 --> 41:20.880]  so we can't be everywhere we need to be regarding the large tankers that's
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.600]  something they would do and you you're an expert in this Alex asymmetrical
[41:24.600 --> 41:28.080]  warfare they would look at the seams within our own defense what where we
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.520]  can't be they would go and so we can't hope to actually protect every single
[41:32.520 --> 41:35.920]  ship going in and out of there therefore we could have to go under the radar so
[41:35.920 --> 41:39.200]  to speak so I think that they've done they've been very effective it's called
[41:39.200 --> 41:42.760]  boat operations frankly I've talked to folks on the inside and they're they're
[41:42.760 --> 41:47.280]  worried to death about these small rubber boats that they can't see coming that
[41:47.280 --> 41:50.560]  could do all sorts of things to large tankers that we can't prevent so I
[41:50.560 --> 41:53.880]  think clearly they would be trying to do exactly what you're proposing there
[41:53.880 --> 41:58.640]  said this kind of under the radar thing with that said I think that there's
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.280]  things that could be done in other parts of of against them at their their
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.640]  infrastructure which would matter but again the military solution would
[42:06.640 --> 42:09.840]  require eventually and I'm gonna say this people are gonna like it boots on
[42:09.840 --> 42:13.320]  the ground in some form you can only do so much remotely you can only do so much
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.640]  with with drones you can only do so much with their friends to actually be
[42:17.640 --> 42:21.080]  effective you've got to put boots on the ground either special operations guys
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.240]  or military forces of some sort to sort things out internally and it's the
[42:25.240 --> 42:31.640]  problem with the inside of Iran like we don't know you don't know where they've
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.160]  hidden everything to be effective out there need a tail like Colonel Shaver
[42:37.160 --> 42:40.640]  stay there your cell phone's been great I know we got you on short notice but
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.640]  it's breaking up a bit let's give it a pause for a moment and see if your
[42:44.640 --> 42:50.200]  cell phone reception comes back here can you hear me now
[42:52.160 --> 42:56.880]  Colonel Shaver can you hear me yeah okay great yeah you started cutting out
[42:56.880 --> 43:00.720]  after you talked about boots on the ground yeah basically we've got to
[43:00.720 --> 43:03.720]  consider the fact that to be effective you've got to go into the interior in
[43:03.720 --> 43:10.160]  some form and so to do that you've got to have special operations guys or
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.760]  somebody there to physically check things out because they the Iranians know
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.800]  how to manipulate how they appear to our what we call ISR our collection
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.560]  systems so and again if we're looking at actually being effective in going out
[43:24.560 --> 43:30.040]  after targets I'm told there's 300 targets we would have to take out to be
[43:30.040 --> 43:33.640]  effective in going after the nuclear program I just don't think we have that
[43:33.640 --> 43:38.960]  level of capability and then plus you have secondary effects of the economic
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.280]  disaster that would be caused by an actual armed conflict with the Iranian
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.080]  so I think both sides I'd like to believe are only saber-rattling I think both
[43:48.080 --> 43:52.560]  sides understand the huge consequences of military action that would hurt both
[43:52.560 --> 43:59.320]  sides immensely we're going to pull this article up Colonel Shafer but a few
[43:59.320 --> 44:05.040]  weeks ago the head of Iranian intelligence for their parliament said
[44:05.040 --> 44:10.440]  that the attack would be taken to Tel Aviv and New York with asymmetrical I
[44:10.440 --> 44:15.680]  guess sleeper cells from your research on Iran do they have the capability to do
[44:15.680 --> 44:22.280]  that and why would Iran you go from not saber-rattling to really saying okay
[44:22.280 --> 44:25.720]  your ships come back through we're going to attack them okay we'll attack you in
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.040]  New York I mean that's really asking for it to say that they're going to attack
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.680]  Tel Aviv in New York I agree and that's where I don't think that the Iranians
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.320]  are willing to go to that level of asymmetric war for against us to dance
[44:39.320 --> 44:44.000]  your first question Alex do I believe they have cells yes I do the Kutsch force
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.720]  and the IRGC are very effective very sophisticated organizations however and
[44:50.720 --> 44:53.040]  you know I talked about this last interview I don't think there is hand
[44:53.040 --> 44:59.800]  handed to do the assassination of the the Saudi Arabian ambassador here as was
[44:59.800 --> 45:03.880]  purported I just don't think that's sloppy but what that said then that I
[45:03.880 --> 45:07.960]  don't think they're willing to go to a use of these capabilities at this point
[45:07.960 --> 45:11.560]  time because frankly they've been gaining everything they need to continue to
[45:11.560 --> 45:16.920]  develop their nuclear program and and work to destabilize the Middle East
[45:16.920 --> 45:20.680]  through their own methods so why would you change your game plan if you're
[45:20.680 --> 45:26.120]  actually being affected in doing what you do to continue to it to to create
[45:26.120 --> 45:32.120]  your nuclear and and be effective in and defending this that the the star of the
[45:32.120 --> 45:35.720]  Syrians because that's part of their their their deal they're trying to
[45:35.720 --> 45:39.400]  defend the Assad government so what would they change I don't think that they
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.520]  actually do gonna be very effective in doing what they can I don't think they're
[45:43.520 --> 45:46.640]  gonna go past saber rattling at this point time well that's good news so then
[45:46.640 --> 45:50.720]  what do you make I mean obviously you can't tell us anything that's classified
[45:50.720 --> 45:54.240]  but most people I talked to in the military high and low say Israel's gonna
[45:54.240 --> 45:58.000]  attack it's only a question of when we have us troops being sent into Israel
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.800]  right now for missile test I'm looking here I'm getting some static but I
[46:03.800 --> 46:14.000]  think that it's very clear that the Iranians don't know yeah that's strange
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  his phone got broken in on that was a cell phone we got him short notice we're
[46:19.000 --> 46:25.920]  getting back on the line but I was gonna get into Ron Paul you know the
[46:25.920 --> 46:31.320]  Huntsman campaign ran an ad making fun of Ron Paul talking about Israel
[46:31.320 --> 46:36.200]  founding Hamas even though that's in the Jerusalem post Harat's Associated Press
[46:36.200 --> 46:42.120]  that's not debatable and that they've also been criticizing him for going
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.680]  along with what the last two chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said what the
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.160]  Secretary of Defense says what the head of the bin Laden unit says but Colonel
[46:52.160 --> 47:03.000]  Schaefer says that it is not a good idea to attack Iran I mean even most of the
[47:03.000 --> 47:13.880]  establishment people say don't do it most of them say don't do it and they
[47:13.880 --> 47:27.120]  are really trying to start this war up right now so my question for him is
[47:27.120 --> 47:34.400]  gonna be it was the word the word he's getting I mean is this leaning more and
[47:34.400 --> 47:41.240]  more towards war I mean obviously it is you've got Iran bluffing and or maybe
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.640]  they're bluffing and the question is will the Israeli and US ships stage some
[47:45.640 --> 47:51.720]  type of Gulf of Tonkin or will there be an accident Colonel I don't know how
[47:51.720 --> 47:54.800]  much of that last question you heard before your line got broken into and
[47:54.800 --> 48:03.440]  cut off but well it sounds like we've got a better connection now what's what's
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.400]  the bottom line I mean are things accelerating towards war or is this
[48:07.400 --> 48:10.840]  just more of the same because all my military sources say Israel's going to
[48:10.840 --> 48:15.480]  strike them the question is when well and that's the issue I think of the day
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.840]  the Israelis told don't understand or I don't think no I don't think we know if
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.000]  our government would back them up on it I think there's been a great deal of
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.080]  ambivalence to use a word from our own White House regarding what they would do
[48:29.080 --> 48:33.280]  on this and I'm not sure if this is by design or by the fact they just don't
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.160]  know what to do look at the White House was asking as late as a couple days
[48:38.160 --> 48:43.640]  before New Year's about the getting assessments of what would happen if we
[48:43.640 --> 48:48.120]  go to war over the straits regarding the economic question so I just don't know
[48:48.120 --> 48:51.600]  how the White House is doing all this I think the Israelis are getting the same
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.040]  kind of we don't know what's going to happen and the other thing about this
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.360]  and again I hear the same thing about the Iranian the Israelis wanting to go
[48:59.360 --> 49:03.720]  forward and Alex you probably noted they actually tested the Jericho 2 missile
[49:03.720 --> 49:07.080]  back in December which by the way just for illicitors understand that if they
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.760]  nuclear capable weapon and that was no accident they actually chose to do the
[49:11.760 --> 49:15.280]  test launch of that because there's rumors that I'm hearing also that the
[49:15.280 --> 49:18.880]  Iranian the Israelis that they feel that they are really are going to be threatened
[49:18.880 --> 49:22.440]  may go ahead and do a first strike of nuclear weapons which would be
[49:22.440 --> 49:27.240]  obviously very bold very dramatic but this will be the consequence of them not
[49:27.240 --> 49:30.360]  you know knowing if we're going to back them up or not because they may feel that
[49:30.360 --> 49:33.760]  their back is against the wall and it's a direct action so that's what you know
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.160]  we we thought of folks do believe it I do believe it but I think the question is
[49:38.160 --> 49:41.800]  it to the Israelis and others will we back them up or not that's something I
[49:41.800 --> 49:47.320]  don't think anybody really knows just incredibly creepy that they've got a
[49:47.320 --> 49:52.800]  bunch of Jericho missiles sitting out there in their silos and out there at
[49:52.800 --> 49:57.920]  their gantries with hundreds of nuclear weapons that Israel's got and how is
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.840]  Israel going to try to sell that politically if they preemptively nuke
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.360]  somebody after all these decades denying they have nukes denying the elephant
[50:06.360 --> 50:10.480]  the room and even if they release their strategic oil supply there's going to be
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.560]  a chain reaction worldwide that's going to cause speculation to go crazy they're
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.680]  talking about $7 a gallon gas kernel right exactly this is this is the issue
[50:19.680 --> 50:23.960]  of this uncertainty this is one of those areas where I think everybody be better
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.480]  off understanding which time who's going to do what I mean one of the the
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.960]  constant criticisms I get from my Facebook friends is you know I keep
[50:31.960 --> 50:34.840]  talking about the fact I do strongly believe this is all stable rattling well
[50:34.840 --> 50:38.280]  you know even when you're stable rattling people can make mistakes during the
[50:38.280 --> 50:41.200]  Cold War we almost went to the Soviet went to war with the Soviets three
[50:41.200 --> 50:44.440]  different times because of misunderstanding so that that could well
[50:44.440 --> 50:48.680]  happen here the biggest thing we can do Alex as a nation is be very clear on
[50:48.680 --> 50:53.240]  what we are willing to do at this point in time I think I agree with Ron Paul's
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.920]  position most on Iran I think that he is most common sense you know the Iranians
[50:57.920 --> 51:00.920]  will probably end up with a weapon if they don't already have the components
[51:00.920 --> 51:06.240]  thereof therefore you have to look at what's doable the idea of attacking them
[51:06.240 --> 51:11.640]  at this point based on the secondary and third-order consequences is probably not
[51:11.640 --> 51:15.640]  the best bet but at the same time we got to have a course of action moving
[51:15.640 --> 51:19.640]  forward which will allow us to protect our allies and either the Israelis aren't
[51:19.640 --> 51:23.040]  feeling like they feel a lot of love from us you have Secretary of Defense
[51:23.040 --> 51:28.160]  you know demanding that they get back to the table so I think a lot of the rhetoric
[51:28.160 --> 51:33.000]  is not well thought and I think by by allowing the rhetoric to be what
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.640]  everybody understands to you know to be to be the case we're not really doing a
[51:36.640 --> 51:40.520]  clear a good job of defending our own interests by the fact that we have we
[51:40.520 --> 51:44.320]  have others act on our behalf and forces to do things we don't want to this is
[51:44.320 --> 51:49.800]  why it's dangerous at the current point how did China and Russia fit into this
[51:49.800 --> 51:54.040]  I mean clearly their posture has gotten the most aggressive it's been since the
[51:54.040 --> 51:59.040]  Cold War there's a thawing there I mean is that one reason Panetta and people are
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.320]  telling Israel hey knock it off well I think that both nations have their own
[52:04.320 --> 52:08.520]  interest and this is one of those things I always tell people always judge an
[52:08.520 --> 52:11.760]  interest a nation by its own interest not about what we think they're doing
[52:11.760 --> 52:15.920]  all interest all nations but they behave in their own best interest the Chinese
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.320]  have a very strong relationship with the Iranians with the Pakistanis and plus
[52:20.320 --> 52:23.560]  frankly they're trying to develop their own influence over the region so they're
[52:23.560 --> 52:26.920]  going to continue to do things which we don't like that's a bottom line the
[52:26.920 --> 52:30.400]  Russians are the same way the Russians are trying to re insinuate themselves as
[52:30.400 --> 52:33.920]  a superpower and they're doing that by essentially what they did during the
[52:33.920 --> 52:37.400]  Cold War proxy warfare so we have to understand that these guys will be
[52:37.400 --> 52:41.360]  working with adversaries of ours at every level so they're doing things by the
[52:41.360 --> 52:45.360]  same as Alex to do what they've always got to try to gain advantage over us
[52:45.360 --> 52:48.680]  in such a way that they their fingerprints are not aren't directly on
[52:48.680 --> 52:52.760]  it the Russians and Chinese both have been helping their ratings behind the
[52:52.760 --> 52:56.720]  scenes let's be brutally honest here the Iranians would not be as far as they
[52:56.720 --> 53:00.360]  are with a nuclear program without direct support from both the Chinese and
[53:00.360 --> 53:04.080]  Russians so we have to understand that and I don't think our own nation our
[53:04.080 --> 53:07.200]  own government the White House has fully understood that even if they talk
[53:07.200 --> 53:10.320]  nicely spoke they are going to listen and they're going to continue to do
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.360]  things to pop their own interest behind the scenes let me let's say there's a
[53:14.360 --> 53:19.800]  clock and midnight is a bombardment of Iran and then all the other horrible
[53:19.800 --> 53:25.760]  things different things that can come out of that but all of them are not nice
[53:25.760 --> 53:31.440]  clearly the hands are moving closer to midnight right I think we're I think
[53:31.440 --> 53:34.760]  we're at 11 o'clock I think we're to start 11 o'clock and this is this is
[53:34.760 --> 53:37.880]  what's going to happen I believe very clearly the thing that's going to prompt
[53:37.880 --> 53:43.280]  the Israelis to act is the moment in time when they believe this is going to
[53:43.280 --> 53:47.080]  decrease the key Alex they believe when the Iranians but when the Israelis
[53:47.080 --> 53:51.680]  believe the Iranians can mount nuclear weapons onto a delivery system this is
[53:51.680 --> 53:54.560]  the thing that I think we need to focus on and I saw what I've been talking to
[53:54.560 --> 53:59.960]  my friends about the Israelis are concerned about the Iranians being
[53:59.960 --> 54:03.960]  able to launch weapons in their direction the moment that the Israelis
[54:03.960 --> 54:07.080]  still threatened it that is say that they think the Iranians can actually put a
[54:07.080 --> 54:11.160]  nuclear weapon a nuclear missile a nuclear tip on a missile that's when
[54:11.160 --> 54:15.200]  they're going to act I think it's a foregone conclusion the Iranians are
[54:15.200 --> 54:18.880]  going to have nuclear weapons I think there's little we can do at this point
[54:18.880 --> 54:22.320]  to prevent that however we can do other things to make sure that if they have
[54:22.320 --> 54:25.320]  nuclear weapons they cannot be used that's going to be the critical juncture
[54:25.320 --> 54:29.360]  and I think that that moment in time is still a few months off maybe up to six
[54:29.360 --> 54:32.600]  to eight months before they're going to be able to do that some of my military
[54:32.600 --> 54:37.280]  sources say Iran that they've been given briefings that Iran does have
[54:37.280 --> 54:42.520]  primitive atomic weapons but is that internal propaganda within the Army no
[54:42.520 --> 54:48.160]  I believe that to be true I believe based on everything I'm told that there's at
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.080]  least two nuclear weapons that is say that there there are the sufficient
[54:52.080 --> 54:56.960]  material that they can put together but with that said you know they are not
[54:56.960 --> 55:01.200]  they can't be used they can't deliver them therefore that is the other thing
[55:01.200 --> 55:05.600]  simply having a nuclear weapon doesn't really give you any give you much you
[55:05.600 --> 55:08.760]  have to be able to use it it's got to be a credible sure and if it doesn't air
[55:08.760 --> 55:12.160]  burst if it doesn't air burst it just blows a crater in the ground I mean
[55:12.160 --> 55:15.160]  right exactly so they don't have a credible way of delivering Alex I think
[55:15.160 --> 55:19.440]  again that's where you we need to look at that if when the the Israelis
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.000]  others believe there's a credible way of delivering a weapon of mass destruction
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.640]  to a target they don't have that at this point in time they've been trying to
[55:25.640 --> 55:29.560]  develop that and I do believe this is the one area I do believe I do agree with
[55:29.560 --> 55:32.720]  Panetta on I think they're at least eight months to a year away from that
[55:32.720 --> 55:38.120]  however I do believe that you know the the cow that the horses have left the
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.160]  barn regarding a weapon I think I have a weapon in the limited time and you've
[55:42.160 --> 55:48.440]  been very gracious to be with us here Colonel specifically looking at what's
[55:48.440 --> 55:56.720]  happening in Iran how does it tie into Pakistan what's behind all of these
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.400]  military strikes on on Pakistani bases they're on the border and if Israel's
[56:02.400 --> 56:08.480]  so worried about Iran having nukes I mean from the numbers I've seen Pakistan's
[56:08.480 --> 56:14.200]  got something like a hundred of them and delivery systems yes I would I can't go
[56:14.200 --> 56:17.600]  on to all the deals but there's at least a hundred nuclear warheads that the
[56:17.600 --> 56:21.520]  Pakistanis have used developed let me say something else frightening they got
[56:21.520 --> 56:25.240]  enough material to probably create another another hundred and the other
[56:25.240 --> 56:28.920]  thing yes they have delivery systems so I could be honest with you I've been
[56:28.920 --> 56:32.600]  working on task forces looking at this for the past five years and I think this
[56:32.600 --> 56:35.520]  is a much more worrisome target because of the central government central
[56:35.520 --> 56:40.400]  Pakistani government falls they have not only weapons they have delivery systems
[56:40.400 --> 56:43.600]  for them and I think that's something we you know the current White House is
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.760]  like talking about and you know the radicals within Pakistan continue to
[56:49.760 --> 56:52.760]  make headway and destabilizing that government so I believe it's only a
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.280]  matter of time before that government becomes essentially a failed state and
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.320]  you're going to have over a decade or an over a decade of weapons that we will be
[57:00.320 --> 57:03.600]  worried about and I can tell you that is one thing we are very well the
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.640]  Indians are also worried about that Alex I mean that is a serious issue one of
[57:07.640 --> 57:10.880]  which is I think is as important about more important than the the Iranian
[57:10.880 --> 57:16.960]  issue well why doesn't Israel seem concerned about that because I mean
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.080]  what they've got medium-range missiles in Pakistan well that's the thing I mean
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.160]  they believe they're trusting us better for better for worse for and having us
[57:25.160 --> 57:28.880]  deal with the Pakistani this is one of those things that I keep talking about
[57:28.880 --> 57:33.000]  regarding Afghanistan the issue is not Afghanistan Alex is Pakistan always has
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.720]  been and it's something I think we continue to pretend otherwise and this
[57:36.720 --> 57:40.400]  is why you know there's been some folks doing a policy review of the region
[57:40.400 --> 57:43.640]  there'll be some meetings on the Hill next week which I think you probably see
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.160]  some results out of but frankly a lot of the folks I talked to understand
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.680]  clearly that the real issue needs to be Pakistan on Afghanistan and frankly you
[57:51.680 --> 57:55.600]  know the Iranians and what they're doing are as important but we've got we
[57:55.600 --> 57:59.200]  already know that there's a fleet of the nuclear weapons nuclear tip missiles
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.920]  which are available to radicals if they continue to push and destabilize the
[58:03.920 --> 58:09.240]  Pakistani sure briefly what do you make of the demonization by of Ron Paul for
[58:09.240 --> 58:12.640]  pointing out what you and countless other analysts said that that whole thing
[58:12.640 --> 58:18.320]  with the Iranians wanting to kill the Saudi ambassador I mean you're saying
[58:18.320 --> 58:21.800]  that's baloney they're attacking Ron Paul for that let me let me point out two
[58:21.800 --> 58:25.400]  things to you Alex remember right when it was announced they kept saying we're
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.560]  gonna have more information coming out well I'll tell you what Colonel will you
[58:28.560 --> 58:31.640]  do five more minutes with us yeah sure okay okay we're gonna go to break and
[58:31.640 --> 58:36.880]  come back and get into that and so many questions regardless the world's getting
[58:36.880 --> 58:40.240]  into a very crazy position
[58:40.240 --> 58:49.080]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.280]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:29.800]  so there's been an amazing demonization of Ron Paul for reading the newspaper I
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.880]  guess Jerusalem Post and others admit Israel set up Hamas as a counterbomb
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.560]  balance to the Iranian Hezbollah they demonized him in a TV ad Huntsman did
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:45.000]  other TV ads saying he's crazy for just saying that that plot was obviously made
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.720]  up to have you know some used car salesmen kill the ambassador but there
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.280]  were just countless analysts on top I mean not just Colonel Schaefer on TV the
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.080]  former head of the Bush administration's unit on Iran said it was
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.240]  preposterous so I guess the mainstream media counts on people being dumb to
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.640]  sit there and tell them that Ron Paul is crazy when all he's doing is repeating
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.040]  what most of the joint Jesus staff have said what the former head of the
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.600]  Israeli Mossad said when when when when Netanyahu fired him last year I mean for
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.440]  me knowing basic news Ron Paul's just mainline common sense Colonel Schaefer
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.360]  let me point out two points to back you up on this first if you recall everybody
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.360]  it was supposedly briefed on the classified information on this plot said
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.080]  oh you're gonna see more coming out over the next few weeks showing that we're
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.160]  correct have you seen a single follow-up article showing that this was the
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.880]  correct that this was true not not a one so that premise that it was you know
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.560]  something more to it has been proven false by the administration's own failure
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.480]  to prevent provide additional clarification and evidence so there you
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.920]  go first point second point is that look I've talked to Bruce Bruce fine I
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.000]  consider Bruce fine a close friend Bruce is one of Ron Paul's senior advisors
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.680]  and from talking to Bruce and others would they look at Paul is trying to
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.360]  actually get what he believes out to be what is fact not what is propaganda but
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.560]  is fact and I got to tell you from talking to Bruce and others you know
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.800]  there's no doubt that Ron Paul would use military force at a very severe way
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.480]  against our adversaries when you have clear intel indicating if something's
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.200]  going on but Alex you and I both know intelligence community has been politicized
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.800]  by whoever is in charge the Bush White House the Obama White House doesn't
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.800]  matter you have people who are policy types trying to forge into intelligence
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.320]  around the policy instead of the other way Paul is trying to get it to be where
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.280]  it was where you take the intel and you make your decisions based on the intel
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.840]  not on what your wishful thinking based on your political perspective is and I
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.720]  think that's what the issue is with top I run Paul's get the slant well he
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.600]  certainly is I mean it looks like the media all the other politicians are
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:02.800]  getting behind a strike on Iran yeah in in closing what's the time frame that
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.960]  that we could see this escalate or briefly what are a few of the ways that
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.600]  things could get triggered here well any miscalculation regarding the military
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.200]  you could see a exchange of fire which could could escalate quickly the thing
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.600]  is I think the Iranians clearly would still lose in that scenario the Iranians
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.480]  want to have the nuclear weapons system which is deliverable I didn't say that
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.400]  they could use they're not there yet Alex so what we're talking I think we're
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.520]  gonna see saber-revelling for another six months we're talking about the fall
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.760]  before the Iranians actually have something that could be used to deliver
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.520]  indicator device so I think we're talking about saber-revelling through the
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.400]  spring unless a miscalculation occurs but I think we're gonna be revisiting this
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.640]  very seriously towards the fall once a delivery system is available to them so
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.120]  I predict more saber-revelling unless somebody loses their cool and does
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.480]  something bad at least through this song but right on time that's the October
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.840]  surprise and that would help Netanyahu in an election if the war was happening
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.120]  right then it would help Obama people rally around the government when
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.440]  there's a war even if the war is a fraud I'm in fact that's the word I'm getting
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.280]  is that they've been looking at it but that but that it could be an October
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.720]  surprise I agree with your assessment I like that could well be the case wow
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.240]  well Colonel Schaefer I look forward to having you back up soon via Skype I know
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.640]  you're gonna be on with Judge Andrew Napolitano later in the week breaking
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.840]  this down more Operation Darkheart.com your best-selling book breaking so much
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.480]  of what happened in Afghanistan down thanks for spending time with us great
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.000]  thank you Alex all right there goes Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.200]  we're gonna come back hit other news Wayne Madsen to give us his perspective
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.680]  on Iran and he's another very well-read person on that front coming up I want to
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.480]  get into some of the election news Ron Paul news a New World Order news straight
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.800]  ahead we'll do that also want to recap first some of the other Iran news stay
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.040]  with us we'll be right back Kurt Nemo's article
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.440]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I

[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.840]  already set up all their new computers for years with that and soon it won't be
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.080]  a thumbprint or even a special number it will be a face scan and they're coming

[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.120]  going to be a mark in the face or in the hand well what do you think your own
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:21.920]  biometric outline basically is but even if God didn't exist the point is the
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.280]  globalists are trying to play God by setting all of this up and we do have
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:32.960]  the article by Kurt Nemo that breaks down the fact that if a war does kick
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.840]  off with Iran it could lead to a world war three type scenario war in the
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.280]  Middle East now appears imminent as the United States Britain and the European
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.040]  Union and Israel put the finishing touches on an embargo of Iran and the
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.440]  facto declaration of war see that's one thing Iran may be forced into this and
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.520]  warships steam towards the Persian Gulf consider the following recent
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:01.640]  developments US Israel war game in Persian Gulf on Friday the US and Israel
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.920]  announced they plant a massive military exercise the Persian Gulf and attempt to
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:12.360]  confront Iran in their own words the exercise dub austere challenge 12 and
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.640]  they're going to make Iran austere cutting off half their fuel will include
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.560]  the participation of thousands of us Israeli soldiers and we'll test
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.200]  multiple air defense systems against incoming missiles and rockets for when
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.760]  Iran's attacked and it'll be on the media how dare Iran fire back only the
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.440]  worst fire back now I've seen police in the US type it in police chief says
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.760]  fetal position assault on officer they actually say if you get in a fetal
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:43.440]  position it's assault and it's resistant so I mean if they walk up and say take
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.640]  open your shirt I'm shooting you with a shotgun if you don't say thank you God
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:53.640]  open and say kill me and then say I worship you five times and you're evil
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.960]  I mean of course I'm being absurd here but that's how ridiculous this has gotten
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.640]  few months ago they were kicking people and pepper spraying them balled up
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.800]  protesters and they said yeah well that's what they deserve that's a form of
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.640]  resistance ah yes you're supposed to say here's my teeth kick them out they're
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.040]  like good you get a metal and knock your teeth out don't worry the bankers are
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.840]  gonna knock your dollar out knock you out with sodium fluoride everybody gets
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:26.200]  to get hurt here in the new world order on January 2nd during the last military
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:33.680]  exercise Iran tested the quadir missile a long-range C2 short missile and the
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.880]  surface-to-surface nor missile the nor is an advanced radar evading target
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.000]  seeking guided and controlled missile can easily find his target destroy it I
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.440]  are in a reported Iran has announced a new war game and that's going to coincide
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:56.880]  with British warships US and Israel including destroyers that are now all
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:03.480]  converging in the area French and Russian warships are off Syria basically
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.640]  threatening each other Ron Paul points out that sanctions are the first step to
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:13.240]  war these are serious blockades and embargoes are about to set up oil prices
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.280]  have already risen to 113 dollars and 20 cents a barrel because of this Iran
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.560]  missile-based propaganda now that Iran's Ahmed Deniz Yad is visiting Latin
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.240]  America it is credited rumor that Iran is building intermediate range missile
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.240]  launch pads and a base on the peninsula in Venezuela has resurfaced it was
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.880]  initially floated by the German newspaper Die Welt and subsequently
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.920]  boosted by the Jerusalem post a documented neocon propaganda operation
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.040]  the post posted the story as well the story brings to mind the Cuban Missile
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.600]  Crisis of October 62 but those were real missiles according to Die Welt store the
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.440]  Iranians paid tens of millions in cash for the base that would be used to fire
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.800]  missiles in the United States after Iran is attacked it was reported the
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.760]  Revolutionary Guard controlled engineering group Katam Al Anabi is helping
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:18.240]  build the site and it just goes on from there now look at this article here out
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:25.760]  of the Washington Post that I just mentioned Obama wants internet ID
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:34.240]  FCC's head proposed broadband reform as well and that the internet ID people to
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.000]  quote make the biggest users pay they say you're making it more cost more for
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.360]  those that don't use as much they this is how they they always sell new taxes
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.680]  consumption taxes this way globalist corporate taxes to companies you name
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:53.160]  it it's been high-tech driving this economy that would be in a complete
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:14:01.720]  cardiac arrest for the last 14 years or so 13 years or so since 1999 if we didn't
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.640]  have this this high-tech economy and to let government put taxes on the internet
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.840]  which they're starting to push its state and federal level and international and
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.720]  to let corporations start charging you more you already get charged more for
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.680]  the type of connection or data plan you get on a cell phone on a computer any of
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.640]  this you're already paying for it but how do they start in the 20s with
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.720]  driver's license which were commercial license they told the public the trucks
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.800]  are tearing up the roads you pay for they use the roads to make money they're
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.720]  in commerce let's start taxing them the public said yeah get them and by the
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.440]  50s they made everybody a driver's license to start paying now they use it
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:51.920]  to totally track us in a Monday speech federal communications chairman
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.560]  outlined a draft proposal that would reform the Commission's lifeline program
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.680]  to include provisions to encourage broadband adoption the program currently
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.320]  aimed at providing affordable telephone service to low income Americans is
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.040]  supported by the Universal Service Fund the program is outdated focused on
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.520]  phone service when high-speed internet has become our vital communications
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.120]  platform but but buried in there they have the other part in his remarks the
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.840]  chairman said the program has been successful but has also been plagued
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.160]  with problems of accountability and efficiency multiple service providers
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.120]  are often supplying lifeline subsidies to the same households he said because
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.200]  there is no centralized system they want an ID to address the issue the draft
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.480]  proposal creates a national database of lifeline users prevent duplicate of
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.920]  billing and you know that's going to be used for internet ID it's also sets a
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.680]  budget for lifeline aimed to connecting eligible consumers with staying
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.720]  within budget oh tracking you and requires the participating companies be
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.720]  subject to independent audits every two years I think the government's just
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:59.000]  going to give you a free phone line for free it's going to be used at the FCC
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.200]  takeover the web the chairman said the FCC work would deal with existing
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.240]  broadband adoption programs and a pilot program so basically they're going to
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.360]  expand that and of course the FCC's also announced they're going to regulate
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.880]  broadband a broadcast you know internet wireless and you're going to have quote
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:25.880]  just like Europe already does in many areas filters on hateful material hate
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:31.200]  hacking gambling porn and there's there's one other that they have in these
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:37.040]  databases and guess what info wars is listed in many databases under hate and
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:43.040]  under hacking I've even seen this listed under gambling there's no gambling
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.040]  going on so you go to a library go to a college you go to a military base you
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.920]  go to a train station that's got free broadband which taxpayers are paying
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.960]  for government doesn't give you something free unless they want the
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:04.240]  control to set the precedent so that's what's going on on that front now I
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.560]  mentioned this earlier you can go up to info wars.com and see it and I also
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.840]  played the CBS clip and I want to cue that back up if we can later we're going
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:20.080]  to have some clips in the third hour more clips of Obama speeches saying I
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.680]  don't need Congress I want to do things without Congress I'll do whatever I can
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.760]  yeah launch wars without Congress shut down power plants without Congress and
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.080]  outside of law make us adopt you know all these new green regulations that are
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:40.120]  about federal control not about greening I mean it just goes on and on CBS
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.760]  reporter blatantly excludes Ron Paul from coverage despite the fact that Paul is
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.920]  surging and Romney sliding gap now only 15 points despite the fact that Ron Paul
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.120]  is polling in second place in New Hampshire and rapidly closing the gap on
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.240]  Mitt Romney according to the latest polls one CBS reporter did her best to
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:05.880]  convince viewers that Paul does not even exist it's a familiar picture for Paul
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.760]  supporters who have had to watch over and over as mainstream media and again
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.280]  I've got to get all my writers in myself to stop calling them mainstream media
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:21.040]  mainstream whores, prostitutes, corporate paid deceivers, zombie control
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.160]  systems, certified twisters and deceivers, dissimblers I mean I don't know
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:33.760]  den of viper media, dinosaur devil media, dinosaur tyrant media, terrible lizard
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.800]  media I don't know it's a familiar picture for Paul supporters who have had
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:44.160]  to watch over and over again as mainstream media that is deceivers
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.120]  talking heads and pundits have consistently either laughed off the
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:53.840]  Texas congressman's chances for GOP nominee or simply excluded Paul from
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.480]  their coverage all together and again we're going to play that clip in a
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.000]  moment we played earlier however within the past few weeks the networks were
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.040]  forced to begin taking Paul seriously as he began consistently polling in first
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.160]  or second ahead of the Iowa caucuses eventually finishing third and what was
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.920]  easily a three-way tie yeah that was clear fraud there that's not been
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.320]  confirmed but it was actually general they had to have a gentleman's agreement
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:25.600]  and precinct after precinct and say that Paul got less and Santorum got more we
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.560]  come back we'll play that clip going into New Hampshire and ahead of two
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.940]  debates this weekend Paul was polling in strong second as he has been for some
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.080]  time however that did not stop CBS political correspondent Jan Crawford
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:43.160]  from showing graphics and talking about recent polling without even mentioning
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.520]  Paul's numbers or even that he was involved in the race at all yeah they
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:54.320]  have Romney 43, Gennrich 9, Huntsman 7, Santorum 6 and of course you've got Ron
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:58.800]  Paul putting on the poll 10 to 13 points some point some polls only eight
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.080]  points behind Romney but no one will tell you that you all know that Berkey

[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:11.220]  theme over and over again but you've seen every major TV network when Ron
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:15.560]  Paul comes in second or first place or third they just don't even show him in
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.840]  the running and John Stewart a few months ago famously you know put all
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:26.720]  that together in a compendium just to show the arrogance and how left right
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.520]  center the entire establishment demonizes Ron Paul and demonizes
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:37.200]  anybody else that doesn't want foreign banks robbing us blind and setting up
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:43.240]  paramilitary police on street corners fondling our genitals TSA now fondling
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:47.280]  people all over the country on the streets and I get calls all the time
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.280]  and look it up it's in the local news where there they are and I'm gonna get
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.760]  back into that in a moment New Jersey will pay you $1,000 to rat out your
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:04.200]  neighbors for guns it's here folks as the economy implodes more and more of this
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.520]  nation is is is gonna live off of ratting out their neighbors but here's
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:14.920]  again that CBS piece we have an article on info wars calm about it CBS
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.480]  reporter blatantly excludes Ron Paul from coverage doesn't show that he was in
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:25.000]  second place here's the clip who polls in single digits here is looking to give
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.440]  Romney a run in the Granite State after his near victory in Iowa as for the
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:36.720]  losers in Texas there was the graphic on CBS news and you watch the whole
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.720]  news piece no mention of Ron Paul it's like he's from the planet Mars he's
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:46.080]  rising in the polls Romney's dropping and they're desperately ignoring him
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:51.400]  because they know he could win oh my gosh it's it's just off the charts insane
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.640]  now we're gonna cover this more on the nightly news this evening but this is a
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:03.160]  big deal it's up at info wars calm New Jersey will pay you $1,000 to destroy
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:14.440]  the Second Amendment this is totally disgusting it's the citizen informant
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:18.960]  without in citizen informants tyrants could never retain the kind of power
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.240]  they wield in fact without citizen informants totalitarian movements would
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.560]  never gain traction but there's always little little minions who want some
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.640]  uniform and want to oppress people and always little minions that want to toady
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.880]  after him or say always nash their teeth later this is why every functional
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.120]  oligarchy throughout history has implemented programs designed to
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.960]  encourage the development of common spies using the promise of monetary reward
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.280]  and collective recognition sadly there are many in our society that would
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.480]  gladly sell out their closest friends and family to the tortures of
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.600]  authoritarian bureaucracy for nothing more than a firm pat on the head and a
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:04.280]  few fiat dollars if there was ever more deranged a lot of bottom feeding
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:10.280]  opportunist scum the citizen informant is the very essence of it with the
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.760]  implementation of the see something say something program and the increasing
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.720]  drive by the White House to institute community watch efforts to route out
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.520]  extremists that's the government's main not crime not even far and far and
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.080]  terror it's domestic grips told you that years ago but now it's public show
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:33.880]  case quite clearly in in strategic outlines like the empowering local
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.040]  partners to prevent violent extremism in the United States but now in New
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.960]  Jersey and other areas they're offering a thousand dollars for every person you
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:49.720]  turn in who owns guns and alt dash market dot com originally wrote this
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:55.560]  article excellent piece breaking it down and we have a clip of the video this is
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:00.560]  going on all over the country but here's New Jersey play that clip
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:11.520]  no more guns eight seven seven in WK guns I'm there Corey Booker and I like so
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.840]  many in our city are just saying enough we have had a significant reduction in
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.520]  shootings in our city but it is still too many there are small group of people
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.400]  in our city to think they can walk around with guns it is unacceptable but we
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.160]  can't just wish this will stop we can't just hope this will stop we as
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.400]  individuals have to do something about it so we have a program in our city
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.320]  right now that's completely anonymous and we will give you cash a thousand
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.680]  dollars to anyone who calls our anonymous tip line give us the
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.960]  information about who is carrying a gun if we don't even have to have a
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.920]  conviction we arrest that individual and simply get that gun off the streets you

[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.840]  ads on television waving money around what about people carrying guns to
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.920]  protect themselves who own businesses who don't want to get knocked on the head

[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:31.080]  people move here like the carpet cleaner 12 13 years ago saw a shotgun for I had
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:36.320]  children on the rack in my studio at my home and the guy flipped out and ran off

[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:03.320]  with our focus on this Iran situation because it's definitely escalating and
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.400]  you heard Colonel Schaefer last hour that it's never been closer to war than
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:13.240]  it is now but that he thinks it'll be an October surprise and then more of this
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:17.280]  is saber-rattling but once it kicks off it could lead to a wider regional war
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.600]  with the Chinese involved and World War 3 that's why we've got the article up
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:28.120]  at info wars.com right now alert Iran crisis headed for World War 3 that
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.760]  mean we can't turn it around it's like if I got in the car today as we're
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.080]  driving to Dallas I could turn around before I got there but it's headed that
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.680]  direction it's like telling some young teenager who's robbing houses and using
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:44.280]  hard drugs you're headed to the penitentiary you're dead you can still
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:52.240]  turn it around but before we go to our next guest on this subject Wayne Madsen
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.360]  before I introduce our guest I want to remind you that we have the book that
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.040]  deliberate dumbing down of America back in print it's been out of print for over
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:06.520]  a year and that original book is out of print forever this is a updated and

[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:52.080]  submarine anti-submarine warfare in the Navy before that and he's written for
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.640]  some of the biggest publications in the country like the Atlanta Journal
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.040]  Constitution Philadelphia Enquirer Houston Chronicle Miami Herald Wayne Madsen
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.560]  report calm is where he you can find all of his great work and he joins us to
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.600]  give us his take on Iran this spectrum this cornucopia of things that are
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.960]  happening sir break that down for us and then you know give us your take on
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.120]  other things that are happening geopolitically right now Wayne Madsen
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:24.240]  okay Alex well I actually happened to have spoken to an old friend of mine the
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:31.200]  other evening who was a very big advisor on US policy in Iran the individual
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.800]  speaks fluent Farsi the language of Iran as well as or do the major language of
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.360]  Pakistan and Dari which is spoken in Afghanistan and and his take on things
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:48.440]  was he is very much afraid that the US will participate in some sort of
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:54.800]  military action before the election now my feeling on this is talking to some
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.760]  other people is what will that entail will that be over military action or
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:07.040]  will it be covert US support for a Anglo-Israeli and possibly French attack
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:12.920]  on Iran that that avoids the issue of the body bags and coffins coming back to
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.400]  October Air Force Base during the election year but also basically disarms those
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:24.320]  Republican critics of Obama who say he's not doing enough against Iran so he can
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.200]  have basically have his cake and eat it too that there are some real problems
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:35.640]  with this however and I add the French in there that's a caveat Nicholas
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:42.960]  Sarkozy is also running for reelection and but in his case he may see French support for military
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.920]  attack is something that can benefit him he's very far down in the polls and he
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:53.720]  may try to play that nationalistic card in France against especially against
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:59.800]  Marine Le Pen who's running for president from his right so the British though
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:04.440]  you can pretty much count them in the Israelis count them in the US may play
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.920]  a role but it will be one where Obama can say we support the action but look no
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.400]  US military troops are involved you know the other day Obama announced a new
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.160]  strategy for the US military he's shifting focus from the Middle East to
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:26.240]  East Asia and he met with the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:32.440]  Staff of the Army got this is a Pentagon plan he's on board with it and that's
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:37.040]  just a public announcement of what China already knows so-called US bases our
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.440]  countries been taken over being built now even in Australia that's why the
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.240]  president of China as you know a month ago said prepare for war with the United
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.920]  States I mean that was in the major headlines this is getting crazy well
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:56.040]  and here's the problem China and two of our allies in East Asia South Korea and
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:00.840]  Japan have already announced they're not going to abide by these sanctions
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:06.800]  against the Iranian oil shipment which are going to be kicking in soon they've
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.960]  announced they're not going to participate they both are all three
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.400]  countries China Japan and South Korea rely heavily on Iranian oil exports and
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:21.080]  what they get in what Iran gets in return for that is is refined gasoline
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:27.680]  because the Iranian refining capacity has really been hurt by US sanctions
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:33.080]  course we know that the Chinese company Albertan tried to get in there and and
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.160]  improve on those capabilities but yeah no they had it under Bush set up where
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:41.120]  only they were allowed to sell them the equipment so just she shows that they're
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.520]  always lecturing us about be for war you're with the Iranians meanwhile
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.040]  they're they're in business with them but but specifically Wayne looking at
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.600]  this right now what do you make of the Israeli US British fleet steaming back
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.200]  in the Strait of Hormuz what do you make of the Iranians a week ago saying
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.840]  you better not come back through there this is your final warning what do you
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:05.840]  make of Iran talking about asymmetrical warfare in Tel Aviv in New York why are
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.280]  they saber-rattling so much more now well there they're having to placate the
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:18.240]  war hawks in Washington London Tel Aviv Jerusalem and Paris and and also
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:24.640]  people like Ahmadinejad has to placate his war hawks in Iran but I think there
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.780]  was a little bit of a monkey wrench thrown into these plans when the US
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:35.560]  Navy rescued about a half dozen or so or about a dozen Iranian fishermen who
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.760]  have been captured by Somali pirates now the US Navy and the Iranian Navy and
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.240]  also the Iranian Revolutionary Guard do maintain protocols to avoid incidents
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.840]  in the in the Gulf and these have been very successful so there are
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:55.760]  communications constantly between US Navy in the Gulf and the Iranian Navy in
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:02.080]  military and I think the fact that the US Navy rescued these dozen Iranian
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:07.440]  fishermen really was probably not very popular among some of the the Warhawk
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:12.040]  Neocons here in Washington they probably would have rather had the Somali
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:16.200]  pirates eat those eat those Iranian fishermen but I think that there's
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:21.920]  wiser heads wiser heads are prevailing right now especially in the US Navy the
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.640]  fifthly the Bahrain and they have to deal with Iranians on it on a daily basis
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.400]  and obviously they don't want to see any kind of war because they know you know
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:37.200]  our fleet is pretty vulnerable to Iranian missile attacks over there as you
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:42.920]  mentioned asymmetric warfare Iran has a lot of influence in Iraq and look not
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.360]  all the US troops have left Iraq there's still at that certain bases there we
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.080]  still have the private security contractors there we thought a whole
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.120]  load of State Department personnel there and these these people would all be
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.400]  sitting back to the Iranians decided to activate their their allies in Iraq so
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.320]  the Pentagon probably more than anyone knows anyone else knows what the state
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:11.720]  gets the at these Warhawks get their way now Wayne I want to put out a nuance
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.320]  statement here because our our detractors will always do what they do
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.720]  they'll always build straw man that don't really represent who we are what we
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:26.240]  are and then you know go out and have a sword battle with the with the straw man
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.120]  and claim that they've defeated it but if you go back into October to November it
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:37.000]  was all over the Israeli news all over the European news that a strike was
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  imminent the Washington Times reported that Netanyahu wanted it he believes
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.080]  politically that'll make him popular and then right on time all of my military
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.320]  sources said yeah it's it's on we're being told get ready yeah move the
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:53.640]  troops to Kuwait out of Iraq get ready to back up the attack getting you know
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:59.680]  troops covertly into Israel now admitted months later and the point is they
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:05.480]  were moving and green lighting so we said get on air call Congress tell them
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.600]  don't do this get pressure on the military listen to the former admirals
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.680]  former chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mullen who said it was a disaster the
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.440]  former head of Mossad who Netanyahu fired because he wouldn't go along with
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.560]  this this is not a good idea even the other top globalist are having a fight
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:26.160]  on this and then they they spin it and say oh we're always hearing about war
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.480]  with Iran it's never going to happen and then now it's in the news that they're
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.680]  moving towards a strike Israel says they may strike but the establishment puts
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.640]  out their operatives to say oh that's ridiculous there's not gonna be a war
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:44.000]  so that we can't build opposition same thing with the NDA a the first month
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.520]  they have a debate saying it doesn't affect citizens then later they say you
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:51.800]  bet it does after they'd already passed it then Obama signed it he said he
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:54.880]  wouldn't sign it to kill opposition because well he's not going to sign it
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.200]  anyways these are tactics you've learned them I've learned them you've been on
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.960]  Capitol Hill for decades I see on c-span there writing notes during these
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:07.840]  hearings but the public gets fooled by these tricks so they keep acting you
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.760]  pushing for war while separately saying it's asinine that they're going to have
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.880]  a war as a psychological tactic so that we can't build an opposition to it then
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.520]  if we're successful and back off war for the third or fourth time as we know five
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.440]  years ago Cheney was about to do it attack our own ships New Yorker magazine
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:31.960]  Sy Hirsch is the same thing then when we're successful backing them off oh see
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.920]  there was never a threat can you do you agree with how I'm breaking down their
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.800]  psychological operation or psiop and and do you concur with what I'm saying well
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:46.720]  of course and we have the master of this cognitive dissonance catch on steam as
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.360]  the basically the propaganda's are for the Obama White House so I mean look you
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.800]  look at all his friends and colleagues and even his wife the man the powers he's
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:04.200]  he's the person who's dreamed up all these you know Arab Spring revolts and
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.840]  he's seen George Soros type color revolutions all around the world and
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:16.960]  some of them obviously the one in Iran failed the one in Tunisia and Egypt were
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:21.400]  successful those they're probably ruining the fact that they even supported
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:28.680]  the one in Egypt but I think you're correct yeah they they there's a this is
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:35.360]  a propaganda most of this is a propaganda war where they're just trying to get
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.040]  into people's heads make them think something when in fact they're doing
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:46.040]  something entirely different from your decades of research and I respect your
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:49.440]  analysis your view on this what do you think's gonna end up happening with Iran
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:54.720]  or what are what are the two or three different probable scenarios that we're
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:00.000]  going down well we already know that the New York Times the once again as it
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.160]  as it is it's want that has put out this false information about Iran trying to
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.960]  develop a nuclear weapon this is the same nonsense that Judy Miller was
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.120]  putting out when she worked for the New York Times we're seeing it play out
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:19.880]  again there's been realness really no change in that program it's still the
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:28.440]  you know CIA came out in 03 with a new finding that Iran did have some nuclear
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:34.320]  weapons the intentions but it is basically a peaceful nuclear power
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.080]  program now but there's still pushing this meme that Iran wants a nuclear
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.360]  weapon and as long as they do that they're going to have support from some
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:45.840]  of these political republicans stay there I want to hear where you think all

[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:14.200]  because there's a war on for your mind okay we've got Wayne with us till five
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:18.520]  after then it's gonna be your phone calls and a bunch of news for the rest of
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.720]  the third hour but going back to Wayne Madsen investigative journalist former
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.680]  officer at the National Security Agency and very secretive areas joins us with
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:34.480]  his perspective on Iran Colonel Schaefer was on during the last hour and he said
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.680]  yes and he hasn't talked like this before he said yes it's moving in the
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:44.560]  direction towards an attack on Iran as an October surprise but that's not foregone
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:49.800]  conclusion cooler heads may prevail in the military and I'm getting that that's
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:55.640]  basically what you're implying but you really can't divorce what's going on
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:00.120]  with Iran and the favor rattling from the presidential campaign we we only have
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:05.320]  there's only two Republican candidates who are fed fed against you go going to
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.880]  war with Iran and that's Ron Paul and somebody we hardly ever hear about he
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:14.640]  gets less attention at all that buddy Rover from Louisiana but all the rest of
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.640]  them are trying to outdo one another on it you know who's gonna nuke Tehran
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:26.280]  first especially Rick Santorum and I have a story up today well two stories
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:32.040]  up about Santorum why he has surged ahead he is as I mean the man was on the
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.000]  board of directors for the Israel project which is a totally pro-lacud
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.640]  think tank here in Washington with the pockets and and and his two advisors
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.880]  two teeth foreign policy advisors are none other than Michael Latine and
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:52.200]  Richard Pearl if you remember who those individuals were they were the chief
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:57.600]  architects and cheerleaders for the US intervention in Iraq and they're
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:03.160]  certainly at the forefront of those were calling for the overthrow of the quote
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:12.000]  unquote moolahs in Iran so continuing along those lines are we closer to war
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.040]  well I think I think what we're going to see here is it's all going to be based
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:24.080]  on the presidential campaign if Romney of course is also called for US troops
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.200]  because not only go back into Iraq but get into it with the Iranians but you
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:34.160]  know we know that Mitt Romney is a virtual I mean this guy will bend with
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:39.800]  the wind a finger up and in the air and sees which way the wind is blowing but
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:47.200]  I don't see Romney if Romney's the nominee I think that this war talk will diminish but if
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:52.240]  it's somebody like Santorum or or a Newt Gingrich who's also in bed with these
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:59.560]  Warhawks then I think we're going to probably see Obama try to get from
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:05.080]  under the issue by at least covertly supporting an Anglo-Israeli and maybe
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:10.160]  French attack on the Iranian you mentioned that the US troops now are now
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:17.640]  stationed in Israel you know and there is especially for anti-missile defense
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:23.880]  there so I think we're we've got the baseline for either over US military
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:29.400]  action or covert action using the Israeli, British and French as sort of as
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:35.760]  a cover for us but but I think all this depends on on the presidential election
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:42.240]  because Iran because of this this constant drumpy for war by these mostly
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:48.240]  Republican candidates Obama's going to have to respond somehow to that. Well
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:52.120]  you're right we're gonna come back in a moment for five more minutes and I want
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:57.280]  to get your take on Jesse Ventura the reason I've covered this quite a bit is
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:03.440]  that it's now been confirmed to be a complete lie and you know they hired
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:09.120]  Ventura at MSNBC and then fired him but kept him under contract and threatened
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:13.720]  to sue him if he talked bad about the war he was under contract for three years
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:17.280]  now they're just trying to assassinate his character claiming he's reckless
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.760]  driving in California when he's in Minnesota that that was a fraud not now
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:26.680]  claiming he says he loves it when troops die that awake in front of people I
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.840]  mean this comes right out of central casting he's totally denied it and is
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.600]  of course gonna sue everybody involved and he is he's not litigious but he will
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:41.480]  sue people he's well known for it but Fox News and others just don't care you
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:48.920]  are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:58.200]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but

[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:11.160]  there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans

[01:59:53.320 --> 02:00:00.760]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:30.800]  Alex Jones something like Jesse Ventura being attacked always by
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:36.120]  Rupert Murdoch outfits the last month with patently fake stories and then
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:40.320]  when he threatens to sue them they just remove it they don't attract I have been
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.760]  at the receiving end of this because you see as a constitutionalist as a Ron
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:51.080]  Paul type libertarian patriot I'm what Fox News hates because they're the
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:56.640]  fake version to a certain extent of what I am or what Ron Paul is so they need to
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:02.280]  hold that into the spectrum to control the right wing if you use that outdated
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:07.320]  stupid term I'm into freedom not about left and right but they see us as right
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.160]  wing so they hate us they want to basically say that restaurant across the
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.840]  street don't eat there they've got cockroaches the size of your Chihuahua
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:20.000]  and it's not true you know the Fox News has the cockroaches my business my
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.080]  operation doesn't the my business is liberty and freedom their businesses
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.480]  globalization and tyranny same thing with the leftist control arms they're
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.520]  there to be gatekeepers on the left Ford Foundation the rest of it Wayne in
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:37.360]  closing and I saw this is key with Ventura right as he goes into Mexico right
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:41.320]  as they know he doesn't have cell phones till he gets to his place in Baja and
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.440]  then that Skype they come out and say yeah he was at a bar to telling a
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:51.160]  family he's glad their son died so I knocked him out and right as the guy has
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:56.080]  a book come out then I looked him up and what's creepy is he's tied in with what
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.200]  you just said Richard Pearl and he's setting up a domestic group to deal
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.360]  with domestic extremists and trained police and Dallas nationwide I mean I
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.160]  guess they said okay here's your first order and we're gonna make you a big
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:12.920]  hero but destroy Jesse Ventura right I think this has to do a lot with Jesse
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:17.880]  Ventura support for Ron Paul let's not forget Pearl is also one of the chief
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:24.000]  providers to Rick Santorum now let's turn the tables on Mr. Santorum I'm
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.960]  reporting basically updating an old story today Rick Santorum started the 10
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:34.760]  State College Republicans in 1977 as a freshman which is kind of odd as a
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.280]  freshman with the help of a guy named Phil English former congressman from
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:44.840]  Erie Pennsylvania now English was arrested in Erie in the 1980s for
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:49.640]  soliciting sex from an underage African-American male this was very much
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:54.880]  covered up English was the head of the Pennsylvania College Republicans
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:03:00.680]  helped Santorum start the 10 State College Republicans and in 1977 was the
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:07.000]  same year that Jerry Santusky began the second mile foundation now what oh my
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.240]  gosh are you saying he could be involved in that ring I'm saying there's a lot
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:17.040]  of there's a lot there's more than smoke there there's fire there and let me just
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:23.120]  say that I'm on this story and and remember there was a sportscaster out
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.480]  of Pittsburgh who said look the second mile foundation was used to pimp young
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.400]  boys out to the wealth healed donors to that no that's the guy that really broke
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.720]  the story that didn't care if they threatened him that's the guy that
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:39.720]  broke it that's right there's other sources I have in Pennsylvania who
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.480]  corroborated that and and here's the here's the issue with with the San
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:50.400]  Torrance and busky we know that Santorum awarded and that's easy some sort of an
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:57.160]  angel award 2002 adoption angel he was an adoption angel but then Torrance was
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:00.920]  one of three senators who could you know they can hire more staff than members
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.560]  of the house because they have a bigger budget and Torrance was one of three
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:09.480]  senators that was known to hire a lot of staffers young male staffers out of
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.800]  diversion programs and remember second mile foundation was that you know one
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:18.480]  of the things they did was divert people from jail and get them you know I
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:24.680]  spent on a better way so to speak they also use the pages congressional pages
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:29.920]  Senate pages but basically hold them in these three Senate offices until some of
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:35.280]  the perverts over on the house site make their selection you know March holy you're
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.880]  saying there he might have been a stabler hold on can you do five more
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:43.960]  minutes to start at the beginning of this and go right through it holy
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:50.840]  mackerel investigative journalist Wayne Madsen's our guest and I tell you look
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:55.520]  that the establishment wouldn't be pushing this gentleman unless they had

[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:25.040]  Everett Robert Judy Eric gazelle we're gonna get to all of you coming up here
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:30.680]  about five minutes but I was bringing up why are they going after Jesse Ventura
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:35.680]  and obviously he could do a third-party run they don't want that screwing up how
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:40.640]  they've selected this election with their ringer the bottom paid for Mitt
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.080]  Romney and their other ringer the bottom paid for either way they want to do it
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:49.280]  Barack Obama they could play the two puppets off against each other and so
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:52.040]  the clearly there they're trying to destroy Ventura with incredible
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:55.720]  defamation right now they wouldn't be doing this unless they were concerned
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.120]  and then he brought up Rick Santorum and connections to the whole Penn State
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:06.520]  Sandusky situation so start from the beginning run through it for folks that
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:11.360]  forget what goes on in Congress you've covered it for years I don't know a lot
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.720]  of estimations are what 60% of the Republican leadership you don't even
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.640]  get recruited in unless you're part of the pedophile network
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:26.880]  skull and bones Bohemian Grove are all homoerotic 110% Richard Nixon said that
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:31.600]  to two major publications just typing Richard Nixon on Bohemian Grove to get
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:34.480]  Harper's and others you can actually hear the audio I can't play it here
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.040]  because of the profanity but so so we have to give credibility what you're
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:42.400]  saying but you're investigating this now you said earlier there's not just
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.880]  smoke there's fire now now now I want you to get into that but this is
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:50.480]  obviously something dangerous first people asked you did kind of disappear
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  for about six months and you were overseas you said you were leaving the
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:56.720]  country because you've been told by a good source they might try to whack you
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:02.360]  why have you come back to the US Wayne then let's get into the Rick Santorum
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:07.680]  Sandusky connection right well the grass always looks greener on the other side
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:11.720]  of the pond and so you go over there you find out things are pretty expensive and
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:18.120]  unless you have a good support network it's hard to just relocate yeah up and
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.600]  move so we're an election year this story now I think is very important the
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.520]  National College Republicans have always been sort of a nexus for a lot of
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:37.480]  young male gays in 1973 Perry Dolan who was openly was later found out to be
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:41.520]  openly gay ran for chairman of the National College Republicans he died
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:49.600]  in 86 button 73 he was beaten for that job by none other than Carl Rose now in
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.840]  1977 still English as it goes from the University of Pennsylvania over to Penn
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:59.520]  State to help a freshman named Rick Santorum start the Penn State chapter of
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:05.840]  the college Republicans there that's the same year that Jerry Sandusky starts
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:11.480]  the second mile foundation both Sandusky and Joe Paterno big supporters of the
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:15.440]  College of Penn State Republicans as well as Republicans statewide in
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:21.640]  Pennsylvania in the 1980s so English is the Santorum's friend who by the way is
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:26.120]  supporting Romney but he's still saying that he thinks and form is a very good
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:32.160]  candidate hedging his fence no doubt so English when he was city controller of
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:39.200]  Erie was arrested for a propositioning and an underage African-American male it
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.360]  was covered up because he was the city official later and he is there were two
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:47.000]  other incidents one in Erie one in Harrisburg the one in Erie was covered up
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:55.760]  by the mayor then Luke Tulio and we have then Santorum going into the Senate
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:01.360]  being one of three senators who would get people from the page system from the
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.240]  diversion programs from the college Republicans to bring him in as staffers
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.640]  and then keep them there until they could be farmed out to house members that
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:16.320]  you know basically you know would select who they'd want to work on their own
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:20.880]  staff those three senators were Rick Santorum, Jim Fallon from Missouri and
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.480]  George Allen from Virginia and George Allen I have to say is running for his
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:30.360]  old seat this year from from the old dominion so these were the three
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:36.200]  individuals who I was I was told back in 06 were part of this whole network of
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:40.760]  recruitment and this was at the height of if you recall the house page
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:45.240]  scandal involving a number of members of Congress including of course Mark
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:52.200]  Cooke-Barton who resigned because of that scandal so we have and then we had in
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:13:02.360]  2002 as Santorum awarding Sandusky this award as one of the adoption angels it's
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:10.240]  quite clear that the Penn State Sandusky Santorum are involved with one
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:14.800]  another this whole practice as I mentioned of Santorum using his Senate
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:21.240]  office as a as a magnet and recruiting grounds for staffers to go over to
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:26.080]  similarly incline and let's be clear the sports writer and newscaster who
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.920]  originally broke all this and forced it out in the open he's been interviewed in
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.800]  Pennsylvania and said the rich donors were coming there obviously Sandusky's
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:39.720]  not raping children in the showers and broad daylight if he didn't think hey
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:44.080]  this is this is I mean and of course the police and others it turns out new
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.680]  15 years ago and did nothing so this is the tip of the maggot pile well I think
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:53.200]  here's another thing I mentioned that Santorum was a member of the board of the
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:14:02.760]  Israel project that that outfit chief spokesman and has now shown up at Penn
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:11.680]  State as the lawyer for Penn State to represent them in this whole pedophile
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.000]  scandal and that guy is Lanny Davis so Lanny Davis who worked with Rick
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.800]  Santorum at the Israel project now shows up at Penn State obviously and
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:26.480]  many people think he's you know there to cover up so there's a lot more to this
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.800]  than meet the eye covering Capitol Hill for decades I mean I get different
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:35.480]  numbers from different insiders but I mean obviously they corrupt a lot of them
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:40.120]  with the with the hookers you have under George Herbert Walker Bush the
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.640]  hundreds of nighttime visits Washington Times people just search Washington
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:50.160]  Times underage prostitute visits you'll get mainstream articles you had it under
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:55.240]  George W. Bush the male madam coming in you've got constantly them being caught
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.200]  in bathrooms everywhere you got the Bohemian Grove you got all of it and
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:04.600]  it's just like really I mean what do these guys do so why did the system go
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:08.920]  for these guys because they know they can destroy them anytime they want I mean
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:14.240]  what percentage I mean we know Barney Frank on record in the 80s you know they
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.680]  found an underage prostitution ring being run out of his townhouse and he gave a
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:22.080]  press conference it's in the film I produced they just came out last year
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.120]  Invisible Empire a new order to find and he said look if you don't stop bringing
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.520]  this up I'm gonna give names and they dropped the whole deal I mean I mean how
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:36.000]  bad is it I mean how what a dead reckoning estimation here Wayne well
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.760]  Barney Frank back back when he gave a news conference he also said that 25% of
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:47.280]  the members of the house were of the same persuasion and he said and and it as
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:52.560]  an aside he said and most of them are Republican and now where are we at today
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:58.080]  I think 25% is the low estimate even using Frank's numbers I would I would
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:05.000]  say we're up a probably around 45% maybe even half and the other thing I have to
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.880]  say is obviously Penn State being a nexus for this activity that's another
[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:15.080]  reason they hired Louis Freeh the big cover-up former director of the FBI has
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:19.080]  been hired to be in charge of Penn State's internal and they've hired the
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.920]  the merc head I mean you talk about vicious he's involved I mean it's a
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:30.560]  who's who of dastardly characters absolutely and you know the word I get
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.880]  from Penn State is you know this this is a virtual cult up here it's a very hard
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:41.560]  cult to penetrate I mean football was the veneer but when you peel back the
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:47.480]  football layer of this idea you get into a lot more sorted activities and I would
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:53.640]  suggest that one of the key actors in that whole episode from 1977 when he was
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:58.000]  working with Bill English and and people like Terry Dolan and with the
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.200]  National College Republicans is one Rick Santorum who is so viciously
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:09.120]  anti-homosexual you have to wonder what is prompting him to do that because the
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:13.760]  word I'm also getting from the gay community here in Washington is what
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:18.320]  we know all about Rick Santorum little Ricky you know his communication
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:22.360]  director when he was in the Senate openly gay African-American man Robert
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:27.480]  Traynham who still supports Santorum today and then we've got the whole
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:36.360]  history of TB the I won't say the name on air old Rove a true demon of hell it's
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:44.400]  just it's unbelievable I mean it is so and and okay well just imagining all
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:49.560]  those people's it's marriage hey why do you think the NDAA legalized the
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:54.520]  military keeping goats and pigs on the base with them and bestiality well that
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:58.400]  was kind of odd I mean when I served in the Navy I can't say that was ever an
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:03.480]  issue we had all kinds of other issues with activity but I I just don't recall
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:11.440]  anybody being involved in the barnyard sex and in the Navy but yeah I was
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:17.600]  surprised to hear that but maybe there's the reason for that as well we do know
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:21.280]  that sometimes there's congressional delegations that visit some of these
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:26.240]  military bases overseas for example maybe it was to protect the animals from
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.960]  members of Congress and their senior staff members well I mean it's in there
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:37.560]  they passed it I mean yeah I was surprised to see it I mean that was that
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.280]  was an issue that I like I say I had never realized that was an issue I'm
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.200]  sure there were cases of that in the military but nothing that would have
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.040]  written for the point where you know Naval investigative service or or some
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.720]  other investigative arm of the military would have had to you know conduct an
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:01.560]  investigation or court martial somebody for it this country this country is
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:04.560]  really becoming a joke and we're gonna break them back with calls I promise
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:08.600]  folks but the minute we've got left in the AA Obama signing it brief take on
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:14.400]  that one well I think again it was another bait to switch operation we
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:19.320]  now see Joe Lieberman starting to talk about deportation of people that
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.440]  convicted of terrorism look we already had that poor girl down in Houston
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.040]  deported a U.S. citizen supported the Columbia are we gonna see more cases of
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.720]  that you know I mean where would they if you're if you're a natural born citizen
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:35.640]  where are they gonna deport you to back to wherever your your forefathers
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:41.520]  they'll probably deport you to a black site because they strip you of the

[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:34.320]  appointments they've not been in recess they've never even tried to bring them
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:39.160]  before the Congress it is unprecedented power grab just like launching
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:42.520]  wars without congressional approval so I want to play a compilation of these
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:47.800]  clips coming up of Obama trying to sell the public on the idea should I do
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:51.720]  things without Congress they're like yeah get rid of them we want a dictator
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:58.640]  super creepy ever in Tennessee you're on the air welcome thanks for holding yes
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:03.600]  thank you I just want to say real quick that we listen to you on WBCR here a
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:11.040]  local radio station 1470 a.m. 1470 are just awesome folks yes sir and he's a
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.880]  great friend of mine and I just want to say ain't Obama on the security of the
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:21.480]  head of the Security Council he said there and don't our Constitution prohibit
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:27.440]  that and why is that it's tying in to him just going on you know so might
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:33.000]  possibly start a big ward to finish this new word order that they want to have
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  and as soon as I would think that the we're seeing the mark of the beast when
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.480]  this stuff starts to happen do you believe it yes but but but they'll call
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:47.240]  it they'll call it the mark of anti-alkaida the mark of anti-terror
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:53.520]  the mark of trusted traveler I appreciate your call great questions yes
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:26:01.040]  there's a rotating membership with the members of the Security Council and you
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.880]  again normally have one of your ambassadors sit on it but this was the
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.880]  president sitting on it violating article 1 section 9 it's unprecedented but
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:17.320]  so is all of this just out of control corruption Judy in Florida you're on the
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:24.640]  air welcome hi Alex thanks for taking my call it's it's a ironic that you're
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.120]  talking about what you are right now there's two things that I was thinking
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:34.400]  about I feel like my life has changed personally with the enactment of the
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:40.840]  NDAA I mean because I'm a vocal person even though I'm a nobody I you know send
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.960]  out emails to people oh yeah no they want to set up a system where you
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:48.440]  disappear into the night but they're doing that so you get scared and won't
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:52.320]  speak out we have to totally speak out against what they're doing and they're
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:56.000]  not going to get away with it that's why they that's why they tried to pass it
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.320]  and claim it didn't affect citizens and then say well don't worry we won't use
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:05.120]  it against you so something don't let it it should concern you like with a
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:08.920]  heightened awareness that wow these really are criminals yes it is a wake-up
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:14.240]  call and I've been going to continue all that I'm doing I know that my friends
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:18.720]  are and they're all you know essentially wrong call supporters or
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:23.280]  they're just supportive of freedom and the other thing that I wanted to ask I
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.000]  mean it to me it seems very logical although I don't know how to go about it
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.240]  I I know the avenues that I've tried to go through in order to you know talk to
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:40.280]  key individuals to get it pushed but why can't Obama get impeached like as soon
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:43.960]  as possible because of everything that he's done okay
[02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:50.640]  treason in this country because because as Ron Paul's top advisor Bruce Fine has
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:55.120]  pointed out most of them Democrat and Republican are voting for everything
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:59.280]  Obama's doing I mean people that call themselves conservative well then you
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:05.320]  should love Obama because Mitt Romney is exactly the same person another
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:10.560]  teleprompter reading Kendall you know who's well-kept and manicured but as a
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:15.800]  global astooge and there was some talk on the House floor last week about
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:19.920]  impeaching him over these recess appointments because there's not even a
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:22.560]  recess that's supposed to go on for close to a year before you can even
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.440]  discuss it it's an emergency recess appointment for now he's trying to
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:31.520]  permanently appoint people without even getting congressional approval for them
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:37.760]  and violating federal law but I mean he violated the law bombing Libya he
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:42.560]  violated the law shutting down power plants he violates the law I mean no
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:49.880]  one has ever done as much as Obama he is the most corrupt but as I've said it
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:54.080]  just gonna get worse from here on out if they're a globalist puppet because the
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:59.240]  new world order is in overdrive I mean I mean it's not slow creeping world
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:04.280]  government anymore it's out in your face out in the open hey we want to censor
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:08.680]  free speech hey we want to arrest you hey we're training your neighbors to spy
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:12.760]  on you hey we're training your kids in public school to spy on you hey we're
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:16.880]  gonna forcibly inoculate you hey we're gonna jack up your taxes and your power
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.240]  bills and rob you I mean it is a criminal feeding frenzy you ever watch
[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:25.680]  underwater footage of sharks getting a feeding frenzy and start biting each
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:30.840]  other I mean it's just a frothing no one's up there blocking criminality so
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.920]  it's not even organized criminal operation anymore I mean they've got the
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:39.440]  basic new order system there but it's just just a grabbing and snatching and
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:45.280]  foaming and fighting and scrabbling around like a bunch of piranha rats on
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:51.840]  PCP you have rabies from the planet Google snapper we're on the march the
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:30:01.960]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:05.680]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:09.480]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:14.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric

[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:22.880]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:26.840]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:31.000]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.960]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:39.080]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:11.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:15.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned menace
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:20.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:25.560]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:30.480]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:34.880]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:38.600]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:42.560]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:48.200]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:54.240]  Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:33:10.120]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV leading up
[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:16.640]  frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:36.440]  radio network
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:41.080]  you know what a call like the last one I had from that nice lady we're going to
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:50.480]  Gazelle Eric and others here in just a moment upsets me because that's what
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:55.000]  these tyrants count on when they started meeting yeah we're listening to your
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.440]  phones without warrants yeah we're training your kids to spy on you yeah
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.200]  we got face scanning cameras up yeah we're training your neighbors to report
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:10.000]  your guns it's meant to scare all of us into hiding and that's why I had even
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:15.440]  been conditioned five six seven years ago when open carry groups in Arizona
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:24.400]  Vermont and Texas would show up at town squares they'd show up at public events
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:30.280]  with their firearms on their sides I understood it was their right but I
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:33.880]  thought well that's provocative oh my gosh they're getting arrested but they
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:38.080]  were going to court and winning it was their right they are the equivalent in
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:45.840]  the 2000s as Rosa Parks in the late 1950s and people like her saying I'm not
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:49.520]  you know what I'm tired I'm not gonna go there's a front seat right here I'm
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:54.600]  sitting here it's open I'm not going to the back of the bus and now police all
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:58.680]  over the country in just four or five years when they see you with your shot
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:04.200]  gun your rifle your m16 your handgun they're not swarming you or arresting
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:08.840]  you or freaking out on you because they want to act like our freedom is like
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:14.480]  drugs illegal drugs or going to the porno shop and buy a playboy magazine or
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:18.240]  whatever and sticking it in a bag and you know how are like you'll liquor in a
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:24.200]  brown paper bag like something evil because you watch all these drama shows
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:30.000]  all these sitcoms and cop shows all of them they're all set in New York Chicago
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.520]  or other total gunman places and it's always oh in your apartment your
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:39.520]  neighbor saw a gun you're going to jail that's 20 years pal to where I go back
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:45.880]  to this because this happened and it was the big local cleaner place and I even
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:49.320]  ended up having it was a two-man team one guy got mad and quit that day I
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.320]  ended up calling into my access TV show as I keep saying 12 years it was like
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:58.080]  1415 I'm over there at my house back then I broadcast out of my house has
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:08.600]  studio in it and there's a shotgun just a Winchester defender like a $250 pump
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:13.600]  shotgun because I want low tech if I'm asleep or there's a problem you know I
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:19.280]  mean I want an easy to control gun shotgun or something like that and I
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:23.040]  hear like how like an argument going on back there it's about three o'clock in
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:26.440]  the afternoon they got there after the radio show and I'm in there making a
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:29.960]  sandwich you know talking to my girlfriend we weren't married yet and I
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:33.160]  here kind of no no that's okay it's okay no no no you don't do that no he you
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:37.680]  know you're allowed to have that in Texas and it turned out the white guy was
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:44.080]  from some big eastern city I forget which one there was Hispanic Texan but
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.080]  he was the assistant you know the guy that carries it around behind him because
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:50.200]  I actually work for Carbaclear Place and was the assistant one summer but the
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:54.880]  point is I go what's the problem the guy's like I'm not working here there's
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:58.400]  a shotgun up there and I said you never seen a gun case he goes well that's not
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:02.920]  in the case I go yeah it's just a you know it's a it's a gun rack it's right
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.040]  there it's it's fine he goes is it loaded and I said well yeah actually it is I
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:11.920]  don't have any kids around here and the guys starts leaving when I go hey here's
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:16.920]  the newspaper two days ago I let a gun rally here's my picture see guns aren't
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:22.480]  illegal I I caught bribery because that had just happened like a week before so
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:25.640]  I was showing him the Austin American States but see I'm on the paper you know
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:29.400]  the cover of Metro and state and the guys like no I'm I'm getting out of here
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:33.360]  and I was like whoa so then I got a bad feeling about two hours later and I call
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:38.240]  the place and they go yes mr. Jones we all know who you are no the police were
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:41.800]  not called though they almost were and you know I kind of got lectured and I was
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:51.480]  like wow that happened again I can't have a shotgun in my house in America and
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:56.520]  they count on intimidating us out of our rights and out of our liberties and out
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:02.120]  of our basic freedoms and I'm sick of it so I salute all of you that open carry
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:07.680]  and and and put up with being arrested beat up you name it but in hundreds of
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:14.320]  cases of one saying I have a right to carry my firearms in almost every state
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:20.600]  in the union that's how you push back you exercise a right they pass some fake
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:24.120]  environmental law that you can't fix your barn or build a barn just do it how
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:27.560]  about everybody does it and nobody pays the fines I mean it's getting to the
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:31.840]  point now the government's so lawless and criminal that it's time to stop
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.600]  complying you don't have to fight every battle but just if you work for the
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:38.960]  system I understand pretty much that's all that's left now for a lot of you out
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:44.320]  there just don't go along with everything don't be so so thug like don't be so
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:51.000]  happy to nail people to the wall don't be so into tyranny and for people out
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.720]  there that are intimidated this is meant to intimidate you and Lindsey Graham
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:59.400]  gets up there and hops around and says I want you to have no lawyer it is for
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:05.040]  citizens I want you to be scared they want to intimidate you so you shut up
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:10.160]  and then they win here's an analogy you're walking through say you're 12
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:13.680]  years old your mom dropped shop at the mall you're walking up you're back out
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:18.360]  to meter or whatever and a man runs up and grabs you by the arm do you bite
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:22.840]  him do you kick him do you yell do you scream or do you cuz he says just get
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:26.400]  in the car and you'll be okay you're not gonna be okay getting in the car the
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:30.240]  new lords goddess by the arm of course we're about a 10,000 pound gorilla
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:34.240]  they're a little wart covered chicken necked you know book toothed little
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:39.000]  vampire we're like an 8,000 pound gorilla which is giant steel muscles power
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.520]  the light of God shining in our eyes like thunderbolts and this little vampire
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.320]  comes over and grabs by the arm we just roll over on our belly and just shake
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:49.680]  and fear and it's got a little little little black uniform on the vampire
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:53.840]  strutting around telling us how tough it is and it grabs us by the arm and we
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.720]  just start urinating on ourselves like a dog roll over on our back groveling and
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:02.120]  fear it's a total game
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:07.440]  together collectively we're an 8,000 pound gorilla with with with muscles of
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:18.240]  of of pure steel now individually individually I'm kind of like a squirrel
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.680]  to the little five-foot buck toothed vampire and it might be able to catch
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:27.920]  me and grab me and stick its little rotten fangs in me and kill me okay but
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:31.840]  let me tell you us collectively I mean they're scared to death of us we're
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:37.840]  fire-breathing 8,000 pound gorilla that shoots laser beams out of its eyes and
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:42.600]  you've got a slug-like vampire that that has to gnaw on you for about an hour
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:49.160]  just to get blood I mean it's that pathetic and I'm not scared of it I
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:55.000]  fear God and that's it okay and that's what we have to start seeing them as
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.120]  don't let it intimidate you all these checkpoints and TSA hands down the pants
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:06.000]  it's all meant to break our will so if you have to travel have to go through it
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.240]  rebuke it speak out against it stand up against it sue them whatever just just
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:16.040]  let them know I know what you're doing vampire and you don't get the pleasure of
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:21.280]  my fear because they drink fear they do they drink fear I want to go to these
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.800]  clips the first one is a compilation that we showed last Friday on the
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:30.560]  nightly news but this is Obama and there's hundreds of these in speeches
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:34.840]  saying Congress is the problem should I act without Congress boy be a lot easier
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:38.520]  if I didn't have Congress I could just do whatever I want getting the crowds to
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:42.680]  cheer he's like a parrot testing its perch you know a parrot will test to see
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:47.520]  if a branch is safe he's testing can I and the systems testing he's being told
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:52.400]  test the perch see if they'll bend over for enslavement see if they'll let us
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:57.400]  put handcuffs on them that's what they're doing the TSA is all for their
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.680]  pedophile training of children all of it they're just a pack of ruthless buck
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:07.240]  toothed cross-eyed wart-covered chicken-neck vampires that can't even
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:15.840]  hardly walk spiritually I mean they're a joke they are bug-eyed blind zombies I
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:21.000]  don't understand the fear of them and they and a whole pack of may grab me a
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:27.920]  little squirrel and eat me I don't even care as as long as I expose them all now
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:31.360]  we're gonna continue with other rodent analogies let's go ahead and go to this
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:38.480]  clip of Obama openly here trying to sell you dictatorship I can fix
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:42.760]  everything just let me do whatever I want we've heard that before in history
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:47.960]  here it is the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this Commission it's
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:52.560]  all-issue and executive order that will allow us to go forward because I refuse
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:57.400]  to pass this problem on to another generation of a man
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:05.800]  I know some here wish that I could just lie past Congress and change the law
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:21.400]  myself I know there's some folks who wish I could just bypass Congress super
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:29.640]  creeping I can't I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:39.960]  laws on my own believe me and sharing for tyranny yes yes we're idiots you
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:50.320]  really think you're good remember the very same bankers Bush was and and
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:44:01.480]  believe me right now dealing with Congress the idea yes we can't get rid
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:08.840]  of Congress take your guns in a minute believe me the idea of doing things on
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:20.720]  my own is very simple and then we've got him being sworn in saying he protect
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:25.760]  and defend the Constitution yeah one of the people he's putting forward with
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:29.360]  these recess appointments without ever trying to actually get him through
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:33.400]  Congress I was named chief operating officer of city groups alternative
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:39.280]  investments unit he's a member of the council on foreign relations and it just
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:45.760]  goes over all of that yeah replacing another mob boss daily I mean literal
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:45:00.120]  mafia so this is the type of garbage that we deal with oh man it makes my
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:04.520]  head spin yeah William Daley is resigning his White House Chief of Staff
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:08.640]  and the budget chief Jack Lou will take his place and no need to get him
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:13.000]  appointed who needs Congress you can launch a war without him whatever you
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:18.160]  want here's another clip from real clear politics of Obama being creepy here it
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:25.400]  is these are ideas that I support from Democrats they have support from
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:28.160]  Republicans around the country independence around the country I want
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:39.080]  to work with Congress to get them done but when Congress refuses to act and as
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.680]  a result hurts our economy and puts our people at risk then I have an
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:49.320]  obligation as president to do what I can without them
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:58.400]  see this is more recent it's just a few weeks ago or like a week ago this is
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:02.320]  what's happening see first the last three years is it be great did I have
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:07.920]  Congress but unfortunately I got a follow-up and then a few months later
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:11.600]  maybe it would be good if they weren't there maybe I will do what I want now
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:16.040]  years later yep I'm doing what I can launch at war shutting down power
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:21.840]  plants and they're just like yay destroy the country faster this new Lou
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:26.920]  guys involved in all these energy companies and payoffs and I mean it's
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:34.880]  just mind-blowing let's go back to the rest of the club I've got an obligation
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:39.560]  to act on behalf of the American people the foreign bankers stand by while a
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:44.120]  minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people that we
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:49.720]  were elected to serve not at this make-or-break moment for middle-class
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:53.000]  Americans we're not gonna let that happen no he's gonna help you oh he
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.160]  cares so much about you that's enough thank you he goes on and on yeah this is
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:01.760]  the guy when Congress wouldn't give approval for the Libya situation he
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:05.600]  just said well I get my authority from the UN I mean there's no reason even
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:09.960]  to have a Congress and I'm not saying they're gonna save us either they're a
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:14.200]  bunch of crooks that need to be impeached and again it's out of this extreme
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:18.960]  criminality this extreme arrogance towards the rule of law constitution
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:23.720]  checks and balances our protections common sense what makes America America
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:28.680]  that they sit there it's like a bunch of body snatchers you're pointing at Ron
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:33.600]  Paul like he's the guy that's the weirdo when really I mean if you study the
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:38.160]  Constitution Bill of Rights Ron Paul is just following the Constitution but it's
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:45.680]  so alien today because we've gone so far down this rat hole
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:49.680]  gazelle in Texas thanks for holding them we're gonna get to Eric and others go
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:56.520]  ahead gazelle is this a cobra commander cobra currency will replace your dollar
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:01.680]  I agree with the World Bank and I love what's happening with the checkpoints
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:08.720]  cobra grease oh wonderful wonderful I wanted to know Alex I wanted to know if
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:15.240]  you had heard about a series on Showtime called Homeland yes I know they got a
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:18.920]  bunch of different made for TV shows but also reality shows were Homeland
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:22.400]  Security teaches us how great it is to have checkpoints everywhere it's all
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:29.680]  part of the dog training yes actually the the premise of this show follows a CIA
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:36.080]  officer who is the hero in the show and two POWs which are the black hats in the
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:41.240]  show and they come back from the Middle East and they return after being MIA for
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:50.560]  several years only to be covert alkydus sleeper cells within the US and what I
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:55.840]  think is most notable about the series is that it was revealed on NBC nightly
[02:48:55.840 --> 02:49:02.200]  news and other sources that Obama is a fan of the show and that he watches it
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:09.320]  no they always they had a Homeland Security celebration for 24 before it
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:13.680]  got you know canceled worshiping it because it taught everyone to like
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:19.640]  torture I mean it's just so sick but I know they also have a real Homeland
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:23.120]  Security show that follows Homeland Security around while they do all of
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:27.160]  their miscreant behavior you know it's come out that Obama lets the illegal
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:30.760]  aliens even felons go we already knew this sheriffs has had us for a year but
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:36.120]  but but now it's confirmed that they have hotlines for the illegals when
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:40.080]  they're in a jail for even committing a regular crime and the Fed comes and gets
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:44.840]  them out I mean I ought to change my name to some illegal alien name and just
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:48.500]  prance around and be above the law and pay no taxes and be worshiped a supreme
[02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:54.360]  leader indeed I guess what's so disappointing about this is that this
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:50:00.960]  is basically the myac report depicted to a T with returning veterans depicted
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:05.200]  as as threats and well yeah and again they're not depicting them as somebody
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:10.240]  who's gonna get mad and and kill themselves or their other wife they're
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.960]  they're depicting them as Al Qaeda and that's what they say in these manuals
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:18.680]  they actually teach it we've published them that the police have sent us and it's
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:22.600]  just a joke I mean obviously the terrorists run the government and the
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:25.920]  terrorists are trying to use Homeland Security against the American people
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:30.240]  it's never been about Al Qaeda I mean Al Qaeda works for the criminals that run
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.280]  our country publicly you know I've got to get some snippets of it I'm sure it's
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:41.640]  online and do an article about it thanks for the heads up Eric in Colorado and

[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:49.240]  good to talk to you Alex say how about that Tim Tebow yeah that's all I'm
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:53.600]  worried about is that a football is great and they're setting up federal
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:56.560]  checkpoints where they grab your genitals but hey that's what freedom is
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:55:00.760]  about and they're openly pushing force inoculation and DNA databases when you
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.440]  get pulled over and but the border is wide open and the government publicly
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:10.360]  ships drugs in and guns out so we're everything's great yep just wondering
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:15.080]  your thoughts on the man I mean it was a great game last night don't know if you
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:20.480]  caught it or not but I know but I see I see it just here and there and read about
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:26.960]  it and I'm glad that he's a Christian no he's been criticized for that but yeah
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:31.000]  I wonder if he's the type of Christian that thinks new king anyone who isn't a
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:36.840]  Christian is Christian if he's that type of Christian I don't like him what type
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:42.240]  of Christian is he not sure not sure I think Southern Baptist I know he was
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:50.040]  homeschooled I was very interesting oh I wonder I wonder I wonder what he thinks
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:53.200]  of the fact the government wants to secretly arrest citizens and have us
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  disappear into black holes I wonder I wonder if if that's important or just
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.240]  praying to God that he went football games because see I'd pray to God that
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:07.280]  they not release a deadly bio weapon that they've been producing there I would
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:10.400]  pray to God that we don't have World War three I would pray to God that the
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:13.920]  honeybee stop dying in mass you know what I mean I appreciate your call I would
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:17.560]  pray to God that they stop putting floor on the water I would pray to God that we
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:21.680]  didn't have the highest cancer rate in the world and Alzheimer's exploding and
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:29.440]  just plagues upon us while we worship television and mindlessness you see let's
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:38.000]  go ahead and talk to Robert in California Robert welcome yeah good sir yeah I
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:43.280]  came up with an interesting idea and I went down to I live in the Bay Area and
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:47.680]  I went down to United Nations Plaza like the week before Christmas and I polled
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:55.040]  250 you know 232 people about whether they prefer world government to actual
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:59.120]  sovereignty so I thought you find that interesting and what did they say well I
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:04.480]  got 21% for world government and that's even in San Francisco where your brain
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:08.240]  washed with it yeah that's where the our government started to you in there as
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:12.080]  you know exactly so I gave him home field advantage I did it in the most
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:16.880]  liberal city in the world and I also I used the leading question I said would
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:22.200]  you prefer world government or national sovereignty but see the globalists say
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:27.240]  they know best so what you want doesn't matter because it's liberal and trendy
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:33.320]  but what I also asked them their age I kept track of their race and I did a
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.080]  little bit and analysis of the demographic and you find this really
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:40.560]  interesting as it went if you look at who is for world government you could
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:47.320]  probably guess I would imagine that kind of academic establishment government
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:55.080]  worker types no yeah we virtually every every Latino I asked or Hispanic was for
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:58:00.360]  it because there's no border virtually every homeless person I asked was for it
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:04.080]  you know I had people tell me what government I'd see him picking out of
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:08.240]  garbage can an hour later or one guy said world government and then threatened
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:13.360]  to beat me up if I didn't give him a dollar to you know well the world
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:17.680]  government wants to kill everybody majority of the population wow you want
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:21.920]  to videotape that and show a composite and put it on YouTube it'd be a big hit
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:27.080]  you know I'm just a regular guy I need all of you I mean to be doing the same
